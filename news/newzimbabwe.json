            "content": "BBC\n\nScientists believe they have found a new effective antibiotic for gonorrhoea, which could be one of the most promising in decades.\n\nGepotidacin can treat and clear the sexually transmitted infection just as well as existing antibiotics and appears to be able to tackle some emerging drug-resistant superbug strains too, say researchers inThe Lancet journal.\n\nThe work was funded by pharmaceutical company GSK which makes the new tablets.\n\nGonorrhoea is one of the most common STIs and cases have been rising.\n\nIn 2023, over 85,000 gonorrhoea diagnoses were reported in England alone  the highest number since records began in 1918.\n\nMost of the cases were treatable, but there isgrowing concernthat some strains cant be dealt with so easily.\n\nOver time, the bacterium has developed resistance to most classes of available antibiotics and experts fear it may become untreatable in the future, unless new drugs are found.\n\nUntreated gonorrhoea can lead to serious health issues, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility.\n\nGepotidacin works differently to other antibiotics and stops gonorrhoea from replicating by blocking two essential enzymes.\n\nIts already approved in the US for treating urinary tract infections.\n\nThe trial, being presented at the ESCMID conference, involved 628 patients randomly allocated to receive gepotidacin or an existing antibiotic.\n\nThe new pill was equally effective for treating gonorrhoea and worked against strains of the infection that were resistant to current first-line treatments, such as ceftriaxone.\n\nSide-effects were reported more frequently with gepotidacin, but they were generally mild, such as nausea or some stomach discomfort.\n\nGepotidacine is not the only new oral antibiotic for gonorrhoea that researchers are exploring.\n\nAnother, called zoliflodacin, has also shownpromise in phase 3 clinical trials.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK is consideringa vaccineto help stop the spread of gonorrhoea.\n\nIn November 2023, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended a targeted roll-out of the MenB vaccine.\n\nPrimarily designed to tackle Meningitis B in children, the JCVI found the treatment was roughly 40% effective at preventing people from contracting and spreading gonorrhoea.\n\nDr Katy Sinka, consultant epidemiologist and head of the STI section at UK Health Security Agency, said it was really promising to see a successful trial for a new antibiotic to treat gonorrhoea.\n\nAs gonorrhoea becomes increasingly resistant to antibiotics, it could become untreatable in future and cause serious problems like pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Trials like this are so important to help us discover new treatment options.\n\nShe said the best way to prevent an STI is by using a condom. If someone has had condom-less sex with a new or casual partner, they should get tested.\n\nEarly detection not only protects a persons health but prevents transmission to others. Testing is quick, free and confidential, she said.\n\nSource: NHS\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP), a human rights watchdog, reports that over 1,000 people experienced violations of their rights to freedom of assembly and association following the March 31stprotests against President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nThe protests were triggered by Blessed Geza, a former Zanu-PF Central Committee member and war veteran. Geza, now on the run, has been using his X page and YouTube channelto mobilise Zimbabweans to protest against Mnangagwa.\n\nGeza accuses Mnangagwa of a litany of issues: corruption, nepotism, tribalism and is demanding his immediate resignation. The war veteran is opposed to the extension of Mnangagwas term beyond 2028, when his constitutionally mandated two five-year terms will expire.\n\nAs a direct consequence of Gezas call to action, over a hundredpeople participated in the March 31st protest. Police responded with force at Freedom Square in Harare. Despite the initial attempts to disperse them, the protesters regrouped repeatedly.\n\nAt one point, protesters barricaded the junction of Rotten Row and Robert Mugabe Roads in the capital, rendering it impassable to motorists. Police responded firing tear gas, ultimately arresting 98 protesters. They are currently detained at Harare Remand Prison after their bail applications were denied.\n\nIn its first-quarter report of 2025, the ZPP raised significant concerns about the number of individuals who suffered human rights violations by the State, before, during, and after the 31st March protests, documenting 14 severe assaultcases and 98 arrests.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Peace Project recorded 24 violations restricting freedom of assembly and association (affecting 740 people, 270 men and 470 women), 15 violations against freedom of expression (affecting 146 people, 72 men and 74 women), and 14 assaults (affecting 68 citizens, 38 men and 30 women), most of which were directly linked to attempts to suppress the protests, reads the report.\n\nThe ZPP argues that these targeted violations reflect a deliberate state-led strategy to violate constitutionally guaranteed rights, especially the rights to demonstrate, express opinions freely, and participate in peaceful political activities.\n\nIn anticipation of the protests, security forces were deployed to pre-emptively intimidate citizens, arrest activists, and surveil communities, while online spaces were policed to silence dissent. The arrest of 98 Zimbabweans in Harare alone, solely for participating in the March 31st protests, exemplifies the criminalisation of protest, the report continues.\n\nThe ZPP further warns that the use of the justice system as a tool of intimidation exerts immense psychological and financial pressure on detainees and their families, and serves as a chilling warning to the broader public, discouraging civic engagement.\n\nThese actions point to an entrenched culture of weaponisation of the judiciary and criminal law to punish human rights defenders. The impact on human rights is a severe dismantling of freedom of expression, eroding public trust in institutions, and deterring peaceful participation in democratic processes.\n\nWithout immediate accountability and structural reforms, Zimbabwe risks institutionalizing a state of fear where dissent is punished, justice is deferred, and democratic freedoms are rendered meaningless, reads part of the report.\n\n",

In November 2022, six police officers in Limpopo were arrested for accepting bribes to create a safe passage for smugglers to enter the country illegally, while in possession of illicit cigarettes.\n\nThe 2019 report conducted by the Transnational Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade (TRACIT) found that although the country has made considerable strides in economic and social development since the mid-1990s, it still faces a number of challenges, including a significant threat from illicit trade.\n\nFrom smuggling, counterfeiting and tax evasion, to illegal mining and the trafficking of humans and wildlife, illicit trade holds back South Africas economic and social progress. Every year, rampant illicit trade robs Africa and South Africa in particular of massive amounts of capital critical to ensuring economic development and improving living conditions for citizens. The report also cited that some of the problems can be attributed to the many, long and porous borders with multiple country entry points.\n\nIn 2023, TRACIT reported that the South African Revenue Service (Sars) estimated that illicit trade cost the countrys economy R100 billion every year.\n\nThe organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa), which is part of the newly formed Border Management and Immigration Anti-Corruption Forum (BMIACF), welcomed the use of drone technology and body-worn cameras, saying not enough has been done to curb the porous borders and import and export challenges, which have placed enormous pressure on the countrys limited resources as well as lost taxes and excise duties from illicit trade and product importation.\n\nWe believe that if these initiatives are successful, more funds should be allocated to protect South Africa from these losses and challenges incurred accordingly, said CEO Wayne Duvenage.\n\nAccording to the department, the drones are equipped with advanced night vision cameras, including thermal detection technology.\n\nThey can travel at speeds up to 43 kilometres per hour and are capable of operating in remote rural areas, without GPS and even underground.\n\nThe drones launch within 15 seconds, are durable and waterproof, and capable of operating under all weather conditions, says the department.\n\nSchreiber said the BMA is undertaking world-class training to equip eight officers to become expert drone pilots. He said the officers would operate the devices on a shift-basis, and would move around different ports in the country.\n\nAdditionally, following a successful operational partnership over the festive season, the BMA will again partner with the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform, which will avail five more drones to the BMA during the Easter period, Schreiber said.\n\nBetween July 2024 and April 2025, the department dismissed 33 officials for various offences, including fraud, corruption and sexual misconduct.\n\nThis followed a series of internal investigations and forms part of a broader effort to restore integrity within the institution.\n\nThe department said 19 officials are facing prosecution while eight have already been convicted and sentenced to prison terms ranging from four to 18 years.\n\nSchreiber added that the body-worn cameras would be fitted to officials working in the port environment to detect and punish acts of corruption, while also monitoring the efficiency of officials.\n\n",
