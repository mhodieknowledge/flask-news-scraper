            "content": "By Privilege Musvanhiri, DW\n\nLawmakers from the ruling ZANU-PF party inZimbabweare moving a motion to further criminalize government critics.Theyre advocating for acomprehensive strategy to promote patriotism and national identity. Proposedmeasures includeformalizing a national ideology, establishing a national institute of ideology andintegrating patrioticeducation into the curriculum.\n\nThe motion comes on top ofthe contested Patriotic Act of 2023, which was seen toeffectively closed the door on dissent In Zimbabwe. It makes provision forcriticism issues such as provision of health care, basic services and accountability to be judged criminal.\n\nThe government dismissed criticism, saying the legislation was necessary to hold accountable individuals who threaten national interests. It said the legislation was modeled on the Logan Act in the US, which bars citizens from engaging in certain unauthorized communications with foreign governments. In Zimbabwe, violations could result in life imprisonment and death, termination of citizenship, suspension from voting or holding public office.\n\nIn a recent parliamentary debate, ZANU-PF MP Ophious Murambiwa suggested that it should be criminal to speak evilabout Zimbabwe.\n\nThe most important issue is to love our country, let us praise our country in all circumstances, whether in good or bad times, during the night or day, Murambiwa said.\n\nThe motion has prompted opposition lawmakers and human rights groups to pushback harder.\n\nPatriotism is not blind loyalty. It is not empty slogans. True patriots question injustice, challenge corruption and demand systems that serve people not a selected few, Prosper Mutseyami, an opposition MP, said.\n\nOur patriotism must ignite participation, ensuring that every Zimbabwean plays an active role in shaping the future.\n\nHuman rights activists say its another attempt to silence dissent.\n\nYou cannot necessarily legislate patriotism, Nigel Nyamutumbu, the Media Alliance of Zimbabwe programs manager, told DW. It is a concept that can naturally clamp down on the requisite freedoms. Patriotism is not a legal concept but rather a political nationalist ideology.\n\nActivists have in the past been accused of treason and unpatriotic behavior for expressing concerns over human rights abuses, corruption, and governance in Zimbabwe.\n\nCitizens have expressed concern overwhat they fear are attempts to enforce a one-party state. ZANU-PF, with its absolute majority in parliament, is seen to be abusing its authority and violating the constitution.\n\nAs parliamentarians we are supposed to uphold the constitution, Gladys Hlatshwayo an opposition MP told DW. Section 119 of the constitution demands that parliament protects the constitution and democratic governance.\n\nIn June 2025, Zimbabwes High Court struck down sections of the Patriotic Act.The court ruled that the drastic penalties prescribed by the Patriotic Act infringed on various sections of the countrys constitution.\n\nSeveral civic organizations and a private citizens had petitioned the court, arguing thatthe legislation was overly broad and vague and had high potential for abuse and misuse.\n\nThe most patriotic people are those who hold their government to account. A government must not be seen as the most dangerous institution, Eric Chisora, a political analyst, told DW. Whatever they [ZANU-PF lawmakers] are doing is unreasonable and irrational. Citizens rights must be protected.\n\nPolitical and civic rights activistsare calling for the repeal of colonial legacy laws which they say are retrogressive. Laws such as the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, with provisions have been used to incriminate government critics, date back toZimbabwes pre-independence erawhen they were used to suppress Black majority rule.\n\nThe activists are concerned over the shrinking of democratic space under Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwes president since 2018.\n\nWe are now living in a country where there is no freedom of expression due to the number of pieces of legislation being passed by the ZANU-PF regime, Blessing Vava, executive director of the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, told DW.\n\nWhen you see a government passing repressive laws, just know that it is not a popular government. Zimbabweans must fight to defend the constitution.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nIn a landmark event set for Saturday, August 2, the Grand Arena at GrandWest in Cape Town will resonate with the harmonious sounds of marimbas as over 1 000 players from South Africa and Zimbabwe gather to attempt a Guinness World Records title for the largest marimba ensemble in history.\n\nUnder the theme United in Harmony, this showcase aims not merely to break the current record set by Guatemala at 505 players, but to more than double it, placing South Africa firmly on the global stage for a celebration of cultural pride and musical talent.The visionary behind the initiative is Kiara Ramklass, the founder of Marimba Jam, an organisation dedicated to introducing youth to the joys of marimba music across South Africa.\n\nRamklass, who first discovered her passion for the marimba 18 years ago, expressed her excitement about the event: South African marimbas are tuned in C major  its almost impossible to feel sad when you hear them. They create this magical, happy energy. Thats what were sharing with the world on August 2.\n\nThe ensemble will feature marimba players aged 8 to 62, drawn from over 70 schools and institutions, representing every province in South Africa, alongside two schools from Zimbabwe. Participants are embarking on significant journeys; one team from KwaZulu-Natal is flying in right after their matric dance, while others are transporting their instruments across provincial lines from Durban and Johannesburg.\n\nIn this record-breaking moment, every marimba counts.\n\nThis is not Marimba Jams first attempt at making history. In 2018, the organisation gathered 241 girls on Womens Day to unofficially break Australias record, yet lacked the resources for official certification. Now, with an international adjudicator flying in from London, their aspiration to etch a new title into the record books is firmly in the spotlight.\n\nThis event is more than just breaking a record, Ramklass said. Its about showing whats possible when we come together across socio-economic divides  private schools, township schools, rural schools  all on one stage. Its a loud, joyful message of ubuntu, the African philosophy that promotes community and shared humanity.Participants will perform a vibrant ten-minute medley of celebrated songs Waka Waka and Jerusalema, both of which serve as powerful anthems of South African pride and unity.\n\nAs the grand event unfolds, a celebratory concert featuring local stars will conclude the day, further cementing the spirit of togetherness.\n\nAttendees can look forward to a plethora of activities beyond the record attempt, including performances by Goodluck, live art installations, interactive marimba demonstrations, djembe drumming workshops, photo booths, and virtual reality experiences. Each participant will also receive an official Guinness World Records medallion in a medal ceremony, celebrating their contribution to this historic event.\n\n",
