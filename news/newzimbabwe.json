Kwekweza has risked a lot for this: she has been arrested several times and has reported torture and intimidation attempts. Every achievement has its price, says Kwekweza.At the end of the day, we have to choose our hard, Kwekweza told DW.If youre abducted for speaking truth to power, if youre in prison for speaking truth to power, its hard, but if youre waking up and youre living a life, a shell of a life that is limited in opportunity and possibility, that is also hard.Representative of a new generationReceiving the German Africa Prize came as a surprise, the young activist admitted. She went on to work her way through the awards history.And when I did have the opportunity to go through past recipients of the award, since it started in the 90s, I am in awe that I do fall on that list of individuals, said Kwekweza.This was also thanks to her community and the team at WELEAD Africa, Kwekweza pointed out.

I had really closed the Zimbabwean chapter between Aliko Dangote and my country Zimbabwe. I was doing other things things for other countries for Aliko, said Mahachi.\n\nA cousin contacted me that we need to start this chapter again. I almost blocked him because of the stress that I went through in 2015. Fast forward, here we are. It was one word to Aliko and say let us try again, said Mahachi.\n\nDangote arrived in Zimbabwe last week to sign a potential US$1 billion investment deal that he committed to the country.\n\nHowever, for Mahachi, it was not a stroll in the park to convince Dangote to lend an ear to Zimbabwe for the second time.\n\nHonestly I do not want to lie. I had really closed the Zimbabwean chapter between Aliko Dangote and my country Zimbabwe. I was doing other things things for other countries for Aliko, said Mahachi.\n\nMahachi joined forces with Sikhosana and visited the Dangote Groups plant in Nigeria, which culminated in the billionaires visit to Zimbabwe last week.\n\nDangote pledged to invest several millions in Zimbabwe, targeting cement manufacturing, coal mining, power generation, and fuel pipelines from Walvis Bay, Namibia.\n\nDuring his visit, Dangote acknowledged that the economic environment had changed under the leadership of President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nSikhosana said the visit by the Dangote Industries leadership is a turning point for Zimbabwe.\n\nThe historic visit between the government of Zimbabwe and Dangote Industries, an engagement where we were honoured to advise and play a midwife. This moment not of transaction. It is a turning point. It is a declaration that Zimbabwe. A sign that the global capital is begining to listen.\n\nWe startd this journey in June 2024, no leak no whisper, no breach, said Sikhosana.\n\nAfter the signing of the multi-million-dollar deal, Dangote has already set the wheels in motion, with his team arriving in Zimbabwe this Sunday.\n\n",

            "content": "By Irish Times\n\nCARE workers from Zimbabwe, who allege they paid thousands of euro each to a recruiter to secure work permits, have told a tribunal of living in freezing shared accommodation without their wages after the jobs they were promised in the Republic failed to materialise.\n\nTestifying to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) this week, one of the workers said she was threatened with having her work permit cancelled when she asked about going to another job she was offered.\n\nAnother said she was left without income for months and had to eventually leave a staff house when the landlord arrived, threatening to change the locks.\n\nShingirirai Chiwaridzo, Nombeko Hlabangana, Brenda Mubaiwa, Tatenda Ncube, Allen Phillip Ndhlovu, Nicola Sibanda, Nobuhle Sibanda and Agapao Munashe Zvihari are each pursuing complaints under the Payment of Wages Act 1991 against their former employer, Unity Healthcare Services Ltd.\n\nThe Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland (MRCI), which is representing the six women and two men, says they are owed months of unpaid wages each, plus repayment of sums allegedly charged to procure their work permits. The company is disputing the complaints.\n\nGiving evidence to the WRC, the workers said they were approached in Zimbabwe and paid fees of between 2,000 and 3,600 to Unity Healthcare or one of its directors in 2022 or 2023.\n\nGiving evidence, worker Nobuhle Sibanda said Unity Healthcare chief executive Londiwe Maphosa quoted her 1,000 to secure a work permit and informed her she would have to pay 3,000 in total when accommodation costs were factored in.\n\nI couldnt raise the whole amount. I raised 2,600, Ms Sibanda said in evidence. An offer letter, contract and non-disclosure agreement were sent to her after she wired the money to Ms Maphosas co-director in the firm, Bruce Magama.\n\nMost of the group flew to Ireland at their own expense in December 2023 or January 2024 after being told they were going to be starting work within weeks at a care facility that was set to open in Virginia, Co Cavan, they said.\n\nThe pay on offer was in the region of 560 a week on a base hourly rate of 15 an hour, the tribunal heard.\n\nSeveral of the workers moved into a staff house Unity had rented near the centre and training was held for some, but the jobs failed to materialise, the tribunal heard.\n\nThe company director, Mr Magama, told the hearing the centres opening had been delayed, and referred to attempts to arrange employment elsewhere for workers.\n\nHe said one healthcare firm had been willing to take staff, but Ms Sibanda said her understanding was that the other company had made it clear that it was not taking anyone from Unity Healthcare.\n\nThe tribunal was told that at one point, seven workers were living communally in the staff house, some two to a bedroom, others bedding down in its diningroom.\n\nAnother worker, Agapau Munashe Zvihari, said her mother had arranged temporary lodgings for her in Galway, but after the delays, her landlady said: We have to go to Cavan and see if you have this job.\n\nHer landlady had formed the view that the company was being run by scammers, she said. When she spoke to Ms Maphosa, she was told: You signed an NDA [non-disclosure agreement]. Why are you talking to these people youre staying with about our company?\n\nMs Chiwaridzo said the workers at the staff house were scared to talk.\n\nMs Maphosa  who was married to Mr Magama, the witness said  came to the house on one occasion and shouted at us for answering questions from another worker about the opening of the centre.\n\nSome of the workers were able to earn small amounts of money cleaning houses or doing childminding, the tribunal heard.\n\nSeveral workers gave evidence that the company undertook to pay them 100 a week while they were waiting for work, but that this arrangement stopped after three weeks, and some further small ad hoc sums were given to some who complained about financial circumstances.\n\nHowever, others said they received no money at all from the company which had brought them to the Republic for work.\n\nMs Chiwaridzo said the workers living at the staff house pooled their resources to try to pay for electricity, food and heating. It was just not enough, she said.\n\nUnder questioning by Mr Magama, she said the businessman had been sending money for food from January to March 2024 and making some contributions to the heating bill, but not consistently.\n\nMs Chiwaridzo said she needed a letter of no objection from Unity Healthcare, as the sponsor of her work permit, to release her and allow her to take up another employment contract.\n\nIt took from first asking in March 2024 to October that year to get the letter  by which time two job offers had fallen through, she said.\n\nBrenda Mubaiwa said she had left kids at home to come to to the Republic and work, but had only ever been paid 300 by Unity Healthcare. Ms Mubaiwa said that to pay for her son to sit exams, her mother had resorted to borrowing money.\n\nThe workers were giving evidence to the WRC on Thursday. The matter has been adjourned by adjudication officer Breiffni ONeill, who will hear the evidence of a ninth complainant at a later date.\n\nPretty Ndawo and Sylwia Nowakowska of the MRCI appeared for the workers. Mr Magama appeared on his own as respondent.\n\n",
