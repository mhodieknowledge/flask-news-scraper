            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nBREAD prices are set to go up starting November 1, 2025, NewZimbabwe.com has learnt.\n\nThe increase comes as a result of a controversial Statutory Instrument (SI) 87 of 2025, which was gazetted by Industry and Commerce Minister Mangaliso Ndhlovu last month.The SI imposed a statutory payment into the Agriculture Revolving Fund on all millers, a move that they warned could result in negative inflationary pressures.Recommendations to set it aside were ignored.Failure to do so, as a result, is set to hike bread prices by not less than 4% on the retailers side according to the National Bakers Association of Zimbabwe (NBAZ) and Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ).Maize meal, stock feed, and other related products are likely to see prices go up.The NBAZ wishes to reiterate that the sector does not have capacity to take any increases in input costs, without compromising business viability, reads a letter to Ndhlovu from NBAZ, dated October 24, 2025.Bread flour accounts for approximately 43% of the total bread production cost, if a 4% increase in bread flour is permitted, it will translate to a 2 cents increase per cost of producing a loaf, resulting in an increase in the wholesale price of bread effective on the day on which the flour price is increased.The communicated increase in flour price, compounded with the other input cost escalations will result in an overall 5 cents per loaf pass-through effect to the retailer, most likely taking the retail price of bread, above the US$1 psychological benchmark, effective 1 November 2025.Despite fuel price increases, shortages of electricity and haphazard distribution, bread prices have remained at generally a dollar across the country.Their price hike could have a ripple effect whose inflationary impact might bring back memories of the late 2000s when prices changed by the hour.GMAZ, which according to another letter in NewZimbabwe.coms possession conceded defeat upon failure to scrap the SI, has already communicated the increase to the government.Regrettably, we have failed to successfully lobby for this SI to be reversed and have no option but to comply with it, reads a letter sent to Ndhlovu dated 23 October and copied to Lands and Agriculture Minister Anxious Masuka, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, the presidents office, and the NBAZ.Accordingly, guided by the Audit Opinion we sought, we will be making provisions of the statutory payment imposed in our costings.Therefore, the price of bread flour (and other types of flour) will be increasing by circa 4% with effect from 1 November 2025.\n\nThe increase comes as a result of a controversial Statutory Instrument (SI) 87 of 2025, which was gazetted by Industry and Commerce

In the horticulture sector, the areas of interest include blueberries, chilies, avocados, and macadamia nuts, said Midzi.He noted that with Chinas zero-tariff policy for African exports, Zimbabwe aims to further tap into the Chinese market for locally produced goods.Looking at the Chinese market, we are also aiming to promote leather products, especially exotic leather. We are also looking to promote arts and crafts from Zimbabwe, the horticultural products, and the processed foods, said Midzi.Zimbabwe is additionally seeking to export heritage-based and value-added products such as baobab wine, baobab powder, and essential oils derived from indigenous resources.We have got baobab seed oil, we have got Marula oil, which are new products that are being developed in Zimbabwe, which we are looking to promote, and we believe the Chinese market is the right market, whether for further value additions into cosmeceuticals or even just consumption by the Chinese market, he said.As Zimbabwe works to strengthen its horticulture sector, businesses in blueberry production will be represented at the expo, following the signing of a blueberry export protocol during President Emmerson Mnangagwas visit to China in September.The protocol is only fairly new, but we are hoping to generate interest so that we can get information on potential buyers in China of blueberries so that we can bring back that information to the Zimbabwean growers and promote blueberry exports to China, said Midzi, adding that Zimbabwe is also pursuing export protocols for additional horticultural products, including citrus and avocados.\n\nKupakwashe Midzi, client advisor in the export development department at ZimTrade, Zimbabwes trade promotion agency, said about 15 companies from sectors including construction, horticulture, minerals, arts and crafts, and essential oils will participate in the expo, slated for Nov. 5 in Shanghai.\n\nWhat we are expecting to benefit from CIIE is getting more business deals, generating business leads, and getting businesses or companies in China that are interested in not only buying products from Zimbabwe, but also investing in the production of the products locally, said Midzi in a recent interview with Xinhua.He said the CIIE has, over the years, served as a key platform to showcase Zimbabwean products and expand their visibility in the vast Chinese market.We are looking forward to gaining a lot of traction from the Chinese businesses as well as potential buyers in what Zimbabwe has to offer.

His failure to leverage on this ended up as a sanctioning of the demonstration, he said.\n\nMliswa also questioned Charambas apparent reluctance to strongly denounce the planned protests, saying this was out of character for a Presidential Spokesperson.\n\nAnyone familiar with his conduct and antics through his multiple ghost accounts could clearly pick out the dragging of feet. While cause existed to restrain abuse of government communication channels, an even greater cause of existential importance called for more. He offered none! he said.\n\nMliswa further accused Charamba of acting like a social media bully, using pseudo accounts to attack opponents,behavior he said was unbecoming of a Presidential Spokesperson and damaging to President Emmerson Mnangagwas image.\n\nOver time, as DCS, he has simply become a wild bully without professional decorum in public engagements, encapsulated by incessant insults of Dununu against any contrary thought or individual.\n\nIts shocking behaviour for someone who is the Presidential Spokesperson and should have drawn government censure long ago, as it brings the President and the Office into disrepute. The absence of such has seemingly emboldened him to grow even coarser into the grating maverick around whom many tiptoe, fearful of getting a revolting rant.\n\nWe cant have a Presidential Spokesperson who is toxic and personal in his engagements, tarnishing the name and standing of the President. These are the kinds of things which the Chief Secretary should bring to the President, Mliswa added.\n\nMliswas criticism comes shortly after he accused Charamba of sleeping on duty, claiming exiled former minister Jonathan Moyo was doing a better job defending Mnangagwa on the controversial 2030 presidential term limit debate.\n\nIn response to the repeated attacks, Charamba dismissed Mliswa as irrelevant, saying he was not worth engaging.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nGOVERNMENT has set aside nearly US$197,000 to cover the medical and repatriation costs for Zimbabwean victims of the Limpopo bus accident, which killed 44.\n\nThe victims, Zimbabweans and Malawians, were travelling back home when the DNC bus veered off the N1 North near Louis Trichardt on 13 October, killing 43 passengers and injuring 40 others, the victims. One more person succumbed to injuries in the hospital, bringing the death toll to 44.\n\n36 Zimbabweans died and 13 remain hospitalised in South Africa, with three in a critical condition.\n\nPreliminary investigations have revealed that the accident was due to brake failure and overloading of the bus, which was carrying 91 passengers with only a 62-seater capacity.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has since declared the bus accident a national disaster.\n\nPresenting a ministerial statement in the National Assembly recently, the Deputy Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Benjamin Kabikira, said the repatriation will be conducted in batches beginning on Friday.\n\nThe positive identification of all deceased was completed on the 20th of October, 2025, with the ZRP forensic team present to assist with the fingerprint screening and verification. In cases involving deceased children, DNA samples were collected from both the deceased and their next of kin for accurate identification.\n\nThen, on the death registration and documentation, all required documentation, including the death certificates and burial orders, are being processed to facilitate repatriation.\n\nThe repatriation to Zimbabwe is anticipated to begin in batches from Friday, 24th October 2025, pending the completion of all formal processes. A mass memorial service will be held in Beitbridge when the bodies arrive in Zimbabwe, said Kabikira.\n\nKabikira added that US$197,000 has been set aside to assist the victims.\n\nSecondly, we have dispatched a bus with next of kin or relatives from the National Disaster Management Centre, Harare, to the Beitbridge route to South Africa, for identification of the bodies. Zimbabwean nationals, that is next of kin without valid passports, were granted temporary passage into South Africa for the sole purpose of identifying the deceased.\n\nA list of names for the next of kin and national IDs was submitted to South African Immigration in advance to ensure smooth border processing. As a Ministry, post mortems were completed on Friday, the 17th of October, 2025 and the physical identification was also completed as of 20 October at Siloam Hospital.\n\nAs an intervention, the department of Civil Protection requested the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development and Zim Borders for a waiver of border charges for the hearses and bus carrying the bodies and families of the bereaved.
