            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) has disbursed US$40 million to revive struggling state-owned enterprises (SOEs) across Zimbabwe as part of its ongoing efforts to restore the viability of key public entities.\n\nFormerly known as the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Zimbabwe, the MIF was established under the Sovereign Wealth Fund Act (Chapter 22:20) to manage national resources and support government-backed projects. The fund draws its capital from balance-of-payments surpluses, foreign currency operations, privatisation proceeds, fiscal savings, and natural resource revenues.\n\nIn an update this week, Mutapa Fund CEO Dr. John Mangudya said the latest funding marks significant progress in efforts to restructure and strengthen the performance of critical SOEs.\n\nThis funding is designed to enhance the performance of parastatals and align them with the national economic agenda, said Dr. Mangudya. Among the entities benefiting from this support are the Cold Storage Company (CSC), which recently emerged from corporate rescue, ZUPCO, Silo Foods, and the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ), among others.\n\nSince its inception, the Mutapa Fund has played a central role in revitalising distressed parastatals, particularly by steering the CSC out of corporate rescue and improving governance and operational efficiency across several other enterprises.\n\nThe fund manages a diversified portfolio of state-owned companies, grouped into key economic clusters, including mineral resources, energy and trading, ICT, transport and logistics, agriculture and industry, financial services, and real estate.\n\nThrough these targeted investments, the Mutapa Investment Fund continues to anchor Zimbabwes broader strategy for state enterprise reform, economic stability, and sustainable growth.\n\n",
