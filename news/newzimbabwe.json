            "content": "AP\n\nAmid everything else on his desk  the Iran hostage crisis, domestic economic turmoil, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and a grueling 1980 reelection fight President Jimmy Carterelevated the independence of a country in southern Africa as a top agenda item.\n\nCarter hosted then-Zimbabwean leaderRobert Mugabeat the White House soon after his country achieved independence and later described Zimbabwes adoption of democracy as our greatest single success.\n\nThree decades later, Carter, who was long out of office, found the door slammed shut whenhe and other dignitariessought to visit Zimbabwe on a humanitarian mission to observe reported human rights abuses after a violent disputed election in 2008. He had become a critic of Mugabes regime and was denied a visa.\n\nCarter didnt give up. From neighboring South Africa, he relied on emissaries from Zimbabwe for testimony on violence and allegations of electoral fraud. The effort reflected the former presidents long commitment to promoting democracy worldwide.\n\nThis more than anything else cemented Carters legacy as an advocate for free and fair elections across Africa, said Eldred Masunungure, a former political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe.\n\nCarter didnt change. Zimbabwe did. Mugabe swayed from the democratic ideals that Carter held so dear, he said. The incident demonstrates Carters consistency, the steadfastness.\n\nZimbabwes evolution toward autocracy turned out to be the kind of scenario that theCarter Centerhas long sought to prevent by deploying observers and developing voting standards in countries struggling to form democracies.\n\nEstablished in 1982, two years after Carter lost his bid for a second term, the center has been Carters signature effort to promote fair elections as a vehicle for peace. It has sent observers to monitor some 125 elections in 40 countries and three tribal nations, and has been credited with helping expand democracy across the globe.\n\nCarters moral authority, the trust people put in him and the credibility of someone who had both won and lost an election contributed to these successes, David Carroll, head of the centers democracy program, told The Associated Press.\n\nCarter, who died Sunday at 100, was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for the centers work supporting elections, promoting human rights and helping developing countries cultivate economic, social and public health institutions.\n\nIts elections work began in Panama, where Carter became concerned about the 1989 elections after reports of armed militia members in civilian clothes confiscating voting records during the night.\n\nThe Carter Center had just decided to expand its mission of conflict resolution and human rights to include vote monitoring, concluding that democratic elections were essential to resolving political disputes.\n\nIn my fumbling Spanish, I stood up on a table, and I denounced the election as fraudulent, Carter recalled in a 2015 video marking the centers 100th election observer mission. There was later another election, which was honest and fair, and that was the birth of real democracy in Panama.\n\nThe center also helped rescue apeace process in Nepal, then oversaw the countrys twice-postponed elections in 2008 to elect an assembly that would be tasked with writing a constitution. Carter made several trips to the South Asian nation, holding marathon negotiations with former rebels and top politicians to keep the peace process on track.\n\nThere was deadlock in the country. Political parties were not sitting together, and there was no way out on how the process will move on, said Bhojraj Pokharel, Nepals chief election commissioner in 2008, who later worked with Carter in Congo and Myanmar.\n\nOn Nepals election day, Carter traveled to dozens of polling stations talking to voters. Polling was peaceful despite earlier fears of violence.\n\nHis presence itself was a message to the Nepalese population and voters about the integrity of the election, Pokharel said.\n\nThe Carter Center often works in countries with little or no experience in representative government and where trust has all but evaporated because of violence.\n\nAfter Bolivia held elections in 2019 that the Organization of American States said were marred by fraud, the countrys electoral tribunal invited the Carter Center to observe elections the following year. The center deployed a team to Bolivia and latercommended the countryfor elections it called impartial and transparent.\n\nThe Carter Centers evaluation was important not only for how the international community viewed us but also for how Bolivian society evaluated the electoral process, said Salvador Romero, the tribunals president at the time.\n\nSimilar results have been difficult to obtain recently in Africa, where many countries emerging from decades of colonialism have seen forceful takeovers and disputed elections.\n\nIn Nigeria, Tunisia, Zambia andIvory Coast, Carter Center observers noted violence, killings, vote-buying, uneven playing fields for political parties and candidates, and a general lack of trust in elections.\n\nIn Tunisia, frustration has replaced the wave of hope brought by the 2010 Arab Spring uprising. A new parliament was convened in March 2023, two years after President Kais Saied suspended parliament and started legislating by decree. The 11% turnout for parliamentary elections marked a low point for the countrys democracy, The Carter Center said, and some election observer groups weredenied accreditationfor the October 2024 presidential contest.\n\nAt times, Carter personally intervened to keep African peace processes on track by trying to persuade warlords and rebels to support elections, rather than the use of force, in their quests for power.\n\nIn recent years, the Carter Centers elections workturned toward the U.S.\n\nIts teams deployed to Oklahoma in 2017 at the request of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes following elections plagued with problems. In 2013, ballots had been moved from office to office and stored without proper security, eroding confidence in the integrity of the vote. A recount then overturned the results, tribal Gov. Reggie Wassana said.\n\nThe Carter Centers presence in the later election made a huge difference, and it restored some faith among tribal members, Wassana said.\n\nUntil 2020, the center tried to stay away from broader political issues in the United States, according to Carroll. But the center noticed threats to American democracy were increasing, which prompted a decision to expand programs within the U.S.\n\nIf we saw the same conditions in another country that we were seeing in the U.S.  the lack of trust in election institutions, polarization and growing concern of political violence  it is exactly the kind of country we would prioritize to see if we could play a constructive role, Carroll said.\n\nFaith in U.S. elections, most notably amonga large segment of Republican voters, eroded after the 2020 election amid former PresidentDonald Trumps false claimsthat Democrats had rigged the vote. There was no evidence ofwidespread fraudor manipulation of voting machines in that election.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, which Trump won, the center did some limited observation in New Mexico, Montana andFulton County, Georgia. In many U.S. states, election observers are limited to political party representatives, with no provisions for nonpartisan, independent groups. The center is working to change that.\n\nCarters leadership on democracy issues remains a north star for the center, Carroll said.\n\nYou can help strong systems be in place, but they need to be watched continually. You can never rest on your record on democracy and elections. You always have to be vigilant and keep an eye on the process, he said.\n\n___ Cassidy reported from Atlanta.

The challenges have impacted on the economy, peoples lives and progress towards achieving the nations Vision 2030 of becoming an upper middle-income society.\n\nThe economy has, however, shown remarkable resilience, reflecting governments successful implementation of strategic reforms and policies since 2018.\n\nDuring National Budget debates in Parliament, most lawmakers were concerned about the mining and agriculture sectors, saying the expansion of the two meant employment creation (with a double digit) and economic growth.\n\nLands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development was allocated ZiG22,9 billion.\n\nAlso, the issue of mining royalties and taxes took a centre stage as legislators felt government was not realising many dividends from the mining industry.\n\nWe need more exploration allocations and indicate some new mining areas to boost revenue for the country, said an MP during one of the Bills debates at New Parliament Building in Mt Hampden last year.\n\nMines ministry was allocated ZiG764.8 million.\n\nThe Primary and Secondary Education ministry got the highest vote pegged at ZiG46,7 billion. The portfolio has faced problems whereby the Better Education Assistance Module (BEAM) programme has not been funded adequately in the past decade.\n\nLast year, BEAM beneficiaries reportedly failed to sit for their Ordinary and Advanced Level ZIMSEC exams for non-payment of fees due to late disbursements.\n\nHealth and Child Care was allocated a mere ZiG28,8 billion but considering challenges being faced by public health institutions in the country, the allocated funds by Parliament are not adequate for the year.\n\nZimbabwe health sector is supported by donor funds but still, even councils are failing to buy baby cards for the newly born babies as well as syringes.\n\nFinance ministry got ZiG28,7 billion while the Ministry of Defence was allocated ZiG18,05 billion.\n\nThe Public Service ministry was allocated a mere ZiG10,7 billion although the portfolio has a huge burden to cater for the vulnerable groups, which includes the pensioners and orphans.\n\nTransport and Infrastructure Development was allocated ZiG5,4 billion while the Parliament of Zimbabwe got ZiG2,7 billion.\n\nThe 2025 Budget comprises ZiG234 688 015 000 in expected revenues charged to the Consolidated Revenue Fund and ZiG6 248 797 000 in retention funds that are meant for specific purposes as provided for by the Public Finance Management Act.\n\n",

Thats a good reason to tow away that car and the driver to pay a heavy fine.\n\nWe hope further investigations will be conducted and bring the officers on that roadblock to book for allowing such a car to pass, said Mapiya.\n\nJerry Maguranyanga said for years he took pride in ZRP as a top policing organisation in Africa but the level of corruption is becoming more apparent.\n\nCarlos Mufiri concurred with Mapuranga, noting the graft was increasingly contributing to road carnage.\n\nZRP is very toxic. All the police officers at roadblocks along the above-mentioned road knew about the 13 passengers in the car but the driver just paid his way, said Mufiri.\n\nThirteen passengers, you are not working you guys. What are the reasons for your roadblocks?\n\nStakeholders interviewed by NewZimbabwe.com in Mashonaland West province called on government to ban pirate taxis plying various routes and introduce regulated conventional buses.\n\nThere are pirates that ply the Chinhoyi-Chegutu route while others transit between the provincial capital and Harare, Karoi, Mhangura and other outlying areas such as Kenzamba, Makonde district.\n\nWHAT HAS GIVEN RISE TO PIRATE TAXIS\n\nSince September last year, 13,886 motorists have been arrested nationwide for operating pirate taxis, an indicator of how rampant pirates are in Zimbabwe.\n\nUnregistered taxis have been part of Zimbabwes transportation system for years, but they have increased since the coronavirus pandemic as other legal means of transport fell away, according to the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development.\n\nIn 2020, to enforce lockdown measures and discourage people from leaving their homes, the government outlawed the countrys most dependable means of transport: licensed and privately owned omnibuses, minivan taxis  locally known as kombis  and smaller cabs. Only public buses, which are few and unreliable, were allowed to operate.\n\nThe ban was lifted in December 2022 but several private operators that had disposed of their vehicles struggled to get back into business. As a result, pirate taxis still dominate the public transportation sector.\n\nDespite various public awareness campaigns to educate passengers on the dangers of using illegal taxis, illegal taxis continue to thrive.\n\nThe demographic and geographical growth of Zimbabwean cities has put pressure on public transportation services, according to research from the Harare-based nonprofit Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development (ZIMCODD).\n\nZimbabwes population has increased by 16.2% and now stands at 15.1 million people, up from the 13 million in the 2012 census.\n\nWhen there is population growth, our cities then also expand, says Cynthia Huni, an urban planning expert.\n\nYou see new suburbs being opened, and when that happens you have to create new roads and transport systems.\n\nWhile the lack of reliable public transport has created new opportunities for an informal market, Passenger Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) president, Tafadzwa Goliati believes the influx of pirate taxis also stems from the countrys economic hardships characterised by high unemployment.\n\nThere is general poverty and joblessness in this country and people are not earning much to survive, so they find alternatives to make ends meet  and pirate taxis is one of those means, Goliati says.\n\nADVOCACY FOR JAILING OF MUSHIKASHIKA DRIVERS, OPERATORS\n\nJust like commuter omnibuses were outlawed for causing road traffic accidents, some stakeholders are also calling on the government to deal harshly with mushikashika and jail those who operate them.\n\nLast September, government implemented the radius-based restrictions for commuter omnibuses from 120 km to 60 km, a move aimed at improving road safety on the countrys major roads.This applied to commuter omnibuses with a seating capacity of 26 passengers and below.\n\nTransport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona said the move was aimed at mitigating against road traffic accidents involving kombis.\n\nThe minister argued that high-capacity buses had greater leg space and baggage space for long-distance travellers than kombis, which makes buses more ideal for long-distance journeys.\n\nA member of Women Coalition of Zimbabwe (WiCOZ), Mary-Anne Mutsambi said besides being sexually violated in crammed pirate taxis, the speeding vessels put the lives of breadwinners at high risk of leaving their children orphaned.\n\nI am personally advocating for a total ban on mushikashika and incarceration of drivers and owners. Pirate taxis have become death traps, and we are needlessly losing lives and limbs daily.\n\nThe pirates are notorious for overloading passengers like sardines, speeding, hailing insults and profanities as well as flouting road rules and regulations with abandon recklessness at the expense of passengers lives and wellbeing, therefore imprisonment of drivers and operators is the only way to make our roads safer and saner, said Mutsambi.\n\n",

From time-to-time we were now sending food, medication and lotions but it was not enough, cancer kept growing.\n\nThe current drought made things worse for them, that even in her state she would try to go for piece jobs until around June 2024 when she was now bedridden.\n\nShe endured extreme pain during her last days. Because she didnt get sunscreen, early screening and treatment we lost her, an emotional Tshuma said.\n\nThe activist also bemoaned neglect from the government and called for the establishment of regular skin cancer screenings, at least twice a year.\n\nShe is also lobbying for hospitals and clinics to have at least one staffer professionally trained in albinism-related health issues.\n\nl am traumatised because of what l see in the countryside, brothers and sisters dying without treatment. The fundraisers we do are only a drop in the ocean.\n\nThe Government of Zimbabwe has abdicated its duty especially to my community of persons with albinism.\n\nWe need regular skin screening at least two times a year. Hospitals and clinics must have at least one health professional knowledgeable about albinism and skin cancer for early referrals, she added.\n\nChigovas passing shows the harsh reality for many in rural Zimbabwe, where treatable and preventable illnesses often lead to death because of neglect.\n\n",
