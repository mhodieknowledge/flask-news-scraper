            "content": "Channel 4\n\nJohn Smyth has been described as the most prolific abuserto be associated with theChurch of England.\n\nHis barbaric beatings of more than a hundred boys and young men in three countries werecovered up for decades.\n\nNow his victims in Zimbabwe are taking legal action against the Church of England to get answers and compensation.\n\nSixteen-year-old Guide Nyachuru attended one of Smyths Christian camps in Zimbabwe in 1992. He never came back alive.\n\nWe first spoke to Guides sister, Edith, in 2017 for an investigation exposing John Smyths abuse. Now shes joining with seven of Smyths Zimbabwean victims to demand compensation from the Church of England.\n\nAn official review by Keith Makin last year accused the Church of England of a cover-up, saying leading figures could have stopped Smyth continuing his reign of abuse in the UK in the early 1980s, before he left for Zimbabwe and South Africa.\n\nA secret report by an Anglican clergyman, Mark Ruston, in 1982 gave a detailed account of the beatings meted out by Smyth. But rather than face justice, Smyth was allowed to leave for Zimbabwe in 1984.\n\nEdith Nyachuru told us that she believed her brother would still be alive if Smyth had been stopped in the UK.\n\nWhen Channel 4 News spoke to Rocky Leanders nearly a decade ago, he had no idea about the scale of Smyths abuse.\n\nNow hes furious after learning how the Church covered it up.He told us: Im now angrier, angry at a much wider, bigger group of people that should have known better.\n\nBoth Rocky and his brother endured barbaric beatings from Smyth at one of his Christian camps. They were left bruised and in pain.\n\nSmyth also insisted on the boys being naked at the summer camps.\n\nWe werent encouraged to be naked, we were forced to be, he said.Its as simple as that.\n\nSmyth would watch the boys showering, and he too would be naked.\n\nIm now angrier, angry at a much wider, bigger group of people that should have known better. Rocky Leanders\n\nIn 1995, Smyth was charged with culpable homicide over Guides death, but the prosecution unravelled. Smyth died in 2018, depriving his victims of answers.\n\nMakin recommended an independent review into Smyths abuse in Zimbabwe. But, nearly a year later, that hasnt happened.\n\nMaybe theyre looking down on us as a third world country. Edith Nyachuru\n\nEdith told us she believes the Church was still covering up the truth now.\n\nI think the Zimbabwean victims have been treated unfairly, she said, adding: Maybe theyre looking down on us as a third world country.\n\nRocky told us bluntly that the Church  in failing to stop Smyth in the UK  was ultimately responsible for at least one death and many, many, many other countless trauma to young boys and young adults and its just despicable.\n\nHe added: Its disgusting.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, quit after the Makin review accused him personally of failing to do enough to stop Smyth.\n\nLaw firm Leigh Day is making a legal claim against the Cambridge church, St Andrew the Great, formerly the round church, whose vicar compiled the 1982 report.\n\nThe Zimbabwean victims and their families still struggle with the legacy of Smyths barbaric abuse.\n\nRocky told us the emotional toll is now significant and that he had lost trust in religion  and humanity as a whole  because people who were in a position of trust have abused that trust.\n\nGuides family are still haunted by his death. Edith said she believed Smyth was rotting in hell.\n\nThe new Archbishop of Canterbury, Sarah Mullally, was announced yesterday. Nearly a year after Justin Welby quit  leaving the organisation he led in crisis  she will immediately face troubling questions about the way victims have been treated.\n\nWe werent encouraged to be naked, we were forced to be. Rocky Leanders\n\nA Church of England spokesperson said: We are truly sorry for the horrendous abuse carried out by John Smyth and the lifelong effects on survivors, both here and in Africa. The Church in South Africa has already carried out its own review. We have been in contact with the Church in Zimbabwe and offered to support and contribute financially to any review that it might choose to undertake, building on the review undertaken by David Coltart in 1993.\n\nThe Church of England is working through the recommendations in its own learning lessons review. The National Safeguarding Team has taken out complaints under the Clergy Discipline Measure against a number of clergy criticised in the review. That process is ongoing.\n\nA spokesperson for St Andrew the Great Church in Cambridge said: We are full of sorrow about the horrendous abuse carried out by John Smyth which has had lifelong effects on survivors, both here and in Africa, and that he was not stopped sooner.\n\nWhile we are unable to comment on the specifics of this claim, we take the safety and wellbeing of our congregation, staff and volunteers extremely seriously and follow Church of Englands Safeguarding Policy and Practice Guidance designed to protect vulnerable people.\n\nIf anyone has been affected by this issue and wants to talk to someone independently, please call the Safe Spaces helpline on 0300 303 1056 or visit safespacesenglandandwales.org.uk. Further support is also available via contacts on our safeguarding webpage.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has defended its monetary policy and the new Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency framework in response to criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe IMFs August 2025 review of Zimbabwes economic performance praised the RBZs tight monetary policy for stabilising the ZiG and controlling inflation, but called for an overhaul of the countrys foreign exchange (FX) management system.\n\nThe IMF recommended reducing the RBZs involvement in the FX market, specifically lowering the mandatory 30% export surrender requirement and transitioning to a more market-driven approach. It also suggested simplifying the Zimbabwean dollars exchange rate system, which it believes is inconsistent with a floating rate.\n\nHowever, the RBZ disagreed, asserting that its current approach provides essential flexibility for stabilizing the currency and strengthening reserves. The central bank emphasized that its involvement in the FX market is necessary to maintain exchange rate stability and questioned the IMFs recommendation to reduce its role.\n\nOn broader monetary policy, the IMF proposed phasing out Non-Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NNCDs) and replacing them with tradable securities to improve liquidity management. The RBZ responded by outlining plans to reduce reliance on direct monetary tools and improve policy transmission, including the introduction of a Term Deposit Facility.\n\nAdditionally, the RBZ rejected IMF claims about exchange rate restrictions, stating that recent reforms have removed all formal restrictions and any remaining measures are internal procedures by financial institutions, not government-imposed.\n\nDespite the disagreements, the RBZ expressed openness to future adjustments, such as enhancing the FX market with greater transparency and exploring IMF technical assistance.\n\nThe central bank also reaffirmed its commitment to price stability and long-term reforms, with plans to transition to a mono-currency system by 2030.\n\n",
