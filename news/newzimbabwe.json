            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nHARARE residents are opposing the governments plan to roll out prepaid water meters, arguing the move will not solve the citys ongoing water shortages, poor water quality and widespread leakages.\n\nThe government announced plans to install prepaid water meters across the country, starting with the capital city, Harare, to improve water management and responsible use.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Harare Residents Trust (HRT) accused local authorities of failing to establish a transparent and accountable water management system and argued that this will be another profit-making scheme at the expense of residents.\n\nPrepaid water meters will never help improve the quantity of water delivered to the residents, nor will they address the quality of the water supplied.\n\nGiven the deliberate failure by the local authorities, especially the City of Harare (CoH), to secure a functional, transparent and accountable enterprise resources planning system, it is prudent to initially invest in plugging the leakages and illegal water connections along the water distribution network to reduce non-revenue water.\n\nThe private companies being brought in by the national government to provide the prepaid water meters and be involved in the whole water value chain are interested in profit and not improving service delivery, HRT said.\n\nThe residents trust also accused the government and CoH of quietly signing the deal under a Build-Operate-Transfer model without involving the most affected stakeholders, which are the taxpayers.\n\nThe water infrastructure contract was given to a Hangzhou Liaison Technology Company and Helcraw Electrical Company without going to tender and the contents of the contracts remain unknown to the public.\n\nHelcraw is owned by Zanu PF legislatorfor Murehwa West constituency,Farai Jere.\n\nMeanwhile,HRT urged parliamentary committees to hold public hearings so Zimbabweans can share their views on the water meter policy.\n\nHarare has faced a growing water crisis for years, with daily water supply going downa mix of poor maintenance, pollution and leaking pipes.\n\n",

King has successfully led cross-functional teams, championed innovation, and delivered transformative technology solutions across diverse sectors and regions, Meikles Limited added.\n\n",

Upon arrival, they produced the pangolin that was stashed in a black bag inside a crate. Detectives then pounced and the two tried to flee when police revealed their identities, but were swiftly apprehended.\n\nThe pangolin  a female weighing 8.7 kilogrammes was rescued alive and taken to veterinary authorities for medical assessment and care.\n\nIn a statement following sentencing, the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) said the mandatory nine-year sentence on the two offenders sends a clear message that wildlife crimes are serious offences, and that pangolins are an endangered species.\n\nPangolins are a national treasure, and any attempt to profit from pangolin trafficking will be met with the full force of the law, the NPAZ noted.\n\n",
