            "content": "By Reuters\n\nTANZANIAS main opposition party said on Friday hundreds of people had been killed in protests over elections this week, as the U.N. secretary-general called for an investigation into allegations of excessive use of force.\n\nThe U.N. human rights office said credible reports indicated at least 10 people were killed in protests in three cities, the first public estimate of any fatalities by an international body since Wednesdays vote.The foreign ministers of Britain, Canada and Norway issued a joint statement expressing concern over the situation and urging the Tanzanian authorities to act with maximum restraint and to respect the right of assembly and of free expression.Speaking to Reuters in some of the governments first public comments on the unrest, Foreign Affairs Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo said the oppositions death toll was hugely exaggerated but that the authorities had not yet tabulated casualties. He denied that security officers had used excessive force.Reuters could not independently verify the casualty figures.Protesters have taken to the streets since Wednesday, angered by the exclusion of President Samia Suluhu Hassans two biggest challengers from the race and what they described as widespread repression.Witnesses have said police fired tear gas and gunshots to break up some demonstrations.Police have imposed an overnight nationwide curfew over the past two nights after government offices and other buildings were set ablaze. Internet access has been disrupted since Wednesday.In a statement issued by his spokesperson, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a thorough and impartial investigation into all allegations of excessive use of force and deplored the loss of life.Partial election results announced on Thursday and Friday showed Hassan winning commanding majorities across the country, and complete results were expected in the coming hours.HEAVY SECURITY PRESENCEThe unrest presents a test for Hassan, who won praise after taking office in 2021 for easing repression but has more recently faced criticism from opposition parties and activists after a series of arrests and alleged abductions of opponents.Hassan has denied allegations of widespread rights abuses. She said last year she had ordered an investigation into reports of abductions, but no official findings have been released.Soldiers and police patrolled the streets of the commercial capital Dar es Salaam on Friday, preventing people from moving around without a valid reason.John Kitoka  a spokesperson for the CHADEMA party which was barred from the election for refusing to sign a code of conduct and had its leader arrested for treason in April  said the party had documented about 700 deaths since Wednesday based on accounts from health workers.He said protests continued on Friday in several cities, although they had waned in some due to the heavy security.We are calling for the protests to continue until our demands for electoral reforms are met, Kitoka told Reuters.GOVERNMENT SAYS VIOLENCE LIMITEDForeign Affairs Minister Kombo said there had only been a very few small pockets of incidents during the election period and that the violence was caused by criminal elements.Most Tanzanians are so much disappointed with what has happened, and they are calling for their government to end this impunity, he said.U.N. human rights spokesperson Seif Magango told reporters there were credible reports of at least 10 people killed in Dar es Salaam, Shinyanga and Morogoro.One Dar es Salaam resident, who asked not to be named for safety reasons, told Reuters a family member had been shot dead outside a hospital when he was mistaken for a protester.A police spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.Writing by Vincent Mumo Nzilani and George Obulutsa; Editing by Aaron Ross, Ros Russell, Andrew Heavens and Gareth Jones.\n\nThe U.N. human rights office said credible reports indicated at least 10 people were killed in protests in three cities, the first public estimate of any fatalities by an international body since Wednesdays vote.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Britain, Canada and Norway issued a joint statement expressing concern over the situation and urging the Tanzanian authorities to act with maximum restraint and to respect the right of assembly and of free expression.Speaking to Reuters in some of the governments first public comments on the unrest, Foreign Affairs Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo said the oppositions death toll was hugely exaggerated but that the authorities had not yet tabulated casualties.

The recent significant investments in our national road infrastructure, including the ongoing Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Road rehabilitation and upgrading project, are vital for economic growth, tourism and public safety, said the government.To protect this critical infrastructure and ensure its longevity, the ministry said there will be zero tolerance for overloaded vehicles.Going forward, any truck found to be overloaded on the Bulawayo Victoria Falls Road, or any other major highway, will be subject to severe penalties and fines as prescribed by the countrys laws. This enforcement is not limited to the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls corridor as it applies to all major highways across Zimbabwe to preserve the national road network.Overloading severely damages road surfaces, leading to premature potholes, structural failures, and increased public expenditure on repairs. It also poses a serious safety risk to all road users.We urge all transport operators and drivers to comply with stipulated axle limits. Regular checkpoints and weighbridges will be operational to ensure adherence, the ministry added.\n\nSpeaking at the official opening of the ninth Parliaments second session back in 2019, President Emmerson Mnangagwa revealed a whopping US$2,5 billion on road infrastructure projects, a figure which has definitely multiplied since the government has sustained the infrastructure projects.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the MoTID said owing to the need to safeguard investments, stiffer penalties will be imposed going forward.This serves as a formal notice to all motorists and transport operators regarding the strict enforcement of axle load regulations on Zimbabwes major highways, with immediate effect.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA NAMIBIAN delegation is in Zimbabwe on a benchmarking mission aimed at strengthening cooperation in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) with a particular focus on diamond cutting and polishing at Zimbabwes only Diamond Training Centre.\n\nThe delegation, led by Namibia Training Authority (NTA) Chief Operations Officer Penda Shilongo and Zimbabwean government officials visited polytechnics across the country, Chinhoyi University of Technology, Diamond Training Centre and the Zimbabwe School of Mines among other training institutions.The purpose of the visit is to learn from Zimbabwes experience in developing skills for mineral beneficiation and industrial value addition.Speaking during the visit to the Diamond Training Centre, an indigenous-owned institute based in Harare, Shilongo said Namibia wanted to draw lessons from Zimbabwes model of transforming natural resource wealth into employment through practical skills development.What we take home is that we need to start with mineral beneficiation in our country. At the moment, we do not have a training facility that offers these types of skills. We see this as an opportunity to collaborate and leverage the expertise of our sister country so that we can also add value to our mineral resources in Namibia, Shilongo said.He added that Namibia was eager to strengthen bilateral cooperation with Zimbabwe, particularly in upskilling trainers and aligning TVET standards across the SADC region.We invite our Zimbabwean counterparts to visit Namibia to identify areas where we can also assist each other. There is a lot to learn from one another, he said.The NTA, which regulates the countrys TVET system, is implementing reforms to bridge gaps in technical training and align courses with emerging industries such as green energy.Richard Kambinda, acting general manager for TVET and VTC development support, said Zimbabwes capacity in vocational training was impressive and that the visit would help Namibia build stronger foundations for technical education.We came to Zimbabwe on a study tour to see what programmes can help us bridge the gaps we have in Namibia, Kambinda said.We dont have a diamond-cutting college back home, so its important to learn from our brothers and sisters here. Weve seen that Zimbabwe has the capacity and we believe Zimbabwe can help us.The visit is part of a broader agenda to finalise a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two countries, focusing on dual certification, curriculum development, trainers capacity building, quality assurance, Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) integration, and SADC TVET harmonisation.Diamond Training Centre founder and director Lovemore Kurotwi said the visit was a significant recognition of Zimbabwes growing influence in technical skills transfer and beneficiation training.We are a private, indigenous-owned institution, and I am grateful to our government and the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education for licensing and recognising our pivotal role in this economy, Kurotwi said.We are transferring vital skills to our young people, which is key to building an industrialised nation.He said the institutes mission is to transform Zimbabwe from an exporter of raw minerals to a manufacturer of finished products.We complain about unemployment, yet we have all the resources. The missing link is skills. Without skills, there is no industry to talk about, he said. That is why our thrust is on training and skills transfer. When another government comes to benchmark us, it shows we are on the right path.The diamond training institute plays a strategic role in Zimbabwes mineral beneficiation agenda by equipping students with expertise in diamond cutting, polishing, grading, and valuation skills once exclusive to foreign operators.Kurotwi said the Namibian delegations tour shows growing continental cooperation in vocational education, as African nations increasingly seek to localise value addition and empower their youth through hands-on technical skills.Meanwhile, despite having a beneficiation policy, Zimbabwe still exports raw minerals.The country continues to train personnel, most of whom end up leaving because there is no beneficiation industry.\n\nThe delegation, led by Namibia Training Authority (NTA) Chief Operations Officer Penda Shilongo and Zimbabwean government officials visited polytechnics across the country, Chinhoyi University of Technology, Diamond Training Centre and the Zimbabwe School of Mines among other training institutions.\n\nThe purpose of the visit is to learn from Zimbabwes experience in developing skills for mineral beneficiation and industrial value addition.Speaking during the visit to the Diamond Training Centre, an indigenous-owned institute based in Harare, Shilongo said Namibia wanted to draw lessons from Zimbabwes model of transforming natural resource wealth into employment through practical skills development.What we take home is that we need to start with mineral beneficiation in our country.

When another government comes to benchmark us, it shows we are on the right path.The diamond training institute plays a strategic role in Zimbabwes mineral beneficiation agenda by equipping students with expertise in diamond cutting, polishing, grading, and valuation skills once exclusive to foreign operators.Kurotwi said the Namibian delegations tour shows growing continental cooperation in vocational education, as African nations increasingly seek to localise value addition and empower their youth through hands-on technical skills.Meanwhile, despite having a beneficiation policy, Zimbabwe still exports raw minerals.The country continues to train personnel, most of whom end up leaving because there is no beneficiation industry.\n\nWe came to Zimbabwe on a study tour to see what programmes can help us bridge the gaps we have in Namibia, Kambinda said.\n\nWe dont have a diamond-cutting college back home, so its important to learn from our brothers and sisters here.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nWOES continue to mount for jailed businessmen Mike Chimombe and Moses Mpofu, with the State now seeking to confiscate their properties following their conviction in a US$7 million fraud case.\n\nThe duo, who face a possible minimum 20-year jail term if convicted, will now be sentenced on November 17 after the State indicated its intention to apply for a confiscation order under Section 50(1) of the Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act [Chapter 9:24].The law empowers authorities to trace, seize, and confiscate assets suspected to have been acquired through criminal activity.Prosecutors believe some of Mpofu and Chimombes properties were bought using proceeds of the goat tender fraud.We had given notice in terms of section 50(1) of the Money Laundering Act, said prosecutor Whispher Mabhaudhi while seeking a postponement of the case on Friday.Mabhaudhi said the States application is ready but has been delayed pending the uploading of the courts written judgment.Once the judgment is uploaded, then the State will file its application, he added.Justice Pisirayi Kwenda, who convicted the pair, said their separate judgments would be available by next Wednesday.The two are expected back in court on November 14 for pre-sentencing proceedings.Sentencing is expected on November 17.Mpofu and Chimombe were found guilty last week after spending over a year in remand prison.The State proved that the fraud emanated from false documents submitted through their company, Blackdeck Private Limited, in September 2021, when the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture invited bids for the supply of 632,001 goats worth US$87 million under a national livestock pass-on scheme.After winning the tender, the contract was instead signed by Blackdeck Livestock and Poultry Farming, an unregistered entity, with Mpofu representing the company and Chimombe acting as a witness.Investigations revealed that Blackdeck Private Limited had no valid tax clearance certificate from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), and that the QR code on its National Social Security Authority (NSSA) compliance certificate belonged to another firm, Skywalk Investments.Relying on these misrepresentations, the ministry paid ZWL$1.6 billionthen equivalent to US$7.7 millionin two instalments on April 21 and June 29, 2022.When the company failed to deliver, it falsely claimed to have mobilised 32,500 goats across provinces, but verification showed only 3,713 goats were available.After the Ministry of Lands realised that they were being deceived by the accused persons, they then cancelled the contract on August 29, 2022, said the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ).To date, only 4,208 goats worth US$331,445.25 have been delivered, leaving the government prejudiced of US$7,380,751.85.\n\nThe duo, who face a possible minimum 20-year jail term if convicted, will now be sentenced on November 17 after the State indicated its

We will announce by Monday at the latest; it should be Tuesday, said Magwizi.\n\nThe post became vacant after Michael Nees was dismissed due to a string of poor results, leaving the national team without a coach just two weeks before the November FIFA international break.\n\nSources say the online application portal, which closed Thursday, drew a stampede of interest, with over 300 curriculum vitae submitted. Among the notable applicants is former Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United, and Ghana national team manager Chris Hughton, who is said to be among the frontrunners.\n\nZIFA has set a minimum requirement of a CAF or UEFA Pro License, effectively ruling out local coaches, none of whom currently hold such qualifications.\n\nThe new coach will immediately begin preparations for the Warriors upcoming friendly matches against Algeria on November 13 in Saudi Arabia, and Qatar four days later as part of the build-up to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) scheduled for December 2025.\n\n",
