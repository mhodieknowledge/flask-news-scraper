            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/how-mobile-gaming-is-transforming-entertainment-and-connectivity-in-zimbabwe/",
            "content": "Mobile gaming has seen explosive growth in Zimbabwe over the last decade, with online casino games such as roulette and slots becoming increasingly popular. What was once a niche industry is now a mainstream form of entertainment, attracting thousands of players from different backgrounds. The rapid adoption of smartphones, improvements in internet infrastructure, and growing interest in digital entertainment have contributed to this transformation. Today, many Zimbabweans can access online casino games from the palm of their hands, enjoying an experience that was once limited to physical casinos.\n\nSmartphones: Bringing Casino Games to the Masses\n\nOne of the primary reasons for the growth of mobile gaming in Zimbabwe is the increasing availability of affordable smartphones. A decade ago, high-end mobile devices were a luxury, accessible only to the wealthy. However, brands like Tecno, Itel, and Infinix have flooded the market with budget-friendly smartphones, making mobile gaming accessible to a much broader audience. With even entry-level smartphones now capable of running online casino games smoothly, more Zimbabweans are taking advantage of the convenience and entertainment these platforms provide.\n\nThis accessibility has led to a shift in gaming habits. Instead of visiting brick-and-mortar casinos, players now have the freedom to enjoy andplay online rouletteor spin the reels on a slot machine from anywherewhether they are at home, commuting, or even on a lunch break. The ease of access has played a significant role in driving interest in online casino gaming.\n\nFaster Internet and Improved Infrastructure\n\nAnother critical factor fuelling the growth of mobile gaming in Zimbabwe is the improvement in internet connectivity. Just a few years ago, slow speeds and expensive data plans made online gaming difficult. However, telecom providers such asEconet, NetOne, and Telecel have expanded their mobile broadband networks, bringing 3G and 4G connectivity to more areas. As a result, playing online casino games has become a seamless experience, with minimal buffering or connectivity issues.\n\nThe increasing competition among internet providers has also led to more affordable data packages. Daily, weekly, and monthly gaming bundles allow players to enjoy their favourite casino games without worrying about excessive data costs. This has made mobile gaming far more appealing, especially to younger audiences who are already accustomed to spending time on their phones.\n\nAdditionally, as Zimbabwe moves towards adopting 5G technology, the future of mobile gaming looks even brighter. Faster speeds and lower latency will improve the overall gaming experience, making it even easier for players to engage in real-time casino games like live dealer roulette or poker.\n\nThe Appeal of Online Casino Games: Why Players Love Slots and Roulette\n\nWhile mobile gaming spans multiple genres, casino games like roulette and slots have gained particular traction in Zimbabwe. These games offer quick entertainment, the potential for big winnings, and a level of excitement that keeps players engaged.\n\nSlot games are especially popular due to their simplicity. Unlike poker or blackjack, which require strategy and decision-making, slot games are easy to playjust spin the reels and hope for a winning combination. The introduction of themed slot games with vibrant graphics and sound effects has further enhanced their appeal, making them an attractive option for casual gamers.\n\nRoulette, on the other hand, appeals to those who enjoy a more dynamic betting experience. The thrill of watching the wheel spin and anticipating where the ball will land keeps players coming back for more. Online platforms now offer both classic European and American roulette variations, as well as modern digital adaptations that introduce new features and betting options.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the popularity of these games is the presence of progressive jackpots. Many online slots now offer huge pooled jackpots that can be won by any player, adding an extra layer of excitement. For Zimbabweans looking for entertainment combined with the chance to win life-changing amounts of money, these games are an irresistible option.\n\nThe Rise of Mobile Payments and Accessibility\n\nThe integration of mobile payment solutions has also played a major role in the expansion of mobile gaming in Zimbabwe. Unlike in many Western countries where credit and debit cards are the dominant payment methods, Zimbabweans rely heavily on mobile money platforms such as EcoCash, OneMoney, and Telecash for financial transactions.\n\nOnline casino operators have quickly adapted to this trend, making it easy for players to deposit and withdraw money using mobile wallets. This convenience has eliminated the traditional barriers to entry, allowing more players to participate in mobile gambling without the need for a bank account or credit card.\n\nCryptocurrency is also gaining traction within the online gaming industry. Some international betting sites that accept Zimbabwean players now support Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, offering an alternative for those who prefer secure and anonymous transactions.\n\nSocial and Economic Impact of Mobile Casino Gaming\n\nThe rapid growth of mobile gaming in Zimbabwe has not only provided entertainment but also opened up new economic opportunities. Local entrepreneurs are developing gaming apps and platforms, creating employment for developers, designers, and marketing professionals. As mobile gaming continues to grow, more job opportunities are expected to emerge within the industry.\n\nAdditionally, online casinos have introduced new revenue streams for players. While most people play casino games for fun, others see it as a way to supplement their income. Some players participate in online tournaments and high-stakes games, hoping to turn their skills into profit. Although gambling comes with risks, the potential rewards have encouraged many Zimbabweans to try their luck.\n\nHowever, the industry has also raised concerns about responsible gaming. The accessibility of online casino games means that players can engage in gambling at any time, which can lead to addiction if not managed properly. To address this issue, many online gaming platforms have introduced responsible gambling features, such as deposit limits and self-exclusion options. Awareness campaigns about the risks of gambling are also becoming more common, helping players make informed decisions about their gaming habits.\n\nLooking ahead, the mobile gaming industry in Zimbabwe is poised for continued growth. As smartphone technology improves and internet infrastructure expands, even more players will join the digital gaming revolution. The governments stance on online gaming regulations will also play a crucial role in shaping the industry. If properly regulated, mobile casino gaming could become a significant contributor to Zimbabwes digital economy, creating more jobs and generating tax revenue.\n\nDevelopers are likely to introduce more locally-themed casino games that appeal to Zimbabwean players, incorporating cultural elements and traditional games into digital formats. Additionally, as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology become more accessible, online casinos may start offering immersive gaming experiences that replicate the feel of a real casino.\n\nFor now, the combination of affordable smartphones, faster internet, and seamless mobile payments has created the perfect environment for mobile casino gaming to thrive. As more Zimbabweans discover the thrill of playing roulette, slots, and other online casino games, the industry will continue to evolve, offering bigger, better, and more engaging experiences.\n\nMobile gaming in Zimbabwe is more than just a passing trendits a digital revolution thats transforming entertainment, creating new opportunities, and reshaping how people engage with casino games. Whether youre a casual player spinning the reels on a slot machine or a seasoned bettor trying your luck at roulette, one thing is certain: the future of mobile gaming in Zimbabwe is bright.\n\n",

I can trade it for Nato membership, if there are such conditions, the Ukrainian president said in response to a question during a news conference.\n\nHis comments came after US President Donald Trump called Zelensky a dictator without elections earlier in the week.\n\nI wasnt offended, but a dictator would be, Zelensky, who was democratically elected in May 2019, responded on Sunday.\n\nI am focused on Ukraines security today, not in 20 years, I am not going to be in power for decades, he added.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian law, elections are suspended under martial law, which has been in place since Russias full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nZelensky is meeting Western leaders on Monday, some in person in Kyiv and some online, as they work out how to provide a post-war security where the US will not.\n\nHe said the topic of Ukraine joining Nato would be on the table at the meeting but he did not know how the discussions would finish. He hoped the meeting would be a turning point.\n\nOn the topic of Trump, Zelensky said that he wanted to see the US president as a partner to Ukraine and more than a mediator between Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nI really want it to be more than just mediationthats not enough, he said.\n\nWith the White House demanding that it gets access to billions of dollars worth of Ukraines natural minerals in exchange for the military aid it provided to date  and could in the future  Zelensky said US help so far had been agreed as grants, not loans.\n\nHe said he would not agree to a security deal which  in his words  would be paid off by generation after generation.\n\nWhen asked about a potential mineral deal, Zelensky said we are making progress, adding that Ukrainian and US officials had been in touch.\n\nWe are ready to share, the Ukrainian leader said, but made clear that Washington first needed to ensure Russian President Vladimir Putin ends this war.\n\nZelensky appeared relaxed as he faced questions from the worlds media. In previous years he had been more impassioned and even emotional, but on Sunday his approach was business-like.\n\nIf Ukraines leader rejects a Donald Trump-shaped peace proposal he does not agree with  as he suggested today  then it could have lasting consequences for the course of this war.\n\nZelenskys comments came hours after Russia launched its largest single drone attack on Ukraine yet, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nOn Saturday night, Ukraines Air Force Command spokesman Yuriy Ignat said a record 267 Russian drones were launched in a single, coordinated attack on the country.\n\nThirteen regions were targeted and while many of the drones were repelled, those that were not caused destruction to infrastructure and at least three casualties, emergency services said.\n\nUkraines Air Force reported that 138 of the drones were shot down and 119, which were decoy drones, were lost without negative consequences, likely due to jamming.\n\nIn Kyiv, the attack meant six hours of air alerts.\n\nIn a statement, Zelensky thanked Ukraines emergency services for their response and called for the support of Europe and US in facilitating a lasting and just peace.\n\nIn a post on X, Ukraines First Lady Olena Zelenska said that hundreds of drones had brought death and destruction overnight.\n\nIt was another night of explosions, burning houses and cars, and destroyed infrastructure, she wrote. Another night when people prayed for their loved ones to survive.\n\nOn Monday, the war will enter its fourth year.\n\nDiplomatic wrangling over a potential peace deal continues, with Ukraine, European allies and the US offering differing visions for how to end the conflict.\n\nThe US and Russia held preliminary talks in Saudi Arabia this week  without delegates from Europe, including Ukraine, present  which resulted in European leaders holding a hastily-arranged summit in Paris.\n\nZelensky criticised Ukraines exclusion from the US-Russia talks, saying Trump was living in a disinformation space governed by Moscow, prompting Trump to respond by calling the Ukrainian president a dictator.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is expected to visit Washington on Monday, while UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will be there on Thursday.\n\nSir Keir has publicly backed Zelensky, reiterating the UKs ironclad support for Kyiv, and said he would discuss the importance of Ukraines sovereignty when he speaks to Trump.\n\nPope Francis  who is in hospital with respiratory illness  wrote in a remarks released on Sunday that the third anniversary of the war was a painful and shameful occasion for the whole of humanity.\n\n",

The office is the Master is responsible for all estates and insolvency situations like corporate rescue and liquidations.\n\nIn furthering institutional independence for the Masters office, the new laws prescribe that a board of professionals be created whose chairperson has to be qualified as a High Court judge. It will be the duty of the board to determine policies and principles of how the office is managed on a day-to-day basis with a focus on ensuring financial management and operational efficiency.\n\nLong and short, the aim of the Act is to address inefficiencies through corporate governance, with a focus on accountability and judicial oversight in the operations of the Masters office.\n\nReporter: What are some of the amendments introduced that affect day-to-day estate administration?\n\nVM: One such amendment deals with what is to be done where there is a dispute or competition for appointment as the Executor Dative.\n\nFor those who are not aware, the Executor Dative is the person appointed by the Master or Court as responsible for the gathering of assets, establishing liabilities and beneficiaries and ultimately distributing the estate.\n\nSuch disputes on who is to be appointed arise where there is no will stating in clear terms who the testator wishes to be the executor.\n\nIn such circumstances,the new act states the order of preference in appointment as the surviving spouse failing which, next of kin, failing which creditors then failing them legatees.\n\nThe Master will have to apply to the High Court with his choice of executor and if the Master has good reasons against the appointment of any of the interested persons, he can appoint a professional or other fit and proper person. The surest way to oppose the Masters choice is for all interested persons to submit to the court on joint affidavit their preferred executor.\n\nReporter: I understand that the amendments also deal with the issue of removal of executors.\n\nVM: Yes that is true.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the amendments do not override or remove the common law principles for the removal of executors by interested persons to the estate.\n\nThey address a situation where the Master on his own motion following his own enquiry is of the opinion that the executor should be removed for grounds that may include incompetence, illegality in appointment or unsuitability for the role due to physical or mental incapacity.\n\nHe the Master is obliged to apply to the High Court an affidavit justifying his reasons for removal of the executor. On receiving the application, the executor is suspended from his duties pending the decision of the Court. The Master, in the interim, assumes the role of the executor. The judges response can only dismiss the application if he receives an affidavit from an interested person to the estate that there is a good reason not to remove the executor.\n\nReporter: Is there any other amendment that could have an effect on day-to-day estate management by executors?\n\nVM: Where the executor wants to sell the property of the estate privately and not by public auction and the will does not forbid it. The executor is to produce to the Master an affidavit jointly sworn by all the interested persons to sell the property and if the Master is satisfied that it will be in the best interest of the estate that the property is sold privately, he shall grant his authority.\n\nIn the event that it is contested, the executor supported by the Master will make an application to the court which shall determine upon considering practical estate needs and beneficiary interests whether or not the property is sold privately.\n\nReporter: Do you foresee any challenges that may come about as a result of the amendments in the Act?\n\nVM: The additional board approval and court processes may slow down administration coupled with the normal transition risks into autonomy.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima atvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

            "content": "CSMonitor\n\nOutside the Bernice Elizabeth Fonteneau Wellness Center in Petworth, a historically Black neighborhood in Washington, D.C., bundled-up passersby swerve around piles of melting slush. But the small room on the centers third floor radiates warmth. So happy youre here, reads the mat on the doorway, welcoming visitors into the softly lit space.\n\nInside, on what looks to be a park bench covered in throw cushions, Angela Jasper offers free, informal talk therapy sessions, creating what she calls a safe, nonjudgmental space for people to unburden themselves.\n\nOn the other side of the world, by a public clinic in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, Shelter Nhengo has a bench, too. Sometimes all one needs is someone to talk to, she says.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, mental health care is expensive and even shameful. But a network of therapy-trained grandmothers, sitting on public benches, has brought comfort to 500,000 people. Now the idea has spread to Washington.\n\nMs. Jasper and Ms. Nhengo arent psychologists or social workers. Think of them, instead, as kind of volunteer neighborhood grandmothers  that is, if the grandmothers were trained in cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nThe two women work using a model calledFriendship Bench, developed by Zimbabwean psychiatrist Dr. Dixon Chibanda. The idea behind it is simple: In many places, formal mental health care is expensive, impractical, or even shameful. But grandmothers are not.\n\nAll told, more than half a million Zimbabweans have sat on a Friendship Bench in the last two decades, and recently, Dr. Chibanda has begun taking his model global.\n\nIsh Mafundikwa A client (left) tells a grandmother her story on a bench outside a Harare clinic. Formal mental health care is expensive, and sometimes shameful, in Zimbabwe. Grandmothers are not.\n\nBut in late January, Dr. Chibanda received a curt email from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which helps pay for some of his projects. As part of the Trump administrations three-month freeze on American foreign aid, Friendship Benchs funding was being cut off.\n\nDr. Chibanda and his team were shocked. Their USAID grants were helping them train 45 virtual Friendship Bench counselors, among other projects. American aid money had also helped his organization train Ms. Jasper and her fellow volunteers in Washington. While a federal court ruled Feb. 13 totemporarily lift the USAID freeze, it remains unclear if the decision will hold, or if and when funding might be restored.\n\nIt affects us badly, he says. And that funding was not only helping people abroad, but also Americans.\n\nFriendship Bench was born of tragedy. In 2005, one of Dr. Chibandas patients, a woman named Erica, died by suicide after missing a session with him. When he spoke to her family members, they told him that she couldnt find the $15 in bus fares she needed to go to her appointment.\n\nFor a long time, I felt personally responsible for Ericas death, he says. I wanted to do something to prevent something similar from occurring [again].\n\nAt the time, Zimbabwe had, by one count, justseven psychiatrists, and many viewed mental health problems as shameful. This troubled Dr. Chibanda, who saw the traumas that stalked Zimbabweans daily, from the legacies of colonialism and government repression to the AIDS pandemic and poverty. All of that led to a problem known in the local Shona language askufungisisa,literally thinking too much  or what Westerners might know as depression.\n\nBut Dr. Chibanda also noticed that those around him were not entirely without support. As in many parts of the world, they leaned on an invisible army of aunties and grannies, older women with quiet wisdom and the time to listen.\n\nFriendship Bench Dixon Chibanda (seated at left) and some of the counselor grandmothers pose at a 2024 Friendship Bench function in Harare.\n\nSo he decided to formalize that system, training a group of older women in Harare in the basic ins and outs of problem-solving-oriented therapy. As there was no space inside the clinic where the project was piloted, the grandmothers did their counseling outside. It was the complete opposite of a frowning professional in a sterile room scribbling your secrets in a notebook.\n\nToday, thousands of these semiprofessional therapy grannies  along with a few grandfathers and younger people, too  host counseling sessions on benches installed around the country.\n\nIts a hard life, but I always feel better after talking toAmbuya, says one Friendship Bench user in Harare, using the Shona word for grandmother. (We are not identifying either because of the sensitivity of speaking about mental health challenges.)\n\nIn 2021, as the COVID-19 pandemic continued crashing over the world, a group of grandparents in Washington found itself asking a question similar to Dr. Chibandas. People around them were hurting deeply. What could they do to help?\n\nAt the time, the group was working with HelpAge USA, a nongovernmental organization that advocates for the rights of older people. The organizations CEO, Cindy Cox-Roman, had read news stories about Friendship Bench, and wondered if the model might work in Washington, too.\n\nSo she called up Dr. Chibanda, and in September 2023, the grandparents found themselves on Zoom with the Zimbabwe team, starting a 10-week training to learn how they could use the benches.\n\nCourtesy of HelpAge foundation Scarlett Small (left) is among a group of 12 grandparents in Washington providing talk therapy using the Friendship Bench model.\n\nOne of them, Scarlett Small, says that she wondered at first whether the Zimbabwean model would fit in Washington. We have a different culture here, she remembers thinking. But she was quickly struck by how many of the issues they discussed in practice sessions were the same across oceans. People were hurting because of money troubles, family problems, and fractures in the relationships they treasured most.\n\nI think most people that come are sort of all tangled up in their thoughts, Ms. Small says. Friendship Bench is an opportunity for them to speak out loud, instead of it going over and over in their mind.\n\nDr. Chibanda has now brought Friendship Bench to several countries, including Vietnam, El Salvador, Malawi, Kenya, and Jordan, and he says many elements of the program have proved universal.\n\nWe find that everywhere, the less emphasis there is on diagnosing people, the better, he says. Instead, he says, the grandparents are taught to focus on giving people in pain space to tell their stories.\n\nBut now, he is worried about the struggling on the other side of the bench, too. In the days after the USAID freeze, he had to send 45 staff members home. Those who remain feel disempowered and helpless, he says.\n\nIn Washington, meanwhile, there are now 12 older people offering therapy at seven sites in historically Black areas of the city. And HelpAge hopes to eventually have one within walking distance of every person in these neighborhoods.\n\nFor her part, Ms. Jasper continues to look back on her time working with the Zimbabwean team with great fondness, calling it the part of the program I cherish most. In their expertise and empathy, she says, Theres so much we learned from them.\n\n",

Last years output of 231.7 million kg of flue-cured Virginia tobacco was a 13.1% increase from 2023.\n\nThe anticipated increase in Zimbabwe combined with projections that Brazils output will increase from 461.8 million kg in 2024 to at least 650 million kg in 2025 has experts predicting downward pressure on tobacco prices, particularly for middle to low-end grades.\n\nTapiwa Masedza, the factory coordinator for the Tian Ze Tobacco Company, said the global demand for tobacco remains robust, with many companies struggling to meet supply orders due to last years reduced crop size. That combined with Chinas need for top-end grades gives hope that prices will remain stable for premium leaf, however low- to medium-end grades prices are expected to drop.\n\nWhile the anticipated increase in production is a testament to the sectors resilience and growth, the potential price pressures underscore the need for strategic planning and investment in quality improvement, Masedza said. Mixing grades in bales, excessive moisture, and moldy tobacco can lead to discounts or rejections, ultimately affecting profitability.\n\nTIMB is trying to help insulate local farmers from potential subdued prices resulting from excess supply with a new pricing system, expected to be implemented April 5. The system will determine the following days minimum price based on the average price of all tobacco sold  both at auction and through contracts  across all grades.\n\n",
