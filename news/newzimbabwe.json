            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has ordered Rockshade Car Rentals and Tours to refund the Methodist Church in Zimbabwe (MCZ) US$7,125 after failing to provide a 60-seater luxury bus as agreed, ruling that the company had repudiated the contract by offering an inferior vehicle.\n\nJustices Benjamin Chikowero and Happias Zhou dismissed the car hire firms appeal against a Magistrates Court ruling that found Rockshade had breached its contract with the church ahead of a scheduled trip to Botswana in April 2025.\n\nThe letter says it all, said the judges, referring to MCZs detailed complaint of 21 March 2025, which went unanswered by Rockshade.\n\nIt was never responded to. What this means is that the appellant never disputed the terms of the contract as spelt out by the respondent and never disputed breaching the contract.\n\nThe church had paid Rockshade for the hire of a new 60-seater bus to transport congregants to a seminar in Botswana.\n\nBut it later discovered the company only had a single 50-seater already hired out. Rockshade then offered an old 57-seater bus instead  a move that left the church with 60 confirmed travellers but only 57 seats.\n\nMCZ described the replacement bus as very old, with worn seats, a dirty fridge and toilet, and earmarked for scrapping. The court said this amounted to a clear breach.\n\nBy refusing to avail the 60-seater bus (having earlier misrepresented to the respondent that it had the bus), the appellant repudiated the contract, the judgment stated.\n\nThe respondent acted properly in suing for a refund the moment the appellant indicated its unwillingness to be bound by the terms of the contract.\n\nThe High Court partially allowed the appeal only to remove a Magistrates Court directive that the refund be paid within 24 hours, ruling instead that Rockshade must simply pay the money and costs of suit.\n\nAll other grounds of appeal are red herrings. Nothing turns on them,Chikowero ruled.\n\nEach party was ordered to bear its own costs of the appeal.\n\n",

There is no rule of evidence that excludes it, he held.He further clarified that while the testimony might cast Mbondiya in a bad light, it was allowed under Section 33(a) of the Civil Evidence Act [Chapter 8:01], which permits character evidence in damages claims where reputation is directly at issue.This is not an issue of admissibility but of weight, Justice Dube-Banda said.
