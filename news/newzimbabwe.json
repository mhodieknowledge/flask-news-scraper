            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nThe Welshman Ncube-led Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) announced on Wednesday that self-appointed party secretary general Sengezo Tshabangu had been expelled from the party for violating the party constitution.\n\nFollowing the 2023 elections, Tshabangu began purging CCC members of parliament and councillors understood at the time to be close allies of the then-party leader Nelson Chamisa, claiming that they had ceased to be party members.\n\nCritics and analysts maintain that it appeared Tshabangu was playing a long game, in cahoots with President Emmerson Mnangagwas Zanu PF, to hijack the CCC party then led by Chamisa after the latter refused to acknowledge Mnangagwas 2023 election victory, citing irregularities which were also recorded in several election observer mission reports.\n\nNcubes CCC charged Tshabangu with four counts and found him guilty on all four.\n\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday, party spokesperson Willias Madzimure said that Tshabangu had contravened the party constitution clause 9.1.2.3.\n\nMadzimure stated that in November and December, Tshabangu had made changes to CCC Parliamentary Portfolio holders without the authority of the President or any organ of the party. He said Tshabangu had breached the partys constitution rules and regulations in that he brazenly defied the authority of the President of the CCC, the National Standing Committee, the National Executive Committee, and the National Council.\n\nOn the second count, Tshabangu was found guilty of making public pronouncements on changes to party representatives in parliament without first seeking the approval of the President of the CCC or its organs, namely the National Standing Committee, the National Executive Committee, and the National Council.\n\nOn the third count, the CCC stated that Tshabangu had brought the name and reputation of the party into disrepute by making changes in Parliament without the approval of the party organs.\n\nOn the fourth count, Tshabangu was found guilty of disrespecting the office of the President of the CCC and its organs by making derogatory remarks in the public media, where he made statements after his suspension from the party.\n\nHaving found Sengezo Tshabangu guilty of all the charges, and having regard to the gravity of the acts of misconduct of which the Committee convicted him, the Committee decided to sentence him to expulsion from the party with immediate effect, part of Madzimures statement reads.\n\nMadzimure added that he was uncertain whether Tshabangu would appeal, but implied that this expulsion could follow to give him a taste of his own medicine because he was the one who started the purging of party representatives from Parliament and local authorities.\n\nNewZimbabwe.com made efforts to reach Tshabangu, but he did not answer his mobile phone.\n\nHowever, one of his lawyers, Kucaca Phulu, confirmed that Tshabangu had appeared before the CCC party Disciplinary Committee but said he was not the one who spoke on behalf of Tshabangu and directed questions to fellow lawyer Nqobani Sithole.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Sithole rubbished the disciplinary Committee, its verdict, and its sentence, describing it as a charade. They do not have that power. They do not have structures. Structures that can exercise that power are not in existence at the moment. It is a charade, he stated.\n\nWhen asked why Tshabangu had appeared before a committee that he described as a charade, Sithole said his client had appeared to simply tell them that they are a charade.\n\nLast December, Ncubes group dragged Tshabangu to the High Court for pronouncing parliamentary changes without consulting his party organs. The High Court ruled in favour of Ncubes group before Tshabangu appealed the same ruling at the Supreme Court. The matter is yet to be heard.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nCITIZENS Coalition for Change (CCC) legislator Darlington Chigumbu has said that the governments initiative to compensate former white farmers overlooks the disadvantaged black workers who toiled on the farms.\n\nThe government recently announced that it is disbursing US$20 million to farmers who were displaced as a result of the land reform process aimed at addressing historical injustices in the early 2000s.\n\nThe 94 farmers, hailing from countries such as Switzerland and Germany, are covered under Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreements (BIPPAs) that Zimbabwe signed with the farmers countries of origin.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube said that the compensation is for the developments the farmers carried out on the farms prior to their displacement.\n\nSpeaking in the National Assembly recently, Chigumbu argued that the programme is ignoring the historical injustices suffered by native workers while developing the farms.\n\nIt is a good thing that our country is honouring its commitments. I would want to bring to the attention of this House that we need to be cognisant of the fact that there are some historical injustices that happened as these people acquired the land. It is a good thing that the Ministry is saying they are paying these people for the developments that were made on the land that was repossessed around 2000.\n\nHowever, they should also not be blind to the fact that the developments that these people are now being paid for, actually came as a result of labour practises that were near to slavery and our grandfathers are no longer there to be part and parcel or to also claim with these farmers to say they also contributed to the development of that particular piece of land as well as not being treated fairly.\n\nIt is also sad that this whole arrangement seems not to be taking into consideration these people who participated in the development of these particular pieces of land, said Chugumbu.\n\nThe government has faced criticism from opposition groups for compensating landowners whose land was forcibly taken from local inhabitants during the colonial era.\n\nChigumbu further suggested that there should be a mechanism to ensure that the native workers who laboured on these farms are also compensated.\n\nThe third aspect is that when the land was re-distributed, the big guys are the ones who took parts of the farm land which was properly developed and l can tell that they are not part and parcel of this whole arrangement.\n\nMy prayer is that can this arrangement include a model whereby these people who are going to receive the payments of the developments that they have done on these pieces of land also pay the people who worked on these pieces of land, which they were not paid fairly during the time they were working on these pieces of land?\n\nI understand most of these people are no longer alive but is it not also prudent Mr. Speaker Sir, to say that they can give back to the communities where their farms are located so that they can also pay something? The reason would be because they are now benefiting from something they did not pay for in as much as we are talking about the developments that were done on the pieces of land that they are now being paid for, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nRapper A$AP Rocky has been found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend.\n\nA jury in Los Angeles acquitted the musician, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, on two felony assault charges that carried up to 24 years in prison.\n\nTerell Ephron claimed the Grammy-nominated hip-hop star opened fire at him during an argument on a Hollywood street on 6 November 2021, grazing his knuckles with one of the shots.\n\nMr Mayers, who is also a fashion mogul and the longtime partner of pop star Rihanna, denied the charges, arguing that the weapon was a prop gun and that his former friend, who calls himself A$AP Relli, was only after money.\n\nAs the first not-guilty verdict was read on Tuesday, the court rang with screams and clapping. Mr Mayers rushed towards his family and Rihanna, who were seated behind him. He dived over a wooden barrier to embrace them.\n\nRihanna had been a repeated presence in court during the trial, and for Tuesdays verdict, brought along their two sons, two-year-old RZA and one-year-old Riot.\n\nMr Mayers also hugged his lawyers and appeared to have tears in his eyes as the second not-guilty verdict was read.\n\nThank God for saving my life, Mr Mayers said aloud. He thanked members of the 12-person jury.\n\nThe rapper was arrested on the two felony assault charges after a heated argument with his former friend in the heart of Hollywood.\n\nMr Mayers and Mr Ephron have known each other since high school in New York and were part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective.\n\nTheir friendship cooled as A$AP Rockys career took off.\n\nAuthorities said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November 2021, a day after the pair had a disagreement, outside a hotel about a block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nAn altercation ensued.\n\nMr Mayers was alleged to have pulled out a gun from his waistband and pointed it at Mr Ephron, telling him: Ill kill you right now.\n\nHe looked me in my eyes and pointed the gun at me, Mr Ephron testified.\n\nMr Ephron said he told the rapper to fire the weapon, but Mr Mayers started walking away. As he left, Mr Ephron followed, shouting at him.\n\nProsecutors alleged that at this point, Mr Mayers once again pulled out the gun and fired multiple shots, with one bullet said to have grazed Mr Ephrons knuckles.\n\nMuch of the trial hinged on whether the firearm in question was a harmless prop gun, as Mr Mayerss defence said, or a real weapon capable of causing harm, as Mr Ephron and prosecutors alleged.\n\nThe weapon has not been recovered by authorities.\n\nJurors were able to watch some footage of the altercation because parts were captured on surveillance video, including audio of gunfire, but no video evidence directly showed any shooting.\n\nMr Ephron took two days before reporting the incident to authorities and brought shell casings he said he had retrieved from the scene.\n\nBut police who responded to reports of a shooting in the area did not locate any shell casings. Mr Ephron, who said he returned with his girlfriend hours later, said he knew exactly where to look, but no surveillance footage corroborates his account.\n\nHe was not admitted to hospital in Los Angeles and instead went for medical treatment after flying back to New York.\n\nLawyers for Mr Mayers suggested that Mr Ephron had planted the shell casings to frame the rapper.\n\nThe trial was marked by emotional and combative exchanges, particularly when Mr Ephron  the trials star witness  took the stand.\n\nAt one point, Mr Ephron called Mr Tacopina  a defence attorney for Mr Mayers  annoying, which led to a reprimand from the judge.\n\nAnother witness, A$AP Twelvyy, was asked by prosecutors about a photograph showing Mr Mayerss bed with the letters AWGE emblazoned on the furniture.\n\nWhen asked what that stood for, Mr Mayers unexpectedly interrupted the proceedings and yelled, Dont say! Twelvyy ultimately refused to elaborate.\n\nOutbursts from defendants during trials are uncommon, especially in front of a jury.\n\nHowever, for a criminal suspect on trial to interject and instruct a witness not to answer a prosecutors question during cross-examination is something nearly unheard of in a court.\n\nThe rapper is set to release his first solo album in nearly a decade and is scheduled to co-headline Los Angeles Rolling Loud festival in March 2025.\n\nAdditionally, he stars alongside Denzel Washington in Spike Lees upcoming film Highest 2 Lowest, due to be released the coming months.\n\n",

Therefore, the total amount paid in lieu of fines is R680 000 while the 322 employees were taken for further processing as per immigration requirements, she said.\n\nMeths response showed that Eastern Cape led the pack with 34 employers that flouted the laws and were fined a collective R340 000, followed by Mpumalanga with 15, Limpopo eight, KwaZulu-Natal five, and two in the Western Cape.\n\nShe also said of the 322 foreign employees that were arrested, the largest number, 163, were from Limpopo.\n\nThe Western Cape came second with foreign nationals at 43, Eastern Cape and Gauteng at 34 each, Mpumalanga 30, KwaZulu-Natal 16, and Free State two.\n\nIn a separate response to another set of questions, Meth said her department received 6 255 work permit applications between April 2023 and March last year.\n\nShe said the role of her department was to make recommendations on corporate work visa applications regarding the availability of local labour in various categories.\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs makes final decisions or waive any recommendation made by any of these three departments after following their final internal processes or after consulting further with other departments such as those in the security cluster.\n\nShe added that of the 60 corporate applications her department received and processed, 5 383 were rejected.\n\nA total of 872 work visas for migrant workers were recommended.\n\nThe applications were mainly from foreign nations from Zimbabwe with 445, Lesotho with 250, Mozambique 86, and Namibia 70.\n\nThe applications were for mining, agriculture, and education and training.\n\n",

            "content": "Xinhua\n\nMozambique Airlines (LAM), the national flag carrier of the southern African country, has announced the suspension of its Maputo-Lisbon flights starting Wednesday, citing accumulated losses of more than 21 million U.S. dollars since 2023.\n\nAs long as the company is not well-organized and we continue to face irregularities in domestic flights, we cannot aim for major operations, LAM spokesperson Alfredo Cossa told a press conference in Maputo on Tuesday.\n\nThe route, which had been resumed on Nov. 20, 2023, after nearly 12 years of suspension, was part of the airlines revitalization plan under the management of the South African firm Fly Modern Ark.\n\nOperated with a 302-seat Boeing 777 in partnership with EuroAtlantic, the route connected the capitals of Mozambique and Portugal three times a week.\n\nHowever, according to Cossa, the airlines new board concluded that the operation was unsustainable.\n\nWe were financing this route using funds from the domestic market, he said. We produced and paid, but we have now reached a point where we can no longer sustain it.\n\nIn addition to suspending the Lisbon route, LAM also canceled flights between Maputo and Harare, Zimbabwe, and between Maputo and Lusaka, Zambia, due to the same reason.\n\nFor the 1,080 passengers who had already purchased tickets for the flights, Cossa said, LAM will make alternative travel arrangements through agreements with other operators.\n\nOnce we have restructured and consolidated our position, we will look toward intercontinental and regional operations, the spokesperson added.\n\nThe decision to suspend international routes aligns with LAMs 100-Day Governance Plan, which seeks to assess operational performance and strengthen the quality of domestic and regional services, Cossa said.\n\nFor years, LAM has struggled with operational challenges, including a reduced fleet, lack of investment, and non-fatal incidents linked to poor aircraft maintenance.\n\nIn February, the Mozambican government approved the sale of a 91 percent state-owned stake in LAM to public companies, aiming to raise 130 million dollars for the acquisition of eight new aircraft and the airlines restructuring.\n\n",
