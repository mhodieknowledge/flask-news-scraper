            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nFormer Zimbabwe Under-18 rugby player Campbell Nyakudya has been dragged to court amid allegations that he drugged, raped and robbed a 25-year-old woman after a night out in Harare.\n\nNyakudya, once celebrated for his explosive pace on the rugby field, appeared before Harare magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa, facing rape and theft charges. He was not asked to plead and was released on US$200 bail pending trial.\n\nAccording to the State, the incident occurred on October 25 when the complainant, a socialite, was having drinks with friends at La Parada Restaurant before they later moved to Karma Night Club in the capital.\n\nProsecutors said while at the club, the complainant went to the bathroom and, on her return, found her friends had left. Nyakudya was reportedly standing at the table with another woman.\n\nShe then picked up her glass and continued drinking while looking for her friends, the State outline reads. From that moment, the complainant could not remember what happened next and only woke up at Chisipite shops covered with a cloth.\n\nAccording to the court papers, bystanders at Chisipite told her she had been dumped by a moving vehicle, but they were unable to capture the cars registration number as it sped away.\n\nShe later realised that her handbag, an iPhone 14 Pro Max, US$1,200 cash, and wig were missing. She filed a police report at ZRP Highlands, leading investigators back to La Parada where they reviewed the clubs CCTV footage.\n\nThe footage showed the accused person adding an unknown substance into the complainants drink, the State said. It also captured him and an unidentified woman escorting the complainant to his vehicle before driving off.\n\nThe prosecution further alleged that Nyakudya later dumped the unconscious complainant at a parking area near Chisipite Shopping Centre.\n\nWhen workers from Karma Night Club took her home, she started to feel some pain in her private parts, prosecutors said.\n\nNyakudya was arrested on October 28, and according to the case outline, he admitted to having sexual intercourse with the complainant once without her consent.\n\nThe State insists the accused acted unlawfully.\n\nThe matter was remanded to a later date pending trial.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe Trump administration will limit the number of refugees admitted to the US to 7,500 over the next year, and give priority to white South Africans.\n\nThe move, announced in a notice published on Thursday, marks a dramatic cut from the previous limit of 125,000 set by former President Joe Biden and will bring the cap to a record low.\n\nNo reason was given for the cut, but the notice said it was justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.\n\nIn January, Trump signed an executive order suspending the US Refugee Admissions Programme, or USRAP, which he said would allow US authorities to prioritise national security and public safety.\n\nThe previous lowest refugee admissions cap was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe notice posted to the website of the Federal Register said the 7,500 admissions would primarily be allocated to Afrikaner South Africans and other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\n\nIn February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to allow members of the Afrikaner community  who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers  to settle in the US as refugees.\n\nSouth Africas ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was later expelled after accusing Trump of mobilising a supremacism and trying to project white victimhood as a dog whistle.\n\nIn the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africas President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and persecuted.\n\nThe White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years.\n\nThe tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.\n\nThe South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.\n\nOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the USs lack of ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans and protects their safety and security.\n\nThe US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups.\n\nSome have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East.\n\nThis decision doesnt just lower the refugee admissions ceiling, Global Refuge CEO and president Krish OMara Vignarajah said on Thursday. It lowers our moral standing.\n\nAt a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programmes purpose as well as its credibility, she added.\n\nRefugees International also slammed the move, saying it makes a mockery of refugee protection and of American values.\n\nLet us be frank: whatever hardships some Afrikaners may face, this population has no plausible claim on refugee status  they are not fleeing systematic persecution, Refugees International said in its statement.\n\nThe South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement.\n\nDuring the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trumps] head.\n\nEarlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances.\n\nWhile the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024.\n\nOf these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.\n\n",

That being the case, she certainly has the interests of her husband. We know the interests. We know how eager he is to become the president of the country; in so doing, she will serve the interests of her husband and not the country, said Mliswa.\n\nMliswas tirade against her follows an embarrassing power outage at the new Parliament Building, which forced President Emmerson Mnangagwa to complete his State of the Nation Address (SONA) using torchlight.\n\nMliswa says the hiccup was not a coincidence but sabotage against Mnangagwa.\n\nThe former Norton legislator accuses Miniyothabo of establishing a parallel structure within the military ranks.\n\nShe is running a parallel structure and it is important that the President knows. My expos of my passport and my boarding card, which was done on social media by Ali Naka, came through her. She has been doing that. What is also important is that the commander of MID certainly does not tolerate her. In not tolerating her, she is able to run a parallel structure. You can not have a parallel structure from a security perspective, he said.\n\nDespite being a colonel in the army, Miniyothabo has become a darling of the public and has never publicly declared any political ambitions.\n\nThe attack by Mliswa also comes as factionalism is deepening in ZANU PF over the succession of Mnangagwa, whose term of office expires in 2028. His loyalists are campaigning for an extended term of office by two years, until 2030.\n\nAdded Mliswa,I had already suggested and proposed that she can not be in office, being the wife of the Vice President, because she is already compromised. When people see her, they see the Vice President. How do you expect them not to take instructions from her? If you do not take instructions from her, you are fired. Why is it taking so long to retire her?\n\nThis is very important and for as long as this is not attended to, these issues will continue. There is a parallel structure which is being run from a security perspective.\n\n",

            "content": "Farmers Weekly\n\nBorn and bred in Zimbabwe, 68-year-old farmer Stuart Brentwas evicted from Kilvington Farm in Norton, just outside Harare, in September 2002.\n\nIn April this year, local media reported that the government had started paying white farmers compensation for the land grabs that occurred under the so-called Fast-track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP).\n\nIt reported thatinvestors whose farms were protected under Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (BIPPAs) would be compensated for land and improvements, while those who lost land through the FTLRP would be compensated for improvements only.\n\nThe Valuation Consortium (Valcon), a Zimbabwean valuation company, and the governments Land Compensation Committee came up with a valuation figure of US$5,2 billion (R90 billion) for improvements on farms.\n\nAccording to the Compensation Steering Committee (CSC), the Commercial Farmers Union came up with a compensation figure of US$10 billion (R174 billion), while independent professional valuers settled for US$8,5 billion (R148 billion). Both figures included the value of land, which was US$3,2 billion (R56 billion).\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations, the government adjusted its figure to US$3,5 billion (R61 billion), a figure that is currently operational.\n\nBrent said that initially, improvements on his farm were valued at US$1,6 million (R28 million), but as the government was opposed to paying that amount, negotiations saw the payment reduced to US$800000 (R14 million).\n\nHe said he had bought the farm in 1990 after getting a certificate from the government that it had no interest in that property, hence he could purchase it. He then took a loan from Standard Chartered Bank that he repaid over five years.\n\nBrent moved to Nigeria in 2009 with the hope of starting commercial farming there, but the expedition turned into a terrible flop due to a lack of promised finance and backing from the Nigerian government.\n\nI left Nigeria after living in tents in the middle of the bush for a year, he explained.\n\nHe added that no amount of compensation would ever make up for the suffering he endured due to the loss of his home, business, and his only profession, farming.When he returned to Zimbabwe, he lived off savings and gratuity payments.\n\nHe said he used to grow tobacco, maize, Rhodes grass seed for export, had cattle, and had just started an ostrich project when he was evicted from his land. Brent nowlives in a retirement home near Harare with his 65-year-old wife.\n\nDeon Theron, a farmer who rejected the compensation deal, said most dispossessed farmers decided not to sign up for compensation because the deal violated the countrys laws that stated payment should be fair and paid within a reasonable time.\n\nTheron, a CSC member, said the deal was discriminatory. He explained that Zimbabwean citizens, considered indigenous and foreigners, covered under BIPPA were paid the full price in cash for the land and improvements. However, citizens not deemed indigenous were treated differently.\n\nThe way forward is to talk to the international community and the government of Zimbabwe to find a way forward of financing fair compensation for everyone. This is possible, and we are busy talking to the government and various embassies and international financial institutions, he added.\n\nTheron said that after 1980, over a period of 37 years, he managed to buy three farms through loans from the Agricultural Finance Corporation.\n\nI lost my third farm with everything on it through violence in 2000. It is now settled with hundreds of A1 settlers.\n\nI lost my second farm in 2004 and my first farm in 2008. It was my main farm where we lived, and it was a dairy farm I built from scratch, he said.\n\nWhen I visited the farm a few years ago, there was very little going on. I saw a few goats and about seven people hanging around.\n\nAccording to Theron, about 90% of acquired farms were valued by Valcon, and the valuation exercise was largely funded by the EU.\n\nHe said the law required that people be paid within a reasonable time and stipulated that interest should be paid if compensation was delayed, yet he had not received a cent in more than two decades.\n\nThe question remains: why am I being discriminated against as a born-and-bred Zimbabwean when foreigners are treated differently? I am being discriminated against because of the colour of my skin.\n\nOur constitution does not allow discrimination against any race, he added.\n\nA liberation war was fought to end racial discrimination. Now we are back to doing exactly what that was opposed.\n\nAnthony Purkis, director of Valcon, said that when it became cleararound 2002 that farm expropriations were a reality, most farmers wanted valuations before they lost their properties.\n\nHe added that the only way to meet the demand was to employ mass valuation methods, which led to the formation of the farmdatabase.\n\nPurkis said it wasnt until 2017 when then-president Robert Mugabe lost power to Emmerson Mnangagwa that real communication started between Valcon and the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development; the Ministry of Finance; and other government departments.\n\nIn July 2020, the government signed an agreement called the Global Compensation Deed (GCD) with farmers, Valcon, and other stakeholders, based on the US$3,5 billion (R61 billion) payout.\n\nPurkis said the GCD promiseda 50% down payment 12 months after acceptance of the deed, followed by 12,5% in each of the subsequent four years.\n\nHe added that the farmers did not receive any payment within the set time frame, and the government came up with another offer,the Farmers Compensation Agreement (FCA), in 2023.\n\nThe [FCA] is a 10-year deal with a mix of small amounts of cash and Treasury bills/bonds. Approximately 1 000 applications have been accepted for the FCA, and 631 of those have received a 1% cash payment to various bank accounts here or in other countries in US dollars. That is the 1% allocated in the agreement of the value of the improvements only.\n\nThe Land Acquisition Act and the Constitution make it quite clear that land will not be compensated by this country, only improvements to the land, which include buildings, roads, fencing, irrigation, and so on.\n\nThe remainder of the compensation is to be paid in Treasury bonds over 10 years, maturing yearly with2% interest on outstanding value, he explained.\n\nPurkis said thecompensation figure for improvements was initially recordedas US$5,2 billion (R90 billion) but was deemed unaffordable by the government and reduced through bargaining to US$3,5 billion (R61 billion), which most farmers reluctantly accepted and was still the accepted FCA figure.\n\nHe added that the Valcon database included over 90% of all commercial farms registered for compensation. Although it recorded 4700 farms, they were owned by just 2450 farmers, highlighting that some farmers owned more than one farm.\n\n",
