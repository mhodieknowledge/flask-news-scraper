            "content": "The Conversation\n\nZimbabwean writerNoViolet Bulawayohas beenhonouredas Africas best short story writer after winning theBest of Caine Award. The special recognition marks 25 years of the annualCaine Prize for African Writing.\n\nAn esteemed panel of judges unanimously selected Bulawayo as the standout winner of the 25 stories awarded the prize so far. Her short story,Hitting Budapest, won the prize in 2011. She has gone on to publish two acclaimed novels,We Need New NamesandGlory. Both were shortlisted for the Booker Prize.\n\nFor me as ascholarof African literary cultures, Bulawayos recognition by the judges feels like a generational milestone. Hitting Budapest follows a band of children wandering in a decaying urban landscape in search of food. Their journey, told through a fractured, childlike voice, captures both the immediacy of play and the stark realities of deprivation.\n\nThe storys unsettling blend of innocence and brutality provoked livelydebatewhen it appeared. It raised questions about the aesthetics of the African literature the prize sought to celebrate. About whether its power lived in its inventive narration and perspective, or whether it leaned too easily into global appetites for African suffering and spectacle.\n\nBut there was never any doubt about Bulawayos singular talent. Shes today known for her virtuoso ability with language and her sharp eye for the textures of African life.\n\nNoViolet Bulawayo, the pen name of Elizabeth Tshele, was born in 1981 in Tsholotsho, Zimbabwe. She grew up in the city of Bulawayo, from which she takes part of her literary name. NoViolet is in honour of her late mother, Violet. She later moved to the US, where she studied and began her writing career.\n\nIn 2013, her debut novel We Need New Names announced her arrival as a major talent. Its sharp social observation, childlike candour, and lyrical experimentation made it both accessible and unsettling. Her Caine Prize story makes up the first chapter of this book.\n\nA decade later,Gloryconfirmed her daring imagination. Set in an allegorical animal kingdom, it transforms Zimbabwes turbulent politics into a fable of authoritarianism and resistance. Its inventive form  mixing satire, oral traditions, and digital-age idioms  reimagines how the novel can respond to todays African realities.\n\nTogether, these works have marked Bulawayo as a defining voice of her generation. She isnt afraid to stretch the form of the African novel while capturing the hopes and contradictions of our times.\n\nSince its inauguration in 2000, theCaine Prize for African Writinghas set itself a lofty goal: to identify and celebrate a new generation of African writers.\n\nWhen the first-ever prize was awarded to acclaimed Sudanese writerLeila Aboulelathat year, it signalled a shift: the new African writers were not just beholden to writing back to colonial history, they wrote from the urgency of their own moment.\n\nManypast Caine winnershave gone on to make enduring contributions to African literature.Binyavanga Wainaina,Helon Habila,Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor,Brian Chikwava,Mary Watson, among others. Their work shows how the prize has provided a platform for innovative writing that unsettles conventions and shifts the contours of the field.\n\nOn average more than 200 entries are received each year, and significantly, more women than men have won the prize. This is notable compared to the heavily male-dominatedAfrican Writers Seriesgeneration of the 1960s. These included literary powerhouses LikeChinua Achebe,Wole SoyinkaandNgg wa Thiongo.\n\nUnlike many other prizes, the Caine made a decision early on to accept entries frominternet publications. This proved prescient. Online platforms have inspired a boom in short stories. The art form has links with age-old traditions of storytelling in Africa and seems particularly suited to the pace of contemporary living.\n\nBeyond the award, the Caine Prize has hosted annual writing workshops in various African cities, helping to nurture local literary communities. Its award ceremonies have been accompanied by efforts to ensure the stories remain accessible to African readers.\n\nToday, more than a dozen African co-publishers distribute the Caine Prize anthologies. These books include each years shortlisted stories and workshop entries.\n\nFor much of its history, the Caine Prize has championed the African short story written in English, by writers based either on the continent or abroad. This has not been without controversy, especiallydebatesabout who counts as an African writer, and why the prize is based in the UK rather than Africa.\n\nIf anything, the prize has forced readers to think harder about who belongs to an African literary community, and who gets left out when boundaries are drawn too tightly. The true currency of prizes is recognition, and in this sense the Caine has often exceeded expectations by bringing visibility to writers who might not otherwise have reached global audiences.\n\nControversies endure. The prizes location in Europe, its emphasis on the short story form, andits rolein shaping global perceptions of African literature all remain points of contention.\n\nEven with that noise in the background, the Caine Prize remains the only freestanding and consistent award dedicated solely to African writing. That distinction alone has made it the preeminent platform for new African voices in the 2000s.\n\nBulawayos crowning as the best of the lot underscores both the continuity and the evolution of the prize. All the winners embody or react against African political and social contexts, at the same time addressing issues of race, identity, sexuality and historical injustices.\n\nThe Caine Prize has been an imperfect but vital incentive for a new generation of African writers and their often politically charged perspectives. It has sparked robust discourse, created opportunities, and amplified voices that might have been overlooked. It has become a cultural institution to be reckoned with and arguably the most influential global event for African literature.\n\nAnd in celebrating NoViolet Bulawayo at its 25-year mark, it affirms what many already knew: she is a generational talent, one whose work will resonate far beyond the prize itself.\n\nAssistant Professor, Harvard University\n\n",

We had seeds that had gone extinct, but now they have been revived, thanks to seed exchanges. If my crop fails due to drought or other reasons, I can always get the seed from other farmers, he said.\n\nA farmer shows her agricultural products at a seed and food festival in Harare, Zimbabwe, Sept. 20, 2025.(Xinhua/Tafara Mugwara)\n\nChinyoka added that smallholder farmers should not be at the periphery of food production, but rather be at the forefront to effectively safeguard food security.\n\nArchbold Sasa, a lecturer in the Department of Crop Science at the Marondera University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology in Zimbabwe, said smallholder farmers are key to promoting food security and resilience.\n\nSmallholder farmers play a crucial role in storing some seed varieties because they keep producing them from time to time, so that we dont lose that genetic material as a country. Its sort of a seed bank, he said. Some crops are being neglected, and people are not producing them anymore, but we tend to find those seeds in smallholder farmers.\n\nIn addition to indigenous grains, farmers are encouraged to adopt indigenous vegetables, including blackjack, pigweed, okra, and pumpkin leaves, due to their high nutritional value and adaptation to local climates.\n\nWe are doing seed exchange from one district to another so that people will have a diversity of these indigenous vegetables to promote their nutrition, resulting in improved health, said Sasa.\n\n",

EBITDA rose 139.9% to ZWG100.9 million, while profit before tax increased 154% to ZWG51.6 million. Net profit after tax more than doubled to ZWG202.4 million from ZWG90.4 million, aided by a ZWG150.7 million income tax credit.\n\nDespite the topline growth, margins came under pressure. The EBITDA margin slipped to 18.5% from 25.6%, while the net profit margin declined to 37.1% from 54.9%, largely due to higher operating costs and the one-off tax credit. Operating expenses rose 237% year-on-year.\n\nOn the balance sheet, total assets fell 10.3% to ZWG1.35 billion, mainly reflecting a reduction in vehicles and equipment. Retained earnings grew 66.3% to ZWG507.7 million, while borrowings eased 3% to ZWG144.8 million. However, finance costs spiked nearly 395% in the wake of elevated interest rates.\n\nLiquidity also weakened during the period. Cash holdings dropped 65.5% to ZWG14.5 million, with operating activities posting a net outflow of ZWG5.8 million compared to an inflow of ZWG57.5 million last year. Financing outflows of ZWG32.6 million were recorded, linked to debt repayments, leases, and fleet investment.\n\nBasic earnings per share rose 153.6% to 194.53 cents, while headline EPS more than doubled to 194.43 cents.\n\nManagement said the performance reflects the benefits of its regional growth strategy but cautioned that cost pressures and working capital constraints remain significant challenges as the company prepares for fleet expansion ahead of the 2026 tobacco season.\n\n",

Over the years, however, some residents had occupied land earmarked for public institutions, sparking resistance whenever development was attempted.\n\nLocal councillor Tafadzwa Kambarami welcomed the resolution, calling it a win for both residents and progress.\n\nWe are happy that the developer understood our concerns despite us having lost court cases. What we want is development and residents have to comply. Everyone is happy because there will be no evictions. We want sanity. We want development and Im happy that residents have accepted what the developer has brought on the table. Development should start right away, he said.\n\nWith the long-standing dispute now settled, construction in Spitzkop is finally set to move forward.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nNewly appointed Zanu PF Treasurer General Patrick Chinamasa has dismissed Advocate Thabani Mpofus recent criticism of President Emmerson Mnangagwas Politburo reshuffle as baseless and without substance, labelling it a misleading interpretation.\n\nMnangagwa made changes to the Politburo structure last month in a move that political analysts believe is strategically aimed at curtailing his deputy, Retired General Constantino Chiwengas, aspirations to succeed him.\n\nAmong the changes, Mnangagwa demoted Obert Mpofu from the influential position of Secretary General to the less prominent role of Secretary for Information Communication Technology (ICT).\n\nMpofu is reported to be an ally of Vice President Constantino Chiwenga and is alleged to have had knowledge of the source of the corruption dossier Chiwenga tabled in the last Zanu PF Politburo meeting in Harare.\n\nThe dossier allegedly named controversial business tycoons Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Wicknell Chivayo, Paul Tungwarara and Delish Nguwaya.\n\nJacob Mudenda, Speaker of the National Assembly, replaced Mpofu as Secretary-General, while Chinamasa himself was shifted from Legal Affairs Secretary to the role of Treasurer General of the party.\n\nAdvocate Mpofu subsequently took to social media, alleging that Mnangagwa had violated the partys constitution with the changes he had made.\n\nThe letter from Chris Mutsvangwa purporting to announce changes to the ZANU PF Politburo is invalid. It claims the decision to relieve Obert Mpofu of his office as ZANU PF Secretary-General was taken under Article 9, sections 65 and 67, Mpofu, the lawyer, stated.\n\nHowever, Chinamasa responded to Mpofus claims yesterday blow by blow.\n\nThis claim is a classic case of mala fides interpretation. The relevant provisions of the Zanu-PF Constitution clearly stipulate the President and First Secretarys authority over the Politburo, Chinamasa wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday.\n\nHe said: Article 9, Section 65 (2022 Constitution) explicitly states:\n\nThe Politburo shall be appointed by the President and First Secretary under Section 67\n\nSection 67 reinforces this by stating that:\n\nImmediately after the election of the President and First Secretary and Members of the Central Committee, the President and First Secretary of the Party shall appoint from the newly elected Central Committee, two (2) Vice-Presidents and Second Secretaries, the National Chairman, the Heads of Departments of the Politburo, the Committee Members of the Politburo and the Deputies to the Heads of Departments.\n\nThis language is categorical and unambiguous. The authority vests in the President and First Secretary  not in any collective, committee, or ancillary structure. Thus, any personnel changes announced are lawfully anchored in the Presidents prerogative. To argue otherwise is to deliberately distort the plain meaning of the text.\n\nAdvocate Mpofu also argued that Article 9 of the Zanu-PF Constitution does not empower Mnangagwa to reassign office holders outside of the partys elective congress.\n\nArticle 9 concerns Politburo functions generally and does not confer authority for the First Secretary to reassign office-holders, Mpofu, the lawyer, contended.\n\nIn response, Chinamasa urged Mpofu to have a look at himself and understand the Zanu-PFs Constitution in its entirety.\n\nThis assertion demonstrates either wilful blindness or a blatant disregard of the Constitutions architecture.\n\nWhile Article 9 indeed outlines the functions of the Politburo, Section 65 therein is not a functional clause  it is a structural clause explicitly tying the Politburos composition to Presidential appointment powers. It must be read in pari materia with Section 67, which sets out the scope of such appointments.\n\nChinamasa further dismissed Mpofus interpretation of the Zanu-PF Constitution, arguing that it misrepresented the powers bestowed upon the President and First Secretary. He stated that Mpofus arguments were a bit of a reach, and that Mpofu was getting ahead of himself.\n\nChinamasa pointed out that the Constitution explicitly allows for the reassignment and removal of department heads, and that Mpofus reading of Sections 65 and 67 pertained to the Politburo itself, rather than subordinate roles.\n\nHe accused Mpofu of missing the mark completely, saying that Mpofus arguments have no real basis in the documented and agreed-upon Constitution.\n\n",
