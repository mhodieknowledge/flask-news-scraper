            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nLOCAL authorities councillors must shun political posturing once elected and sworn into office, Local Government Minister Daniel Garwe has said.\n\nGarwe was addressing local authorities officials (Mayors and Town Clerks) from the countrys 92 local authorities during the 2024 performance outcomes feedback workshop in Harare last Thursday.\n\nLocal authorities and the ministry must have a relationship-based approach.Local authorities and the Local Government ministry (which represents the central government) are all appointed by one authority. We are all accountable to the President of the Republic in our various workstations.\n\nSo, we must be able to find each other. I told the Mayor of Bulawayo (David Coltart) last week that we have come here not to fight, but to build bridges, Garwe said.\n\nHe revealed that some people were expecting fights in their minds, which was not the mission.\n\nSo, we said there are some ways to build bridges. All these cities, the 32 urban councils, are all ours.\n\nThe 60 rural councils are all ours. There is no person who exists in this kind that doesnt belong to a vote. So, this is how important local authorities are to everybody.\n\nWe do not want to be focusing on fault finding. We want to be focusing on correcting the areas where we are not doing well. We should be able to be corrected as well, he told the officials.\n\nResults for the local authorities performance released showed that most of them had failed to reach their targets for the year.\n\nLet us take responsibility whenever there is something that we have done correctly. There is no one under the sun who does not make a mistake, nobody.\n\nAll of us make mistakes, but the ability to be able to sit down and diagnose the problem and provide the cure is what makes us different from the rest of the people.\n\nGarwe urged the local authorities bosses to tackle challenges without looking at which party one belonged to.\n\nWe must attend ourselves into challenges. In here, we do not have councillors belonging to political parties. We have councillors belonging to government.\n\nWe are all accountable to government, we are all accountable to this existence. So we leave behind all this political culture behaviour the moment we are sworn into offices.\n\nFurther, he said, Right now, there are no any chances. We do not need to be mudslinging. We do need to speak to each other, working together to turn around the fortunes of our local authorities.\n\nThe minister also urged council officials and councillors to change their mindset and forget about past fights.\n\nThe local authorities in central government, officials from the minister of Local Government, change your mindset in a positive attitude towards our local authorities.\n\nWe humbly request you to leave positive attitude towards central government.\n\nWe are one government with one vision. We want to turn- around the local governance and avoid focus on what happened in the past, said Garwe, adding What is done is done. Let us focus on the future.\n\nMost local authorities have not done well in the service provision in the last years, mainly due to political fights and corruption, prompting government to privatise most of the services especially in Harare.\n\n",

We were given a directive that we must implement as we leave this room.\n\nIn every local authority we must, with immediate effect, deal with the issues of littering. I know we need support of Home Affairs and ZRP but with the resources that we have with the municipal police, we should be able to enforce our by-laws and make sure that people clean wherever they are operating, said Garwe.\n\nSome major cities in Zimbabwe have been struggling to manage refuse collection and maintain a semblance of cleanliness.\n\nHarare has become the epitome of this struggle, with garbage piling up in residential areas such as Mbare.\n\nDespite the involvement of a private company, Geo Pomona, in handling garbage collection in Harare, council has failed to eliminate the waste problem in the city.\n\n",
