            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nTHE tragic death of Blessed Believe Juruvenge (30), who recently died in police custody, has left his pregnant wife facing an uncertain future alone.\n\nThe now deceaseds wife Mercy Madenyika, is distraught, hopeless and drained, particularly having to face a daunting task of motherhood as a young widow.\n\nNearly two weeks since the brutal assault allegedly carried out by Constable Prince Ndavambi, the officer who still remains on the run, Madenyika is expecting to give birth to a fatherless baby had it not been of police brutality that claimed the life of a responsible would-be dad.\n\nThe couple, which resided in the Damafalls area of Ruwa, ran a tuckshop, and was preparing for their first child, but now Madenyika is left grappling with both loss of her husband and the daunting reality of motherhood without her partner.\n\nI cant believe my husband is gone before he could even hold our baby. I never thought I would have to face this alone, especially with a child on the way, a teary Madenyika told NewZimbabwe.com, her voice trembling with grief.\n\nHer anguish is compounded by the financial burden of a funeral that is yet to be done.\n\nI dont know how I will manage, she said, her eyes filled with tears.\n\nWe were supposed to build a life together, and now it feels like everything has been taken away from me.\n\nMadenyika hopes that justice will be served with the weight of her loss heavy on her shoulders.\n\nIf the law doesnt take its course, we are pleading to citizens of Zimbabwe to help us find something to haunt the ones who took away his life, said Madenyika.\n\nElipa Jimu, the now deceaseds mother, is at pains to accept reality that her son is no more. Worse still, she cannot imagine the burden of taking care of her widowed daughter-in-law and her unborn child.\n\nI am in pain over my sons death; him and Melisa were the ones taking care of me.\n\nHe left a pregnant wife. I dont even know how I am going to take care of her. The preparation for the baby has not been bought yet. There even is no money for the funeral. I dont know where I am going to even get it. My son was supposed to bury me first, but it is me who is burying him, lamented Jimu\n\nTaurayi Chiedziso, a neighbour and friend, voiced his frustration over the tragedy.\n\nThis matter would have been resolved without even involving the police because we are neighbours, we are a community.\n\nNow, Blessed has died leaving behind his wife who is also pregnant. That child will grow without a father, its so heartbreaking, said Chiedziso.\n\n",

attention of everyone following his last minute inclusion in the squad, was one of the unused substitutes during Saturdays match.He (Nathan) will get his turn, one of my goals is to make sure that at least every player gets a moment to play.I didnt think it was the right time for me to play him, thats why I didnt put him on, said Marange.Mutasa was a last minute inclusion in the Warriors COSAFA

Upon detention, the now deceased was told by Ndavambi that he would return home in a coffin, a source told NewZimbabwe.com.The now deceaseds sister, Mellisa Manyepa was also victimised by assailant on the same day her brother was taken into custody. Her crime was allegedly harbouring a person on polices wanted list.Manyepa narrated events of the fateful day to NewZimbabwe.com.On 28 May I was informed about my brothers death and I was shown his body.We reported the matter to Police General Headquarters and Commissioner Paul Nyathi called Ruwa Police Station ordering the Officer-In-Charge to have Ndavambi arrested. But until now Ndavambi hasnt been arrested yet he always posts statuses on his WhatsApp.When I try to call him his phone says the number is not available meaning that he blocked my calls, said Manyepa.In a statement, the ZRP spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi said Ndavambi will face justice for his deeds.Sadly, Constable Ndavambi disappeared as his arrest was imminent. He is currently on the run. Efforts to arrest him are underway for the law to take its course without fear or favour.The Commissioner-General of Police, Stephen Mutamba has made it clear that the law is the law and that no one will sweep this disturbing case under the carpet, police sais in the statement.Police will ensure that the suspect, Prince Ndavambis docket is swiftly concluded and presented to the court for prosecution. We are currently appealing for information which may lead to his location and subsequent arrest.He will face the full wrath of the law. The exact charge to be faced by Prince Ndavambi will be determined by the courts based on the police inquiry and full post-mortem results.Futhermore, the ZRP has filed two separate autopsies and have informed the deceaseds family to conduct theirs if not satisfied.Police has also noted with concern, conflicting reports on the post-mortem results. For the record, two post-mortem examinations have been conducted by Pathologist Doctor Guillen and Doctor Jabangwe. The Juruvenges family is still free to engage another independent pathologist of their own choice in line with the countrys laws, said Nyathi.As the investigations continue, the family is left in a limbo regarding Juruvenges final burial date.We are going to wait for the results before we bury him, though some family members are of the opinion we should sign the burial order. But if we sign, the matter will lose value and justice might delay, Manyepa told this publication.The family has since engaged human right lawyers to assist in the unfolding matter.\n\nConstable Prince Ndavambi is reported to have assaulted Believe Blessed Jaravange (30) at Ruwa Police Station until he died.\n\nThe incident followed Juruvenges arrest on May 27, 2025, following an altercation with a fellow resident, Mwazha/Maphosa, who reported him for assault and theft.

Lungelo Ndhlovu/Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nAround Hwange, last years drought dried up the boreholes and waterholes, threatening wildlife in the park and depriving people in Mabale of drinking water.\n\nAnd although rainfall from December to February this year was normal or above, fallout from the last drought persists.\n\nDespite this years rains, we had to close one of our boreholes, Mudima said, explaining how water table levels were still very low.\n\nBecause there are too many people in my village and not enough boreholes, people walk 5 km to a neighbouring village with a solar borehole, she said, referring to a borehole pumped by solar power.\n\nFaced with these recurrent water crises, people in Hwange have started building rainwater tanks, helped by the Soft Foot Alliance, a community-based trust registered in Zimbabwe.\n\nConstance Ndaba, 75, who lives in Masikili Village 2, said the tank harvesting system saves her walking 2 km to the next village.\n\nFor a family of seven, drinking water from the rainwater tank lasts us up to three months. Im not sure when I last went to fetch water from a borehole.\n\nConstance Ndaba poses next to a giant rainwater harvesting jar at her home in Masikili Village 2. The jar helps her family cope with water shortages when nearby boreholes and rivers run dry. 7 May 2025. Lungelo Ndhlovu/Thomson Reuters Foundation\n\nRainwater is collected in giant jars made by moulding canvas and chicken wire around sand. A thin cement plaster fixes the form, then the inside is plastered. The jars are placed near house walls to collect run-off from the roof.\n\nTheir simplicity makes for an easy upkeep  a key benefit in remote communities.\n\nWe use chicken wire, plain wire, four bags of cement and 24 buckets of river sand which is locally available. To build the jar tank takes four days and it can collect up to five drums of water, which can last up to three months, said Austin Nkomo, one of the builders of jar tanks based in Hwange.\n\nMsungwe Sithole, a creative facilitator at the Soft Foot Alliance, said the project aimed to build resilience to drought and help people live sustainably in a depleted landscape.\n\nErratic rains are not the only reason for water scarcity, said Chipo Mpofu-Zuze, manager for the Environmental Management Agency in the Matabeleland North province.\n\nMpofu-Zuze said deforestation, crop-growing along streams, poor farming methods, alien species invading wetlands and the release of effluent into local waters were also responsible.\n\nSimba Guzha, regional project manager with Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) Zimbabwe, trains farmers to adapt to the increasingly hot and dry conditions.\n\nVSO is working with smallholders in the eastern provinces to improve productivity while safeguarding the environment  helping them stay safe from any shock drops in aid.\n\nMost of the farmers who have been trained on infiltration pits, earth dams, and rooftop water harvesting systems are now using these systems even without any foreign support, he said.\n\n",

He struck three centuries in five first-class games at an average of 72.66, while Senokwane, 28, was a significant run scorer in the Cricket South Africa 4-day competition.\n\nThe 27-year-old Yusuf finished the domestic season with a bowling average of 22.39.\n\nThe squad also sees the recall of batsman Zubayr Hamza, who last played a test against New Zealand in early 2024.\n\nMarco Jansen, Aiden Markram, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton and Tristan Stubbs will be rested for the Zimbabwe trip while the fast-bowling trio of Nandre Burger, Gerald Coetzee and Lizaad Williams were not considered for selection because of fitness issues.\n\nWeve opted to rest some players to manage their workload ahead of a busy season, said Conrad at a virtual press conference, but for the others this tour provides the ideal platform to expose them to the demands of Test cricket and see how they respond.\n\nSouth Africa, who meet Australia in the World Test Championship final at Lords starting on Wednesday, take on Zimbabwe in their first test at the Queens Club from 28 June-2 July with the second at the same venue from July 6-10.\n\nSquad:\n\nTemba Bavuma (captain), David Bedingham, Matthew Breetzke, Dewald Brevis, Corbin Bosch, Tony de Zorzi, Zubayr Hamza, Keshav Maharaj, Kwena Maphaka, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Lhuan-dre Pretorius, Lesego Senokwane, Prenelan Subrayen, Kyle Verreynne, Codi Yusuf.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nHARARE waste collection crisis will soon be over as Geo Pomona Waste Sorting Plant, vehicles and equipment were commissioned by President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Harare this Thursday.\n\nAddressing government officials, investors and Zanu PF supporters at the Geo Pomona waste management dump site in Borrowdale, President Mnangagwa warned Zimbabweans to desist from illegal dumping.\n\nAs we roll out the modern waste collection system, I urge all of us Zimbabweans to desist from illegal dumping.\n\nLet us embrace a culture of responsible waste disposal, recycling, and environmental stewardship in order to realise our goal of a clean, safe, and healthy environment, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe said the waste collection crisis, particularly in the capital city of Harare has had dire consequences ranging from environmental degradation to public health risks, among other negative impacts.\n\nWe have seen outbreaks of diseases, a situation that is wholly unacceptable. Such conditions must become a thing of the past. The plant and the trucks we are commissioning today mark a turning point in our quest towards efficiency in wasteanagement.\n\nTherefore, in line with Vision 2030, my government will continue to prioritize the creation of clean, safe and modern urban environments, which are engines of economic growth. I am, therefore, pleased with the acquisition and deployment of 45 refuse trucks and 100 skip bins by Geo Pomona, with more on the way to come.\n\nCongratulations, Pomona. Through the pages of this equipment, we must see the waste management system being capacitated to efficiently and consistently collect waste across all parts of Harare, Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe also urged all the players in all towns and cities to take a leaf from such initiatives towards improving waste management in the country.\n\nReferring to the Geo Pomona waste sorting plant, the President described it as a beacon of nations potential.\n\nThe facility is a beacon of our national potential. It represents how infrastructure, when aligned to a national vision, can transform lives, protect the environment, and drive economic growth. It is important to note that waste is not just waste.\n\nWaste is actually a resource. With this modern sorting facility, recyclable materials can be recovered, repurposed, and reintegrated into the economy, he said.\n\nMnangagwa added that waste sorting plant is a critical enabler of the Waste to Energy Project, which will soon contribute between 16 and 22 megawatts of electricity to the national grid.\n\nThis is a solution that exemplifies innovation and modernisation.\n\nHe acknowledged the management and the staff of Geo- Pomona waste management led by its CEO Delish Nguwaya for their clarity of role, not only towards a greener planet but also advancing the realisation of national development goals.\n\nYour accomplishments thus far are applauded and inspirational to others in our region and continent. However, the responsibility of waste management does not lie with Geo Pomona alone. It is the duty of every Zimbabwean.\n\nThe event coincided with the World Environment Day celebrations Thursday as Zimbabweans joined the rest of the world in celebrating their shared mission of protecting the environment for the present and future generations.\n\nThe Geo Pomona Waste Management, (Private) Limited is a product of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) venture involving the Harare City Council.\n\n",
