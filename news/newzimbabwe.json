After a moment, we heard screams from the toilet calling for help, and we quickly rushed there only to find that the whole toilet had collapsed, trapping the three kids inside the pit under over 90 bricks that had fallen on them.\n\nWe rushed them to the hospital, and two were declared dead upon arrival. My son Prosper tried to soldier on after admission, but he also left us at 3 PM.\n\nWhat really affected them were the bricks falling on them and the water and waste, which contains carbon. Its not normal to inhale it, so we can say the water was their biggest detriment, said Chigwegwe.\n\nThe toilet was said to be almost full of waste, but appeared functional and in good condition.\n\nChigwegwe, a miner, is convinced that there was an evil hand behind the death of his children, given how the events unfolded.\n\nLucy Sixpence, a relative, is convinced there was foul play.\n\nIts still shocking for us, and we have never heard of anything like this before. Believe me, something transpired in this whole situation because this toilet didnt have any issues, she said.\n\nProsper and Tawanashe were laid to rest on Sunday in Norton, while the three-year-old was taken to her resting place in Buhera.\n\n",

We interviewed her son, who said her mother had gone to work.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, we phoned her and informed her of the charges she was facing and she told me that she was not in Harare. Actually, when we initially called her to the police station, she did not cooperate and she supplied a false address.\n\nIf granted bail, she is likely to abscond and interfere with witnesses. The case is still under investigation, I need to record detailed witness statements from the outstanding witnesses, he told the court.\n\nAccording to the State, Mabvirakure received US$15,200 on March 3 2025, which she was supposed to surrender to Brickforce Hardware Company as payment for utensils supplied to the company.\n\nMabvirakure allegedly diverted all the money to her personal use.\n\nAccording to the court papers, Mabvirakure received US$8,00,0 which was deposited in her account and later on received US$7,200 on two different occasions in the presence of witnesses who are yet to record their statements.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nExpelled Zanu-PF Central Committee member and war veteran, Blessed Geza,resurfaced on Tuesday night, unleashing a scathing attack on Zimbabwes Chief Justice Luke Malaba, ordering him to release jailed journalist Blessed Mhlanga.\n\nMhlanga was arrested after Heart and Soul Television (HSTV), which he heads, exclusively broadcast Gezas explosive press briefings. In these briefings, the war veteran called for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to step down, citing a litany of reasons, chief among them corruption, nepotism, and tribalism.\n\nGezain an online addressdemandedMhlangas immediate release from gaol.\n\nWe are deeply concerned by the arrest of journalist Blessed Mhlanga. We see this as a blatant attempt to muzzle democratic voices. We demand the unconditional and immediate release of Mhlanga, he declared.\n\nMhlanga has been charged under Section 164 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23, with the state alleging that he transmitted a message with intent to incite public violence. This message stemmed from Gezas press briefing in which he cautioned police boss Stephen Mutamba against deploying officers to quell potential protests against Mnangagwa.\n\nGeza had warned Mutamba that if the police were to beat or shoot protesters, the citizens would take matters into their own hands in their respective communities.\n\nPreviously, the police, who had twice invited Mhlanga for questioning, seemed to be clutching at straws, unable to find a case against him. They later issued a statement claiming they were searching for Mhlanga, who then handed himself in, only to be immediately detained and appear before the Harare Magistrates Courts, where he was ultimately denied bail.\n\nMhlanga appealed against the bail denial at the High Court, and the court has reserved its judgment.\n\nGeza came out all guns blazing, warning Chief Justice Luke Malaba that he would have only himself to blame for keeping Mhlanga locked up.\n\nThe judiciary  we are warning you, we have been watching you, and this has been going on for a long time. Dont be used as a puppet by Mnangagwa to violate peoples rights, Geza stated.\n\nHe added: We fought for the right to free speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of association.\n\nGeza warned Justice Malaba that the abuse of the judiciary has become a depressing tradition, whereby those who speak out against the government are labelled as criminals.\n\nThis didnt begin with Mhlanga. You have jailed Timba, Chibaya, Sikhala, and countless others. So where are people supposed to turn? People believe that if they go to the judiciary, they will find justice. Chief Justice Malaba, please get your house in order, or we will be coming after you very soon, he fumed.\n\nGezas sentiments regarding the judiciary echo those of Alpha Media Holdings owner Trevor Ncube, who told the press at the Magistrates Court a few weeks ago that Mnangagwa is using the courts to punish dissent. Ncube challenged Mnangagwa to arrest him, as he owns HSTV, which transmitted the message deemed to be inciting public violence.\n\nMhlangas arrest has been widely condemned by numerous media freedom advocacy groups at local, regional, and international levels.\n\nHeis currently detained at Harare Remand Prison, and his bail application appeal awaits a ruling from Justice Gibson Mandaza.\n\n",

Which one would you go with?\n\nLedwaba responded by saying he wanted to know who Ndlovu was talking about before he responded since he wanted to give his answer based on facts. Ndlovu then responded by mentioning Alakine.\n\nThe artist then paid a surprise visit to the studios for a face-to-face conversation with the hosts, questioning what right they had to discuss his girlfriend the way they did.\n\nWhat downgrade? What gives you the right to sit here and discuss another mans relationship and then have an opinion that they are a downgrade?\n\nWhat are you teaching these kids here? That if youre a girl that looks like Gigi in the public perception, you are a downgrade compared to a girl that looks like Luthando?, Alakine asked.\n\nPiano Pulseis a popular podcast focused on amapiano culture, hosted by popular TikTok content creators, Ledwaba, Munaka Muthambi and artist manager, Ndlovu.\n\nThe podcast is part of MacGs podcast network, which features various shows discussing different topics. It is known for its lively discussions and provocative comments about amapiano artists.\n\nFans took to social media to react to the drama, with some praising Alakine for standing up for his girlfriend, while others criticised the hosts for overstepping their bounds.\n\nX user @uMNtuNgabantu commented: @ReasonHD good thing you went to that pod to face them as a man instead of gossiping through a live video, I respect you more.
