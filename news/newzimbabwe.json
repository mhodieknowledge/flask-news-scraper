If you are receiving this video, it means that we have been intercepted and have been abducted by the state of apartheid Israel, he said. I call you to request our government to exert pressure for my immediate release.\n\nThe South African group of the flotilla has condemned the interception of its vessels by Israeli occupation forces in international waters, describing the attack as a deliberate attempt to block humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nDelegates aboard the flotilla, which included South African civilians, were reportedly detained and faced drone and water cannon attacks.\n\nIn a statement, the Global Sumud Flotilla (GDF) confirmed that the Israeli occupation forces ambushed the Global Sumud Flotilla in international waters, detaining some of the delegates and attacking the vessels with drones and water cannons.\n\nThese actions represent yet another attempt to silence voices of solidarity and to prevent even the smallest lifeline of relief from reaching Gaza. This is illegal under international law, the GDF said in a statement.\n\nThe organisation emphasised that the flotillas mission was purely humanitarian and peaceful.\n\nThe GSF was carrying civilians committed to drawing attention to the devastating conditions faced by Palestinians. Their mission is peaceful. Their objective is humanitarian. Their interception exposes once more the reality that Gaza is held under siege not only by walls and checkpoints, but by warships, drones, and policies of isolation.\n\nThe GSF called on the South African government to act immediately to ensure the safe return of its citizens.\n\nThe Global Sumud Flotilla  RSA demands the immediate and unconditional release of all the delegates with full access to their lawyers, and for Israel to respect all international laws and measures governing the protection of civilians and humanitarian missions, the unhindered delivery of the humanitarian aid, and the lifting of the siege that continues to strangle Gaza, they said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chrispin Phiri, spokesperson for the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco), emphasised South Africas call for restraint and adherence to international law.\n\nSouth Africa wishes to reiterate, in the strongest terms, its call for all actors to adhere strictly to international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and relevant international humanitarian law principles, he said.\n\nPhiri stressed that the safety and security of the flotillas participants, includingSouth African citizens, are of paramount importance.\n\nThe safety, security, and physical integrity of all unarmed participants aboard the Flotilla, including South African citizens, are of paramount importance, he added.\n\nHe warned that any military engagement or forceful detention of the vessels in international waters would constitute a serious breach of international norms. Phirifurther highlighted the peaceful and humanitarian mission of theflotilla.\n\nIt must be underscored that the Flotilla is a civilian-led initiative, embarked upon a peaceful and humanitarian mission. Its participants aim to draw attention to the severe and urgent humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people in Gaza and to deliver vital aid to alleviate the widespread suffering, Phiri said.\n\nOther South Africans who are part of the mission include Fatima Hendricks, Zaheera Soomar, Zukisa Wanner, Reaaz Moola, Bashera Soomar and Carolyn Shelver.\n\nFormer Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi shared his support of Mandela. \n\nMandla Mandela! Selfless brave soul. You make us eternally proud Madiba. Strength to the Sumud Flotilla, Free Palestine, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "The Conversation\n\nZimbabwean writerNoViolet Bulawayohas beenhonouredas Africas best short story writer after winning theBest of Caine Award. The special recognition marks 25 years of the annualCaine Prize for African Writing.\n\nAn esteemed panel of judges unanimously selected Bulawayo as the standout winner of the 25 stories awarded the prize so far. Her short story,Hitting Budapest, won the prize in 2011. She has gone on to publish two acclaimed novels,We Need New NamesandGlory. Both were shortlisted for the Booker Prize.\n\nFor me as ascholarof African literary cultures, Bulawayos recognition by the judges feels like a generational milestone. Hitting Budapest follows a band of children wandering in a decaying urban landscape in search of food. Their journey, told through a fractured, childlike voice, captures both the immediacy of play and the stark realities of deprivation.\n\nThe storys unsettling blend of innocence and brutality provoked livelydebatewhen it appeared. It raised questions about the aesthetics of the African literature the prize sought to celebrate. About whether its power lived in its inventive narration and perspective, or whether it leaned too easily into global appetites for African suffering and spectacle.\n\nBut there was never any doubt about Bulawayos singular talent. Shes today known for her virtuoso ability with language and her sharp eye for the textures of African life.\n\nNoViolet Bulawayo, the pen name of Elizabeth Tshele, was born in 1981 in Tsholotsho, Zimbabwe. She grew up in the city of Bulawayo, from which she takes part of her literary name. NoViolet is in honour of her late mother, Violet. She later moved to the US, where she studied and began her writing career.\n\nIn 2013, her debut novel We Need New Names announced her arrival as a major talent. Its sharp social observation, childlike candour, and lyrical experimentation made it both accessible and unsettling. Her Caine Prize story makes up the first chapter of this book.\n\nA decade later,Gloryconfirmed her daring imagination. Set in an allegorical animal kingdom, it transforms Zimbabwes turbulent politics into a fable of authoritarianism and resistance. Its inventive form  mixing satire, oral traditions, and digital-age idioms  reimagines how the novel can respond to todays African realities.\n\nTogether, these works have marked Bulawayo as a defining voice of her generation. She isnt afraid to stretch the form of the African novel while capturing the hopes and contradictions of our times.\n\nSince its inauguration in 2000, theCaine Prize for African Writinghas set itself a lofty goal: to identify and celebrate a new generation of African writers.\n\nWhen the first-ever prize was awarded to acclaimed Sudanese writerLeila Aboulelathat year, it signalled a shift: the new African writers were not just beholden to writing back to colonial history, they wrote from the urgency of their own moment.\n\nManypast Caine winnershave gone on to make enduring contributions to African literature.Binyavanga Wainaina,Helon Habila,Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor,Brian Chikwava,Mary Watson, among others. Their work shows how the prize has provided a platform for innovative writing that unsettles conventions and shifts the contours of the field.\n\nOn average more than 200 entries are received each year, and significantly, more women than men have won the prize. This is notable compared to the heavily male-dominatedAfrican Writers Seriesgeneration of the 1960s. These included literary powerhouses LikeChinua Achebe,Wole SoyinkaandNgg wa Thiongo.\n\nUnlike many other prizes, the Caine made a decision early on to accept entries frominternet publications. This proved prescient. Online platforms have inspired a boom in short stories. The art form has links with age-old traditions of storytelling in Africa and seems particularly suited to the pace of contemporary living.\n\nBeyond the award, the Caine Prize has hosted annual writing workshops in various African cities, helping to nurture local literary communities. Its award ceremonies have been accompanied by efforts to ensure the stories remain accessible to African readers.\n\nToday, more than a dozen African co-publishers distribute the Caine Prize anthologies. These books include each years shortlisted stories and workshop entries.\n\nFor much of its history, the Caine Prize has championed the African short story written in English, by writers based either on the continent or abroad. This has not been without controversy, especiallydebatesabout who counts as an African writer, and why the prize is based in the UK rather than Africa.\n\nIf anything, the prize has forced readers to think harder about who belongs to an African literary community, and who gets left out when boundaries are drawn too tightly. The true currency of prizes is recognition, and in this sense the Caine has often exceeded expectations by bringing visibility to writers who might not otherwise have reached global audiences.\n\nControversies endure. The prizes location in Europe, its emphasis on the short story form, andits rolein shaping global perceptions of African literature all remain points of contention.\n\nEven with that noise in the background, the Caine Prize remains the only freestanding and consistent award dedicated solely to African writing. That distinction alone has made it the preeminent platform for new African voices in the 2000s.\n\nBulawayos crowning as the best of the lot underscores both the continuity and the evolution of the prize. All the winners embody or react against African political and social contexts, at the same time addressing issues of race, identity, sexuality and historical injustices.\n\nThe Caine Prize has been an imperfect but vital incentive for a new generation of African writers and their often politically charged perspectives. It has sparked robust discourse, created opportunities, and amplified voices that might have been overlooked. It has become a cultural institution to be reckoned with and arguably the most influential global event for African literature.\n\nAnd in celebrating NoViolet Bulawayo at its 25-year mark, it affirms what many already knew: she is a generational talent, one whose work will resonate far beyond the prize itself.\n\nAssistant Professor, Harvard University\n\n",
