            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE trial of former Agriculture Deputy Minister Douglas Karoro took a new twist on Friday with the investigating officer contradicting the States case.\n\nKaroro is accused of fraud, which allegedly led to 700 bags of fertilizers meant for beneficiaries in Mbire under the Presidential Input Scheme being taken from the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) Mushumbi depot.Karoro has denied the allegations saying he is a political victim, denying ever conniving with anyone or ever visiting the GMB Mushumbi depot where the fertilizers were allegedly taken.Chief Inspector Violet Chikuni, who investigated the matter told Regional Magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa that there was no misrepresentation that was made to GMB Mushumbi.Instead, she said, misrepresentation was made to GMB Aspindale where alleged fake Compound D fertilisers were allegedly swapped with Ammonium Nitrate, which was then taken back to GMB Mushumbi.This was a direct contradiction to the States case that had been presented and argued from the onset that the alleged misrepresentation was made to GMB Mushumbi resulting in 700 bags of fertilisers being siphoned.The defence led by Admire Rubaya showed her the charge sheet which was being used in court against the former parliamentarian and three others and she confirmed there was no allegation that misrepresentation happened at GMB Aspindale or that fake fertilisers were used to conduct the alleged swap.There was no misrepresentation at Mushumbi. Misrepresentation happened at GMB Aspindale where fake fertilisers were swapped for AN, she said.Chikuni claimed Karoro sold the fertilizers and received US$10,000 for his own use. She however conceded that there was no evidence of Karoro communicating or transacting with the alleged buyer of fertilizers.Cornered by the defence, she conceded she ought to have obtained call records and triangulation reports for the alleged communication with the buyer and his people in Mushumbi.She, further, found it difficult to prove the sale after the defence asked her to provide evidence that money exchanged hands to which she responded saying there was no documentary evidence.Chikuni further claimed Karoro phoned officials at GMB Aspindale to have them release the AN fertilizer in exchange of Compound D as a cover up to the allegations.She was asked to provide call history between Karoro and GMB officials for the alleged phone calls which she did not have.The defence said her lack of evidence before the court shows that she was being used and misused by Karoros political rivals Now Gumbo and Takesure Chikwamba, who were identified in open court by Rubaya as having proceeded to court to ensure that she tows the line.The two, Gumbo and Chikwamba, who are Zanu PF District Coordinating Committee chairman and security secretary respectively, were seated in court when they were blasted for fabricating the case against Karoro and contaminating evidence by conducting their parallel investigations which include getting documents at GMB Mushumbi.The defence said Chikuni launched her investigation based on contaminated evidence given to her by Karoros foes in Mushumbi.This came after she told the court that she got to know about the allegations through an informer whom she could not name.The top cop said she was prepared to lose the case than divulge the informers name.She alleged that the informer was a GMB Mushumbi employee resulting in the defence arguing that she investigated the matter taking evidence from a poisoned well.It was put to her that there was nothing for her to hide as Chikwamba told the court in the previous session that he was the one who took the report to the police.The matter continues on August 5.\n\nKaroro is accused of fraud, which allegedly led to 700 bags of fertilizers meant for beneficiaries in Mbire under the Presidential Input Scheme being taken from the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) Mushumbi depot.\n\nKaroro has denied the allegations saying he is a political victim, denying ever conniving with anyone or ever visiting the GMB Mushumbi depot where the fertilizers were allegedly taken.Chief Inspector Violet Chikuni, who investigated the matter told Regional Magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa that there was no misrepresentation that was made to GMB Mushumbi.Instead, she said, misrepresentation was made to GMB Aspindale where alleged fake Compound D fertilisers were allegedly swapped with Ammonium Nitrate, which was then taken back to GMB Mushumbi.This was a direct contradiction to the States case that had been presented and argued from the onset that the alleged misrepresentation was made to GMB Mushumbi resulting in 700 bags of fertilisers being siphoned.The defence led by Admire Rubaya showed her the charge sheet which was being used in court against the former parliamentarian and three others and she confirmed there was no allegation that misrepresentation happened at GMB Aspindale or that fake fertilisers were used to conduct the alleged swap.There was no misrepresentation at Mushumbi.

Sales volumes fell 19% in the first quarter, grew 24% in the second, rose 8% in the third, before slipping 3% in the final quarter.\n\nThe reason?\n\nAuthorities controlled the in-store exchange rate throughout the year, whereas informal players used higher exchange rates aligned with the parallel market.\n\nThis allowed informal traders to offer lower prices in USD, bleeding supermarkets across the market, including OK Zim and Spar.\n\nThat changed earlier this year when the government repealed SI 81A through SI 34 of 2025. USD sales, which made up just 23% of total sales last year, have now crawled up to 32%.\n\nUnit sales volumes rose by 8%, reflecting sustained consumer demand, Pick n Pay says.\n\nLast year, Pick n Pay shut down three stores in Chegutu, Harare Street and Southwold. It opened one in Hogerty Hill.\n\nThe company is back in expansion mode. A new branch opened in Shurugwi, and more are on the way. The focus is on high-potential stores in mining towns, liquor category development, and fixing supply chains for remote areas.\n\nTheres also a big move coming in Bulawayo. Pick n Pays property arm plans to develop what it calls the citys largest mall of its kind, with over 220 small shops, food outlets and office space. Says the company: The tenant mix will include a combination of smaller businesses, which generate higher rental yields, and key anchor tenants such as TM Pick n Pay and KFC.\n\n",
