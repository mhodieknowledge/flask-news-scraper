            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) has applauded the Government of Zimbabwe for its landmark decision to abolish the death penalty.\n\nThe quasi-governmental body says the move will promote human rights and the sanctity of life in the country.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa recently signed into law the Death Penalty Abolition Act, which saw over 60 prisoners awaiting the hangmans noose having their sentences commuted to life imprisonment.\n\nThe last execution in the country was nearly two decades ago in 2005.\n\nIn a statement, the ZHRC noted that the governments legislative development aligns Zimbabwe with global trends, which will eliminate the punishment and uphold modern human rights standards.\n\nThe new Act eliminates the death penalty in Zimbabwe, ensuring no person shall be sentenced to death or executed.\n\nThis legislative development aligns with modern human rights standards and reflects the global trend towards the abolition of the death penalty.\n\nZimbabwe now joins a growing number of nations that have recognised the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of their past actions.\n\nThis development also reinforces Zimbabwes alignment with international human rights instruments such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, said the commission.\n\nZHRC also commended the government for its efforts of re-sentencing offenders while also providing legal representation and opportunities for clemency for those affected.\n\nThe ZHRC applauds the inclusive and compassionate approach taken in the transitional provisions of the Act, ensuring prisoners under sentence of death are afforded legal representation and the opportunity for clemency. This approach underlines the importance of rehabilitation over retribution in Zimbabwes justice system.\n\nThe ZHRC highly commends the unity of purpose demonstrated by the political leadership across the political divide, notably, Honourable Edwin Mushoriwa who introduced the Private Members Bill in November 2023, Honourable Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi who facilitated the passage, Members of Parliament as a whole, and His Excellency Dr. E. D. Mnangagwa who signed the Bill into law, ZHRC said.\n\nGovernment was further called on to ratify outstanding international treaties such as the UN Convention Against Torture.\n\nThis milestone achievement symbolises Zimbabwes commitment to upholding constitutional, regional and international human rights standards. In that vein the ZHRC therefore urges the Government of Zimbabwe to maintain the momentum and ratify outstanding treaties, particularly the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and the UN Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CED), ZHRC said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE low water levels at the iconic Lake Kariba are reportedly on the rise, a development that is good news for Zimbabwe and Zambia that rely on the reservoir for hydroelectricity generation.\n\nAccording to the latest hydrological survey report by the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA) issued this Monday, steady water inflows from the dams catchment area are contributing to the improved levels.The Lake level is steadily increasing due to sustained rainfall on the reservoir and immediate catchment, closing the period under review at 475.87m (2.61% usable storage) on 6th January 2025, compared to 477.28m (12.32% usable storage) recorded on the same date last year, said the water authority.The lake is designed to operate between levels 475.50m and 488.50m (with 0.70m freeboard) for hydropower generation.As of January 6, 2025, the dam was 12.32% full from 11.38% recorded on December 28,2024.Owing to the El Nino-induced weather phenomenon which resulted in low rainfall, on November 28, 2022, Zimbabwe stopped generating electricity at the Kariba South Power Station situated on the mighty Zambezi River.Why did Kariba South shut down?Historically low rainfall led to a glaring imbalance between the water intake level at Lake Karibathe worlds biggest dam reservoirand water consumption by the Zimbabwean Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) at Kariba South.As a result, ZRA, which maintains and operates the Kariba Dam, issued guidance to suspend electricity generation.At the time of the suspension, ZRA, jointly owned by Zimbabwe and Zambia, believed the decision would allow most of the remaining water left in Lake Kariba to be used by Zambia, which at that time rationed its water consumption more carefully than Zimbabwe, which has become more hydropower dependent as it battled outages and soaring fuel prices owing to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Why is the Kariba Dam so important?The significance of the Kariba Dam, with an installed capacity of 1,626 megawatt, stems both from its contributions to regional economies and what it symbolizes in Southern Africa and beyond.The dam was controversially built in the late-colonial period to accelerate economic growth in settler colonies under white-minority control but ended up becoming central to newly independent African states.

You have lost your f****** mind and if my husband were here, he would knock out your f****** teeth. Youre a dead man walking. You just f****** up your whole life, and you will never be anyone, Ill make sure of it.She is then accused of yelling at Luke and demanding he look through his phone to find out which medications he had picked up from her, before turning her attention back to Brandon and allegedly getting very close to his face.The complaint added: At this point, Minaj open-handedly struck Garrett on the right side of his face, causing his head to swing backwards as his hat flew off his head.The tour manager  who allegedly was also left with a throbbing right wrist after being stuck on the arm  then locked himself in a bathroom for several hours and received a text message telling him he wasnt being asked to join the next stop on the tour.The complaint states, per Variety. Attorneys for Garrett also state that he was hit in his right wrist, leaving it throbbing.Brandon eventually filed a complaint with Detroit police and is seeking punitive and exemplary damages as well as general damages.Nickis lawyer has branded the lawsuit frivolous and denied the allegations, but stressed she hadnt yet received the complaint.Judd Burstein told TMZ: At this time, no complaint has been served upon Minaj, and therefore, we are unaware of the specific allegations.However, if the lawsuit is as reported by TMZ, it is completely false and frivolous. We are confident that the matter brought by this ex-assistant will be resolved swiftly in Mrs. Pettys favour.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by TMZ and Variety, the lawsuit stems from an alleged incident after Minajs show at Detroits Little Caesars Arena on April 21, 2025.\n\nBrandons lawyers claim he received a text from the Starships hitmakers head of security, Larry Dathan, asking him to speak with the 42-year-old singer in her dressing room when he was on his way to the arena.When he got there, the manager alleged around eight other staff members were there, and Minaj  who has a four-year-old son with husband Kenneth Petty  began complaining that some didnt know what they are supposed to do, and who reports to who before asking a man named Luke Montgomery his purpose on the tour.The documents added: Mr. Montgomery explained that his duties entailed tasks like venue dressing room set-up, private jet set-up, hotel room set-up, quick change room refreshments and tour bus set-up.Mr. Montgomery mentioned these duties were in addition to any requests from Minaj communicated by Garrett, including food orders, drinks, personal items, baby items, and, most notably, prescriptions.Brandon explained he told his famous boss he had asked his colleague to collect prescriptions because he was busy with tour responsibilities, including assisting Minaj with her costume changes, but he alleged the star then became visibly upset and angrily screamed at him.She allegedly fumed: Are you f****** crazy having him pick up my prescription?
