            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has struck off a claim by retired Duly Holdings Limited administrator, Theresa Ruredzo, who was demanding a Ford Everest vehicle as part of her terminal benefits, ruling that the matter belongs in the Labour Court, not the High Court.\n\nJustice Munangati-Manongwa upheld a special plea filed by the vehicle dealer, agreeing that Ruredzos case, though framed as a contractual dispute, was fundamentally rooted in her former employment and thus a labour matter.\n\nIt is evident that the plaintiffs claim, despite its contractual framing, fundamentally relates to the employment relationship and the associated terminal benefits, ruled the judge.\n\nHence, the Labour Court possesses exclusive jurisdiction to resolve such disputes.\n\nRuredzo, who worked for 31 years and two months at Duly Holdings, rising from clerk typist to national administration manager, retired in November 2017. She told the court that the company failed to pay her full terminal benefits and later agreed to compensate her with a Ford Everest to be delivered within five years  a promise she said was never fulfilled.\n\nHer lawyer argued that the case was purely contractual since the agreement to deliver the vehicle was made after her retirement, and therefore outside the Labour Courts reach. He cited previous judgments suggesting that post-employment contracts do not qualify as labour disputes.\n\nBut Duly Holdings countered that Ruredzos demand amounted to a claim for unpaid terminal benefits, squarely falling under labour law. The company argued that the 2013 Constitution and subsequent amendments to the Labour Act gave the Labour Court exclusive jurisdiction over such employment-related claims.\n\nThe plaintiff has brought her claim before the wrong court, the defence argued, relying on a string of Supreme Court decisions affirming that even cleverly framed contractual claims cannot escape the Labour Courts authority.\n\nJustice Priscilla Munangati-Manongwa agreed, noting that while Ruredzo tried to repackage her claim as a private contract, the car in question was undeniably part of her terminal benefits.\n\nThe agreement for the delivery of the Ford Everest motor vehicle is intrinsically linked to the employment relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, the judge said. This brings the claim squarely within the jurisdiction of the Labour Court.\n\nThe court upheld Duly Holdings special plea and ordered Ruredzo to pay costs.\n\nRuredzos long-running fight for her promised Ford Everest is now likely to continue before the Labour Court, the only forum legally empowered to decide whether Duly Holdings must finally deliver the vehicle.\n\n",

            "content": "By AFP\n\nThe Zimbabwe ruling partys backing of a term extension for President Emmerson Mnangagwa, which requires a change to the constitution, has fuelled anger and fears of deepening authoritarianism.\n\nZanu-PF, accused of corruption and misrule during its 45 years in power, announced a week ago that its annual congress supported moves to keep Mnangagwa in office until 2030, and required legislative amendments would be initiated.\n\nProminent lawyer Tendai Biti immediately pledged to defend the constitution against its capture while opposition figures called a press conference for Tuesday to respond to the constitutional crisis.\n\nMnangagwa, 83, came to power in 2017 in a military-backed coup that ousted Robert Mugabe, who was president for 30 years.\n\nElected in 2018 and re-elected in 2023, Mnangagwa has been accused of allowing rampant corruption and suppressing human rights, while ordinary Zimbabweans endure hardship even though the economy is growing.\n\nMoves to keep him on were a huge scandal, said Moses Msipa, a former soldier living in the second largest city of Bulawayo.\n\nAs Zimbabweans, we must say no to this, the 48-year-old told AFP. One of the main reasons Mugabe became reviled is because he became a dictator and overstayed, and now they want to take us back to that.\n\nOrdinary Zimbabweans have suffered under years of economic crisis while ruling party elites are accused of corruption  Zinyange Auntony / AFP\n\nZanu-PFs 2030 agenda had been on the cards for months before it was announced as the party position on October 18.\n\nAttempts over the past months to demonstrate against the plan were met with a harsh police crackdown that put scores of people in jail.\n\nOnly mass popular expression of dissent may change course, but prospects of such are low at the moment on account of weak grassroots organising and mobilising, said Musa Kika, director of the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa.\n\nResistance is highly unlikely under such circumstances, notwithstanding the public anger that they harbour, political analyst and university professor Eldred Masunungure told AFP.\n\nThe constitutional limit of two five-year presidential terms was introduced in 2013. Any change would require a series of legal steps, including the approval of two-thirds of both houses of parliament and a national referendum.\n\nIf the term extension agenda was put to a referendum, it would be defeated, said Stephen Chan, a professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.\n\nThe Zimbabwean people also want No Kings, he said, referring to rallies in the United States this month critical of President Donald Trump.\n\nResistance within the Zanu-PF could see a faction backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga join forces with the opposition to block any constitutional amendment, he said.\n\nThe analysts warned that the party that has governed since independence in 1980 would not be above bypassing constitutional safeguards.\n\nZanu-PF uses the law as a tool to achieve its ends, never as a boundary for compliance and accountability, said Kika. The party is good at manipulating the institutions that operationalise the law through coercion and capture.\n\nEfforts to keep Mnangagwa in office were led by self-serving party elites seeking immunity from accountability for past and present wrongs, and assurance for continued accumulation of wealth, he said.\n\nMnangagwa was useful for party members who abuse state power and its resources more or less unhindered, added Masunungure.\n\nWith the opposition splintered and weak after years of repression, unemployed Bulawayo university graduate Tafadzwa Moyo told AFP he understood the nervousness about standing up to the government.\n\nStill, the 29-year-old said, it was time for citizens to unite across political divisions and fight to reclaim democracy.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nSouth Africa is pushing to deport more undocumented migrants who compete with citizens for jobs in an economy with one of the highest unemployment rates globally, the minister overseeing the program said.\n\nThe nation is a neglected part of the global migration story, with the contestation between foreigners and locals for positions becoming a real tinderbox, Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said in an interview on Bloomberg Television Friday. Weve deported 51,000 people in the last year  thats more than France and Germany combined. If we had more resources, wed be doing more of that.\n\nSouth Africa has the continents most industrialised economy and sees a constant influx of job seekers from neighbouring countries, including Zimbabwe and Mozambique. But with the unemployment rate running at 33.2%, tensions between locals and foreigners run high. About 8.4 million people are eligible to work yet dont have jobs.\n\nIn 2008, about 60 people died and 50 000 were displaced in a wave of xenophobic violence, with foreigners blamed for everything from unemployment to poor government services.\n\nThere were similar riots in 2015 and again in 2019, when President Cyril Ramaphosa was forced to apologize to other African nations who were appalled by the treatment of their citizens. Local media recently reported on incidents of foreigners being chased away from health clinics by angry residents.\n\nSouth Africa is managing the situation responsibly, said Schreiber, who is a member of the Democratic Alliance, the second-biggest member of the countrys 10-party governing coalition.\n\nWere anchoring what we do in the rule of law to make sure that we also protect social cohesion, even as we enhance our enforcement operations, he said.\n\nA so-called government of national unity was formed in June last year, when the ruling African National Congress failed to secure a parliamentary majority in a national vote for the first time since apartheid ended in 1994. The ANC and DA have since clashed repeatedly over policy and appointments, raising doubts over whether the alliance will remain intact.\n\nWere in a better space now than we were initially, Schreiber said, adding that disputes are quite normal in any society with a coalition government.\n\nThe coalition succeeded in navigating a budget impasse and with a new fiscal cycle about to begin, Schreiber said hes hopeful any differences can be resolved in a less public and destructive way.\n\nIf we can succeed in that, I think that builds another layer of confidence that we actually are working pretty well together, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Xinhua\n\nZimbabweans on Saturday marked Anti-Sanctions Day in Harare, the countrys capital, calling for the unconditional removal of Western sanctions imposed on the country over two decades ago.\n\nThe SADC Anti-Sanctions Day, commemorated on Oct. 25, was established by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a 16-member regional organization, in 2019 as a collective regional initiative to denounce the sanctions, which were imposed on Zimbabwe following the countrys land reform program that redistributed land from minority white farmers to indigenous black Zimbabweans.\n\nIn his keynote address at the event, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa called for the complete and unconditional removal of the sanctions, saying that the country remains resolute in developing in the face of the illegal sanctions.\n\nThrough sanctions, some Western countries sought to punish us for asserting our sovereignty and pursuing equal economic development for the benefit and prosperity of the people of our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe, Mnangagwa said at the event, which was widely attended by government officials, members of the diplomatic community, business leaders, and Zimbabweans from all walks of life.\n\nMnangagwa said that despite the negative effects and other challenges and shocks such as climate change-induced droughts and public health emergencies, the national economy has been on a positive growth trajectory.\n\nOver the years, we have made tremendous progress in our efforts to promote a self-sufficient and food-secure nation. Comprehensive people-centered programs and projects have been put in place to enhance our agricultural productivity. Climate-proofing our agriculture has seen the country attain food self-sufficiency, he said.\n\nMnangagwa said that in navigating the path toward sustainable economic development, Zimbabwe requires access to flexible and reliable lines of credit, which are hindered by sanctions.\n\nRegrettably, the illegal economic sanctions have fundamentally disrupted the ability of our country to access global lines of credit. To ensure the continuity of our developmental agenda, my administration has adopted home-grown, innovative development financing models to drive our country forward, said the president.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the sanctions, the country remains committed to multilateralism and international cooperation toward the realization of global peace, security, justice and equitable development, he added.\n\nMartin Zharare, executive director of Citizens Against Economic Sanctions, an anti-sanctions lobby group, said sanctions should be removed unconditionally as they impede economic growth.\n\nThe people of Zimbabwe stand with the governments position and say we are not going to support any initiative to have sanctions removed with conditions. We are standing firm to say the sanctions must be removed unconditionally, Zharare said.\n\nThe United States imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe in 2001 through the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act, which restricted multilateral financing to the country.\n\nIn March last year, former U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order terminating the Zimbabwe sanctions program that had been in force since 2003 but immediately imposed sanctions on 11 individuals, including Mnangagwa and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, over alleged human rights abuses and corruption under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.\n\n",
