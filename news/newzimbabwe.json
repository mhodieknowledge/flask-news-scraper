            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nLAWYER Fadzayi Mahere has won a US$100,000 defamation claim against journalist Edmund Kudzayi, whom she sued in 2022 after he accused her of dating a married businessman, Tinashe Murapata.\n\nKudzayi got in trouble over a story he published on his online platform Kukurigo, alleging that the top lawyer had caused the collapse of Murapatas marriage.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Joel Mambara granted the order, ruling that Kudzayi should pay the claimed damages.\n\nWhereupon, after reading documents filed of record and hearing counsel, it is ordered that the plaintiffs claim be and is hereby granted.\n\nThe Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff the sum of US$100,000.00 or the equivalent thereof in local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the time of payment.\n\nThe Defendant shall pay interest on the above amount at the prescribed rate, namely 5% per annum from the date of service of summons to the date of payment.\n\nThe Defendant shall pay Plaintiffs costs of suit, ruled the judge.\n\nBefore mounting a lawsuit against the journalist, Mahere initially demanded a retraction, failing which she would sue for damages.\n\nHowever, Kudzayi insisted that there will be no retraction; the story is factual and much more is coming.\n\nMaheres lawyers consequently filed a defamation claim with the High Court.\n\nKudzayi said Mahere had an affair with Murapata, whose marriage has since collapsed because of the illicit affair.\n\nIn her declaration, in summons filed through her lawyers, Honey and Blanckenberg, Mahere said the allegations and publication by Kudzai were aimed at soiling her business image.\n\nThe article was designed to damage the plaintiffs personal and professional reputation, without any attempt at reporting information which was true or in the public interest. In the article itself, it was confirmed that neither the Plaintiff nor Mr. Murapata had confirmed any of the allegations set out in the article, and that efforts to contact the estranged wife were unsuccessful. It is therefore clear that the author of the article made no attempt to establish the veracity of his claims, and had no direct sources for the claims made, and was relying simply on the hearsay of third parties, read part of the summons.\n\nOn 3 July Kudzai published a tweet in which he threatened to produce Mahere story and pictures with a married man, 10AM tomorrow [4 July] (sic).\n\nThereafter, on 4 July 2022, in response to tweets from members of the public who expressed support for Mahere, Kudzai again tweeted, there is nothing honourable about having sex with married men and wrecking marriages.\n\nYou think chonaka because chaitwa neCCC? Munotopenga imi.\n\nMahere said it was clear from the context of the tweets that they were directed at Mahere.\n\nThereafter, on 5 July 2022, an article was published through the Kukurigo online WhatsApp platforms with the headline CCC spokesperson caught up in businessmans marriage collapse, love affair.\n\nThe article also stated that Mahere and Murapata had travelled together to a funeral in Masvingo and slept there under unclear circumstances.\n\nMahere then demanded a retraction but Kudzai said he was not going to do so.\n\nMahere said the Kukurigo website claims that 370,000 people read its news articles every day and claims 46,000 direct subscribers across 185 WhatsApp groups.\n\nShe said his Twitter page has 126,600 followers and since the articles were published, the untrue allegations have been reposted on social media and have been picked up by media sites, including Gambakwe Media, Zim News Online, Zimetro, iHarare.com, MyZimbabwe, Nehanda Radio, Pindula News, and Zimeye.\n\nThe reach of the defamatory allegations is therefore extensive. In light of the above, Plaintiff is entitled to damages as claimed, reads the summons.\n\n",

She was granted US$200 bail after spending three nights behind bars.\n\nThrough its lawyer Chris Mhike, AMH challenged placement on remand, arguing that the charge does not disclose an offence.\n\nMhike said in a democratic state, one cannot be arrested for expressing his or her opinion where there is freedom of the media and expression.\n\nThe arrest amounts to restrictions of the right of access to information.\n\nThe disregard of fundamental rights of the accused amount to violation of principle of democracy, he said.\n\nThe lawyer said when the company is placed on remand the state has restricted it from performing its duties to inform the public which is its mandate.\n\nJournalism is not a crime, by placing the company on remand means criminalisation of journalism.\n\nOne consenting to placement on remand means youre admitting to committing the offence, Mhike said.\n\nTakudzwa Jambawu representing the state said there is reasonable suspicion that an offence was committed.\n\nHe said it is not in dispute that Mnangagwa is the current SADC chairperson and the words contained in the article were insulting his authority.\n\nAccording to the state on June 7 2025 accused through the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper edition of 27 June 2025 to 3 July 2025 published an article titled When you become mafia state, intending to undermine the authority of the President by saying: In less than two months, our one year rotating chairmanship of SADC comes to an end and we hope it is not just Muckraker, who has not seen any value that our time in that important role has added to the regional bloc apart from just confirming the obvious fears that SADC is a mere trade union of dictators.\n\nIn the few months that we have been in that role, we have been implicated in the chaos that has rocked most neighbouring countries. We were implicated in the massive vote rigging in Mozambican elections-with proof that our people actually voted for Daniel Chapo in an election in whose disputed outcome resulted in the death of hundreds of people. We were also fingered in the elections in Botswana and Namibia, where our electoral rigging machinery was heavily deployed.\n\nWhen you have become a mafia state, and are known to arm fellow criminals from around the globe with your diplomatic passports, it has become very hard to stop your people from believing just anything.\n\nThere is certainly no doubt who is micro Managing this Chapo chap, so there is not even any need to wonder what our Owner thought when his boy was addressing a virtually empty stadium very soon the boy would have developed a thick skin, just hike his handler who no longer needs to do anything under the cover of the darkness. That is what happens when you become the head of a mafia state.  It is a government that came into power through a coup and is only obsessed with keeping itself in power hence the creation of demons such as the Tshabangus and the like, themselves creations of courts whose top judges are themselves appointed -and kept on  the bench via political chicanery, all to serve the purpose of keeping this criminal enterprise masquerading as a government in power.\n\nThe state alleges that the accused attached a photograph of President Emerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa and Mozambican President Daniel Chapo.\n\nThe state alleges the article was false in material and was designed to engender feelings of hostility by the citizens of Zimbabwe towards the President.\n\nHearing continues Friday.\n\n",

Some patients in the queue said they had been waiting for assistance for a week.\n\nPut SA First\n\nDaily Maverickreports that the various anti-migrant groups broadly fall under the Put South Africa First banner  including Operation Dudula, thePatriotic Alliance(PA) and several smaller community groups.\n\nThe groups are demanding that South Africans be prioritised over undocumented migrants  whom they want deported  for economic opportunities and services, like healthcare, accusing them of burdening the countrys health system to the detriment of locals.\n\nThey demanded proof of our nationalities and denied us access because we are not South Africans. The clinic has our clinic cards because we come here for medical attention, said a young mother who was at the Rosettenville Clinic to have her baby vaccinated.\n\nThe Immigration Act stipulates that only immigration officers and members of theSouth African Police Service(SAPS) have the authority to ask citizens and foreign nationals to produce valid documentation.\n\nAt the Hillbrow Community Clinic, where members of the PA, along with a small group of residents and members of Operation Dudula, denied access to foreign nationals, an off-duty security officer toldDaily Maverickthat the (anti-foreigner) groups that have been coming here are not happy with the matron.\n\nThey feel she is siding with the foreign nationals, and when they came on Friday, some demanded to speak to the clinics provincial manager, he said.\n\nAt the Rosettenville Clinic, where community members stood guard at the gates screening patients, Aneliswa Dutshwa, who spoke on behalf of the local anti-migrant group, claimed South African voters concerns were not being taken seriously by the government.\n\nWe want Immigration and Home Affairs to be visible. We are not taking a break until they are both visible, Dutshwa said.\n\nForeign nationals who were barred from entering the facility said they were also being denied a chance to take their clinic cards so they could seek help elsewhere.\n\nSome said they could afford private healthcare, but, pointed out oneZimbabwean who was at the clinic to collect medication, private health facilities require their clinic cards, with their full medical history. Without their cards they could not go anywhere else.\n\nI would have left already because its clear that they will not allow us in, but I want my clinic card because private health facilities require those. If they can give me my card, I will leave, she said.\n\nOperation Dulula\n\nOperation Dudula, which has vowed to intensify its operations at health centres, has been calling for the deportation of all undocumented foreign nationals since its emergence in mid-2020.\n\nThe groups Zandile Dabula said they would escalate their operations and also call for doctors who are foreign nationals to be replaced with South Africans, even if the foreigners were legally employed.\n\nThe government has condemned the groups and said it would deploy police to maintain peace and enforce the law at the affected facilities.\n\nGauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Brenda Muridili said: These deployments are as and when needed, and should the need arise, the SAPS will respond to its mandate.\n\nIllegal\n\nDepartment of Health spokesperson Foster Mohale said the reports were concerning.\n\nWe have noted with concern these illegal actions, he said, adding that no one has the right to prevent anyone from medical treatment.\n\nEveryone who happens to be in the country is protected by a number number of prescripts, including Section 27 of the constitution, theNational Health Act, and theRefugees Actof 1998.\n\nWhile there were claims that those seeking health services are illegal in the country, and while the department condemns the action of those who enter the country illegally, he said, no one has the right to take the law into their own hands.\n\nGauteng Health MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko indicated that her department has begun engaging concerned community-based organisations involved in the campaign, adding that while they noted the concerns by some groups, our Constitution allows everybody to access healthcare services, so it becomes difficult for us to chase people away.\n\nTheSouth African Human Rights Commission(SAHRC) said the rise in complaints from people being turned away from facilities was unlawful, discriminatory, and an infringement on human rights, reportsIOL.\n\nSection 27(1) of the Constitution clearly states that everyone has the right to have access to . services, including reproductive healthcare, it said in a statement.\n\nThe SAHRC has urged health departments and provincial leaders to address critical issues plaguing the sector, like staff shortages, long waiting times, and insufficient bed availability, saying these challenges, compounded by discriminatory practices, exacerbate healthcare inequity in an already strained system.\n\nMeanwhile, theForum for South Africa(FOSA) said the Human Rights Commission is failing in its arguments as it advocates for undocumented migrants to access healthcare services in this country.\n\nThe organisation added that illegal foreign nationals taking advantage of national health services arenot only affecting South Africans, but other legal documented foreign nationals.\n\nThey burden the system while accessing medications earmarked for citizens and documented migrants, said the organisations spokesperson, Tebogo Mashilompane.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) finds itself once again locking horns with university authorities, this time demanding the reinstatement of members suspended from state universities.\n\nThe union is accusing three universities, Midlands State University (MSU), Great Zimbabwe University (GZU) and the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) of what it calls a flagrant violation of both domestic and international human rights law.\n\nThe suspended students stand accused of breaching conduct regulations, allegedly brandishing placards on campus and calling for a resolution to the ongoing lecturers strike.\n\nIn a letter dated 7 July 2025, and served to the students on Tuesday, UZ Vice Chancellor Paul Mapufmo stated that the six had contravened rule 3.1.4 of the Rules of Student Conduct and Discipline, 1984 Ordinance 30, by moving around campus inciting fellow students to join the lecturers protests.\n\nIt was brought to my attention that on the 12th of May 2025 at around 1210 hours, while in the company of Blessing Mtisi, Nodeshar Maingehama, Tafadzwa Katsande Masimba, Tawananyasha Hove and Mtukura Tariro were found holding unlawful demonstration at the University Halls of Residence.\n\nYou were moving one hall of residence to another, one dining hall to another, addressing fellow students and inciting them to join you to hold placards and chant slogans against the University Administration.\n\nAccordingly in light of the seriousness of the allegations detailed above, I have found it necessary to, in terms of section 8 (3) (e) of the University of Zimbabwe Act,[ Chapter 25:16], (the act) to suspend you with immediate effect, from your studies at the University of Zimbabwe indefinitely pending disciplinary hearing against you.\n\nIn response, ZINASU President Emmanuel Sitima issued three key demands, asserting that Mapfumos actions reflect a deliberate and systematic effort to criminalise dissent and suppress the agency of students as political and civic actors.\n\nSuch repressive conduct is not only morally indefensible, but legally unsustainable. The Constitution of Zimbabwe (2013), which stands as the supreme law of the Republic, guarantees the freedom of expression (Section 61), freedom of assembly and association (Section 58), and the right to peaceful demonstration and petition (Section 59), said Sitima.\n\nSitima further insisted that the suspended students must be reinstated immediately and without conditions.\n\nThe immediate and unconditional reinstatement of all students unlawfully suspended or expelled. A thorough and independent investigation into the abuse of university disciplinary procedures for political ends. Firm guarantees from the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education affirming the protection of student rights in accordance with the Constitution, he declared.\n\nThe dispute comes as UZ lecturers have been on strike since April, demanding fair wages. At one point, even President Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesman, George Charamba, conceded that the US$230 being offered to lecturers at UZ was a concern, pledging that his boss had approved salary increments.\n\nThe university has responded to the industrial action by suspending protesting lecturers and replacing them with what students are derisively calling virgins in the academic setting, ill-equipped to handle the demands of the job.\n\n",
