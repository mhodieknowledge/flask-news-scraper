            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA 23-year-old man from Chiredzi, who fatally stabbed a villager after mistaking him for one of his attackers, has been jailed for five years.\n\nJustice Christopher Dube-Banda sitting at the Hight Court at Masvingo convicted Simbarashe Tapera of culpable homicide after he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge, escaping a possible murder conviction.The court heard that on December 22, 2024, Tapera fatally stabbed Edwin Tapera, aged 24, at Murambi village, Chief Nhema in Zaka.According to an agreed statement of facts, the deceased had earlier been assaulted by a group of young men while walking home from Mutembwa business centre around 7pm.Court heard that, as the assailants fled, the accused arrived at the scene with his girlfriend. Mistaken for one of the attackers, he was grabbed by the collar by the deceased, who was holding a stick. In response, Simbarashe drew a knife and stabbed the deceased once in the chest before fleeing.The judge said the accused acted negligently.At the time the accused stabbed the deceased, an attack on him was imminent. However, the means he used to avert the attack were not reasonable in the circumstances, he said.In stabbing the deceased in the manner he did, a reasonable man placed in the same circumstances as the accused would have foreseen the possibility of death and guarded against it. The accused was negligent, and it was his negligence that led to the death of the deceased.The judge noted that although the deceased was the aggressor, the accuseds reaction was excessive and unjustified.The fact is that the accused was not part of the group that harassed the deceased and his companions. He just found himself in a controversy he had nothing to do with; these factors reduce his moral blameworthiness.He, however, stressed that the sanctity of life must be upheld. Society frowns upon a person who, by his violent conduct, causes the death of another human being. The courts must send a loud and clear message that causing the death, albeit negligently, of a fellow human being will not be tolerated, the judge said.The court also considered the Victim Impact Statement, which highlighted the emotional and financial suffering endured by the deceaseds family.Tapera, a first offender and father of one, was sentenced to five years in prison, with one year suspended for five years on condition of good behaviour.The accused, though a young first offender, jumped into crime from the deep end, and he must contend with the consequences. This was negligence of the highest degree, said Justice Dube-Banda.\n\nJustice Christopher Dube-Banda sitting at the Hight Court at Masvingo convicted Simbarashe Tapera of culpable homicide after he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge, escaping a possible murder conviction.\n\nThe court heard that on December 22, 2024, Tapera fatally stabbed Edwin Tapera, aged 24, at Murambi village, Chief Nhema in Zaka.According to an agreed statement of facts, the deceased had earlier been assaulted by a group of young men while walking home from Mutembwa business centre around 7pm.Court heard that, as the assailants fled, the accused arrived at the scene with his girlfriend.

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nZIMBABWE Football Association (ZIFA) is bearing the brunt of hosting international matches abroad, losing in excess of US$500,000 per match, Parliament has revealed.\n\nThe national teams have been forced to play their home international matches on foreign soil as the country lacks certified stadiums.This follows the National Sports Stadium (NSS) being deemed unfit by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in 2020.The ban, coupled with a lack of other suitable stadiums in the country, has left Zimbabwe playing its home matches in neighbouring South Africa.Presenting a report at a pre-budget seminar in Bulawayo, the chairperson for the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture, Farai Jere, said Zimbabwe is incurring significant losses by hosting international matches outside the country.The homologation of the stadium remains outstanding. The cost of playing international matches for the Zimbabwe mens soccer team average US$500, 000 to US$750, 000 per match in logistics, accommodation, and lost revenue, depriving the country of potential revenue from hosting these matches, said Jere.The NSS has been undergoing renovations for the past three years, but the work has been progressing at a snails pace, prolonging the return of international football to the country.The Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Anselem Sanyatwe, like his predecessor, Kirsty Coventry, has on numerous occasions failed to meet his own deadlines for the return of international football.In response to Jeres report, the acting Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Tinoda Machakaire, said the giant stadium is 65% complete and the government is targeting its approval by the continental football mother body in June 2026.The National Sports Stadium refurbishment is now 65% complete, with bucket seats, turnstiles, and upgraded utilities installed.This project is a model of resilience and accountability in the use of public resources. Full homologation by mid-2026 through coordinated funding from Treasury, said Machakaire.\n\nThe national teams have been forced to play their home international matches on foreign soil as the country lacks certified stadiums.\n\nThis follows the National Sports Stadium (NSS) being deemed unfit by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in 2020.The ban, coupled with a lack of other suitable stadiums in the country, has left Zimbabwe playing its home matches in neighbouring South Africa.Presenting a report at a pre-budget seminar in Bulawayo, the chairperson for the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture, Farai Jere, said Zimbabwe is incurring significant losses by hosting international matches outside the country.The homologation of the stadium remains outstanding.

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nFORMER Mt Pleasant legislator Fadzayi Mahere has told South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to be bold and confront the Zanu PF government over the economic and political challenges that have forced Zimbabweans to migrate to his country.\n\nSouth Africa has in recent years been buckling under a migration crisis, with Zimbabweans crossing the Limpopo River in search of greener economic pastures.\n\nThis has left Zimbabweans at loggerheads with South Africans, who accuse them of exploiting and straining social services.\n\nMahere said the root cause of migration is the economic and political challenges bedevilling Zimbabwe, which are forcing many to leave.\n\nYour Excellency, we must also deal with the root causes of immigration to South Africa, especially from Zimbabwe. Why do you believe so many Zimbabweans are running away? It was not always the case. What changed?\n\nRespectfully to what extent has South Africa, through successive administrations, taken an honest view about the Zimbabwean crisis?\n\nUnless these questions are addressed, you will most likely continue to have hordes of Zimbabweans braving high fences, vicious crocodiles, the vagaries of the Limpopo and your law enforcement in order to escape the bigger crocodiles back home, said Mahere.\n\nNumerous attempts by South Africa to curb illegal migration from Zimbabwe have been futile, prompting vigilante groups to attack foreign nationals.\n\nRamaphosa said his government is holding engagements with countries whose nationals are in South Africa illegally.\n\nEngagements with countries whose nationals are frequent transgressors are ongoing through discussions with embassies, and these matters are also included as an Agenda item on Bi-National Commissions. This is to ensure that the implication of illegal migration is understood.\n\nIllegal immigration does place a strain on our social services and undermines our national security.\n\nWe should not allow vigilante acts targeting foreign nationals as these do not solve the problem and they undermine the rule of law, said Ramaphosa.\n\n",

It will feature exhibitions, investment sessions, expert panel discussions, and will conclude with an awards gala celebrating outstanding achievers in the diaspora.\n\nDescribed as a premier diaspora engagement platform, the event has become an important avenue for companies and organisations seeking to expand into both the local and diaspora markets.\n\nThe organisers said the summit will bring together prospective investors while recognising individuals making notable contributions to the countrys progress.\n\nThe 3rd Edition of the Zimbabwe Diaspora Celebration & Business Summit is more than a gathering; it is a national initiative celebrating the indispensable role of Zimbabweans abroad in driving economic transformation.\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the diaspora community remitted an impressive US$2.2 billion in 2024, up from US$1.873 billion in 2023. This growth underscores the diasporas unwavering commitment to Zimbabwes socio-economic progress, said ZIDO chaiperson Blessed Kapesa.\n\nAn estimated 300 in-person participants and thousands of online viewers from around the world are expected to take part in the event.\n\nWith an expected attendance of at least 300 in-person participants and thousands of online viewers worldwide, the summit is strategically scheduled during the festive season, when many Zimbabweans in the diaspora return home.\n\nThis hybrid platform will enable participants to showcase their products, services, and investment opportunities to a global audience, amplifying visibility and engagement, he added.\n\n",
