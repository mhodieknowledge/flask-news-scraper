Those bricks are pre-sold. They are going to our customers. Our customers will pay a 50 percent deposit and pay the balance in instalments over two years, he said.\n\nThe initiative is meant to incentivise the customers to build and not be burdened by paying lump sums towards the bricks and then failing to buy other building materials.\n\nThe purchase price of $0.14 a brick will include transportation costs to the building site.\n\nSpeaking at a Christmas and excellence recognition awards ceremony for WestProp employees, Sharpe stressed the concept of urgency in service delivery to meet customer expectations.\n\nHe rallied the employees to embrace the one billion brick vision adding that their hands would be imprinted on the achievements of the vision.\n\nWhatever we do with the billion bricks stands forever. For the test of time, he said.\n\nSharpe reiterated his love for Zimbabwe noting that he formed the company to make a difference and provide livelihoods to thousands of people whose value chain depends on WestProp.\n\nI set up this business to be a public company. Not to enrich myself. I have enough money. I set it up so that you can benefit from it, he said.\n\n",

It could be about loyalty to EDs vision, a political analyst suggested.\n\nMnangagwa has reshuffled his cabinet multiple times in recent years, often citing the need for efficiency.\n\nDuring his Christmas Day interview with ZBC, Mnangagwa emphasized the importance of performance and accountability among leaders.\n\nThis is the season to reflect, not just on personal matters, but on professional performance. Those entrusted with leadership must evaluate their contributions to the people of Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nWe must look at that and say this was my team, this is the team that has delivered our vision. Or does it require interrogating it? And are you going forward with that team like you were saying? No, I cant release it now, Ill make my statement after January 1, 2025.\n\nThis is because, at this moment, everybody is celebrating Christmas. Without me, how shall we? I said dont go and do what I will be doing. We reflect on how weve worked as a team and what weaknesses have I identified, what is necessary for me to strengthen, to execute government work.\n\nWhile stopping short of naming specific cabinet ministers or portfolios under review, Mnangagwa made it clear that underperformance would not be tolerated.\n\nZimbabwe deserves a government that works tirelessly for the people. This requires commitment and results from those in leadership, he added.\n\nHis remarks have left the political landscape buzzing, with many speculating about which ministers might be affected by the potential shakeup.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nA biodiversity hotspot in a remote part of South Africa has become the hub of an illegal trade in protected plant species, with organised crime groups capitalising on overseas demand.\n\nTheyve not just stolen our land or our plants, theyve stolen our heritage as well, a livestock farmer angrily tells the BBC, as she expresses dismay at the social and ecological crisis that the poaching has caused.\n\nMost of the plants in question are a variety known as succulents, named for their ability to hold water and survive in arid climates.\n\nMany of the worlds succulent species are only found in the Succulent Karoo desert, which spans South Africa and Namibia.\n\nSucculent species range in size, shape and colour  some look like small multi-coloured buttons and some look like cacti, sprouting colourful flowers at certain times of the year.\n\nWhile these varieties can be cultivated in nurseries, global demand is also fuelling the poaching of these plants from the wild which are then smuggled and sold online to buyers in the US, Europe and East Asia.\n\nIn Kamieskroon, a small town in the centre of South Africas Namaqualand region, the rolling hills have become a haven for poachers.\n\nSome of the species are highly localised, and so can be wiped out by just a small amount of poaching.\n\nIn South Africa, we know already of seven species that has been wiped out completely and there are certainly more species that will go extinct very soon, says Pieter van Wyk, a nursery curator at the/Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park.\n\nIt is hard to obtain figures for how many plants are being poached, but the non-governmental organisation Traffic reports that1.6 million illegally harvested succulents were seizedby South Africas law enforcement agencies between 2019 and 2024. This only represents the contraband that was detected, so the true figure is likely to be far higher.\n\nThe South African government is well aware of the problem, and unveiled a strategy in 2022 to combat poaching. It includes running community programmes about the need to protect the environment.\n\nAccording to Mr Van Wyk and other conservationists, plant poaching has been booming since the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.\n\nWith international traders unable to travel to South Africa during that time, they turned to local people to collect succulents for them and post them out of the country.\n\nMr Van Wyk says this coincided with an increase in global demand.\n\nPeople had more time to try to find something to keep busy with, and plants were one of the only things that in your house, could connect you to the outside world.\n\nThis has been seized upon by organised crime syndicates who hire teams of plant poachers and then market the wild plants on social media and e-commerce platforms.\n\nThe syndicates saw this as an opportunity of making something viral telling a wide as possible public: We have this super-strange looking thing that comes from the African continent,' Mr Van Wyk says.\n\nThen the public just loses their heads and they say: I want to buy one, and [the syndicates] arrange for the species to be poached, he adds.\n\nThe uptick in organised crime activity in the region is having knock-on effects on local communities.\n\nThis is a low-income area, people are not rich here, and people will exploit opportunities for income, explains Malinda Gardiner from Conservation South Africa.\n\nExpressing a similar view, the livestock farmer whom the BBC spoke to says there is always an influx of money in her community when poaching takes place.\n\nWhen we see young men going up in the mountain areas, we know theyre poachers, adds the farmer, who asks not to be identified for fear of reprisals.\n\nThey use screwdrivers to uproot the succulents and they carry backpacks and sacks to keep the stolen plants.\n\nA few days after that, there is an outbreak of binge drinking and illegal activity.\n\nWhen they get the money, theres more drugs, more alcohol, children are neglected because mummy is drunk, daddy is drunk, theres no food, adds the farmer.\n\nMs Gardiner worries that the tensions will have longer-term effects.\n\nSmall communities here really need each other but this brings distrust. It brings a split in the communities as well, she says.\n\nMr Van Wyks assessment is starker: People are being abused and enslaved by syndicates and buyers.\n\nAttempts are being made to raise awareness among buyers about the importance of understanding where a plant might have come from.\n\nChina has become a major source of demand for wild succulents in the last few years, but an internet campaign there to educate people about the illegal succulent trade has seen some results.\n\nThe Clean Internet for Conophytum campaign was launched in March 2023 by the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.\n\nAccording to the foundations deputy secretary-general Linda Wong, they have seen an 80% reduction in online adverts for conophytum  a type of succulent  with an unknown source, and buyers are starting to ask questions about where plants being sold online have come from.\n\nThe key is awareness. Once people know, they want to take action. They want to take responsibility to consume those plants and enjoy their beauty in a very responsible way, she tells the BBC.\n\nConservationists advise customers all over the world to ask about the origin of a plant, and under no circumstances should they buy those advertised as wild.\n\nTraffic and the UKs Kew Gardens recently announced that they were teaming up with eBayto develop new ways of preventing the sale of wild succulents on its platform.\n\nIn South Africa, Mr Van Wyk says more should be done to promote the cultivation of succulents that can be grown and harvested legally, to reduce the demand for poaching.\n\nWe as a country need to say that: We have this resource, and there are other countries that are majorly benefiting from this, why arent we?' he tells the BBC.\n\nMr Van Wyk now runs a nursery at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park which looks after plants that have been confiscated by law enforcement, and he says they have received more than 200,000 so far.\n\nIts obviously stressful seeing things disappearing. But if you study these plants, it brings so much joy and pleasure and you just forget about all the nonsense thats happening in the world, Mr Van Wyk says.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nAN ambitious plan to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas tenure beyond the constitutionally mandated two terms has triggered a wave of violence and intimidation, a recent report has revealed.\n\nDespite Mnangagwa saying he will respect the constitution and leave office after the end of his current and final term some ruling party officials are pushing for the octogenarian to remain in power.\n\nSeveral officials, including former cabinet ministers Supa Mandiwanzira and Owen Ncube have been clamouring in their respective provinces for Mnangagwa to rule beyond 2028.\n\nThis is in contrast to the partys resolution at this years conference in Bulawayo, which declared that Mnangagwa is serving his final term as president.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP) latest report revealed that those opposed to Mnangagwa extending his term have faced violence from Zanu PF officials in Midlands province.\n\nSeveral incidents of intimidation included the harassment of known political activists by Zanu PF supporters who are focused on promoting the ED2030 campaign, which seeks to extend President Mnangagwas rule beyond 2028. The incidents were reported in Chiwundura and Kwekwe, among other areas.\n\nIn Chiwundura, Zanu PF activists Calvin Mhondiwa, Forbes Choto, and Adam Dhliwayo threatened a male victim belonging to a group supporting former CCC leader Nelson Chamisa. They allegedly harassed him for campaigning against the ongoing Mnangagwa beyond 2028 movement, promising to deal with the victim violently and extending such treatment to anyone opposed to the campaign, the report reads.\n\nZanu PF must amend Sections 91(2) and 382(7) of the constitution to allow Mnangagwa to extend his term.\n\nZPP has called on the police to take action on the allegations levelled against Zanu PF officials.\n\nThe ZRP should take concrete steps to prevent and investigate incidents of violence, particularly those related to the ED2030 campaign. The police must also ensure that perpetrators are held accountable and that victims receive adequate protection, said ZPP.\n\n",
