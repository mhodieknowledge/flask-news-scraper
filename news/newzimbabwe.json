It is the first and most critical stage of mining, involving mapping, surveys and exploratory drilling to identify potential ore bodies before mining decisions are made.\n\nSpeaking toNewZimbabwe.comon the sidelines of the inaugural Zimbabwe Gold Investment Conference on Monday, Ernst & Young Associate Partner Dr Godknows Njowasaid Zimbabwes exploration spending remains far too low.\n\nErnst & Young Associate Partner Dr Godknows Njowa\n\nIn terms of exploration, Zimbabwe spends only 0.2% of annual global exploration expenditure, and within Africa, we contribute just 2%. Yet Africas total share is around 9%, he said.\n\nSo this shows that in Zimbabwe, we are not spending enough money on exploration. During my presentation, I gave the example of Canada, which is the highest spender in the world at about 20% of the annual global exploration budget.\n\nNjowa warned that Zimbabwe continues to lose opportunities, saying the country has the potential to double its current gold outputif it adequately explores and develops new deposits.\n\nFor decision makers,both government and private sector,more money must be allocated to exploration. Gold mining companies globally are making super profits because prices are at levels not seen in the past 30 or 40 years.\n\nSo some of that money should be reinvested into exploration. You need to spend between US$50 and US$80 per ounceof what you produce on exploration, he added.\n\n",

            "content": "The Globe and Mail\n\nThe documentaryMbira Talks, about a Zimbabwean-Canadian musicians relationship with an instrument once banned during colonisation, took a long time to make. We know this because Moyo Rainos Mutamba is shown plucking his mbira on a Toronto street, with the glittering Honest Eds department store in the background.\n\nThe lights went out in that building in 2016, and it was torn down a year later. Director Adrienne Amato originally planned to make a film about Stella Chiweshe, the pioneering rebel queen of the instrument, often referred to as a thumb piano because of the metal tines affixed to a wooden board that are struck by the first digits of the human hand.\n\nLogistics sabotaged the film on Chiweshe, who died in 2023 at age 76. Amato, who is white and was born in Zimbabwe when it was still under British rule as Rhodesia, immigrated to Toronto in 1977. After Chiweshes death, she shifted her focus to Mutamba. Still, the documentary, which premieres online and at the South African Film Festival in Toronto on Monday, took years to make, mostly because of money.\n\nIts very specific what gets funding these days, said the filmmaker, who joined Mutamba on a video call. Unless you have a celebrity in your doc or its a whodunnit crime thing, its a difficult landscape for making documentaries these days.\n\nAmato did not have a celebrity in her film, but she and Mutamba did have one on their side. Canadian indie-pop star Leslie Feist donated her frequent-flier miles for the trip to Africa by Amato, Mutamba and cinematographer Tess Girard. She also helped pay for the digging of a well at the Ubuntu Learning Village, the educational and community hub Mutamba co-founded in rural Zimbabwe.\n\nMutamba came to Canada more than 20 years ago to study economics at Trent University in Peterborough, Ont. The self-described village human finds Toronto too loud and crowded. In 2007, longing for a connection with his homeland, he took up the mbira, a ceremonial instrument tied to traditions of the Shona culture.\n\nThe late Chiweshe called the mbira a telephone to the spirits of people, water, trees and birds. Deeming it subversive, Rhodesias white authorities and Christian missionaries banned the instrument. The mbira is part of Mutambas educational mission involving food sovereignty, arts and cultural reclamation.\n\nIm intrigued by the power of community, he said. People are searching for it. Were all searching for village.\n\nFormer Toronto landmark Honest Eds can be seen across the street from Mutamba in a still from the documentary.Supplied\n\nMutamba is both a facilitator and a searcher himself. He longs for home, but Toronto is where he earns a living as co-director of Bloom Consulting, specializing in strategic planning, conflict mediation and psychotherapy. Canadas wealthy biggest city is his hunting place, where money is made to be used in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe mbira is more popular in Western Canada than in its eastern counterpart  Vancouver Island is the hotbed. Though the instrument is foreign to Canada, Mutamba believes its effect is universal.\n\nIt provokes certain emotions, he said. It is in the body. Its beyond the otherness. It is a sound that is human.\n\n",

Half of the worlds population resides in rural areas, but only 36% of the global nursing workforce lives there. This means infant mortality, maternal death, and poor health outcomes are much prevalent in rural areas than in urban locations.\n\nTelehealth (healthcare delivery via electronic means) has helped in overcoming some barriers, but it requires internet access. One in three people globally will still live in a rural area by 2050, and there is a critical need for healthcare access solutions that are built to work in rural areas.\n\nIn rural Zimbabwe, a person who is sick might walk 15 to 20 kilometres to reach a clinic.ZimbosAbantu a social enterprise in Harare, Zimbabwes capital has a fleet of mobile clinics that offer medical services to vulnerable populations in the rural and peri-urban areas of the city. Its goal is to reduce the distance that women, youth, and children walk to access primary healthcare from 15km to 3km.\n\nZimbosAbantu roughly translates to Zimbabwean people. It operates five mobile clinics, offering services like dental care, maternal health, immunisation, eye care, and nutrition education.\n\nEach mobile clinic has a wind turbine and solar panels generating enough power for a 190-litre vaccine freezer. They are equipped with examination rooms, vital monitoring machines, diagnostic kits, and medications. They operate 12 hours a day and are staffed full-time by health professionals. Each clinic serves an average of 18-20 patients per day, or about 1000 patients per month.\n\nThe social enterprise was founded by Chiedza and Tawanda Mushawedu in 2021. Chiedza serves as the organizations executive director and previously worked for a private hospital. While working there, she saw people suffering from undiagnosed chronic conditions and dying from treatable conditions, simply because care was out of reach.\n\nZimbosAbantu offers a subsidised healthcare scheme to solve affordability disparities. Men, women, and youth are organized in groups of 10 or 20, and each member pays about $3 every month for access to healthcare, drugs, and other benefits. About 1,000 people are currently enrolled in the scheme.\n\nRemoteness from care is a wide-scale problem that needs a similarly-sized solution. ZimbosAbantu has recently added more vehicles to its fleet and expanded its operations to a second province. In a conversation with Africa Business Radio, Chiedza admits that there is still a large gap to be addressed, and ZimbosAbantu is a drop in the ocean. She emphasizes the need for investors and partners to help expand the organizations reach and impact.\n\nZiplineis another company working to improve medical access in Africa, but with autonomous drones.\n\n",

This was due to stretched consumer spending, a challenging macroeconomic environment, and a shift in pricing strategy from ZWG to US dollars, said Manatsa.\n\nDespite the volume and revenue drops, profitability recovered significantly. Profit before tax rose to US$11 million, a turnaround from a US$3 million loss recorded during the same period last year,a 491% year-on-year growth. The improvement was largely driven by reduced foreign-exchange losses and lower inflationary impacts.\n\nOperating costs also fell sharply to US$10 million, a 66% decline from the prior year, reflecting lower forex losses, easing inflation pressures, and the implementation of cost-management initiatives.\n\nThe company noted that enhanced distribution efficiency, closer engagements with traders, and performance-focused trade programmes helped support volume delivery. BAT described the external environment as dynamic but relatively stable, bolstered by steady inflation and a more stable exchange rate driven by ongoing monetary policy interventions.\n\nHowever, Manatsa warned that challenges persist, including liquidity constraints, high borrowing costs, and frequent power outages that continue to disrupt industrial productivity.\n\nLooking ahead, the Company remains focused on reinforcing the strength and sustainability of the business by driving volume recovery through increased focus on the value segment, improving product availability across all markets and channels, and enhancing operational efficiency by optimising supply-chain processes and reducing our cost to serve in order to protect profitability, he said.\n\n",
