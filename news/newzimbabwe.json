            "content": "Medicalbrief\n\nSouth Africa  TheNational Department of Healthhas condemned the action taken by some groups to prevent foreign nationals from accessing essential healthcare services around the country, after campaigners in both Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal blocked clinic and hospital entry to migrant patients, demanding proof of identity before anyone was allowed in.\n\nThis week, members ofOperation Dudulain Gauteng and of theMarch and Marchmovement in KZN began manning the entrances of government facilities that includedAddington HospitalandGateway Clinicin Durban,RK Khan Hospitalin Chatsworth, andHillbrow Clinicas well asRosettenville Clinic,south of Johannesburg, in a bid to prevent alleged undocumented foreigners from seeking health services.\n\nThe Mercuryreports that they accosted patients at the gate and demanded they show ID documents to confirm they were South African nationals.\n\nIn Rosettenville last week, foreign nationals were barred from the local clinic by the protesters who said they were fed up with the long queues that mostly comprised illegal foreign nationals and who, they added, are placing a strain on the facilitys already stretched resources, reportsKaya959.\n\nThey said the clinic was on the brink of collapse, having already stretched its resources to provide free healthcare  mostly to migrants.\n\nClinic management denied allegations that it was turning people away, saying it was attending to everyone walking into the health facility, reportseNCA. Some patients in the queue said they had been waiting for assistance for a week.\n\nPut SA First\n\nDaily Maverickreports that the various anti-migrant groups broadly fall under the Put South Africa First banner  including Operation Dudula, thePatriotic Alliance(PA) and several smaller community groups.\n\nThe groups are demanding that South Africans be prioritised over undocumented migrants  whom they want deported  for economic opportunities and services, like healthcare, accusing them of burdening the countrys health system to the detriment of locals.\n\nThey demanded proof of our nationalities and denied us access because we are not South Africans. The clinic has our clinic cards because we come here for medical attention, said a young mother who was at the Rosettenville Clinic to have her baby vaccinated.\n\nThe Immigration Act stipulates that only immigration officers and members of theSouth African Police Service(SAPS) have the authority to ask citizens and foreign nationals to produce valid documentation.\n\nAt the Hillbrow Community Clinic, where members of the PA, along with a small group of residents and members of Operation Dudula, denied access to foreign nationals, an off-duty security officer toldDaily Maverickthat the (anti-foreigner) groups that have been coming here are not happy with the matron.\n\nThey feel she is siding with the foreign nationals, and when they came on Friday, some demanded to speak to the clinics provincial manager, he said.\n\nAt the Rosettenville Clinic, where community members stood guard at the gates screening patients, Aneliswa Dutshwa, who spoke on behalf of the local anti-migrant group, claimed South African voters concerns were not being taken seriously by the government.\n\nWe want Immigration and Home Affairs to be visible. We are not taking a break until they are both visible, Dutshwa said.\n\nForeign nationals who were barred from entering the facility said they were also being denied a chance to take their clinic cards so they could seek help elsewhere.\n\nSome said they could afford private healthcare, but, pointed out oneZimbabwean who was at the clinic to collect medication, private health facilities require their clinic cards, with their full medical history. Without their cards they could not go anywhere else.\n\nI would have left already because its clear that they will not allow us in, but I want my clinic card because private health facilities require those. If they can give me my card, I will leave, she said.\n\nOperation Dulula\n\nOperation Dudula, which has vowed to intensify its operations at health centres, has been calling for the deportation of all undocumented foreign nationals since its emergence in mid-2020.\n\nThe groups Zandile Dabula said they would escalate their operations and also call for doctors who are foreign nationals to be replaced with South Africans, even if the foreigners were legally employed.\n\nThe government has condemned the groups and said it would deploy police to maintain peace and enforce the law at the affected facilities.\n\nGauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Brenda Muridili said: These deployments are as and when needed, and should the need arise, the SAPS will respond to its mandate.\n\nIllegal\n\nDepartment of Health spokesperson Foster Mohale said the reports were concerning.\n\nWe have noted with concern these illegal actions, he said, adding that no one has the right to prevent anyone from medical treatment.\n\nEveryone who happens to be in the country is protected by a number number of prescripts, including Section 27 of the constitution, theNational Health Act, and theRefugees Actof 1998.\n\nWhile there were claims that those seeking health services are illegal in the country, and while the department condemns the action of those who enter the country illegally, he said, no one has the right to take the law into their own hands.\n\nGauteng Health MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko indicated that her department has begun engaging concerned community-based organisations involved in the campaign, adding that while they noted the concerns by some groups, our Constitution allows everybody to access healthcare services, so it becomes difficult for us to chase people away.\n\nTheSouth African Human Rights Commission(SAHRC) said the rise in complaints from people being turned away from facilities was unlawful, discriminatory, and an infringement on human rights, reportsIOL.\n\nSection 27(1) of the Constitution clearly states that everyone has the right to have access to . services, including reproductive healthcare, it said in a statement.\n\nThe SAHRC has urged health departments and provincial leaders to address critical issues plaguing the sector, like staff shortages, long waiting times, and insufficient bed availability, saying these challenges, compounded by discriminatory practices, exacerbate healthcare inequity in an already strained system.\n\nMeanwhile, theForum for South Africa(FOSA) said the Human Rights Commission is failing in its arguments as it advocates for undocumented migrants to access healthcare services in this country.\n\nThe organisation added that illegal foreign nationals taking advantage of national health services arenot only affecting South Africans, but other legal documented foreign nationals.\n\nThey burden the system while accessing medications earmarked for citizens and documented migrants, said the organisations spokesperson, Tebogo Mashilompane.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) finds itself once again locking horns with university authorities, this time demanding the reinstatement of members suspended from state universities.\n\nThe union is accusing three universities, Midlands State University (MSU), Great Zimbabwe University (GZU) and the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) of what it calls a flagrant violation of both domestic and international human rights law.\n\nThe suspended students stand accused of breaching conduct regulations, allegedly brandishing placards on campus and calling for a resolution to the ongoing lecturers strike.\n\nIn a letter dated 7 July 2025, and served to the students on Tuesday, UZ Vice Chancellor Paul Mapufmo stated that the six had contravened rule 3.1.4 of the Rules of Student Conduct and Discipline, 1984 Ordinance 30, by moving around campus inciting fellow students to join the lecturers protests.\n\nIt was brought to my attention that on the 12th of May 2025 at around 1210 hours, while in the company of Blessing Mtisi, Nodeshar Maingehama, Tafadzwa Katsande Masimba, Tawananyasha Hove and Mtukura Tariro were found holding unlawful demonstration at the University Halls of Residence.\n\nYou were moving one hall of residence to another, one dining hall to another, addressing fellow students and inciting them to join you to hold placards and chant slogans against the University Administration.\n\nAccordingly in light of the seriousness of the allegations detailed above, I have found it necessary to, in terms of section 8 (3) (e) of the University of Zimbabwe Act,[ Chapter 25:16], (the act) to suspend you with immediate effect, from your studies at the University of Zimbabwe indefinitely pending disciplinary hearing against you.\n\nIn response, ZINASU President Emmanuel Sitima issued three key demands, asserting that Mapfumos actions reflect a deliberate and systematic effort to criminalise dissent and suppress the agency of students as political and civic actors.\n\nSuch repressive conduct is not only morally indefensible, but legally unsustainable. The Constitution of Zimbabwe (2013), which stands as the supreme law of the Republic, guarantees the freedom of expression (Section 61), freedom of assembly and association (Section 58), and the right to peaceful demonstration and petition (Section 59), said Sitima.\n\nSitima further insisted that the suspended students must be reinstated immediately and without conditions.\n\nThe immediate and unconditional reinstatement of all students unlawfully suspended or expelled. A thorough and independent investigation into the abuse of university disciplinary procedures for political ends. Firm guarantees from the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education affirming the protection of student rights in accordance with the Constitution, he declared.\n\nThe dispute comes as UZ lecturers have been on strike since April, demanding fair wages. At one point, even President Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesman, George Charamba, conceded that the US$230 being offered to lecturers at UZ was a concern, pledging that his boss had approved salary increments.\n\nThe university has responded to the industrial action by suspending protesting lecturers and replacing them with what students are derisively calling virgins in the academic setting, ill-equipped to handle the demands of the job.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nKenyas President William Ruto has ordered police to shoot protesters targeting businesses in the legs, ensuring they are incapacitated but not killed.\n\nThe UN and human rights groups have accused the police of using excessive force in the recent wave of anti-government protests  31 people were killed on Monday, according to a state-run body.\n\nAnyone caught burning another persons business or property should be shot in the leg, hospitalised, and later taken to court. Dont kill them, but ensure their legs are broken, the president said.\n\nHe further warned his political rivals against sponsoring and using violent protests and unlawful means to forcibly remove him from power.\n\nIn addition to the 31 deaths, more than 100 people were injured and about 532 arrested in the protests which hit the capital Nairobi and other major cities, said the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR).\n\nThe Kenya police says that 11 people died.\n\nThe UN said it was deeply troubled by the killings and criticised the Kenyan police for using lethal ammunition against protesters.\n\nBut in an address on Wednesday, Ruto defended the police action, saying an attack on security forces would be a declaration of war against the country.\n\nKenya cannot and will not be ruled through threats, terror, or chaos. Not under my watch, the president said, vowing to firmly deal with those behind the protests.\n\nHe said any change of government was only possible through the ballot and not through protests, urging his opponents to wait for the 2027 general elections.\n\nThis country will not be destroyed by a few people who are impatient and who want a change of government using unconstitutional means. It is not going to happen, Ruto added.\n\nFormer Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has denied claims that the opposition was planning to overthrow Ruto.\n\nNobody wants you out of government unconstitutionally. We want to face you on the ballot in August 2027, so just relax, said Gachagua, who was elected alongside Ruto in 2022 but was impeached last year after the pair fell out.\n\nThere has been rising tension in the country since the death of blogger Albert Ojwang in police custody last month brought people back onto the streets, a year after young protesters stormed parliament angered by a wave of tax rises.\n\nRising economic challenges have fanned anger in a country where youth unemployment and the quality of jobs remain significant concerns.\n\nRuto acknowledged the youth unemployment crisis in the country but said the job challenges had existed long before he came to power in 2022. He said that his administration was the first to take deliberate steps to address it.\n\nThe 58-year-old leader questioned why some Kenyans have been more critical and confrontational towards his administration compared to previous governments.\n\nWhy cause all the chaos during my time? Ruto asked rhetorically, warning against ethnic politics.\n\nYou can call me whatever names you want to call me, but I will make sure there is peace and stability in Kenya.\n\nMondays protests were intended to commemorate Kenyas decades-long struggle for democracy but they quickly escalated into deadly clashes in 17 out of the countrys 47 counties, local media reported.\n\nMany of those demonstrating chanted Ruto must go and wantam, meaning one term, a popular rallying call demanding President Ruto leave office.\n\nIna statement issuedon late Tuesday, the KNCHR said the sharp rise in the death toll was deeply troubling.\n\nThe KNCHR strongly condemns all human rights violations and urges accountability from all responsible parties, including police, civilians and all other stakeholders, it added.\n\nThe commission also documented widespread looting and destruction of both public and private property by unidentified individuals.\n\nAmong those killed was a 12-year-old pupil who was hit by a stray bullet while at home in Kiambu, in the outskirts of the capital, local media reported.\n\nIt is very concerning that these latest incidents come barely two weeks after more than 15 protesters were reportedly killed and many more injured in Nairobi and other parts of Kenya on 25 June, said Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nLethal ammunition, rubber bullets, tear gas, and water cannons were used, Shamdasani added.\n\nAt least two hospitals were damaged after unidentified attackers raided the facilities and stole medical equipment and harassed staff, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nReligious and rights groups have demanded a prompt and independent investigation into the killings, destruction of property and arbitrary arrests.\n\nOpposition leaders on Tuesday accused the government of deploying unmarked police vehicles to transport armed gangs to perceived opposition strongholds during the protests.\n\nThey called for a national boycott of all businesses affiliated with President Rutos administration, accusing his government of deploying state-sponsored violence and extrajudicial killings on Kenyans.\n\nThis regime is hostile. It cannot be reasoned with. It must be resisted. We will not rest. We will not retreat. We will not surrender, the opposition said in a joint statement.\n\nKenyas Chief Justice Martha Koome has cautioned the country against the increasingly violent protests, saying they risked the nations democratic fabric.\n\n",
