            "content": "By Andy Dolan l MailOnline\n\nA MANAGER at a healthcare company has won an unfair dismissal case after she was sacked two days after she complained that her bosss husband was sexually inappropriate with her.\n\nAmber Stoter felt ambushed when businesswoman Olinda Chapel-Nkomo called her into a meeting and fired her 48 hours after she lodged the complaint, an employment tribunal heard.\n\nMs Stoter, 30, had complained that the CEOs husband Tytan Nkomo made a crude comment to her about being hard and referred to her as his property.\n\nAfter Ms Stoter posted a picture with a caption saying working hard in the sun, Mr Nkomo commented saying thats not the only thing you make go hard.\n\nMr Nkomo also called Ms Stoter his girlfriend, it was heard.\n\nCompany director Mrs Chapel-Nkomo sacked Ms Stoter because she viewed the allegations as problematic, Reading Employment Tribunal concluded.\n\nMs Stoter is now set to win compensation after successfully suing Gain Healthcare for unfair dismissal.\n\nShe told MailOnline today that the tribunal experience had been stressful and she had struggled to find work since being sacked.\n\nOlinda Chapel-Nkomo announced managerial performance reviews  which led to Ms Stoter being sacked  a day after she was informed of inappropriate texts sent by her husband, the tribunal heard.\n\nThe tribunal heard Ms Stoter started working as a manager for the health firm, in Bicester, Oxfordshire, on June 5, 2023.\n\nOn June 26, she had a discussion with her line manager Jessica Cannon and raised concerns about the conduct of Mr Nkomo.\n\nAt the time, he was married to the founder and CEO Mrs Chapel-Nkomo.\n\nThe tribunal said he occupied a management position, but noted that this was disputed by Gain Healthcare, who said he was not an employee.\n\nMs Stoter told her line manager that Mr Nkomo had been sexually inappropriate with her and had told her she was like his girlfriend.\n\nThe manager said on one occasion, while they were in a car together, he told her dont allow men to look at you like that, you are part of my property after she half-smiled at a man.\n\nAnd, on another date, he responded to a picture of her with a caption reading working hard in the sun, with the comment thats not the only thing you make go hard.\n\nThe tribunal heard that during the conversation with Mrs Cannon, Ms Stoter was asked to show the messages she had been sent by Mr Nkomo but said she was unable to do so as their chat had disappearing messages.\n\nFollowing their conversation, Mrs Cannon decided that Mr Nkomo should stop working from the office.\n\nThe matter was not escalated any further after this.\n\nThe morning after their chat, against the wishes of Ms Stoter, the line manager also spoke to Mrs Chapel-Nkomo and stated that her husband had apparently sent inappropriate texts to (Ms Stoter).\n\nThe next day, Mrs Chapel-Nkomo told all managers via a WhatsApp group that she was going to hold performance review meetings.\n\nShe met with Ms Stoter on June 28 and the employee was dismissed following a heated conversation in which Ms Stoter became distressed, the panel heard.\n\nIt was heard she felt ambushed in the meeting and told Mrs Chapel-Nkomo that she had done this because of what your husband did.\n\nIn her dismissal letter, Gain Healthcare set out several reasons for Ms Stoters dismissal, which included how she had allegedly been witnessed leaving our premises to frequent the neighbouring tanning studio during contractual working hours.\n\nThey also said she was fired for sending an excessive number of messages to colleagues on a WhatsApp chat, among others.\n\nIn her witness statement, Mrs Chapel-Nkomo said: I dismissed her because of her exceptionally concerning and escalatory behaviour during my one to one with her.\n\nThe tribunal said that the matters raised by Ms Stoter in the meeting involved a specific report of sexual misconduct, directed at a junior female employee by a male with senior status at work.\n\nThey said the business deals with vulnerable clients and has significant safeguarding responsibilities.\n\nUpholding her claims of unfair dismissal on ground of protected disclosures, Employment Judge Colin Baran said: Overall, the Tribunal concludes that the principal reason for (Ms Stoters) dismissal by Mrs Chapel-Nkomo was the making of the protected disclosure about Mr Nkomo.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that at the time of dismissal Mrs Chapel-Nkomo knew of the fact and nature of the disclosure  reports of sexually inappropriate conduct by her husband Mr Nkomo towards (Ms Stoter), a new member of staff.\n\nSuch a disclosure, if properly acted upon, would have been problematic not just for (Gain Healthcare) but also for Mr Nkomo personally.\n\nThe judgement added that the reason given for dismissal was not supported by other evidence, and that the matters reported in the disclosure were not looked into or addressed by the company following Ms Stoters dismissal.\n\nThe judge said Mrs Chapel-Nkomo sacked Ms Stoter as a response to the disclosure she made about her husband.\n\nMs Stoter also won a claim of victimisation.\n\nA remedy hearing to decide her compensation will take place in September.\n\nMs Stoter told MailOnline: I represented myself at the hearing and it was difficult, but I had to stand up for myself. Maintaining ones integrity is the best way.\n\n",

As the saying goes: Until the lion learns to write, every story will glorify the hunter, Mudenda said.According to the Speaker, pro-poor budgeting, which revolves around a fundamental question regarding every budget allocation: Will this directly improve the life of the poorest family in your constituency?Mudenda highlighted that there was need by members to employ Artificial Intelligence (Al) through database analytics in order to unravel the political economy undergirding the daily lives of the people.He told them that the approach was in consonant with Nelson Mandelas affirmation that: Overcoming poverty is not a task of charity, it is an act of justice. It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life.This pro-poor approach should align the budget to the Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2063, particularly the forte of the elimination of poverty, achieving zero hunger and ensuring sound health and well-being for all.Also, of importance, proficiency in budget analysis demanded a comprehensive understanding of the Public Finance Management (PFM) framework.The PFM system is built on strong legal and institutional foundations which delineate every stage of the budget process namely, from the initial planning and preparation, approval, implementation and expenditure, to the final monitoring and evaluation level of due analysis.Centrally, the framework places fiscal oversight on the committees responsibility to exercise with probity the budgetary processes. This is where you, as Parliamentarians, must step forward to fulfil your hallowed responsibility.The role of Parliament in budget oversight is not a matter of political convenience, executive benevolence or sheer happenstance. It is a constitutional mandate that forms the very juridical foundation of the budgetary processes, stated Mudenda.He reminded members that the Constitution did not just permit them to scrutinise public expenditure but, also commanded them to do so because they must ensure that public resources were expended on programmes designed to improve the livelihoods of the citizenry with greatest equity.The Constitution speaks with crystalline clarity. Section 119(3) states that: all institutions and agencies of the State and government at every level are accountable to Parliament, said the Speaker.Beyond the legal framework which anchors the Select Committees financial oversight, Mudenda said committees must have an appreciation of the national budget matrix.Section 298 provides for principles of public financial management which should act as the beacon for Parliamentary oversight on how public funds ought to be expended prudentially for the sake of democratic accountability.Equally, Section 299 complements Section 298 by specifically obligating Parliament to monitor and oversee expenditure by all State institutions.The primary objective of budget analysis was to identify opportunities for improving the quality and quantity of public spending in counterbalance to the available revenues.Furthermore, international protocols have established standards that can assist in measuring whether Budget allocations truly prioritise the needs of the vulnerable people.The Abuja Declaration calls for 15% of the National Budget to be allocated to health, while the Dakar Declaration of 2000 and the Incheon Declaration require 20% of government expenses to be allocated to education. In the same vein, the Maputo Declaration sets a target of 10% for the agriculture sector, the Speaker explained.However, sometimes these international standards were not met because of negative economic imperatives that may be obtaining in those countries.Mudenda told members that the budget analysis must be guided by the Bill of Rights as provided for in Chapter 4 of the national Constitution.The need to take cognisance of the climate change impact phenomenon, as more resilient, climate-proof infrastructure development demands robust budgetary allocations was of profound importance.\n\nOfficially opening a capacity building workshop for Members of Parliament on Budget Analysis for the Public Accounts and Budget and Finance committees respectively in Bulawayo this weekend, Mudenda said the two committees,\n\ncharged with the sacred responsibility of demanding unwavering standards on the value-for-money across every tier of government expenditure must be actively involved in every step of the budgetary processes, moving beyond perfunctory examination to critical analysis of the national budget.\n\nIn the past, analysis of the National Budget has been done by others, leaving you as mere spectators in decisions that directly affect the welfare of the people you are sworn to serve.Today, you begin the process of becoming the lion that writes its own story through the mastery of rigorous budget analysis.

It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life.This pro-poor approach should align the budget to the Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2063, particularly the forte of the elimination of poverty, achieving zero hunger and ensuring sound health and well-being for all.Also, of importance, proficiency in budget analysis demanded a comprehensive understanding of the Public Finance Management (PFM) framework.The PFM system is built on strong legal and institutional foundations which delineate every stage of the budget process namely, from the initial planning and preparation, approval, implementation and expenditure, to the final monitoring and evaluation level of due analysis.Centrally, the framework places fiscal oversight on the committees responsibility to exercise with probity the budgetary processes. This is where you, as Parliamentarians, must step forward to fulfil your hallowed responsibility.The role of Parliament in budget oversight is not a matter of political convenience, executive benevolence or sheer happenstance. It is a constitutional mandate that forms the very juridical foundation of the budgetary processes, stated Mudenda.He reminded members that the Constitution did not just permit them to scrutinise public expenditure but, also commanded them to do so because they must ensure that public resources were expended on programmes designed to improve the livelihoods of the citizenry with greatest equity.The Constitution speaks with crystalline clarity. Section 119(3) states that: all institutions and agencies of the State and government at every level are accountable to Parliament, said the Speaker.Beyond the legal framework which anchors the Select Committees financial oversight, Mudenda said committees must have an appreciation of the national budget matrix.Section 298 provides for principles of public financial management which should act as the beacon for Parliamentary oversight on how public funds ought to be expended prudentially for the sake of democratic accountability.Equally, Section 299 complements Section 298 by specifically obligating Parliament to monitor and oversee expenditure by all State institutions.The primary objective of budget analysis was to identify opportunities for improving the quality and quantity of public spending in counterbalance to the available revenues.Furthermore, international protocols have established standards that can assist in measuring whether Budget allocations truly prioritise the needs of the vulnerable people.The Abuja Declaration calls for 15% of the National Budget to be allocated to health, while the Dakar Declaration of 2000 and the Incheon Declaration require 20% of government expenses to be allocated to education. In the same vein, the Maputo Declaration sets a target of 10% for the agriculture sector, the Speaker explained.However, sometimes these international standards were not met because of negative economic imperatives that may be obtaining in those countries.Mudenda told members that the budget analysis must be guided by the Bill of Rights as provided for in Chapter 4 of the national Constitution.The need to take cognisance of the climate change impact phenomenon, as more resilient, climate-proof infrastructure development demands robust budgetary allocations was of profound importance.\n\nAccording to the Speaker, pro-poor budgeting, which revolves around a fundamental question regarding every budget allocation: Will this directly improve the life of the poorest family in your constituency?\n\nMudenda highlighted that there was need by members to employ Artificial Intelligence (Al) through database analytics in order to unravel the political economy undergirding the daily lives of the people.He told them that the approach was in consonant with Nelson Mandelas affirmation that: Overcoming poverty is not a task of charity, it is an act of justice.
