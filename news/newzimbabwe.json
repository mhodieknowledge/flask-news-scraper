            "content": "Al Jazeera\n\nPolish and NATO forces have shot down drones violating the countrys airspace during a Russian aerial attack on neighbouring Ukraine.\n\nFighter jets were scrambled early on Wednesday as more than a dozen drones entered Polish airspace, the Polish military said. It is the first time that Polish and NATO forces have become engaged in the conflict. Ukraine said Russia is testing the West.\n\nDuring todays attack by the Russian Federation on targets in Ukraine, our airspace was repeatedly violated by drones, the Operational Command of the Polish military said in a statement.\n\nAt the request of the Operational Commander of the Armed Forces, weapons have been used, and operations are under way to locate the downed targets, the military said.\n\nThe army said Polish and NATO military aircraft were mobilised to ensure airspace safety.\n\nPolish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, while ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems have been brought to the highest state of readiness, the Operational Command said.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that an operation is under way related to multiple violations of Polish airspace.\n\nTrwa operacja zwizana z wielokrotnym naruszeniem polskiej przestrzeni powietrznej. Przeciwko obiektom wojsko uyo uzbrojenia. Jestem w staym kontakcie z Prezydentem i Ministrem Obrony. Odebraem bezporedni meldunek od dowdcy operacyjnego.\n\n Donald Tusk (@donaldtusk)September 10, 2025\n\nTranslation: An operation is under way related to multiple violations of Polish airspace. The military used armaments against the objects. I am in constant contact with the president and the minister of defence. I received a direct report from the operational commander.\n\nAn operation was also conducted to collect debris from the drones.\n\nA drone or similar object struck a residential building in Wyryki in eastern Poland, but nobody was injured, its mayor told the state-run news channel TVP Info. Footage showed a house with a damaged roof and the rafters showing.\n\nPolice in the Lublin region said they found a damaged drone in the village of Czosnowka while drone debris was also reported in the town of Czesniki.\n\nTusk confirmed that the drones originated from Russia. We are dealing with a large-scale provocation, the prime minister said.\n\nMoscow appeared to distance itself from the incident. The Russian Ministry of Defence said its drones had struck military facilities in western Ukraine but there were no plans to target sites in Poland.\n\nEarlier, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the European Union and NATO accuse Russia of provocations on a daily basis, most of the time without even trying to present at least some kind of argument.\n\nTusk said he was in constant contact with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. An emergency meeting of the Polish Council of Ministers was called for Wednesday.\n\nAircraft have used weapons against hostile objects, Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on social media, adding: We are in constant contact with NATO command.\n\nUkraines foreign minister said on Wednesday that the events show Russian President Vladimir Putins impunity and his expansion of the war and added that Moscow is testing the Wests willingness to respond to aggression.\n\nPutin just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West, Andrii Sybiha said on X.\n\nThis situation shows that finally the decision needs to be taken to enable partner air defence capabilities in neighbouring countries to be used to intercept drones and missiles in the Ukrainian airspace, including those approaching NATO borders.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy said eight Russian drones had been aimed toward Poland, and called the episode an extremely dangerous precedent for Europe.\n\nEU Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius called for the EU to develop a drone wall along its eastern flank.\n\nOnce again Russia tests frontier states, EU & NATO, Kubilius wrote in a post on social media. We shall work together with Member States, frontier countries and Ukraine. Russia will be stopped.\n\nRussias war is escalating, not ending. We must raise the cost on Moscow, strengthen support for Ukraine, and invest in Europes defence. The EU plays a major role and we will support initiatives like the Eastern Border Shield defence line, the EUs top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, wrote on social media.\n\nThe United States also questioned Moscows intentions after the incident with President Donald Trump weighing in on Truth Social: Whats with Russia violating Polands airspace with drones? Here we go!\n\nFour airports in Poland, including Chopin Airport in Warsaw, were closed due to military activity late on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to notices posted on the US Federal Aviation Administrations website, the other airports closed were Rzeszow-Jasionka Airport, Warsaw Modlin Airport and Lublin Airport.\n\nChopin Airport confirmed later in a post on social media that airspace over parts of Poland, including over the airport, had been closed temporarily due to the actions of state services and the military to ensure safety.\n\nPassengers whose travel plans were disrupted were asked to monitor airlines and official government announcements for updates.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, all of the airports save for Lublin, which is close to the border with Ukraine, reopened.\n\nWany komunikat dla pasaerw korzystajcych z@ChopinAirport.pic.twitter.com/kN1W7dFSLx\n\n Chopin Airport, WAW (@ChopinAirport)September 10, 2025\n\nThe military mobilisation in Poland came after Ukraines air force reported that Russian drones had entered Polish airspace, posing a threat to the city of Zamosc, but the air force later removed the statement from its Telegram messaging app.\n\nMost of Ukraine, including the western regions of Volyn and Lviv, which border Poland, were under air raid alerts for several hours overnight, according to Ukraines air force data.\n\nPoland said earlier that it planned to close its border with Belarus at midnight on Thursday (22:00 GMT on Wednesday) due to Russian-led military exercises scheduled to take place in Belarus.\n\nRussia and Belaruss large-scale military exercises, known as the Zapad drills, have raised security concerns in neighbouring Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, all NATO member states. The Zapad-2025 (West-2025) drills will be held in western Russia and Belarus from Friday.\n\nAsked about the duration of the border closure, Polish Minister of Interior Marcin Kierwinski said the border would only be reopened when the government was sure there was no more threat to Polish citizens.\n\nThe Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had summoned the Polish charge daffaires to complain about the border closure, which it said caused significant difficulties.\n\nIt described Polands move as an abuse of its geographical position.\n\nThe temporary suspension of passage indicates rather an intention to conceal ones own actions than the existence of any threat from Belarus, the Foreign Ministry said.\n\nLithuanias border guard said on Tuesday that the protection of its border with Belarus and Russia would be strengthened due to the exercises.\n\n",

Before the rebasing of the economy, taxes were 30% of GDP (double Africas average ) making Zim the most taxed African country, Biti said.\n\nThe former finance minister said the government has no clear guiding ideas and is using taxes to cover up its reckless spending which falls on ordinary working people, leaving them with little or nothing to live on.\n\nAt any given time the average Zim pays annually at least 15 different types of taxes and levies that include PAYEE, corporate taxes, IMMT, VAT, Fuel levies, carbon taxes, AIDS levies , excise duties on alcohol and cigarettes presumptive taxes,stamp duties toll gates, vehicle licenses, ZBC, stamp duties, customs duties, capital gains taxes, rates,NSSA to name a few.\n\nAn ideological vacuous regime sees taxes as an antidote to an overzealous expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nHigh regressive taxes hit innocent working people who are left with little or no disposable income.\n\nLow disposable incomes underpin a crises of under accumulation, the basis of any economic recession. Thanks to high toxic taxes, an artificially tight monetary policy and a mismanaged exchange rate this economy is bleeding, he added.\n\n",

This, combined with repeated disease outbreaks such as FMD, led to shrinking herd sizes and the loss of lucrative export markets.\n\nIn recent years, however, the sector has shown significant potential to recover through private and government-led initiatives aimed at boosting productivity, improving quality, and opening new markets.\n\nDeputy Lands and Agriculture Minister Vangelis Haritatos told Parliament that Zimbabwe is now working on expanding its beef export base to East Asia.\n\nGovernment is currently negotiating a bilateral Beef Export Trade Protocol with Asian countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia. The main challenge affecting exports has been foot-and-mouth disease control.\n\nTo this end, Government has intensified FMD surveillance and established disease-free zones for beef production, Haritatos said.\n\nHe added that the ministry has partnered with African Livestock and Organic Welfare (ALOW) and ZimTrade to ensure beef destined for export meets international quality standards.\n\nEast Asia represents a vast market for beef imports, driven by rising demand from its growing middle class.

Current measures include a high policy rate of 35%, a statutory reserve requirement of 15% for savings and time deposits, and 30% for demand and call deposits.\n\nThe policy framework is designed to support the ZiG, which was introduced to restore confidence and stability in the economy. The central bank has been working to maintain the currencys stability against the US dollar.\n\nIn its latest inflation tracker, CZI noted that while the fall in inflation confirms the effectiveness of the current monetary stance in stabilising prices, the downside has been a steep decline in aggregate demand.\n\nWhile tight liquidity is helping stabilise prices, it also has negative implications on demand and hence business output and growth. Therefore, in the long term, monetary policy has to ease tight liquidity conditions as stability becomes sustainable, the industry grouping said.\n\nCZI said keeping inflation below 1% enhances price stability and goes a long way in broadening the use of ZiG beyond a transaction currency, while acknowledging that businesses that previously preferred to trade in USD transactions only are beginning to slowly encourage ZiG payments to help them settle some of their monthly obligations.\n\nThe industry grouping said the high annual inflation rate of 93,8% is still reflective of the September 2024 devaluation of ZiG, hence will only ease in October, provided there is no other shock in the inflation drivers to cause high month-on-month inflation.\n\nIn comparison, the US$ prices remained the same between July and August 2025 as the main driver of USD inflation (S.I. 81A of 2024) was repelled in early 2025. Some of the possible signals to be derived from the stable USD prices include greater predictability in input and output costs for businesses that largely operate in US$.\n\nThe industry grouping warned that the gap between the official and parallel market rates could motivate traders to abandon the formal market.\n\n",
