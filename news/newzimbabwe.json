            "content": "ExpressUK\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Faragehas accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of behaving like Robert Mugabe amid further claims that the Government is considering postponing local elections scheduled for the Spring.\n\nMugabe, who served as President of Zimbabwe for 30 years, became notorious for putting off democratic elections. He was eventually ousted in 2017 in what was widely regarded as a coup detat.\n\nReports last week suggested that the Labour government, led by Prime Minister SirKeir Starmer, is considering the controversial move as part of a shake-up of local government.\n\nAnd a recent report inThe TimessuggestedEssexCounty Council elections, as well as those in the unitary boroughs of Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock, were almost certain to be postponed.\n\nA leaked Thurrock Council report says that as a consequence of participation in the Government Devolution Priority Programme the Leader and Chief Executive approve a letter to the Secretary of State asking to postpone local elections to be held on May 1, 2025.\n\nThe GB News host, whose own seat, Clacton, is likewise in Essex, wasted little time making his feelings plain as he shared the news on X.\n\nHe commented: This is outrageous.Keir Starmeris behaving like Robert Mugabe.\n\nThe reforms, aimed at restructuring councils and enhancing devolution across England, are being spearheaded by Deputy Prime MinisterAngela Rayner.\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThey involve merging or disbanding existing councils to create more streamlined and efficient local governance structures.\n\nLocal Government Minister Jim McMahon has acknowledged that elections in areas undergoing reorganisation might be deferred.\n\nHe explained that if a council is set to be restructured and will not exist in its current form for the full term following the elections, it is customary to postpone the elections and instead elect a shadow body to oversee the transition.\n\nSuch an approach aims to prevent electing representatives to councils that are on the verge of significant structural changes.\n\nThe Government has not yet provided a definitive list of councils that will be affected by the postponements.\n\nThe situation remains fluid, with further details expected to emerge as the government continues to outline its devolution agenda and local government restructuring plans.\n\nStakeholders and the public await more comprehensive information to understand the full implications of these proposed changes on local democracy.\n\nA Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: No decisions have been taken to postpone elections in specific areas.\n\n",

            "content": "Al Jazeera\n\nAt least 120 people have been killed when a passenger plane caught fire after skidding off a runway and crashing at an airport in South Koreas Muan city, the countrys National Fire Agency said.\n\nThe accident occurred on Sunday at 9.03am local time (00:03 GMT) as the Jeju Air flight, carrying 175 passengers and six crew from the Thai capital Bangkok, landed at Muan International Airport located about 289km (179 miles) southwest of the capital Seoul.\n\nThe National Fire Agency confirmed that 120 people have been killed, and two people have been rescued  both crew members. The fire that engulfed the plane has been extinguished, the agency said.\n\nCiting fire agency officials, South Koreas Yonhap news agency said that hopes are fading for survivors.\n\nThere seems to have been some kind of malfunction with the landing gear and images which have been on the media here do appear to show the plane landing on its belly, skidding along the runway, followed then by a huge explosion, Al Jazeeras Rob McBride, reporting from Seoul, said.\n\nEyewitness accounts have talked then about a series of explosions and certainly images that we have been seeing have shown a catastrophic fire, he said.\n\nThe plane, a 15-year-old Boeing 737-800 jet, was reported to be carrying two Thai passengers and the rest were believed to be South Koreans.\n\nThailands Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has expressed deep condolences to the families of the crash victims.\n\nThailands Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been ordered to investigate if Thai passengers were on the plane and to provide assistance immediately, the prime minister said in a post on social media.\n\nOne photo shared by local media showed thick clouds of black smoke coming out of the plane. Another showed the tail section of the jet engulfed in flames on what appeared to be the side of the runway, with firefighters and emergency vehicles nearby.\n\nThe Yonhap news agency reports that the crash is believed to have been caused by contact with birds, resulting in malfunctioning landing gear as the plane attempted to land at the airport.\n\nThe countrys News1 agency reported that a passenger texted a relative to say a bird was stuck in the wing. The persons final message was, Should I say my last words?\n\nAn official from South Koreas Transport Ministrys aviation department said a bird strike was among several theories for the accident that have not been verified and that an investigation was ongoing.\n\nSouth Koreas Acting President Choi Sang-mok, meanwhile, ordered all-out efforts for rescue operations at Muan airport.\n\nAll related agencies must mobilise all available resources to save the personnel, he told officials in a statement.\n\nJeju Air, one of South Koreas largest low-cost carriers, which was set up in 2005, issued an apology for the crash, saying it would do everything in our power in response to this accident.\n\nThe crash is the first fatal accident for Jeju Air, though in August 2007, a Bombardier Q400 operated by the airline and carrying 74 passengers came off the runway due to strong winds at the southern Busan-Gimhae airport, resulting in a dozen injuries.\n\nExperts say that South Koreas aviation industry has a solid track record for safety.\n\n",

            "content": "Xinhua\n\nThe year 2024 has witnessed significant milestones in China-Zimbabwe cooperation in the agriculture sector, a cornerstone of Zimbabwes economy.\n\nTrade between the two sides increased, while Chinas support for Zimbabwes technical expertise and human resources development in the agriculture sector also expanded.\n\nAccording to the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency, a national investment promotion body, the agriculture sector sustains more than 60 percent of Zimbabwes population, provides 63 percent of raw materials for the manufacturing sector, generates 30 percent of export earnings, and contributes 15 percent to gross domestic product.\n\nIn a bid to further open Chinas market to Zimbabwean agricultural products, a trade protocol on the export of Zimbabwean avocados was inked during Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwas state visit to China in September, ahead of the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.\n\nRodwell Choto, an avocado farmer from Bindura, Mashonaland Central Province, is among those preparing to meet the expected surge in demand from China.\n\nExports to China will give us foreign currency, our economy will grow, and our livelihoods will improve, Choto told Xinhua in a recent interview, noting that avocado farmers are ramping up production.\n\nAccording to the Horticultural Development Council, an organization representing horticultural exporters in Zimbabwe, the Southeast African country is projected to produce a record 6,000 metric tons of avocados in 2024, with its avocado industry set to expand the growing area from the current 1,500 hectares to 4,000 hectares by 2030.\n\nThis builds on earlier successes, including a 2022 trade agreement enabling the export of fresh citrus to China, which saw its first shipment in 2023.\n\nThis is a chance for African agriculture now to become part of the global food value chain, said Christopher Mutsvangwa, politburo member and secretary for information and publicity at the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU PF) party.\n\nZimbabwes tobacco sub-sector has also flourished in 2024, bolstered by Chinas market access.\n\nTobacco, an important economic activity and a major foreign currency earner for Zimbabwe, Africas largest tobacco producer, saw exports to China rise 38.3 percent to 790 million U.S. dollars in the first nine months of 2024, accounting for 40.6 percent of Zimbabwes total exports to China, according to data released by the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe overall trade figures between Zimbabwe and China grew 25.6 percent to 3 billion dollars in the same period, the Chinese embassy added.\n\nDespite these significant milestones this year, a severe drought has caused crop failures and livestock losses, greatly undermining the agriculture sector. In response, China launched a project to drill 300 boreholes in four provinces of the country.\n\nThese boreholes will not only provide safe water to the affected community, but will also serve as a stepping stone towards resilience building in view of the current El Nino-induced drought, and will also save the lives of our livestock which is also in dire need of water, said Zimbabwes Minister of National Housing and Social Amenities Daniel Garwe.\n\nChinas support extends beyond infrastructure to human resource development. Collaborative efforts have focused on capacity building and technical assistance to enhance agricultural productivity.\n\nAs part of this initiative, Zimbabwean officials and professionals have attended seminars and workshops in China, equipping them with skills to modernize agriculture.\n\nJotamu Dondofema, director of agricultural education in the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, and Rural Development, is among the officials who attended a seminar on the construction of green, low carbon, and circular economic systems in China this year.\n\nThis program has already yielded significant benefits. We have witnessed large numbers of successfully trained personnel, improved technologies in the agricultural value chains, the establishment of renewable energy sources and systems, and information and technology-sharing platforms anchoring capacity-building initiatives. These efforts have enhanced the employability and competitiveness of Zimbabwean professionals while also promoting the adoption of green technologies and sustainable practices, Dondofema said.\n\n",
