It is estimated that Zimbabwe produces approximately 150 000 tons of black granite annually with Mutoko contributing about 75% of that output.EMA Mashonaland East provincial spokesperson, Astas Mabwe this work commended rising appreciation levels on matters of environmental concern.Off-hand as EMA, I wouldnt be able to tell the statistics district by district, but I would say in Togo generally, most of the granite mines have Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) certificates. In very few cases where you find those people starting their operations without an EIA. But the residual problematic areas are in the Makaha area where small-scale gold miners ply their trade, he said.Mabwe urged local communities to insist on conducting EIAs saying such procedures are the cornerstones of resolving all the potential disputes way before they go out of hand.He said the document avails the opportunity for communities to say out their worries, what they think may be violated and gives the proponent an opportunity to provide answers.We would like to applaud Silveira House for supporting such efforts which have made us realise these high environmental awareness levels. They have assisted in making environmental protection a reality.At the end of the day, what we want is sustainability. While miners get money from these mineral resources, there is need to balance such goals with environmental preservation.So they are really helping the government to have a conscious society. We really applaud them, and they have called us as EMA at various platforms, and we are proud of that, said Mabwe.However, Mutoko RDC Ward 10 Councillor, Robert Mabvuta said while some notable progress has been made, there is still need to raise awareness and strengthen communities appreciation of EIAs processes to stop miners from shortchanging communities.Ward 5 Councillor, David Kadiki called on authorities to find ways to punish miners, who evade conducting EIAs and those who fail to adhere to what they agreed on with the communities.\n\nThe Mashonaland East town hosts some of the countrys largest black granite miners as well as some gold mines.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA top official has highlighted the need for stronger systems to safeguard the remittances and investments of Zimbabweans abroad, emphasizing governments commitment to protecting and supporting the diasporas contributions to national development.\n\nZimbabweans abroad contribute significantly to the national fiscus, accounting for an estimated 10 percent of the countrys domestic product.\n\nThese remittance flows have been pivotal in contributing to the countrys revenue, prompting the Deputy Minister of Youth Empowerment, Development and Vocational Training, Kudakwashe Mupamhanga, to call for the government to introduce incentives for Zimbabweans abroad.\n\nMupamhanga was speaking at the ZAA Diaspora Forum in Harare organised by Destiny Media Group.\n\nAnything that encourages the diaspora to get more and more involved in their country I represent a rural area. I like to be biased towards the rural area where diaspora investment can come and partner with the Government in developing our rural areas. Everyone has a kumusha [home] that they came from. Everyone has roots; those people need the diaspora to play ball. It is not just about sending money for medication but also getting involved in the rural district councils, said Mupamhanga.\n\nThe forum brought together Zimbabweans based abroad and policymakers to explore investment opportunities. It was part of the two-day programme which concludes Saturday with an awards gala at the Manna Resorts.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, the UK Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Peter Vowles, said it was vital for Zimbabweans in the diaspora to plough back their experiences into local communities.\n\nMany Zimbabweans in the diaspora are building lives around the world, including in the UK. Many Zimbabweans in the UK dream or plan to return home, and as a British Ambassador, one of the great privileges is meeting British citizens with Zimbabwean heritage coming home. You are bringing back experiences, ideas, and energy that can shape Zimbabwes future, said Vowles.\n\n",

Offenders will face harsh penalties, including imprisonment and lifetime driving bans.\n\nPublic safety comes first. Every reckless driver is a potential killer on our roads, the NPA noted.\n\n",
