            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTHE Womens Academy for Leadership and Political Excellence (WALPE) and its partners have engaged Parliamentarians as they lobby for a motion on the Unpaid Care and Domestic Work (UCDW) Bill.\n\nWALPE, together with the Zimbabwe Womens Parliamentary Caucus, developed the motion to ease the burden of unpaid care and domestic work on women and girls through the enactment of a national care policy.Parliament, through Clerk Kennedy Chokuda, has accepted the motion, confirming its readiness for debate and noting that it is in the correct format and will positively impact womens lives in Zimbabwe.According to WALPE, an official date will soon be announced for members to debate the motion in the House.The proposed law calls for the recognition of UCDW as legitimate work and seeks to ensure that womens contributions to the economy are acknowledged and supported.Speaking during a workshop with MPs and Senators in Harare recently, WALPE Executive Director Sitabile Dewa said unpaid care and domestic work falls mainly on womens shoulders, limiting their participation in the paid economy and in society.By recognising unpaid care and domestic work as legitimate work, the Bill acknowledges the valuable contributions women make to their families and communities, she said.Dewa highlighted WALPEs six-year journey of advancing the UCDW agenda, which includes conducting national research, producing academic papers and newspaper opinion pieces, developing knowledge management toolkits, and using testimonials and documentaries to capture the lived experiences of women and girls.During the same workshop, the Zimbabwe Womens Parliamentary Caucus, led by Chairperson Maybe Mbohwa, and supported by male MPs and Senators, urged Parliamentarians to rally behind the Bill once it is introduced in both houses.Over the years, WALPE has also facilitated cross-country learning and advocacy. A leadership learning visit to Kenya brought together stakeholders including the Womens Parliamentary Caucus, the Ministry of Women Affairs, the Zimbabwe Gender Commission, Padare Mens Forum on Gender, Bekezela Home-Based Care and the Mayor of Harare to exchange strategies on UCDW policy reform. The delegation gained valuable lessons from Kenyas development of a National UCDW Policy.In 2024, WALPE presented a Gender-Responsive Public Services Dummy Budget Proposal alongside the national budget process, urging government to invest in public services that recognise, reduce and redistribute unpaid care work.WALPE has also hosted forums with private sector stakeholders, in partnership with Padare, to advocate for collective action in reducing and redistributing UCDW.The lobby groups work has been supported by Oxfam and IDRC/CRDI to ensure communities understand the importance of UCDW policies and their role in achieving gender equality and economic justice.\n\nWALPE, together with the Zimbabwe Womens Parliamentary Caucus, developed the motion to ease the burden of unpaid care and domestic work on women and girls through the enactment of a national care policy.\n\nParliament, through Clerk Kennedy Chokuda, has accepted the motion, confirming its readiness for debate and noting that it is in the correct format and will positively impact womens lives in Zimbabwe.According to WALPE, an official date will soon be announced for members to debate the motion in the House.The proposed law calls for the recognition of UCDW as legitimate work and seeks to ensure that womens contributions to the economy are acknowledged and supported.Speaking during a workshop with MPs and Senators in Harare recently, WALPE Executive Director Sitabile Dewa said unpaid care and domestic work falls mainly on womens shoulders, limiting their participation in the paid economy and in society.By recognising unpaid care and domestic work as legitimate work, the Bill acknowledges the valuable contributions women make to their families and communities, she said.Dewa highlighted WALPEs six-year journey of advancing the UCDW agenda, which includes conducting national research, producing academic papers and newspaper opinion pieces, developing knowledge management toolkits, and using testimonials and documentaries to capture the lived experiences of women and girls.During the same workshop, the Zimbabwe Womens Parliamentary Caucus, led by Chairperson Maybe Mbohwa, and supported by male MPs and Senators, urged Parliamentarians to rally behind the Bill once it is introduced in both houses.Over the years, WALPE has also facilitated cross-country learning and advocacy.

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nELEVEN Chipinge schoolchildren are suing ethanol producing firm, Green Fuel, and its security guards for over US$100,000 after they were assaulted earlier this year on allegations of stealing sugarcane.\n\nThe three security guards are Makina Ngwenya, Benjamin Dube and Munorwei Gomondera.In a viral video on social media earlier this year, the children were filmed lying down on their bellies while one of the guards flogged them.Parents and guardians of the school children, who are aged between 13 and 17 years, through the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR), filed summons at Chipinge Magistrates Court Friday against the three security guards and their employer for unlawful assault and ill-treatment.According to the childrens lawyers, Peggy Tavagadza and Tatenda Sigauke, the minors sustained serious injuries from the beatings.The children sustained injuries from the assault and experienced swollen backsides and were not able to walk properly for some time.They experienced shock, pain and suffering both physical and psychological, emotional trauma and distress, contumelia and suffered public humiliation while their dignity and bodily integrity was violated.The assault was grievous and psychologically traumatising due to the students young ages and the viral effect of the videos, which circulated on online platforms, the lawyers said.Sigauke and Tavagadza also want the court to order Ngwenya, Dube, Gomondera and Green Fuel to pay a total of US$110 000, which entails payment of US$10 000 to each student, for damages for pain and suffering, shock, trauma, contumelia and violation of dignity.The human rights lawyers are also demanding that Green Fuel publicly apologizes to the learners, their families, and the Chisumbanje community, condemn the guards actions, and commit to preventing similar abuses in future.The legal team also wants Green Fuels apology published in a local Manicaland newspaper, aired daily on Vemuganga Community Radio for five days, and displayed on the companys social media and notice boards for 14 days.\n\nThe three security guards are Makina Ngwenya, Benjamin Dube and Munorwei
