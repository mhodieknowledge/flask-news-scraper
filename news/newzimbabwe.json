While the government has collected more revenue than in the same period last year, analysts say containing the deficit may prove difficult without new fiscal measures.\n\nThe local currency, the ZiG, launched in April 2024 to replace the Zimbabwe dollar, has largely remained stable against the U.S. dollar but is still overshadowed by widespread use of the dollar in everyday transactions.\n\nNcube reiterated the governments commitment to the gold-backed unit and said the currency had benefited from tight monetary and fiscal policies.\n\n",
