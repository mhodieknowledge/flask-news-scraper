A clear roadmap for the modernisation of the health sector is now being implemented.\n\nSocial services in all parts of the country must never again be allowed to deteriorate to the levels that I recently witnessed when I toured health facilities here in Harare, said Mnangagwa.\n\nHis comments follow his surprise visits to Harares public referral hospitals last month, where he witnessed the deteriorating state of the healthcare system.\n\nThe government has faced criticism over the neglect and decline of public institutions, to the detriment of ordinary citizens.\n\nMnangagwa challenged the ruling party to spearhead development and improve the livelihoods of Zimbabweans.\n\nAs a revolutionary movement, we have, without doubt, achieved transformational milestones over the last 45 years. The aspirations which saw many sons and daughters of this great land wage a protracted liberation struggle are being achieved, sector by sector. Well done, Zimbabwe. Well done, ZANU-PF. We have every reason to be proud.\n\nHowever, looking into the future, a great responsibility lies with us, as the Peoples Party. Our duty is to create an environment that future generations will be proud of. We must enable our communities, the youth, women, SMEs, and others to be ready for the future, said Mnangagwa.\n\n",

            "content": "Channel Africa\n\nZimbabwes attempt to reckon with one of its darkest chapters, the Gukurahundi massacres of the 1980s, is drawing fierce criticism, with questions raised about the legitimacy of the process under President Emmerson Mnangagwas leadership.\n\nThe government says it is moving forward with a judicial and reconciliation programme aimed at addressing long-standing grievances stemming from the mass killings in Matabeleland and the Midlands, which left an estimated 20 000 people dead. But for many survivors and human rights advocates, the effort feels hollow, not least because of who is leading it.\n\nAt the time of the atrocities, Mnangagwa was the Minister of State for National Security, serving under then-President Robert Mugabe. His involvement in the security structures responsible for the crackdown has cast a long shadow over the current initiative.\n\nGeopolitical analyst Aaron Ngambi believes the process is more about optics than accountability.Mnangagwa seems determined to close this chapter, but many view it as an attempt to whitewash the past, Ngambi said in an interview. Its difficult to talk about reconciliation when those accused of complicity are in charge of the process.\n\nThe Gukurahundi killings, carried out by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade, targeted members of the Ndebele ethnic group in the aftermath of Zimbabwes independence. The violence has never been properly investigated, and the state has long resisted calls for justice and recognition.\n\nNow, with the renewed focus on the issue, some observers say the timing may be politically motivated, part of a broader effort by Mnangagwa to shape his legacy and consolidate power in the run-up to future elections.\n\nAny reconciliation process that fails to include survivors, civil society and independent investigators will never be seen as credible, Ngambi warned. This moment demands openness, not control.\n\n",

I am consulting. I am building. I am assembling a new strategy and a citizens team that will carry and pivot this nation unto greatness and stardom, Chamisa wrote on his X account, Thursday.\n\nHe described his departure from the CCC as disembarking from a ship that was leaking and could have jeopardised the democratic project he is striving to realise in Zimbabwe.\n\nI left CCC but not the mission. All because CCC was never the destination. It was just the vehicle meant to take us to the New Zimbabwe. When that vehicle was compromised, it became necessary to step out and prepare a better, cleaner, fit-for-purpose vehicle, he explained.\n\nChamisa further acknowledged the mistakes he made during his time at the helm of the CCC.\n\nOur approach in 2023 was not the same as 2018, because in the fight against oppression, no strategy is cast in stone. This is a battle to save lives and to save a nation. We sometimes miss. We sometimes omit. We commit. We adjust. We correct. We keep moving forward until we win.

She therefore has no capacity to interfere with members of the ZRP investigating this case.\n\nThe accused is a fit candidate for bail. She is a mother of two and the solebreadwinner of her family.\n\nIn addition to her children, she also takes care of a niece who is totally dependent on her and also her mother, aged 70.\n\nMhike said Zaba is of fixed abode, adding that she is employed as an editor.\n\nShe needs to go back to work soon after she recuperates from her current ill health.\n\nThe accused before you is an award-winning journalist well respected in Zimbabwe Media, commercial, human rights and philanthropic circles, he said.\n\nCourt was also told of her other colourful accolades in media circles, including being the Secretary General of the Zimbabwe National Editors Forum (ZINEF), a mentor, and a member of the Women in News organisation, as such a responsible person to be trusted with freedom.\n\nThis shows she is a distinguished member of the society, Mhike said.\n\nThe lawyer also said Zaba did not give the police trouble when she was arrested.\n\nShe made every effort to honour the request by the police for her to attend at the police station.\n\nShe voluntarily walked into Harare Central Police Station in the company of her lawyer.\n\nIt is regrettable that the police did not allow her to go home after the recording of her warned and cautioned statement, he said.\n\nCitizens who honour and respect authorities ought to be spared from harsh prison realities. As indicated, the accused is not feeling well and the veracity of that submission is documented.\n\nHowever, Mhike raised a complaint against the police, saying, Our complaint is that the accused was detained overnight even in the face of comprehensive medical documentation confirming that she was on bed rest on the order of a medical doctor.\n\nJambawu said police officers and some of Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) employees are lined up to testify against Zaba.\n\nZaba is represented by Mhike andNontokozo Dube Tachiona.\n\n",
