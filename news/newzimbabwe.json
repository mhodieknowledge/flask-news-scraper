Phiri further demonstrated that the chameleons tail, once pricked and used in the ritual, would cause death to occur within five days, Magistrate Mayambu said.\n\nThe lawyer for the two men, Agrippa Malando, said his clients pleaded for leniency as they were first-time offenders.\n\nHe urged the court to fine them, but the request was rejected.\n\nMagistrate Mayambu noted that many people in Zambia, like in other African countries, believed in witchcraft, even though it was not scientifically proven.\n\nThe law was designed to protect society from fear and harm caused by those claiming to have the power to carry out acts of witchcraft, he said.\n\nThe question is not whether the accused are wizards or actually possess supernatural powers. It is whether they represented themselves as such, and the evidence clearly shows they did, Magistrate Mayambu said.\n\nIn addition to the two-year sentence they were given for professing witchcraft, the men were sentenced to six months in prison for possessing charms.\n\nAs the sentences will run concurrently, they will serve only two years in prison, effective from the date of their arrest in December 2024.\n\nHichilema has previously said he does not believe in witchcraft. He has not commented on the case.\n\nLawyer Dickson Jere told the BBC that the Witchcraft Act was passed during colonial rule in 1914.\n\nHe said people were very rarely prosecuted for practising witchcraft, but it helped protect elderly women who faced mob justice in villages after being accused of bewitching someone and causing their death.\n\nWitchcraft has also featured prominently in conversations over the protracted dispute between the government and the family of the late President Edgar Lungu over his funeral.\n\nSome people believe that the governments insistence that he should be buried in Zambia, contrary to his familys wishes, may be for occult reasons.\n\nThe government has denied the accusation.\n\nLungu died in South Africa in June, and his body is still in a morgue there because of the failure to reach agreement over his burial.\n\n",

Running to achieve personal goals with every mile completed.\n\nWhen all one needs is a good pair of shoes, running seems like an easy activity to start. However, running requires preparation and training, both physically and mentally.\n\nAn avid runner herself, Camille Worthington, Ph.D., assistant professor and registered dietitian in theUniversity of Alabama at BirminghamDivision of General Internal Medicine and Population Science,discusses an important aspect to ones running success  how to fuel the body.\n\nWhen fueling your body, it is easy to fall behind and hard to catch up, Worthington said. However, proper fueling before, during and after a run is essential to hitting your goals while keeping your body safe and healthy.\n\nProper fueling before, during and after running is essential to hitting goals and keeping your body safe and healthy.\n\nKnow your fuels\n\nComplex carbohydrates have slow digestion and absorption rates. They are a good source for sustained energy, which is needed for longer runs. Complex carbs include whole wheat breads, whole grain crackers and vegetables.\n\nSimple carbs are quickly digested and absorbed. They are sources of quick but short-term energy, which is beneficial during runs when one needs an energy boost. Simple carbs include pasta, white bread, chips, cookies and candy.\n\nProtein offers many benefits for the body. For runners, it plays a crucial role in muscle recovery and helps reduce hunger. Proteins include lean meats, dairy products, eggs, yogurt and nuts.\n\nElectrolytes, such as sodium,help maintain fluid and hydration levels in the body. Electrolytes are lost through sweat during exercise. Low levels can lead to muscle cramps, dehydration and dizziness. Electrolytes are naturally found in such foods as leafy greens, avocados, pickles, nuts and bananas.\n\nProducts such as gels, gummies, water, electrolyte packets, bars and salt tabs are popular fuel sources for runners. They often contain higher concentrations of carbs and electrolytes, such as sodium.\n\nTime it out\n\nProperly timing the intake of the fuels is as important as knowing what fuels to consume, Worthington says.\n\nFuel recommendations prior to a run depend on when one wants to eat. If you eat several hours before, focus on a mix of complex and simple carbs to increase different types of energy within the body. If you prefer eating closer to the run, prioritize simple carbs the body can quickly digest.\n\nStay hydrated with water before the run. For runs longer than an hour or in hot weather, preload with electrolytes.\n\nDuring a run, focus on simple carbs for bursts of energy. Complex carbs during a run can lead to sluggishness and gastrointestinal issues due to their slow digestion rate. Maintaining hydration levels with water, electrolytes and sodium is also a priority.\n\nStay hydrated with water before the run.\n\nFor runs longer than an hour or in hot weather, preload with electrolytes.After a run, mix complex carbs with protein. The carbs restore glucose stores in your liver and muscles that were used during your run. Protein helps with muscle recovery and can satiate hunger. Replenish hydration levels with electrolytes and water.\n\nWorthington suggests post-run snacks such as:\n\nUltimately, the perfect fuel routine comes down to the runners preference. When experimenting, Worthington suggests changing only one fuel source at a time to understand what specific foods and products work best with ones body.\n\nIt is a lot of trial and error. Worry less about the specific product, and more about the fuel source and ingredients, Worthington said. Find what you like, what makes sense for your body and training, and what works best for your budget.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nA CHINESE national, presented as an investor within the gold mining sector, has been convicted for stealing over US$875,000 worth of the precious metal from a local small-scale miner and illegally operating in Mashonaland Easts Makaha area.\n\nDocuments from the Mines Ministry, sourced by NewZimbabwe.com, and a Mutoko Regional Magistrates Court ruling have all exposed a well-coordinated syndicate comprising Zheng Zhangxian, the Chinese investor and a mines official, amongst others.\n\nZheng, who was convicted and had his questionably registered company, Reajin Enterprises, receive a restitution order of US$875,667.67, is reported to have been encroaching on a claim belonging to Emmanuel Ndemeras Koodoo 83 claim for the past four years.\n\nReajin Enterprises had been operating as Takura Mining Syndicate, which held a Special Grant, in some form of partnership with a Zimbabwean partner, Vengai Kurarama.\n\nTakura Mining Syndicates claim was next to Ndemeras, from which they knowingly stole his gold ore.\n\nZheng, up until this year, had been mining 75 metres below the surface of Ndemeras claim where he is said to have stolen over 5,000 tonnes of gold ore.\n\nDocuments in NewZimbabwe.coms possession reveal successful investigations into Zhengs operations and payment of a US$350 bribe to Mines Ministry Inspector Anthony Singende, who has since been dismissed.\n\nSingende, who was part of the ministrys investigating team that provided evidence of blasting and Zhengs ore theft on Ndemeras claim, was not only paid to curtail investigations but went as far as sanctioning continued blasting on the property against ministry guidelines. His criminal case is being pursued at the Marondera Magistrates Court.\n\nThe traverse survey clearly indicates encroachment of a haulage in Adit No. 5 along strike with stoping (active extraction of ore) done above the distance of approximately 75 metres.\n\nWe recommend that Takura Mining Syndicate cease mining operations within the boundary of Ndemera and construct a containment wall 6m inside their own boundary, read a report that followed investigations.\n\nThe 6m is mandated by Statutory Instrument (SI) 109 of 1990 (Mine Management and Safety Regulations).\n\nThe ore was processed at the Chinese-owned Zhangveng Milling Plant according to a letter sent to Ndemera by Provincial Mining Director Tendai Kashiri. The milling plant, together with Zhengs own partnership, was last month exposed to have been operating illegally in the country.\n\nWhereas foreign investors are supposed to be cleared by the Zimbabwe Investments Development Agency (ZIDA), legally bound to form and register companies, the two formed mining syndicates with locals against policies meant to govern foreign investments.\n\nReajin Enterprises was convicted on September 8, this year, of contravening Section 113(1)(a) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act as read with Section 379 of the Mines and Minerals Act (theft of gold ore).\n\nA fine of US$3,000 was imposed, restitution of US$875,667.67 ordered and the entire ore dump was to be returned to Ndemera.\n\n",

I literally lost my mind, said the mother of four who has been in the trade for nearly two decades.\n\nShe recalled leaving her most recent visit to the clinic with only 10 days worth of antiretrovirals.\n\nI could not get condoms, which are a necessity for my work. I was at risk of contracting more infections. My clients were also exposed, she said quickly.\n\nWith US-funded facilities shuttered or empty, the few remaining providers say they are buckling under the pressure.\n\nMedical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which operates independently of US government funding, said its clinics in Harare suburbs like Epworth and Mbare were stretched thin.\n\nThey dont know where to go. They dont know where to seek services, said project lead Charlotte Pignon, referring to patients and especially sex workers.\n\nWhile she did not directly link the rising deaths to the funding cuts, she said the impact of the withdrawal could not be ignored.\n\nIt is difficult to know all the factors that are impacting those numbers but its impossible to say that its not impacted by the US cuts either, she said.\n\nThe scale of the fallout was still coming into focus, said Wonder Mufunda, chief executive of the Harare-headquartered think-tank Centre for Humanitarian Analytics (CHA).\n\nMufunda said US support had previously amounted to about $522 million, with roughly $90 million directed to HIV programmes.\n\nYou wake up and you have lost such funding, there were serious disruptions, he said, warning that deaths could rise.\n\nIts quite a big blow we are talking about, he told AFP.\n\nBeyond overstretched clinics, Zimbabwes economic freefall is pushing more people into sex work with an estimated 40,500 women already engaged in sex work nationwide, according to CHA.\n\nCompetition had eroded the power to insist on safer sex, said 20-year-old Cleopatra Katsande. Some workers were charging as little as 50 US cents per client, far less than the cost of a box of condoms, she said.\n\nFor veteran Ruzvidzo, there was no real choice.\n\nWe knew it wasnt safe, she said of using baby socks as condoms. But I had to feed my children.\n\nThe clients did not seem to mind, she said. When it comes to this moment, men dont think straight.\n\n",

She also conveyed greetings from Vincent Minja, the President of the Tanzania Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (TCCIA).\n\nAmbassador Kaganda emphasized the critical role of the Port of Dar es Salaam in facilitating regional trade. She highlighted that the port plays a vital part in the transportation of vehicles from Japan to Zimbabwe, a factor that prompted the Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) to open an office in Zimbabwe to streamline shipping procedures.\n\nOn his part, Christopher Mugaga expressed gratitude to the Tanzanian leaders for the ongoing cooperation and underscored the importance of increasing visits, meetings, and business forums to further boost trade and investment growth between the two countries.\n\nMugaga also announced that ZNCC is ready to organize and bring a delegation of Zimbabwean businesspeople to Tanzania in June 2026, where they will engage with their counterparts from TCCIA and explore various investment opportunities available in Tanzania.\n\nThese discussions have laid a solid foundation for economic cooperation between Tanzania and Zimbabwe. It is also anticipated that prior to the Africa-Nordic Foreign Ministers Meeting scheduled for October 2025 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, leaders from TCCIA and ZNCC will convene again for in-depth talks aimed at promoting trade and investment for the mutual benefit of both nations.\n\n",
