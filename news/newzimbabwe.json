            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nFINANCE Minister, Mthuli Ncube, says the Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) is driving sustainable growth by undertaking projects of high national impact.\n\nEstablished in 2015 and first known as the Sovereign Wealth Fund, the MIF is Zimbabwes sovereign wealth fund, which is a pool of resources that the government invests for the future.It was renamed in 2023.\n\nPresenting the Mid-Term Budget Review before ParliamentThursday, Ncube expressed confidence in the MIFs potential to spur national sustainable growth.\n\nHe said to date,the Fund has achieved significant strides towards strengthening the governance frameworks and enhancing the financial performance of the portfolio companies under its ambit.\n\nThe Fund has injected capital into a significant number of portfolio companies, most of which have started registering improved performance. The capital deployment to the portfolio companies is guided by the Investment Strategy of the Fund and the diagnostic assessment report, prioritising long-term value creation, stability and prosperity, Ncube said.\n\nInvestments currently under consideration include procurement of buses for the Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (ZUPCO) to minimise public transport challenges, capitalisation of the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) to rehabilitate rail infrastructure and address rolling stock challenges, crafting of sustainable operational models for COTTCO, Air Zimbabwe, Cold Storage Company and Silo Food industries, among others.\n\nThe Fund is also working with the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) on a variety of initiatives to address power shortages, which include enhancing base load, together with the implementation of prepaid, net and smart metering projects.\n\nBased on the current and projected investments in the energy sector, the Fund is optimistic that load shedding will be significantly minimised in the outlook period, not least because of the rehabilitation of Hwange Units 1 to 6 under a Rehabilitate Operate and Transfer concession agreement between Zimbabwe Power Company and Jindal Africa, added Ncube.\n\n",

This brings the debt-to-GDP ratio to 44% as at 31 March 2025, he said.\n\nIn local currency terms, the countrys stock of Public and Publicly Guaranteed (PPG) debt stood at ZiG576.5 billion as at the end of March 2025. The debt was external debt totalling ZiG337.7 billion, and domestic debt amounting to ZiG238.8 billion, representing 58.6% and 41.4% respectively.\n\nThe external and domestic debt arrears as at end March 2025 amounted to US$7.8 billion, constituting 36% of total PPG debt. The accumulation of arrears since the year 2000 have been worsening the country`s debt situation, constraining access to external concessional financing.\n\nIn this regard, the government is implementing the Arrears Clearance and Debt Resolution Roadmap in order to restore debt sustainability and unlock critical external financing needed for the countrys development programs, he said.\n\nDomestic debt service in local currency totalled ZiG1.64 billion, comprising both principal and interest payments during the period January to June 2025.\n\nDuring the period January to June 2025, Treasury made payments amounting to US$176.28 million for external debt service, which includes US$93.72 million towards the active portfolio, US$79.75 million for legacy debts and US$2.81 million of token payments to the International Financial Institutions and the sixteen Paris Club Bilateral Creditors.\n\nOf this, ZiG39.52 million was paid towards interest payments and ZiG1.60 billion for principal payments related to ZiG-denominated Treasury Bills and bonds.\n\n",
