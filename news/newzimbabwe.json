            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAT just 40 years of age, Rinos Mautsa has emerged as a shrewd businessman, overseeing multi-million-dollar enterprises within and outside the country.\n\nHaving shown early shoots of entrepreneurship at a young age, Mautsa has established several business ventures, such as the Contact Experience Association of Zimbabwe (CXAZ), formerly CCAZ, and PICCO Construction, among others.\n\nHis humble and calm demeanour belies the success and scale that his businesses have achieved over the years in Zimbabwes challenging economic environment.\n\nNewZimbabwe.com(NZ)caught up with Mautsa(RM), who described his journey and how his businesses have managed to stay afloat despite turbulence.\n\nNZ:Can you walk us through your professional background?\n\nRM: I have always been an entrepreneur at heart, inspired by my mother, whom I assisted in selling farm produce at a young age. While in college, I launched a movie business through a deal with my university, which ignited my passion for entrepreneurship.\n\nDuring my industrial work experience, I started a condiments buying and selling business that eventually grew to the point of exporting to Zambia. After college, I briefly worked at Telecel, TelOne, and Zuva Petroleum in various managerial roles.\n\nThe leaders at TelOne and Zuva greatly influenced my development as a manager and leader, and I am grateful for their mentorship. My wife, who is also my business partner, has played a significant role in my journey. I am a firm believer in God, and I recognise that I wouldnt be where I am today without His mercy.\n\nQN:Walk us through how you launched your businesses and what inspired the journey.\n\nI started my first business while in college by seizing a unique opportunity to run a movie venture. This experience taught me the importance of innovation and calculated risks. On industrial attachment at Dairibord, I started buying and selling condiments from work and exporting to Zambia.\n\nMy condiments business later flourished, allowing me to reinvest and explore further opportunities in education and technology, which ultimately led me to energy and the construction and real estate sectors, where I recognised significant potential to do much more across Africa.\n\nQN: What has managed to sustain your firms in this difficult economic environment?\n\nOur resilience is rooted in our commitment to quality and innovation. We embrace learning and quickly adapt to change. By identifying the critical need for housing and infrastructure in Zimbabwe, we have focused on developing clusters and high-rise flats that maximise space and align with market demands. This strategic focus has enabled us to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.\n\nQN: You have expanded outside of the country. How has that experience been, and how are the firms performing abroad?\n\nExpanding beyond Zimbabwe has been a rewarding experience, allowing us to tap into new markets and diversify our portfolio. Our firms abroad are performing well as we adapt our strategies to local needs while maintaining the high standards weve established. The Chartered Institute of Customer Management is now operating in 13 countries across Africa.\n\nQN: Your portfolio spans construction (Picco), education, energy, and more. How do you identify opportunities across such diverse sectors, and whats your strategy for scaling them?\n\nIdentifying opportunities across diverse sectors requires a keen understanding of market dynamics and trends. My previous work experience informs many of my ventures.\n\nI focus on thorough research and analysis to pinpoint market gaps. My strategy for scaling involves building strong partnerships, nurturing relationships, leveraging technology, and maintaining a customer-centric approach to meet the evolving needs of our clients.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Labour Court has dismissed an appeal by Watershed College Trust against an arbitral award in favour of a former probationary teacher, ruling that the institution clearly aprobated and reprobated its contractual obligations and acted unlawfully by issuing notice of termination after the expiration of the probation period.\n\nIn a judgment delivered by Justice Samuel Kudya, the court found that while the arbitrator erred in concluding that the teacher, Jenipha Madziva, had become a permanent employee, the substantive award of damages for unfair dismissal remained valid.\n\nWatershed College Trust had challenged the arbitrators ruling on five grounds, including the claim that Madziva was erroneously classified as a permanent employee and that damages were improperly awarded in US dollars. However, Justice Kudya found that only one of the grounds had merit and upheld the rest of the arbitrators findings.\n\nThe employer clearly aprobated and reprobated by writing in the probation contract that it did not intend to extend it, yet it was doing exactly that which it said it did not intend to do, the judge ruled.\n\nThe dispute arose when the school employed Madziva on a fixed-term probation contract, which was due to expire on 31 March 2023.\n\nOn that very day, the school issued a notice stating it would not be extending her contract.\n\nThe arbitrator ruled that this amounted to unlawful termination and awarded damages, prompting the appeal.\n\nKudya criticised the colleges handling of the matter, stating, Had the employer indeed intended to give notice for the termination of the probation contract, it should have done so before its expiration.  It was not remiss for the arbitrator to conclude that once parties were in the April to December phase of the contract, they were now operating in the main contract.\n\nHe added that the colleges attempt to treat the contract as terminated while simultaneously letting it roll into the next phase of employment cannot pass the unreasonableness test laid out in Hama v NRZ.\n\nOn the matter of prejudice, the court noted that unfair dismissal need not be measured by harm suffered.\n\nPrejudice is indeed not a prerequisite to find unlawful termination, Kudya said, affirming the arbitrators position that the dismissal was inherently unfair.\n\nAddressing the employers objection to the damages awarded in US dollars, the court reaffirmed Zimbabwes multi-currency framework.\n\nThere was nothing remiss by making the order which the arbitrator made.  If the employer wants to pay what was ordered using the rate of the local currency at the date of payment, nothing stops it from doing so.\n\nThe judge further dismissed the employers contention that the arbitrator had wrongly quantified the damages.\n\nIt was unnecessary to try to find out what was due when it was apparent on the contract. The res ipsa loquitur principle applies.\n\nThe judge upheld the appeal relating to the employees classification as permanent.\n\nHe ruled that the arbitral award stands, but with the correction that Madziva was not a permanent employee.\n\nWatershed College Trust was ordered to pay costs on the ordinary scale.\n\n",

I think once you show people respect, they know you were raised well. Where you come from becomes a secondary issue.\n\nDespite cultural similarities, Awa Khiwe revealed that her upbringing in a Zimbabwean village in Nkayi prepared her for life in KwaNongoma.\n\nBeing raised in the village helped me shape my cultural identity. The KwaNongoma lifestyle is similar to that of Nkayi its not a huge adjustment.\n\nAwa Khiwe, renowned for championing Ndebele pride on global stages, has opened up about embracing a more traditional role in her personal life.\n\nNow living in a new home, the outspoken rapper revealed that while many know her as a fierce and fearless queen, she proudly takes on the role of being a loved,spoiled and submissive wife to her Zulu husband.\n\nSpeaking candidly, she said she respects both Zulu and Ndebele cultures, describing the union as a beautiful exchange rather than a clash.\n\nAwa said her open-mindedness allows her to find strength in unity and mutual respect, rather than division, even in deeply rooted cultural differences.\n\nVeteran actor Ernest Ndlovu joined Awa Khiwe in KwaNongoma to celebrate her wedding day. Image: Pixel Visuals\n\nWhile fans speculated that new music inspired by the wedding might be on the way, Awa was quick to set the record straight:\n\nI have new music, but it has nothing to do with the wedding, she said. I juggle music and family, Im old enough to handle the situation.\n\nHer husband, a Qwabe man involved in the construction industry, has been in her life for years. The two met through a mutual friend, Macingwana, and nurtured their relationship quietly before tying the knot in a ceremony that honoured both families.\n\nOn social media, she called it the best day of my life and added in a heartfelt tribute:\n\nThank you for keeping your promise, my love. I promise to love, honour, respect and protect you, till death do us part.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nZimbabweand theUKare rekindling diplomatic ties after almost three decades of tension, driven by a global surge in demand for critical minerals thats led the former colonial power to pursue $1 billion in deals with the resource-rich nation.\n\nIn June, the UK dispatched Minister for Africa Lord Ray Collins of Highbury to meet Zimbabwean PresidentEmmerson Mnangagwaand other senior leaders. The trip marked a rare encounter between the two nations officials after years of deteriorating relations, especially under former PresidentRobert Mugabe a vocal critic of Britains 90-year colonial rule of the southern African nation.\n\nCollins described his visit as a mission for economic growth that would lead to a win-win situation for both countries. The British Embassy in Harare echoed that sentiment in the past week, citing a $1 billion pipeline of prospective deals across key sectors such as agriculture, finance, telecommunications, renewable energy and critical minerals that it wants to close.\n\nIt identified the 30-megawatt Vungu solar energy investment as a beacon project and said others will follow soon.\n\nThe UK is working hard to increase trade and investment for mutual benefit, a spokesperson said in an emailed response to questions.\n\nZimbabwes foreign affairs spokesperson didnt respond to a request for comment.\n\nRelations between Zimbabwe and Western powers, including the UK, were largely cordial after independence in 1980, with Britain serving as the countrys biggest trading partner and a key source of aid supporting land reform and economic development. In 1997, the ties deteriorated after Britain refused to fund the land reform program. In a letter that November, the UK government said it had no colonial obligation to finance the program. That sparked tensions between the two countries and fueled debate over land redistribution in Zimbabwe.\n\nTwo years later, Zimbabwe defaulted on loan repayments, andin 2000, it began state-sanctioned farm seizures that displaced 4,500 White farmers and caused agricultural output to plunge. In response, the UK and other Western nations imposed sanctions, citing violations of property rights.\n\nBy 2024, the UK ranked as Zimbabwes 14th-largest trading partner, with total trade valued at $155 million  significantly overshadowed byChinas $3.9 billion and theUnited Arab Emiratess $2.9 billion.\n\nThe UKs renewed engagement with Zimbabwe reflects more than a diplomatic thaw and signals a strategic interest in critical minerals, particularly lithium, said Zaynab Hoosen, senior Africa analyst at Pangea-Risk, a specialist intelligence advisory firm. Zimbabwes substantial lithium reserves offer a timely opportunity to diversify supply chains and reduce reliance on dominant producers.\n\nWestern nations from the US to the UK are scouring the globe for greater access to critical minerals needed for clean energy, military infrastructure, advanced defense systems, semiconductors and electric-vehicle batteries.\n\nThe UK said in a policy paperlast monththat an upcoming critical minerals strategy will highlight the importance of forming targeted growth partnerships.\n\nIts strategy in Africa is undergoing an overhaul from traditional aid toward commercially focused, mutually beneficial ties under its newApproach to Africa,unveiled in June, Hoosen said. Recent moves include an infrastructure partnership withSouth Africa, which builds on existing cooperation in platinum group metals and the UKs first trade and investment mission to Angola, where UK-based firmPensana Plcis advancing theLongonjo Rare Earth Project.\n\nFor Zimbabwe, the benefits go beyond minerals diplomacy, as the stronger ties with the UK offer access to diversified investment, expanded trade and renewed international legitimacy, Hoosen added.\n\nThe improved relations also coincide with Zimbabwes economic diplomacy strategy adopted by its cabinet last month that prioritizes key sectors including mining, manufacturing and agriculture in foreign relations.\n\nZimbabwe is what it is because of the economic endowments that it has, Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Amon Murwira told a post-cabinet briefing on July 29 as he unveiled the new policy. The southern African nation wont hesitate to leverage on its natural resources to further its national interests, he said.\n\n",

We can not have a society that aspires to wear second-hand clothes. It is a serious oxymoron; we have cotton we can not make new clothes. So we wait for the cotton to be exported and clothes to be manufactured, and they are worn before we wear them.\n\nOn the other hand, we have some in our midst wearing second-hand clothes. We must assist each other as a society. We need to deal with it in a sensitive manner, but at the same time, we can not sustain a city based on second-hand clothes.\n\nDespite their importation ban by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), second-hand clothes have provided relief for cash-strapped individuals due to their affordability.\n\nThe ban on the importation of second-hand clothes was implemented by ZIMRA in 2015, but due to porous borders, they continue to flood the streets, being sold at cheaper prices.\n\nIn Harare, second-hand clothes are also sold at night, a practice the government is also banning.\n\nThe Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) has since condemned the move as autocratic, particularly in an economy reliant on the informal sector.\n\nThe Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) notes with deep concern the position taken by the Ministry of Local Government on banning the selling of second-hand clothing and street vending\n\nThis intervention by the Ministry of Local Government is a clear reflection of the failure of the implementation of devolution within the local authority, the decision was made from an autocratic position\n\nThe City of Harare has to run the operations within the City in accordance with Section 264 of the Constitution, the procedure should be done in accordance with the Constitution.\n\nThe informal sector has for years been complementing the formal sector as there has been an emergence of formal businesses operating 24/7 in the CBD over the years, reads the statement by CHRA.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Thursday upheld the tight Monetary Policy stance as a strategy to conserve the local currency.\n\nPresenting the Mid-Term Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), premised under the theme Walking The Talk And Staying The Course, the central bank governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu, once again stated that the bank was receiving widespread acclaim for its sustained exchange rate stability.\n\nThe RBZ projected inflation to end the year at around 30%, giving a positive real interest rate of 5% and maintained the Bank Policy rate at 35% despite sustained outcry from industry on the need to ease the cost of borrowing.\n\nThe high policy rate has choked productivity in the recent past by worsening the cost of capital to fund critical industry needs. However, on its part, the RBZ believes that such rates are necessary to curb speculative borrowing.\n\nOn bank charges, the MPS implored banks to adhere to the measures announced in the February 2025 Monetary Policy Statement to exempt from bank charges all accounts that maintain a balance below US$100 or its equivalent in ZiG.\n\nIn addition, Point of Sale (POS) transactions for amounts less than US$5 or its equivalent in ZiG were also exempted from transaction charges for both banking institutions and Payment System Providers (PSPs).\n\nWhile a noble step, the move falls far short of addressing the thorn in flesh for the transacting public who are ordinarily forced to part ways with US$3,00 per every US$100 withdrawn from banks, a position which increases the cost of doing business, especially for corporates who withdraw large volumes of money.\n\nThe current statutory reserve requirements are set between 15% and 30% depending on the nature of the deposits. Banking institutions can, therefore, easily reduce the effective statutory reserve requirements towards 15% by attracting more long-term deposits.\n\nThe statutory reserve ratios, therefore, remain unchanged and will be reviewed when appropriate and consistent with the monetary policy thrust, reads the MPS in part.\n\nThis is despite complaints from the banking sector alleging that high statutory reserves are mopping up excess resources necessary to support productive lending.\n\nThe MPS maintained the export surrender thresholds at 30% but did not address the pertinent concerns raised by exporters who allege they have not been paid the ZWG portion for a prolonged period of time in what experts believe to be one of the strategies to protect the local unit.\n\nMarket watchers suspect that the move to withhold the export surrender thresholds for fear of weakening ZWG is an indication of a currency facing the crisis of fragility.\n\nDespite having triggered fears across the markets on impending monocurrency by 2030, Dr Mushayavanhus MPS did not disclose the practical roadmap to his course of action, instead opting to give assurances of a workable process.\n\nThe de-dollarisation roadmap will be crystallised in the National Development Strategy II and the Reserve Bank, which is chairing the NDS2 Thematic Working Group on Macroeconomic Stability and Financial Deepening (MESFIND) is currently seized with consultations on the issue.\n\nThe roadmap will undoubtedly encapsulate the need to maintain the current stability, preserve the foreign currency accounts and the value of the existing USD-denominated contracts. Consideration will always be made to ensure that there is business continuity and certainty, the MPS added.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nSocial media personality Melody Natalie Mhandu, popularly known as Enchantress, was on Thursday hauled before a Mbare magistrate accused of casting a spell on her former friend Tatenda Butau.\n\nMhandu (34) was charged with engaging in practices commonly associated with witchcraftas defined in section 98 (i) of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act Chapter 9.23.\n\nShe was released unconditionally after briefly appearing in court.\n\nThe state alleged that on August 4 and at Churu Farm, Mhandu unlawfully committed the offence by writing Tatendas name and others on a red cloth which she wrapped around a knife and sprinkled snuff powder before burying it under amuhachatree in a bid to cast a spell on her.\n\nAccording to State papers, Mhandu did this with the help of a traditional healer, Christine Matashu, also known as Manjenjenje.\n\nHer former helper, Elizabeth Mharirire, wrote a statement telling the court that Mhandu asked her to accompany her to see Manjenjenje when the ritual was performed.\n\nMharirire said she later found snuff powder in her room and bathroom before confronting Mhandu about it.\n\nThe two had an altercation before she told Mhandu that she could no longer work for her, given the circumstances.\n\nThe maid later told Butau that her former employer had bewitched her.\n\nShe then accompanied her and her boyfriend to the spot where Mhandu allegedly performed the rituals.\n\nButau dug up the cloth and knife before she confronted Mhandu.\n\nThe matter was also reported to the police.\n\nMhandu denies the allegations.\n\nThrough her lawyer, Mhandu said she was never at Churu Farm on August 4 as alleged.\n\nShe will specifically deny putting Tatenda Butaus name or any other name for that purpose on a red cloth as alleged or at all.\n\nShe will deny having wrapped any red cloth with a dagger and snuff powder and burying it underground as alleged or at all.\n\nShe will deny having any intention to harm or realising the real risk or possibility of harming any person as alleged or at all.\n\nShe will tell the court that she does not know any ritualist by whatever name. She never visited any either alone or with any other person as alleged or at all.\n\nShe did not cast any spell on anyone as alleged or at all, read her defence outline.\n\nThe lawyer said his client will tell the court that the charges are a malicious fabrication of a vindictive former maid who is manipulating the current bad blood between the accused and the complainant.\n\nThe former maid had been relieved of her duties and is bitter about it.\n\nMhandu also said Butau filed the current report as a social media blitz against her and for the purpose of countering a report she made against her at Highlands Police Station on 4 August 2025 under RRB Number 6440490.\n\nShe will also state that the allegations against her do not amount to any practice associated with witchcraft.\n\nFurther, the allegations are vague and embarrassing. They are only meant as a public show for the purposes of causing embarrassment and humiliation of the accused, said the lawyer, praying that the court returns a verdict of not guilty and acquits her of any wrongdoing.\n\n",
