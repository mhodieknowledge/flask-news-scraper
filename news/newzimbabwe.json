It reflects how press freedom is increasingly being disrespected, which is deeply concerning.\n\nEven with the repeal of repressive legislation, journalists continue to be arrested and their safety compromised.\n\nInstead of making progress, we are taking steps backwards in respecting free expression and democracy in Zimbabwe.\n\nPress freedom is under attack, and we need as much solidarity as possible, Nyamutumbu said.\n\nZabas arrest comes soon after another journalist from Alpha Media Holdings, Blessed Mhlanga, was arrested and spent three months in pre-trial detention for interviewing a war veteran, Blessed Geza, who had called for President Emmerson Mnangagwas immediate ouster.\n\n",

Collaborating with Nvidia gives us the advanced computing capabilities needed to drive Africas AI innovation while strengthening the continents digital independence, Masiyiwa stated in a press release.\n\nNvidia will reportedly implement thousands of GPUs, which power its high-performance supercomputers, and intertwine its AI software using NVIDIA Cloud Partner reference architectures.\n\nCassava president Hardy Pemhiwa revealed that 3,000 Nvidia GPUs would be embedded into their South African facility in June before installing 9,000 more across Kenya, Nigeria, Morocco, and Egypt over the next three to four years. Masiyiwa,Bloombergreports, is prepared to invest up to $720 million in the project.\n\nThe future comes from young people building apps and solutions, small businesses every day across this continent using AI, Masiyiwa said at the Global AI Summit on Africa 2025 in Kigali in April where he was a co-chair. They are the digital natives, and we just have given them the ability to do what they do best.\n\nAfrica has the unprecedented opportunity of becoming a global tech leader, boasting ample resources, worldwide investment, and the biggest (and youngest) untapped market in the world.\n\nAround 600 million Africans still lack reliable access to electricity, a figure that experts believe will subside thanks to the continents push for renewable energy and growing access to mobile internet services, such as Starlink.\n\nFintechs and AI startups are abundant from Nairobi to Accra, but the continents limited tech infrastructure and low digital literacy rates continue to squeeze its known potential of leading the AI revolution.\n\nThe Future of Jobs Report 2025by the World Economic Forum identified a critical skills gap in Africa, with over 60% of companies believing it to be one of the most significant barriers to business transfer formation by 2030.\n\nNew, cutting-edge technology now beckons for the continent; Nvidia-powered AI factories are set to seemingly streamline AI development through an optimized ecosystem supporting algorithm development, model experimentation, and data pipelines.\n\nAkin to a startup incubator, but on a mass, online scale, the proposed AI factory is designed to foster innovation and accelerate African AI development by connecting local businesses, governments, and researchers to high-performance AI infrastructure while alleviating them from the financial burdensome Nvidia-built GPUs cost thousands of dollarsof investing in hardware.\n\nBuilding digital infrastructure for the AI economy is a priority if Africa is to take full advantage of the fourth industrial revolution, added Masiyiwa in the press statement.\n\nOur AI Factory provides the infrastructure for this innovation to scale, empowering African businesses, startups, and researchers with access to cutting-edge AI infrastructure to turn their bold ideas into real-world breakthroughsand now, they dont have to look beyond Africa to get it.\n\n",

Bus crews, you name them, they are surviving through the money. They report they were paid police officers.\n\nNcube explained that there was a need for the whole country to vigorously campaign against corruption.\n\nCorruption is running in our nerves because police cannot corrupt themselves alone. Someone is giving them money.\n\nSomeone is enticing them because the person doesnt want to pay the necessary dues to the government. Maybe you define it as $20, but the person is not willing to pay that $20. And its enticing the police officer to pay $30.\n\nSo its corruption across the world.

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/can-trump-strip-musk-and-mamdani-of-their-us-citizenship/",
            "content": "Al Jazeera\n\nUS President Donald Trump and officials from his administration have hinted that they might consider revoking the US citizenship ofZohran Mamdani, New York Citys Democratic mayoral candidate.\n\nSeparately, Trump said former aideElon Muskwould have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa amid a row over histax breaks and Trumps narrowly passed spending bill.\n\nBut would the Trump administration have the power to revoke the citizenship of Mamdani and Musk, both foreign-born, naturalised citizens of the US?\n\nMamdani, 33, was born in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, to ethnically Indian parents. He moved to New York at the age of seven and became a naturalised US citizen in 2018.\n\nMusk was born in 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa to a Canadian mother and South African father. At the age of 17, he moved to Canada of where he is also a citizen. In 1992, he moved to the US to study at the University of Pennsylvania. He became a naturalised US citizen in 2002, according to a biography of him written in 2023 by journalist Walter Isaacson.\n\nIn October 2024, the Washington Post reported that Musk began his career in the US without the proper work authorisation, but Musk has denied this. I was in fact allowed to work in the US, Musk wrote in an X post on the same day the report was published. I was on a J-1 visa that transitioned to an H1-B, Musk wrote in another post. A J-1 visa is a temporary visa for foreign students, while an H-1B is a temporary work visa.\n\nTo become naturalised as a US citizen, an individual needs to be above the age of 18 and to have lived continuously in the US as a green card holder for five years, or three years if they are married to a US citizen.\n\nAndy Ogles, a Republican Tennessee representative, wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi on June 26, asking for the Department of Justice to probe whether Mamdani, who identifies as ademocratic socialist, should be subject to denaturalisation proceedings.\n\nPosting a copy of the letter to Bondi on his X page, Ogles wrote: Zohran little muhammad Mamdani is an antisemitic, socialist, communist who will destroy the great City of New York. He needs to be DEPORTED. Which is why I am calling for him to be subject to denaturalization proceedings.\n\nOgles said that the investigation should be conducted on the grounds that Mamdani may have procured US citizenship through willful misrepresentation or concealment of material support for terrorism.\n\nThe Tennessee Republican cited reports, including an article published in the New York Post, stating that Mamdani expressed solidarity with individuals convicted of terrorism-related offenses prior to becoming a US citizen. Ogles said that Mamdani rapped Free the Holy Land Five / My guys.\n\nThe Holy Land Foundation was convicted in 2008 for providing material support to Hamas, a designated foreign terrorist organization. Publicly praising the Foundations convicted leadership as my guys raises serious concerns about whether Mr. Mamdani held affiliations or sympathies he failed to disclose during the naturalization process, Ogles wrote in his letter to Bondi.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Mamdani has recently refused opportunities to reject the pro-terrorist rallying cry to globalize the intifada a call to expand violent attacks on civilians to the United States and around the world, Ogles wrote.\n\nMamdani has also pledged to stop masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from deporting our neighbours. When Trump was asked about this on Tuesday at a news conference, he said that if Mamdani prevents ICE agents from conducting deportation operations, Well, then, well have to arrest him.\n\nWe dont need a communist in this country, but if we have one, Im going to be watching over him very carefully on behalf of the nation, Trump said, adding, well send him money, well send him all the things he needs to run the government.\n\nTrump continued, citing claims that Mamdani is in the US illegally, saying, Were going to look at everything. The president also voiced support for the current New York mayor, Eric Adams, who is also a member of the Democratic Party.\n\nMamdani posted a statement on his X account in response to Trumps comments on Tuesday.\n\nThe President of the United States just threatened to have me arrested, stripped of my citizenship, put in a detention camp and deported. Not because I have broken any law but because I will refuse to let ICE terrorize our city, Mamdani wrote in his statement.\n\nMamdani also called Trumps praise of Adams unsurprising, adding: At the very moment when MAGA Republicans are attempting to destroy the social safety net, kick millions of New Yorkers off of healthcare and enrich their billionaire donors at the expense of working families, it is a scandal that Eric Adams echoes this Presidents division, distraction and hate. Voters will resoundingly reject it in November.\n\nWhile the billionaire owner of Tesla and SpaceX was once a key aide to Trump and a major donor to his presidential campaign last year, Trumps Big Beautiful Bill has created a public rift between Trump and Musk.\n\nMusk has repeatedly decried the bill online and has threatened to forma new political partyas a response to the bill passing.\n\nMusk stands to be affected by the finance bill that the Senate narrowly passed on Tuesday, as it ends tax credits worth up to $7,500 for purchases of electric vehicles (EVs) from September 30. This could significantly reduce consumer demand for EVs in the US.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump wrote, Without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE.\n\nPerhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!! Trump added, in reference to theDepartment of Government Efficiency, an advisory body aimed at boosting government efficiency and upgrading information technology, that Musk formed and led at the start of Trumps second administration, before leaving on May 30.\n\nOn Tuesday, when reporters asked Trump if he was going to deport Musk, he said, Well have to take a look. We might have to put DOGE on Elon.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, US citizens by naturalisation can lose their status as citizens. This process is also called denaturalisation.\n\nThis can happen if naturalised citizens commit certain crimes, including terrorism, war crimes, human rights violations, sex crimes or naturalisation fraud, meaning they obtained their citizenship through fraud, misrepresentation or illegal procurement.\n\nOn June 11, the Justice Department issued a memo stating that it would prioritise denaturalisation by instituting civil proceedings for people if they either illegally procured naturalization or procured naturalization by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.\n\nThe memo added: The Civil Division shall prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence.\n\nA naturalised citizen can also lose their citizenship if they commit an act of treason against the US, or run for public office or join the military of a foreign country.\n\nMost recently, the Justice Department announced on June 13 that UK citizen Elliott Duke, a convicted collector and distributor of child sexual abuse material, had been denaturalised. In a news release, the Justice Department said Duke enlisted in the US Army in 2012 and began receiving and sending child sex abuse material online while serving in Germany. Duke did not list this crime in his naturalisation application in 2013. He was convicted of receipt and possession of child pornography in 2014.\n\nIt is not likely, according to experts.\n\nDenaturalisation is limited to cases where the government can prove material fraud in their original applications, said Michael Kagan, professor of law at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\nIt is rare and unlikely for either Musk or Mamdani. This appears to be irresponsible rhetoric designed to intimidate political opponents.\n\nThe US has revoked the citizenship of naturalised citizens on different occasions over the past few decades.\n\nCases of denaturalisation were more frequent during the first half of the 20th century while the two world wars and, later, the Cold War with the Soviet Union were ongoing. Between 1926 and the mid-1940s, hundreds of people were denaturalised every year, according to political scientist Patrick Weil, author of The Sovereign Citizen, published in 2017.\n\nThe US government frequently tried to denaturalise citizens during the two Red Scare periods of 1917 to 1920 and 1947 to 1957, when the fear of communism was particularly high in the US. During this time, it was also very hard to obtain US citizenship by naturalisation.\n\nPeople who were denaturalised at the time included communists and Nazi sympathisers. Two famous cases were:\n\nIn 1967, the trend for denaturalisation slowed down when the US Supreme Court ruled that a US citizen could not be involuntarily deprived of their citizenship unless they met the specific criteria of having obtained naturalisation by fraud or of having committed serious offences.\n\nThe ruling came at the end of a case involving Beys Afroyim, who was born in Poland and became a naturalised US citizen in 1926. The US government tried to revoke his citizenship because Afroyim had voted in an Israeli legislative election in 1951.\n\nIn ruling this, the Supreme Court repealed a US federal law which said that US citizens could lose their citizenship if they vote in a foreign election.\n\n",

Any attempt to impose partisan ideology on judges through training programmes conducted by the Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology would undermine the rule of law and erode public trust.\n\nI mean, not even Chitepo himself would abase himself to the point of receiving training from this school named after him. We stand in defence of judicial independence, honouring the legacy of those who fought for justice and fairness. In Chitepos name; lets collectively rage against this unnecessary attack on judicial independence, Mpofu said.\n\nThe Chitepo School of Ideology has stirred controversy in the country; last year, there was uproar over Local Government Minister Daniel Garwes invitation to all councillors, including those from the opposition, to attend the workshop in Harare.\n\n",
