This publication has it on good authority that the executive has advised players to find alternative clubs as Dinson Mvuma can nolonger manage their upkeep.\n\nIn the letter, the struggling club also revealed that it has failed to pay referees for their last two home fixtures and the financial situation is now dire.\n\nYou may have realised that we have failed to pay match officials adequately and properly in our last two home games, a result of that financial squeeze which has caught us unaware as the company had not communicated their position when the league started.\n\nConsequently our players have all left camp and we are unable to raise a team for this weekends fixture.\n\nWe are fully aware of the huge inconveniences our request will cause but we think this will allow us time to restrategise and be able to run the team through the season, further read the letter.\n\nDinson Mvuma is currently in the relegation zone occupying position 16 on the log with five points from seven games.\n\n",

These include; drug and substance abuse, gender-based violence, child pregnancies and early child marriages, among others.\n\nI call upon traditional leaders, and the ministries responsible for Social Welfare as well as Primary and Secondary Education, among other stakeholders, to scale up the implementation of concrete interventions for the benefit of our children and the youth, who are the future of this nation, Mnangagwa said.\n\nZimbabwe is grappling with an alarming rise in drug and substance abuse cases, particularly among the youth.\n\nAt the same time womens rights statistics say that nearly half of the countrys female population has been subjected to GBV, while child marriages still persist with one in three women having been married in childhood.\n\nThe President also said the government has committed to investing in education, infrastructure, and the arts to support cultural preservation, creative industries, and the development of cultural centres.\n\nFrom the governments side, we stand ready to invest in education, infrastructure, and the arts as well as to support initiatives that promote cultural preservation and the creative industries.\n\nFunds have also been set aside to establish, renovate, and equip culture centres across the country. These centres will serve as hubs for preserving and promoting Zimbabwes diverse cultural heritage, including traditional music, dance, art, and crafts.\n\nAdditionally, the development of film studios to boost the local film industry, along with funding for infrastructure, equipment, and capacity building programmes for filmmakers, are being supported and prioritised.\n\n",
