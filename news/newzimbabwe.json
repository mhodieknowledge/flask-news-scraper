The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. You spoke on sustainable infrastructure development at the CEOAfrica AnnualRoundtable in Victoria Falls. What is your position on sustainable infrastructure development in the African context, considering that Africa is a low global contributor to world pollution?\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nAs a point of correction, I spoke on legal considerations for unlocking finances for sustainable infrastructure development. My focus was really on the different mechanisms available to unlock finance for funding infrastructure projects in Zimbabwe, the continent and around the world.\n\nTo your question, sustainable development is a global reality despite various individual contrary views on whether it is necessary or fair. There is a plethora of legislation and policy entrenched in financing institutions that fund global development projects. They (the financial institutions) have, as a prerequisite, the condition that the projects be conscious of ESGs, being environmental, social impact and governance considerations.\n\nA debate on its necessity, especially as 54 separate African countries, is in my view, an uphill task and the logical thing will be for each to benefit from the funds available and develop the individual countries for the collective benefit\n\nReporter:Lets then start with the continental position. What legal and financial instruments are available for infrastructure development that is sustainable?\n\nVM: We have a number of funds that promote infrastructure development that are premised on sustainability by taking into consideration the environment and social impacts. An example will be Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA), Green Climate Fund and even the African Development Bank also prescribes infrastructure projects to establish sustainability.\n\nThis is not just a continental requirement, even when unlocking global international finance, institutions are guided by the Equator Principles and International Finance Corporation performance standards, which have at their core, requirements for the financing institution to satisfy itself that the projects being funded are environmentally sustainable.\n\nIf we were to also look East, being global financial giants, China in 2021 also implemented the Green Development Guidelines for Overseas Investment and Cooperation and is also considering sustainability in its funding mechanisms.\n\nTo the second part of your question on sustainable infrastructure development, on the continent, we are guided by the African Union Agenda 2063 being a blueprint of Africas structural transformation.\n\nFurther, we also have the Programme for Infrastructure Development (PIDA) with a priority action plan or mandate to give preference to cross-border projects in energy, water and transport, among other things. These projects, as you can see at face value, have serious environmental and social considerations.\n\nThen there is the African Free Trade Organisation, which makes sustainable infrastructure a treaty-based obligation. The harmonisation of the continental laws and individual state laws is now a legal and economic necessity.\n\nReporter: Before discussing what the position in Zimbabwe is, what are the things investors generally consider when investing in infrastructure development?\n\nVM: Well like in every investment transaction, the investor is concerned mainly with whether he or she will attain enforceable rights, whether or not there are predictable timelines within the project and key to all, whether the project has taken into consideration and mitigated against any potential environmental and social impact, allowing maximum protection to the potentially affected.\n\nReporter: What is then our Zimbabwe position in terms of sustainable infrastructure development?\n\nVM: I will reiterate what I said at the CEO roundtable conference, my view is that our laws in terms of sustainable infrastructure development are well developed and competitive on the continent.\n\nSustainability is a constitutional, legislative and policy question in Zimbabwe as it is covered by all pillars of the prescriptive and guidance laws in our country.\n\nOur weakness is that the laws are fragmented and found in various statutes that address the different areas where sustainability is a question. Although the Environmental Management Act is the overarching legislation, aligning with the prescriptive terms of our constitution, other legislation like your Water Act, Electricity Act, ZIDA and many other have sustainability considerations.\n\nThe National Development Strategy 2, commencing in 2026, has put sustainable development goals at the core of its policy.\n\nCountries like Kenya have managed to amalgamate these laws into a single reference legislation, making them more attractive to sustainable infrastructure development financing. Although we have a National Climate Policy, our National Climate Management Bill, which will harmonise these laws, is going through the legislative processes with the objective of having a national reference point.\n\nReporter: Would you then advise that ESGs be part of all sustainable infrastructure development plans for investors? If yes, what would your reasons be?\n\nVM: With the risk of sounding like a broken record, international finance can mostly be accessed by companies that can show project environmental and social impacts, including mitigation and remediation options.\n\nIt therefore widens the areas where the developer can access development finance.\n\nInclusion of ESG considerations future proofs projects because most African countries, with Zimbabwe included, are incorporating or perfecting the laws that deal with climate issues.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr Madzima. We have to end here because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nLimpopo Premier Dr Phophi Ramathuba has describedthe deadly N1 bus crash that claimed 43 livesas a preventable disaster and an act of criminal negligence, following revelations that the vehicle was overloaded, unroadworthy and speeding when it plunged down a steep embankment near Louis Trichardt last week.\n\nOn Monday, Ramathuba met with the families and relatives of the deceased at Siloam Hospital in the Vhembe District, where she extended her condolences and expressed solidarity with those mourning the loss of their loved ones. Addressing the gathering, she said the tragedy was not an unavoidable act of fate but the result of lawlessness and greed within the cross-border transport industry.\n\nThe victims  mostly Zimbabwean and Malawian nationals  were travelling home when the bus veered off the N1 North near Louis Trichardt on 13 October, killing 43 passengers and injuring 40 others.\n\nAccording to a technical report by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), the bus was operating without meeting roadworthiness standards, carried passengers beyond its legal limit and was travelling at an unsafe speed along a mountainous route. Ramathuba said such conditions made the tragedy not just an accident, but a crime against humanity.\n\nThe government will not allow lives to be lost due to greed, lawlessness and disregard for human life, she said. We condemn reckless driving, non-compliance with transport regulations, and the operation of unroadworthy vehicles. The law must take its course, and those responsible must be held accountable.\n\nLimpopo Premier Dr Phophi Ramathuba\n\nRamathuba also commended the emergency services and hospital staff who responded to the scene, saying their swift action saved lives under difficult and dangerous conditions. Our rescue teams risked their own lives to retrieve bodies and transport survivors to safety. Their commitment gave dignity to the deceased and comfort to the grieving, she said.\n\nThe Limpopo government has partnered with the diplomatic missions of Zimbabwe and Malawi to identify and repatriate the deceased. Forensic teams have completed postmortem examinations and begun DNA testing to ensure accurate identification of remains.\n\nFamilies of the victims were provided with counselling and logistical support as they began the painful process of identifying their loved ones.\n\nThe tragedy has reignited concerns over South Africas road safety record and the persistent operation of unsafe, overloaded cross-border buses. Transport experts and activists have long warned that weak enforcement and corruption in vehicle inspections allow dangerous operators to remain on the road, turning long-distance routes into death corridors.\n\nFor many families, the loss goes beyond the immediate grief  it also means the loss of breadwinners who had been working in South Africa to support relatives in neighbouring countries.\n\nEvery life lost on our roads is a blow to a family, a community, and to our shared humanity, Ramathuba said.\n\nAs the province continues to assist with repatriations and investigations, the premier urged all road users to prioritise safety and accountability.\n\nLife has no duplicate, she said.\n\nEvery journey must begin with responsibility. Let us not wait for another disaster to remind us of the value of a single human life.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL law expert Professor Lovemore Madhuku has trashed Zanu PFs attempts to illegally extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas second term to 2030.\n\nDespite initially professing ignorance, analysts believe it is now clear Mnangagwa wants to hang on beyond his constitutionally mandated two terms using a combination of possible legal lacuna, manipulation of constitutional provisions and monetary rewards for Parliamentarians.\n\nMadhuku, who is strongly opposed to the idea, was speaking to online news platform 263Chat.\n\nWe do not know how they intend to do it; they have not indicated how they would want to amend the constitution but what is very clear is that it is not possible to ensure that when the presidents term ends in 2028, he remains in office beyond 2028, said Madhuku.\n\nThere is no legal mechanism of doing it as it currently stands.\n\nPassed as a resolution at Zanu PFs Bulawayo congress in 2024, extending Mnangagwas term has dominated Zimbabwean politics since then, further dividing an already fragile society that is still traumatised by late President Robert Mugabes lengthy stay in power.\n\nMugabe was in power for 37 years, eventually losing power in a military-backed coup in 2017.\n\nWith Section 91 (2) limiting Presidents stay in office to two five-year terms and demanding a referendum to change it, Zanu PF is understood to have devised a way around it, completely avoiding the general populations involvement.\n\nAdded Madhuku: The kind of amendments they are talking about are not possible without a referendum. There are a few things you can amend without going for a referendum but if you want to tamper with the term of office of the president, the exercise of executive powers or the structure of the state, you cannot avoid a referendum.\n\nThis idea of avoiding a referendum means that they know that this proposal is not popular with the people.\n\nExiled former government minister, Jonathan Moyo, who is behind a document (Breaking Barriers Initiative) said to not just map the way for Zanu PF but suspend elections, believes Mnangagwas term can legally be lengthened without going to a referendum.\n\nA well-respected think-tank, Moyos work with Zanu PF indicates a party determined to extend Mnangagwas term, which will mean shutting the door of succession on his deputy Constantino Chiwenga, who is eagerly waiting for a shot at the presidency.\n\nThe Constitutions sole presidential term limit on the officeholder lies in Section 91(2)s two-term bar, which would remain untouched by a term length amendment to Section 95(2)(b), said Moyo on X.\n\nAmending section 95(2)(b) to seven years, for instance, would simply recalibrate this flexible duration, enabling the extension to 2030 via a two-thirds vote in each House in Parliamentfree from the dictates of sections 328(6) (9).\n\nProfessor Lovemore Madhuku\n\nAttempts to extend Mnangagwas stay are part of factional fights within the ruling party.\n\nMnangagwas continued stay will be a boon for his preferred successor, businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei, who recently joined the partys powerful Central Committee.\n\nFor Chiwenga, it would mean going back to the drawing board, or as some have predicted, planning and executing another coup as he did in 2017.\n\nIt is wrong for any political party on its own to want to impose a constitution on the people, added Madhuku.\n\nTerm limits are actually imposed to limit very good presidents. They were invented to ensure that a person would not remain in office merely because they were doing wellwhich is why some of the best presidents have had to leave.\n\nTerm limits are for good presidents; you do not need term limits for a poor president who will obviously be removed in an election.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nNicolas Sarkozy has become the first French ex-president to go to jail, as he starts a five-year sentence for conspiring to fund his election campaign with money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nNot since World War Two Nazi collaborationist leader Philippe Ptain was jailed for treason in 1945 has any French ex-leader gone behind bars.\n\nSarkozy, who was president from 2007-2012, has appealed against his jail term at La Sant prison, where he will occupy a small cell in the its isolation wing.\n\nMore than 100 people applauded and shouted Nicolas! as he left his villa in the exclusive 16th district of Paris, holding his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy by the hand.\n\nHis son Louis, 28, had appealed to supporters for a show of support, while another son, Pierre, called for a message of love  nothing else, please.\n\nNicolas Sarkozy, 70, was driven through the entrance of the notoriously overcrowded 19th-Century prison in the Montparnasse district south of the River Seine at 09:40 local time (07:40 GMT), while dozens of police officers cordoned off most of the surrounding streets.\n\nHe continues to protest his innocence in the highly controversial Libyan money affair and posted a message on X as he was driven to the jail, saying: I have no doubt. Truth will prevail. But how crushing the price will have been.\n\nWith unwavering strength I tell [the French people] it is not a former president they are locking up this morning  it is an innocent man, he wrote. Do not feel sorry for me because my wife and my children are by my side but this morning I feel deep sorrow for a France humiliated by a will for revenge.\n\nMoments after Sarkozy entered jail, his lawyer Christophe Ingrain said a request for his release had been filed. Nothing justified his imprisonment, said Mr Ingrain, adding: Hell be inside for at least three weeks or a month.\n\nSarkozy has said he wants no special treatment at La Sant prison, although he has been put in its isolation section for his own safety as other inmates are infamous drugs dealers or have been convicted for terror offences.\n\nSarkozys cell in the prisons isolation wing is believed to be on the top floor and will measure between 9-11 sq m (95-120 sq ft). There had earlier been talk of him serving his term in the another wing for vulnerable people, where other VIPs have been jailed in the past.\n\nHe will have a toilet, a shower, a desk, a small electric hob and a small TV, for which he will have to pay a monthly 14 (12) fee, and the right to a small fridge.\n\nThe former president has the right to receive information from the outside world and family visits as well as written and phone contact.\n\nBut he is in effect in solitary confinement, allowed just one hour a day for exercise, by himself in the wings segregated courtyard.\n\nConditions of detention in an isolation wing are pretty hard, La Sant ex-deputy head Flavie Rault told BFMTV. You are alone, all the time. The only contact you have is with prison staff. You never come across another detainee for security reasons and theres a type of social isolation which makes life difficult.\n\nAt the end of last week, Sarkozy was received at the lyse Palace by President Emmanuel Macron, who told reporters on Monday it was normal that on a human level I should receive one of my predecessors in that context.\n\nMacron stressed on Tuesday that it was not his role to comment on or criticise judicial decisions, but he said it was normal that for many in France the sight of a president jailed by this judicial decision would provoke comment.\n\nIn a further measure of official support for the ex-president, Justice Minister Grald Darmanin said he would go to visit him in prison as part of his role in ensuring Sarkozys safety and the proper functioning of the jail.\n\nI cannot be insensitive to a mans distress, he added.\n\nEver since he left office in 2012, Sarkozy has been dogged by criminal inquiries and for months had to wear an electronic tag around his ankle after a conviction last December for trying to bribe a magistrate for confidential information about a separate case.\n\nLate next month, Frances highest administrative court will give its verdict on Sarkozys appeal against a six-month jail term in another illegal campaign financing case known as the Bygmalion affair.\n\nAhead of his arrival at La Sant prison, Sarkozy gave a series of media interviews, telling La Tribune: Im not afraid of prison. Ill keep my head held high, including at the prison gates.\n\nSarkozy has always denied doing anything wrong in a case involving allegations that his 2007 presidential campaign was funded by millions of euros in Libyan cash.\n\nThe former centre-right leader was cleared of personally receiving the money but convicted of criminal association with two close aides, Brice Hortefeux and Claude Guant, for their role in secret campaign financing from the Libyans.\n\nThe two men both had talks with Gaddafis intelligence chief and brother-in-law in 2005, a meeting arranged by a Franco-Lebanese intermediary called Ziad Tiakeddine, who died in Lebanon shortly before Sarkozys conviction.\n\nAs he lodged an appeal, Sarkozy is still considered innocent but he has been told he must go to jail in view of the exceptional seriousness of the facts.\n\nSarkozy said he would take two books with him into prison, a life of Jesus by Jean-Christian Petitfils and the Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumass classic story of a man wrongly imprisoned who escapes to wreak vengeance on his prosecutors.\n\n",
