            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Supreme Court of Appeal has dismissed with costs the Department of Home Affairs attempt to overturn an interim interdict, previously granted in favour of the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation, protectingnearly 200,000 Zimbabwean Exemption Permit (ZEP) holdersagainst arrest and deportation.\n\nAfter winning Part A of the court wrangle, the federation will be heading back to the court, for Part B, to argue before court that the Department of Home Affairs overreached in 2021, when the then home affairs minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced the termination of the ZEP.\n\nThe special permit dispensation has allowed 180,000 Zimbabwean nationals to live and work in South Africa since 2009.\n\nIn the federations view, the jurisdiction to terminate the ZEP lies with Parliament, not the minister.\n\nIOL had an interview with Vindren Magadzire, director of the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation who said his organisations case revolves around the termination of the ZEP programme by the minister of home affairs.\n\nVindren Magadzire, director of the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation Image:Supplied\n\nThe programme allowed approximately 180,000 Zimbabweans to live and work in South Africa. In 2021, the minister of home affairs announced plans to terminate the ZEP permits, sparking legal actions from the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation, Magadzire told IOL.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Immigration Federation was inspired to go through courts due to the South African minister of home affairs decision to terminate the permits. The decision would have significant implications for approximately 180,000 Zimbabweans living and working in South Africa under the ZEP permit program.\n\nMagadzire said his organisation is requesting the superior court to declare the termination of the ZEP permits unlawful, setting aside the termination decision, and protecting permit holders rights.\n\nIn Magadzires view, a lasting solution would be granting the ZEP holders permanent residence status in South Africa.\n\nThe latest development in the court case is that the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed the minister of home affairs appeal. This decision upholds a Johannesburg High Court interdict that shields approximately 180,000 ZEP holders from arrest and deportation, said Magadzire.\n\nLast year,IOL reported thatthe High Court in Pretoria heard arguments from the Helen Suzman Foundation to enforce the courts order that the ZEP remains valid, while the minister of home affairs conducts a fair and rational inquiry into the impact of its termination.\n\nThe foundation turned to court in a bid to give ZEP holders a lifeline.\n\nWhen the minister first signalled his intention to appeal the courts June 2023 judgment, the foundation asked him to leave the ZEP in place until he exhausted the appeal process. The minister refused, Nicole Fritz, executive director of the foundation said at the time.\n\nThe court had held earlier that the ministers appeal had no prospects of success. Home Affairs then decided to turn to the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) says a total 4 912 injuries and 76 fatalities were recorded in 2024, prompting calls for urgent combative measures.\n\nVarious factors, including human error, equipment malfunction, and environmental hazards, can contribute to workplace accidents.\n\nIn a speech read on behalf of the ZCTU President, Florence Taruvinga, to mark this years June 6 commemorations, the labour organ revealed that workplace injuries and fatalities rose significantly during the period.\n\nIn 2024, Zimbabwe experienced a concerning rise in occupational injuries and fatalities. It is reported that there were 4,912 injuries and 76 fatalities throughout the year. What about those accidents that went unreported? It is our demand that we cannot continue to suffer from workplace neglect as workers without the responsible authorities being brought to account for the injuries and deaths being experienced in the workplace, she said.\n\nTaruvinga said the mining industry has become synonymous with unsafe shafts, equipment failure, and weak regulations that are causing unnecessary deaths.\n\nIn Agriculture, she said, employees work without personal protective equipment and are exposed to chemicals, heat stress, and poor living conditions, while in the retail and commercial sectors, workers are exposed to long hours of work, job insecurity and poor ergonomics.\n\nTaruvinga said that in the informal sector, over 80% of workers operate with no safety laws, medical care, or recognisable rights, while the transport and manufacturing sectors have also not been spared, as workers work with very dangerous old and archaic machinery, poorly maintained and without proper safety nets.\n\nAs the voice of workers, we clearly pronounce that enough is enough. We demand the following: Full enforcement of OSH laws across all economic sectors, establishment of functional health and safety committees in every workplace and access to adequate PPE, occupational health training, and medicalservices for all workers, added Taruvinga.\n\nThe June 6 commemorations are held annually to reflect on the Kamandama Mine Disaster, in which 427 miners were killed in 1972 in a mine explosion. The accident, which was attributed to a methane gas explosion, forced the permanent closure of the mine.\n\n",
