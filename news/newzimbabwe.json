We are all accountable to the President of the Republic in our various workstations.\n\nSo, we must be able to find each other. I told the Mayor of Bulawayo (David Coltart) last week that we have come here not to fight, but to build bridges, Garwe said.\n\nHe revealed that some people were expecting fights in their minds, which was not the mission.\n\nSo, we said there are some ways to build bridges. All these cities, the 32 urban councils, are all ours.\n\nThe 60 rural councils are all ours. There is no person who exists in this kind that doesnt belong to a vote. So, this is how important local authorities are to everybody.\n\nWe do not want to be focusing on fault finding. We want to be focusing on correcting the areas where we are not doing well. We should be able to be corrected as well, he told the officials.\n\nResults for the local authorities performance released showed that most of them had failed to reach their targets for the year.\n\nLet us take responsibility whenever there is something that we have done correctly. There is no one under the sun who does not make a mistake, nobody.\n\nAll of us make mistakes, but the ability to be able to sit down and diagnose the problem and provide the cure is what makes us different from the rest of the people.\n\nGarwe urged the local authorities bosses to tackle challenges without looking at which party one belonged to.\n\nWe must attend ourselves into challenges. In here, we do not have councillors belonging to political parties. We have councillors belonging to government.\n\nWe are all accountable to government, we are all accountable to this existence. So we leave behind all this political culture behaviour the moment we are sworn into offices.\n\nFurther, he said, Right now, there are no any chances. We do not need to be mudslinging. We do need to speak to each other, working together to turn around the fortunes of our local authorities.\n\nThe minister also urged council officials and councillors to change their mindset and forget about past fights.\n\nThe local authorities in central government, officials from the minister of Local Government, change your mindset in a positive attitude towards our local authorities.\n\nWe humbly request you to leave positive attitude towards central government.\n\nWe are one government with one vision. We want to turn- around the local governance and avoid focus on what happened in the past, said Garwe, adding What is done is done. Let us focus on the future.\n\nMost local authorities have not done well in the service provision in the last years, mainly due to political fights and corruption, prompting government to privatise most of the services especially in Harare.\n\n",

A contract that is measured in clean water supply, functioning sanitation, well-maintained roads, and refuse collections.\n\nAs we reflect on the performance of our local authorities, it is essential to acknowledge the policy landscape that will inform our next steps.\n\nThe recent performance outcomes and new significant challenges, none of our local authorities exceeded their targets, Garwe said.\n\nThe minister stated the failure by the local councils to reach targets was a reminder that something must be done urgently.\n\nIn the concerning percentage of what rural and urban councils failed below expectations, this data sets as a wake-up call for all of us, added Garwe saying in the length of these outcomes, councils must strategically adapt from the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), 2021 to 2025, to the forthcoming National Development Strategy 2 (NDS2), 2026 to 2030.\n\nHe stressed that this transition represented not just a change in policy direction, but a critical opportunity to recalibrate governments approach to local governance, which is central to minimum savings in different standards.\n\nNDS2 focuses on enhancing the capabilities of local authorities, ensuring that they are equipped to meet the demands of services delivered in a rapidly changing environment.\n\nCentral to our discussions today is the Cultural Action Group, which is fed with the minimum services delivered standards. And these standards are essential for establishing the baseline for services delivered across all our local authorities.\n\nThey will say this is a guide for local authorities to elevate their performance and ensure that every citizen receives the quality services they deserve.\n\nIt is, therefore, imperative that we institutionalise these standards and hold ourselves accountable for meeting them, said Garwe.\n\nThe minister urged authorities to be focused.\n\nAs we confront the realities of our current performance, let us not lose sight of our goals. The vision of a prosperous and empowered upper-middle income society by year 2030 is within our reach, but it requires a refereeing commitment and collective effort, said Garwe.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, there are 32 urban councils and 60 rural councils, giving a total of 92 councils countrywide.\n\n",
