            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOutspoken former Zanu PF Central Committee member Temba Mliswa has launched a blistering attack on Presidential Spokesperson George Charamba, accusing him of sabotaging President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nMliswa claimed Charamba should be investigated, alleging that his lackadaisical response to rising criticism of Mnangagwa over controversial calls for a 2030 term extension amounted to deliberate sabotage.\n\nZanu PF is currently engulfed in succession battles, with some of Mnangagwas loyalists pushing for him to remain in power until 2030 despite the two-term constitutional limit, which requires him to step down when his second and final term ends in 2028.\n\nMnangagwas deputy, Rtd Constantino Chiwenga, is widely expected to succeed him. He, however, faces stiff resistance from a faction of Mnangagwa allies, some of whom Chiwenga has accused of corruption.\n\nTensions have intensified following reports that Chiwenga presented a corruption dossier to the Politburo naming businessmen Delish Nguwaya, Wicknell Chivayo, Paul Tungwarara, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, and Pedzai Sakupwanya, all reportedly close to Mnangagwa.\n\nZanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa last weekaccused Chiwenga of turning the presidium into a kangaroo court after the VP questioned whyMnangagwa had not taken actionagainst the named individuals.\n\nAmid the internal chaos, Mliswa accused Charamba of failing to defend Mnangagwa.\n\nHis latest conduct, as a Presidential Spokesperson, when the President came under siege has been very telling and speaks of a compromised character. His lackadaisical approach is not just absence of passion and initiative but a wilful removal of those factors to sabotage the President. One has to learn to serve one master faithfully and not be preoccupied with surviving to serve in every administration that comes in, Mliswa wrote on X.\n\nHe further argued that self-exiled former minister Jonathan Moyo was doing a better job defending Mnangagwa from abroad.\n\nHow does one act normal and even peddle the mirage of normalcy in a situation which everyone can see is a President facing internal attacks? As it is, Prof Moyo is actually doing a better job from a propaganda perspective advancing the Presidential cause more effectively.\n\nMliswa also took aim at Information Ministry Permanent Secretary Nick Mangwana, accusing him of weakness during a politically volatile moment.\n\nThe situation hasnt been helped by Nick Mangwanas own weak approach in a volatile environment. In a scenario where rivals have defrocked themselves of diplomacy, humility and etiquette in relation to the President, why does the Presidents own defence retain false humility and continue delicately tiptoeing around? he added.\n\nCharamba, however, hit back, using his pseudonymous X account @Jamwanda2, dismissing Mliswa as a failed opposition figure seeking relevance.\n\nI HARDLY HAVE TIME FOR A FAILED OPPOSITION FIGURE WHO SEEKS TO PLAY SAVIOUR TO MY PRINCIPAL OR TO ZANU PF WHICH HE IS YET TO RE-JOIN. I WILL ONLY TAKE NOTICE OF HIS ERRANT VIEWS WHEN HE BECOMES A MEMBER OF ZANU PF, OR AN MP AFTER WINNING A SEAT IN A FREE AND FAIR ELECTORAL CONTEST. FOR NOW HE IS A MERE TALKATIVE NOBODY WHO HAS NO LESSONS FOR ME! YOU CAN ADVISE HIM TO GO HANG ON A BANANA TREE IF HE HAS ANY, OR RUNS AN ORCHARD!!! Charamba wrote.\n\nMliswa, who has also attacked Chiwenga in recent weeks, claimed the Vice President lacks the political strategy to succeed Mnangagwa and alleged that he too benefitted from corrupt networks.\n\nHe alleged that at one point, Chiwengas honeymoon expenses were paid for by Chivayo.\n\n",

The lack of adherence to these procedural safeguards rendered the previous judgments ineffective and void.\n\nMugabe, appointed bursar on a fixed-term contract from July 2017 to June 2021, was dismissed following clashes with university management. A labour officer later awarded him US$323,036 for unfair dismissal, a ruling UZ unsuccessfully appealed.\n\nRepresenting Mugabe, attorney Tawanda Zhuwarara said the earlier rulings violated fundamental rights enshrined in sections 56 and 71 of the Constitution, adding that the Supreme Courts decision was an arbitrary deprivation of property.\n\nUZs lawyer, G. Madzoka, countered that the application was nothing more than a disguised appeal, arguing that the underlying issues had already been settled.\n\nJustice Rita Makarau noted the unacceptable failure by lower courts to address preliminary points vital to fairness.\n\nDeclaring both earlier rulings void, the Court found the proceedings fraught with irregularities.\n\n",

In accordance with World Health Organisation (WHO) protocols, the detection of even a single confirmed case necessitates the declaration of an outbreak, prompting health authorities to launch an immediate response.\n\nThe MoHSS has assured the Namibian public that the countrys robust surveillance system is primed to identify and monitor individuals exhibiting signs of mpox. Additional cases are being actively sought, while health authorities in the Erongo region are closely monitoring the patients immediate contacts to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nMpox is a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopox virus, resulting in smallpox-like symptoms in humans. This outbreak follows a concerning trend, as multiple countries within Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Zambia, Malawi, and Tanzania, are reporting active mpox cases.\n\nMpox symptoms typically manifest after an incubation period ranging from 5 to 21 days and can include:\n\nThe rash often appears on the face, palms, and soles of the feet, and can also affect the mouth, genitals, and eyes. Symptoms generally last from two to four weeks, during which the infected individuals are capable of transmitting the virus to others.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission occurs primarily through direct contact with respiratory secretions, bodily fluids, or skin lesions of an infected person. The MoHSS outlines several potential avenues for transmission, including:\n\nAs mpox can affect anyone regardless of demographic, the MoHSS urges the public to take preventive measures. These include:\n\nIn light of this outbreak, the MoHSS has mobilised necessary resources to respond effectively, emphasising the importance of public cooperation. Citizens are encouraged to remain calm and to refrain from spreading unverified information, which could instigate unnecessary panic or stigma towards affected individuals and their families.\n\nAs Namibian health officials continue to monitor the situation closely, ongoing updates will be provided to keep the public informed.
