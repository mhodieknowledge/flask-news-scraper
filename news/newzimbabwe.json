            "content": "Reuters\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo has filed criminal complaints against Apple subsidiaries in France and Belgium, accusing the tech firm of using conflict minerals in its supply chain, lawyers for the Congolese government told Reuters.\n\nCongo is a major source of tin, tantalum and tungsten, so-called 3T minerals used in computers and mobile phones. But some artisanal mines are run by armed groups involved in massacres of civilians, mass rapes, looting and other crimes, according to U.N. experts and human rights groups.\n\nApple does not directly source primary minerals and says it audits suppliers, publishes findings and funds bodies that seek to improve mineral traceability.\n\nApple last year said it had no reasonable basis for concluding its products contain illegally exported minerals from conflict-hit zones. The tech giant has insisted it carefully verifies the origin of materials in its output.\n\nIts 2023 filing on conflict minerals to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said none of the smelters or refiners of 3T minerals or gold in its supply chain had financed or benefited armed groups in Congo or neighboring countries.\n\nBut international lawyers representing Congo argue that Apple uses minerals pillaged from Congo and laundered through international supply chains, which they say renders the firm complicit in crimes taking place in Congo.\n\nIn parallel complaints filed to the Paris prosecutors office and to a Belgian investigating magistrates office on Monday, Congo accuses local subsidiaries Apple France, Apple Retail France and Apple Retail Belgium of a range of offenses.\n\nThese include covering up war crimes and the laundering of tainted minerals, handling stolen goods, and carrying out deceptive commercial practices to assure consumers supply chains are clean.\n\nIt is clear that the Apple group, Apple France and Apple Retail France know very well that their minerals supply chain relies on systemic wrongdoing, says the French complaint, after citing U.N. and rights reports on conflict in east Congo.\n\nBelgium had a particular moral duty to act because looting of Congos resources began during the 19th-century colonial rule of its King Leopold II, Congos Belgian lawyer Christophe Marchand said.\n\nIt is incumbent on Belgium to help Congo in its effort to use judicial means to end the pillaging, he said.\n\nThe complaints, prepared by the lawyers on behalf of Congos justice minister, make allegations not just against the local subsidiaries but against the Apple group as a whole.\n\nFrance and Belgium were chosen because of their perceived strong emphasis on corporate accountability. Judicial authorities in both nations will decide whether to investigate the complaints further and bring criminal charges.\n\nIn an unrelated case in March, a U.S. federal court rejected an attempt by private plaintiffs to hold Apple, Google, Tesla, Dell and Microsoft accountable for what the plaintiffs described as their dependence on child labor in Congolese cobalt mines.\n\nMinerals fuel violence\n\nSince the 1990s, Congos mining heartlands in the east have been devastated by waves of fighting between armed groups, some backed by neighboring Rwanda, and the Congolese military.\n\nMillions of civilians have died and been displaced.\n\nCompetition for minerals is one of the main drivers of conflict as armed groups sustain themselves and buy weapons with the proceeds of exports, often smuggled via Rwanda, according to U.N. experts and human rights organizations.\n\nRwanda denies benefiting from the trade, dismissing the allegations as unfounded.\n\nAmong the appendices to Congos legal complaint in France was a statement issued by the U.S. State Department in July, expressing concerns about the role of the illicit trade in minerals from Congo, including tantalum, in financing conflict.\n\nThe statement was a response to requests from the private sector for the U.S. government to clarify potential risks associated with manufacturing products using minerals extracted, transported or exported from eastern Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.\n\nCongos complaints focus on ITSCI, a metals industry-funded monitoring and certification scheme designed to help companies perform due diligence on suppliers of 3T minerals exported from Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.\n\nCongos lawyers argue that ITSCI has been discredited, including by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) of which Apple is a member, and that Apple nevertheless uses ITSCI as a fig leaf to falsely present its supply chain as clean.\n\nThe RMI, whose members include more than 500 companies, announced in 2022 it was removing ITSCI from its list of approved traceability schemes.\n\nIn July, it said it was prolonging the suspension until at least 2026, saying ITSCI had not provided field observations from high-risk sites or explained how it was responding to an escalation of violence in North Kivu province, which borders Rwanda and is a key 3T mining area.\n\nITSCI criticized the RMIs own processes and defended its work in Congo as reliable. It has also rejected allegations in a 2022 report by campaigning group Global Witness entitled The ITSCI Laundromat, cited in Congos legal complaint in France, that it was complicit in the false labeling of minerals from conflict zones as coming from mines located in peaceful areas.\n\nApple mentioned ITSCI five times in its 2023 filing on conflict minerals. The filing also made multiple mentions of the RMI, in which Apple said it had continued active participation and leadership but did not mention the RMIs ditching of ITSCI.\n\nIn its July statement, the U.S. State Department said flaws in traceability schemes have not garnered sufficient engagement and attention to lead to changes needed.\n\nRobert Amsterdam, a U.S.-based lawyer for Congo, said the French and Belgian complaints were the first criminal complaints by the Congolese state against a major tech company, describing them as a first salvo only.\n\nSome information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.\n\n",

But it needs to be done in conformity with the law.\n\nMy proposal is for the president to declare a state of national disaster.\n\nRehabilitation of infrastructure should be from the source. The whole distribution system should be refurbished.\n\nIt has been a disaster for too long hence we need a holistic approach and declare this a national disaster.\n\nThe whole system has decayed. We need the whole system to be revamped, he said.\n\nGomba also blamed the late long-time ruler Robert Mugabe for failing to handle the situation from the time he came into power.\n\nWho is to blame? The late former president Robert Mugabe, the ministers who were working with Robert Mugabe whether dead or alive, even if they are holding certain offices now.\n\nGomba said Mugabes government was supposed to construct the Kunzvi and Musami dams, which were supposed to be completed by 1990 but these projects failed.\n\nWe should blame the government.\n\nFrom 1980 to now it has failed to run these affairsHarare was supposed to get water from Kunzvi and Musami so that Chivero could be decommissioned for cleaning.\n\nThe City Council was not able to decommission Lake Chivero because Kunzvi was not built. It was supposed to be built in 1990, he said.\n\nGomba said now more money is needed to solve the situation.\n\nWe need a huge investment into our infrastructure for our water and sewer system\n\nNorton also needs a sewer system plan so that they dont discharge into Darwendale.\n\nThat takes a lot of money, he said.\n\nThe government has since banned fishing operations in Lake Chivero to give space for investigations.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume on Tuesday told journalists that they will have a way forward after a fact-finding visit which was scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nZimParks has since relocated the remaining rhinos from Lake Chivero Recreational Park to a safer place among other precautionary measures.\n\n",

Civil servants are already earning paltry salaries and are battling to make ends meet.\n\nFestive season was struck off the calendar of government workers way back. Unfortunately, the late payment of salaries adds a new layer of pain to the exploited government employees. Failing to meet the basics for survival when others are swimming in plenty is torturous, said ARTUZ.\n\nThe teachers representative body alleges top bureaucrats were now enjoying the fruits of their manipulative conduct, which saw them suppressing dissent among impoverished public service employees.\n\nSenior government officials have since received their big perks in United States dollars. The majority of these elites are now on holiday with their families claiming to be resting from a busy year.\n\nIndeed it was a busy year for them. Looting from the impoverished is not an easy job. Working round the clock to silence the oppressed and disenfranchised majority is not an easy task. But as they rest they should be assured that the underpaid civil servants will not be silenced forever.\n\nARTUZ said its members had endured enough unfair labour practices and warned of protests to demand improved pay and working conditions. Teachers are demanding at least US$1 260 per month from an average of US$300.\n\nWe are not in the habit of making empty threats. The anger from the civil servants is reaching the boiling point. 2025 will be a difficult year for those who steal from the poor. We will organize and demand fair wages paid on time, ARTUZ said.\n\n",

            "content": "BusinessInsiderAfrica\n\nA delegation from the Pan-African Parliament (PAP)has made an unexpected visit to Russiain a bid to address Africas growing food crisis driven by fertilizer shortages. The delegation, which included representatives from a dozen African nations, emphasized the need for urgent global action to address the growing food crisis as fertilizer prices skyrocket and agricultural yields plummet across the continent.\n\nThe visit highlighted Africas increasing frustration with the global sanctions regime, which has disrupted exports of potash and nitrogen fertilizers from Russia and Belarussuppliers that together account for over third of the worlds potash. These sanctions, imposed to isolate Moscow over the war in Ukraine, have had significant consequences for African nations, where agriculture is central to both economies and livelihoods.\n\nGayo Ashebir, the PAP vice president for East Africa, led the delegation and did not mince words. The sanctions imposed by the West are not just hurting Russia and Belarusthey are hurting Africa, Ashebir said. Our farmers cannot afford fertilizers, and this has triggered a chain reaction: reduced yields, skyrocketing food prices, and widespread hunger. This is a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe delegation included representatives from countries such as Ethiopia, Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania, Somalia, Djibouti, and Mozambique, all of which have been severely impacted by the global fertilizer crunch. The leaders voiced strong support for the full-scale resumption of fertilizer exports from Russia and Belarus, urging Western nations to ease financial and other restrictions that have made it nearly impossible for African governments to pay for these critical agricultural inputs.\n\nWe are willing to purchase fertilizers directly from Russia and Belarus, a member of the delegation said. But the financial restrictions imposed by Western powers are effectively blocking these transactions. This is no longer about politicsits about saving lives.\n\nThe timing of the visit reflects the urgency of the crisis. According to the United Nations, one in five Africans282 million peoplefaced food insecurity in 2023, with the numbers expected to worsen in 2024. In sub-Saharan Africa, where smallholder farmers produce roughly 80% of the continents food, the price of fertilizers has risen by as much as 300% since the start of the Ukraine war. Analysts warn that cereal yields in some African nations have dropped by 20-30%, pushing millions closer to famine.\n\nThe delegations visit has already faced criticism from Western and Ukrainian media and sparked a wave ofanonymous articlesattacking the trip. But Ashebir defended the mission, arguing that African nations must advocate for their own survival amid the global geopolitical conflict. This is about ensuring that Africas voice is heard on the world stage and that food security is treated as a global priority, Ashebir said.\n\nThe food crisis has been compounded by soaring energy prices, driven in part by the conflict in Ukraine. Natural gas, a key component in fertilizer production, saw prices spike by nearly 300% in Europe in 2022, driving up production costs for ammonia-based fertilizers worldwide. These costs have been passed on to farmers, with devastating effects in low-income nations.\n\nIn Africa, where agriculture accounts for 23% of GDP and employs more than half the population, the ripple effects have been severe. Countries like Malawi, Zambia, and Tanzania have reported widespread reductions in planting activity as farmers cannot afford fertilizers. In turn, food prices have surged in local markets, making basic staples like maize, wheat, and rice inaccessible to millions.\n\nGlobally, hunger is on the rise. The UN estimates that between 691 and 783 million people were affected by food insecurity in 2022, up from 613 million in 2019. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warns that without intervention, the crisis could escalate, potentially affecting 900 million people by 2030, with Africa bearing the brunt of the impact.\n\nThe Pan-African delegations visit to Moscow is part of a broader effort to reframe the global conversation around sanctions and food security. Delegates argued that the Wests sanctions regime disproportionately impacts vulnerable nations, effectively penalizing African countries for a conflict they did not create.\n\nWhile it remains unclear whether the delegations Moscow visit will lead to concrete policy changes, it has succeeded in amplifying Africas voice in the global debate. PAP leaders are now pushing for discussions at the upcoming UN General Assembly to address the unintended consequences of sanctions and to establish mechanisms for ensuring that essential commodities like fertilizers are exempt from geopolitical disputes.\n\n",

Soil plays a vital role in human life, from producing food and filtering water to supporting biodiversity and mitigating climate change, said Jiri.\n\nZimbabwe has a variety of soil types, including sandy, loamy, and alluvial.\n\nSandy soil covers about 70% of the country, and is mostly derived from coarse granite.\n\nA balance of sand, silt, clay, and humus, loamy soil is dark in colour and mealy in the hands. It is considered to be the perfect soil for arable farming while alluvial soil is deposited by surface water, and are found along rivers, in floodplains and deltas, and stream terraces.\n\nSoils produce 94% of our food, through their extraordinary capacity to form, store, transform, and recycle nutrients.\n\nThe government has emphasized the importance of soil conservation, highlighting key initiatives such as the National Soil Conservation Policy and the Agriculture Food Systems and Rural Transformation Strategy.\n\nThe Directorate of Agricultural Engineering, Mechanisation and Farm Infrastructure Development, Soil Conservation unit is working tirelessly to conserve our soils, said Jiri.\n\nConstructing soil conservation mechanical works contour ridges, infiltration pits and practicing conservation agriculture, as well as rehabilitation of degraded land is part of the departments agenda to conserve or protect the precious resource, the soil.\n\nJiri hailed efforts by partners such as the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), schools, and partner ministries, for their support in promoting sustainable soil management practices.\n\n",
