            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/israel-iran-strikes-what-are-the-worst-case-scenarios/",
            "content": "By BBC News\n\nFRIDAY night saw Israel and Iran exchange a barrage of air strikes.\n\nFor now, the fighting between Israel and Iran seems restricted to the two nations. At the United Nations and elsewhere there have been widespread calls for restraint.\n\nBut what if they fall on deaf ears? What if the fighting escalates and expands?\n\nHere are just a few possible, worst-case scenarios.\n\nAmerica gets dragged in\n\nFor all the US denials, Iran clearly believes American forces endorsed and at least tacitly supported Israels attacks.\n\nIran could strike US targets across the Middle East  such as special forces camps in Iraq, military bases in the Gulf, and diplomatic missions in the region.\n\nIrans proxy forces  Hamas and Hezbollah  may be much diminished but its supportive militias in Iraq remain armed and intact.\n\nThe US feared such attacks were a possibility and withdrew some personnel. In its public messaging, the US has warned Iran firmly of the consequences of any attack on American targets.\n\nWhat might happen if an American citizen were killed, say, in Tel Aviv or elsewhere?\n\nDonald Trump might find himself forced to act. Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long been accused of wanting to drag the US into helping him defeat Iran.\n\nMilitary analysts say only the US has the bombers and bunker-busting bombs that can penetrate the deepest of Iranian nuclear facilities, especially that of Fordow.\n\nTrump promised his MAGA constituency he would not start any so-called forever wars in the Middle East. But equally many Republicans support both Israels government and its view that now is the time to seek regime change in Tehran.\n\nBut if America were to become an active combatant, that would represent a huge escalation with a long, potentially devastating consequential tail.\n\nIran is reeling from Israels unprecedented attack  and it is only the start\n\nGulf nations get dragged in\n\nIf Iran failed to damage Israels well-protected military and other targets, then it could always aim its missiles at softer targets in the Gulf, especially countries that Iran believes aided and abetted its enemies over the years.\n\nThere are lots of energy and infrastructure targets in the region. Remember Iran was accused of striking Saudi Arabias oil fields in 2019 and its Houthi proxies hit targets in the UAE in 2022.\n\nSince then, there has been a reconciliation of sorts between Iran and some countries in the region.\n\nBut these countries play host to US airbases. Some also  discreetly  helped defend Israel from Iranian missile attack last year.\n\nIf the Gulf were attacked, then it too might demand American warplanes come to its defence as well as Israels.\n\nIsrael fails to destroy Irans nuclear capability\n\nWhat if the Israeli attack fails? What if Irans nuclear facilities are too deep, too well protected? What if its 400kg of 60% enriched uranium  the nuclear fuel that is just a small step away from being fully weapons-grade, enough for ten bombs or so  is not destroyed?\n\nIts thought it may be hidden deep in secret mines. Israel may have killed some nuclear scientists but no bombs can destroy Irans knowhow and expertise.\n\nWhat if Israels attack convinces Irans leadership that its only way of deterring further attacks is to race for nuclear capability as fast as it can?\n\nWhat if those new military leaders round the table are more headstrong and less cautious than their dead predecessors?\n\nAt the very least, this could force Israel to further attacks, potentially binding the region into a continual round of strike and counter-strike. Israelis have a brutal phrase for this strategy; they call it mowing the grass.\n\nTheres a global economic shock. The price of oil is already soaring.\n\nWhat if Iran tried to close the Strait of Hormuz, further restricting the movement of oil?\n\nWhat if  on the other side of the Arabian Peninsula  the Houthis in Yemen redouble their efforts to attack shipping in the Red Sea? They are Irans last remaining so-called proxy ally with a track record of unpredictability and high risk appetite.\n\nMany countries around the world are already suffering a cost of living crisis. A rising price of oil would add to inflation on a global economic system already creaking under the weight of Trumps tariff war.\n\nAnd lets not forget, the one man who benefits from rising oil prices is President Putin of Russia who would suddenly see billions more dollars flood into Kremlin coffers to pay for his war against Ukraine.\n\nIrans regime falls, leaving a vacuum\n\nWhat if Israel succeeded in its long term aim of forcing the collapse of the Islamic revolutionary regime in Iran?\n\nNetanyahu claims his primary aim is to destroy Irans nuclear capability. But he made clear in his statement yesterday that his broader aim involves regime change.\n\nHe told the proud people of Iran that his attack was clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom from what he called their evil and oppressive regime.\n\nBringing down Irans government might appeal to some in the region, especially some Israelis. But what vacuum might it leave? What unforeseen consequences would there be? What would civil conflict in Iran look like?\n\nMany can remember what happened to both Iraq and Libya when strong centralised government was removed.\n\nSo, much depends on how this conflict progresses in coming days.\n\nHow  and how hard  will Iran retaliate? And what restraint  if any  can the US exert on Israel?\n\n",

Zimbabwes brightest football talent has sparked a bidding war as Highlanders FC demand a jaw-dropping R15 million for teenage winger Prince Ndlovu The move has sent shockwaves through South African football circles, an SA publication wrote.\n\nNdlovu, often referred to as the next Peter Ndlovu, has long attracted interest from top clubs, having previously trained with the Buccaneers in Houghton before a failed European stint. Now, with his stock soaring, Highlanders are playing hardball.\n\nHighlanders FC value Prince (Ndlovu) and thats why they are pricing him at around R15 million. The club believe its a fair price looking at his talent, quality and future ahead of him, a club official said, as quoted by Soccer Laduma.\n\nHighlanders play the long game as bids loom\n\nThe Bulawayo giants arent rushing to cash in. Their valuation isnt just based on local interest, its also shaped by serious attention from abroad.\n\nApart from Orlando Pirates there is a European club that has been monitoring him for some time now. Its Sturm Graz from the Austria Bundesliga, a source revealed.\n\nThis European connection could tip the scale and inflate the price further.\n\nA R15 million fee would rank among the highest for any player moving directly from the Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League. Its a bold statement from Highlanders, and a sign of just how highly they rate the 19-year-old winger.\n\nNdlovu was recently donning national colours at the COSAFA Cup in Bloemfontein, offering football scouts from across the continent a front-row seat to evaluate his explosive potential. Pirates are believed to have sent representatives to monitor him closely.\n\n",

compared to April 2025.\n\nIn a report released Saturday, the human rights watchdog documented 83 human rights violations across various areas, including during government-led food aid distribution, instances of political harassment, and restrictions on freedom of assembly and expression.\n\nIn May 2025, the Zimbabwe Peace Project recorded a total of 83 human rights violations affecting 5,376 victims nationwide, a 10% decline from the violations recorded in May where 6,059 people were affected, part of the report reads.\n\nThese violations included breaches of personal security, acts of intimidation and harassment, assault, political discrimination in the distribution of government-sponsored food aid, restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and association, as well as limited access to social services.\n\nOther incidents included unjustified arrests, unlawful evictions, malicious damage to property, inhumane and degrading treatment, and restricted access to information.\n\nFor the second consecutive month, ZanuPF has been identified as the primary perpetrator of violence, followed by the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP).\n\nOf the 5,376 people affected, 3,107 were female and 2,269 were male.\n\nThe report detailed some of the alleged perpetrators.\n\nAmong the perpetrators, those affiliated with the ruling party, Zanu PF, accounted for 35.38%, followed by members of the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) at 13.77%.Other violators included local authorities (16.53%), government officials (11.44%), artisanal miners (5.93%), traditional leaders (6.14%), members of the MDC-Alliance (0.64%) and unaffiliated individuals (6.36%).Worryingly, members of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) are also implicated, accounting for 0.21% of reported violations.The report highlights that other State security actors, particularly those mandated to protect the public, continue to feature prominently among perpetrators of human rights violations.Despite these concerns, the ZPP expresses cautious optimism about the potential for future improvements.It welcomed and embraced the opportunity to engage with the Zimbabwe Independent Complaints Commission (ZICC) through its goodwill ambassador to promote a rights-based, accountable approach in security operations.We are hopeful that other implicated institutions will be open to such engagements, paving the way for lasting solutions to end impunity and foster sustainable peace in Zimbabwe, the report adds.Geographically, Masvingo and Harare provinces recorded the highest number of violations in May, with 13 each.Midlands followed closely with 12 violations, while Manicaland and Mashonaland West each documented 10.Mashonaland Central experienced a significant decline, from 13 violations the previous month to just four in May.Mashonaland East recorded nine violations, while both Matabeleland North and South recorded six breaches each.ZPP commended the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) for highlighting urgent issues needing government action, including collapsing public services, a shrinking civic space, and restrictive conditions.\n\nAmong the perpetrators,
