            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has unveiled plans to launch newly designed ZWG notes, effectively dumping the old defiled versions in a move set to trigger yet another wave of shock across the markets.\n\nIntroduced on April 5 2024, as the countrys lasting solution to currency problems, the ZWG has suffered major setbacks since its inception, including the 43% devaluation in September 2024, which left the local units gold-backed status in question.\n\nThe currency is still in short supply, with the rural economy having very limited access to the local unit despite being the most populous. Some regions have resorted to using the rand as a medium of exchange, especially for smaller denominations in transactions.\n\nIn the midst of another storm following the announcements that the country will adopt the ZWG as the sole currency in 2030, RBZ governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu, on Tuesday told a state-run publication that plans to launch a new version of ZWG notes were currently underway.\n\nThe Reserve Bank is working on the modernisation of the ZiG banknote series as advised in the recent mid-term Monetary Policy Statement. The new ZiG banknotes will be redesigned, including improved quality and durability for the convenience of the transacting public.\n\nIn this regard, the production process of the improved banknotes has progressed well and is at an advanced stage. The public will be advised of the expected roll-out at the appropriate time, he said.\n\nSceptics immediately took to social media platforms questioning the rationale behind the new designs, with many concluding it is a ploy to dump the failed first version.\n\nMarket watchers who anonymously spoke to our publication criticised the ghostly nature of RBZ announcements for creating more headaches than solutions.\n\nThey are of the view that the RBZ must accompany its policy announcements with finer details to avoid market speculation.\n\nOn his part, Mushayavanhu said the new notes must not be misconstrued as a new currency but just a normal routine in line with global best practices.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court of Zimbabwe granted an urgent interdict to the Zimbabwe Diamond & Allied Minerals Workers Union (ZDAMWU), effectively blocking RioZim Limited from disposing of its mining assets while pending corporate rescue proceedings.\n\nThe judgment, delivered by Justice Maxwell Dembure, encapsulated the precarious intersection of corporate governance and worker rights.\n\nThe case arose after RioZim, a publicly listed company, issued a cautionary statement on July 21, 2025, initiating discussions regarding the potential sale of its mining and non-core assets. This announcement followed ZDAMWUs filing of a court application on April 28, seeking to place the company under supervision due to financial distress.\n\nDembure noted, The mere filing of the application for corporate rescue triggers an immediate moratorium on the disposal of a companys assets, emphasising the protective nature of the law intended to shield creditors and employees from the adverse effects of asset stripping.\n\nHe further highlighted that any attempt at asset disposal during this phase could render the corporate rescue application academic, fundamentally undermining the purpose of such proceedings.\n\nIn lambasting RioZims move, the judge said, If the applicants rights are not preserved, the purpose of the ongoing litigation will be defeated, which is against the interests of all affected, including the workers. The court affirmed that allowing the asset disposals would suit a strategy that frustrates and defeats the pending corporate rescue proceedings, further noting that the company must not be allowed to operate as if it were free from legal encumbrances.\n\nZDAMWUs counsel, R. Mabwe, characterised the urgency of the application as essential, asserting that should the court fail to act swiftly, irreparable harm would result, reflecting the unions commitment to safeguarding employee interests linked to the companys asset base.\n\nRioZims response, led by attorney E. Donzvambeva, contended that the company should be allowed to explore transactions to alleviate financial duress without impediment.\n\nHe argued, The proposed disposals are necessary for the companys survival, pointing out that asset sales could provide much-needed liquidity during corporate rescue discussions.\n\nHowever, Dembure countered, highlighting the lack of clarity in RioZims intentions about which specific assets might be sold, noting that such details could impact any ruling on the matter.\n\nThe court granted two key orders: prohibiting any asset sales contemplated in RioZims cautionary statement and mandating the company to bear the costs of the proceedings.\n\nThe balance of convenience strongly lies in favouring the applicants request for an interim interdict to prevent potential asset dissipation until a determination is made on the main application.\n\nAs a result of this significant ruling, RioZims shareholders and stakeholders will need to navigate the complexities of corporate restructuring under the courts oversight, while the future of the companys asset management remains uncertain.\n\nThe outcome of the wider corporate rescue proceedings now looms large, with potential implications for the mining sector and employee security within the industry at stake.\n\n",

They started dating while Swift was in the throes of her now world-famous Eras tour. At a Kansas City stop, Kelce attempted to give Swift his number on a friendship bracelet, a ubiquitous accessory on the tour. When that failed, he spoke openly about his affection for the singer on his podcast, New Heights.\n\nI was disappointed that she doesnt talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs she sings, Kelcetoldhis brother, Jason Kelce, on the podcast at the time.\n\nIf youre up onTaylor Swiftconcerts, there are friendship bracelets and I had received a bunch of them, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it.\n\nThe pair got in touch after that proclamation and began dating shortly thereafter. They in effect hard-launched their relationship in September 2023 when Swift appeared at Arrowhead Stadium to watch Kelce  and the Kansas City Chiefs   play the Chicago Bears.\n\nSince then, they have made headlines routinely. In one blockbuster instance, fans went wild after seeing Swift and Kelce kissing on the field after hisSuper Bowl LVIIIwin in 2024  Kelces third  with the Kansas City Chiefs in a victory against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIn front of thousands of screaming fans, Swift tweaked a song in her Eras Tour shows,  Karma, to be about Kelce: Karma is the guy in the Chiefs, coming straight home to me. She also featured him in a 2024 performance in London during the The Tortured Poets Department set of the show.\n\nThe pair also, very recently, appeared on New Heights together to announce Swifts upcoming 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, which many (correctly!) suspected would be a precursor to an engagement.\n\nThat episode has since broken the record for the most concurrent views for a podcast on YouTube,Guinness World Records announced on Tuesday. About 1.3 million people simultaneously tuned in to the podcast episode when it first aired on YouTube on 13 August. By Tuesday, the podcast episode had 20m views on YouTube.\n\nFans of both Swift and Kelce have been waiting for an engagement announcement for virtually their entire relationship, but rumoursheated up last monthwhen photos of Kelceslock-screenmade the rounds on social media and beyond. The screen appeared to show a photo of the duo with Swift flashing an outstretched hand.\n\nThe NFL shared well wishes to the couple in a congratulationpostwhile Brittany Mahomes showed her support in an Instagram story, calling the pair two of the most genuine people.\n\nThe engagement is particularly notable for longtime Swifties, who have grown up with Swift and watched her dating journey over the years. Many of her songs have been about her past paramours, which include the likes of Joe Alwyn, Matty Healy, Tom Hiddleston, Joe Jonas, Taylor Lautner, Jake Gyllenhaal and John Mayer.\n\n",
