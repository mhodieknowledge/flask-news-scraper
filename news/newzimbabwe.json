Authorities say he even became chairman of the defrauded investors group by leveraging these lies.\n\nIn one of the most elaborate scams, between 2020 and 2021, Chibaya allegedly defrauded a female investor of US$98,000, concocting stories about taxes, bribes and legal fees.\n\nHe is accused of faking his own arrest, impersonating a police officer, and later pretending to be dead to avoid detection.\n\nA stolen Samsung S20 cellphone was also traced back to him.\n\nOther counts include defrauding a complainant of US$850 in 2021 under the guise of tax fees and swindling another investor of US$2,000 after promising to help recover a US$30,000 investment while posing on duty as a doctor.\n\nA third investor lost US$2,000 after being promised recovery of his US$30,000 investment, with the accused again pretending to be on duty as a doctor when collecting cash, the court.\n\nAfter years on the run, the accused person was tracked down by Interpol in the UAE and handed over to Zimbabwean authorities. He has since been remanded in custody pending trial.\n\nIf convicted, Chibaya faces lengthy prison time.\n\n",

Until and unless section 8 of the Immigration Act is declared unconstitutional and such declaration is confirmed by the Constitutional Court, the courts hands are tied.\n\nThe provision gives immigration authorities up to 14 days to verify an individuals identity, nationality and antecedents.\n\nThe Chief Immigration Officer opposed Mupenzis release, stating that his nationality was still under investigation and that none of the documents he presented substantiated his claim to refugee status.\n\nApplicants identity and nationality status have been questioned by the countrys security apparatus, the court was told.\n\nThe judge acknowledged Mupenzis complaint over not being given reasons for his detention, but made it clear that release was not the remedy. Whilst applicant might have a genuine grievance that he was not furnished with reasons for the arrest and detention forthwith, I am not persuaded that the remedy for that is his immediate release, she said.\n\nThere was no order regarding costs.\n\n",

Just recently, mineral exporting companies revealed that the central bank has not been paying their 30% export surrender in local currency.\n\nThe latest decision by Bitumen Worlddemonstrates the authorities appetite to uphold currency stability even at the cost of other critical economic imperatives.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government, one of the companys largest debtors, is experiencing significant challenges in making timely payments to its contractors. The government is facing delays in settling arrears, affecting various projects, including road rehabilitation and dam construction.\n\nWhile efforts are underway to establish payment plans and small payments have been received, these financial constraints have contributed to the companys decision to realign its operations to remain resilient in a challenging fiscal environment, said the company.\n\nThe company said this necessary transition reflects a committed effort to adapt to the current economic challenges, including operating under cash flow pressures caused by delayed payments from clients.\n\nBW said it recognises and deeply values the dedication and professionalism of all its employees and is committed to handling the process with respect, transparency, and dignity, offering support to those affected through severance packages and transition assistance.\n\nBW CEO, Andre Zietsman, said the decision has been very tough but had to be made due to limited options at hand.\n\nOver recent months, we have engaged in extensive discussions and evaluations to guide Bitumen World through this difficult period. While the decision to restructure was not made lightly, it is essential for ensuring our long-term viability and ability to continue contributing meaningfully to infrastructure development in Zimbabwe and beyond, he said.\n\nHe said the employees who have worked tirelessly to restore the countrys infrastructure glory will, unfortunately, suffer heavy blows when they see their jobs going down the drain.\n\nThe tragedy of these layoffs is that they impact the very people who built this prestigious brand  a brand that was wholly created by Zimbabweans, said Zietsman.\n\nThe company committed to handling the process with respect, transparency, and dignity, offering support to those affected through severance packages and transition assistance.\n\n",
