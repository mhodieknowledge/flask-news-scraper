            "content": "University World News\n\nMost girls and young women in Zimbabwe dream big about pursuing a tertiary education. Still, their dreams are shattered by barriers that hold them back, according to the findings of a new survey conducted in 10 districts across the country by researchers from the World Bank and local research assistants.\n\nThesurvey, A Girl Can Dream: Analysing aspirations, gender norms, and influencers among girls and women in Zimbabwe, released on 25 August 2025, noted that 80% of girls in the country aspire to attain higher levels of education and eventually get jobs in the manufacturing, retail or healthcare sectors.\n\nHowever, only 4% eventually acquire a tertiary education, according to Dr Abhilasha Sahay, an economist at the World Banks gender group, and her associates, Sara Troiano, a senior economist at the World Banks Social Protection and Jobs Global Practice, and Sreelakshmi Papineni, an economist who focuses on gender issues at the Office of the Chief Economist Office (Africa region).\n\nOdds that include limited reproductive rights, traditional norms, domestic roles, acceptance of male authority, financial constraints and other indicators of poverty are invariably stacked against too many girls from an early age, the researchers state in the survey report.\n\nThe survey, which explored the aspirations and challenges faced by girls and young women aged 15-35, revealed that financial constraints were the primary obstacles: 80% of the respondents cited poverty as the main barrier to their pursuing higher education opportunities.\n\nAccording to the research team, this is consistent with the situation in most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Girls and young women are more likely to live in poverty than men and, characteristically, have less access to higher education and, subsequently, rarely benefit from productive economic opportunities.\n\nEarly-age risks\n\nDespite progressive views on gender equality as reflected in the countries legal systems, especially regarding education and reproductive rights, the researchers point out that traditional norms persist. This particularly happens in rural areas, where domestic roles, male-dominated careers, and acceptance of male authority still influence decisions that negatively impact girls access to higher education.\n\nCiting some of the early-age risks in Zimbabwe, the survey found that one in three girls is married before turning 18, and only 9% manage to complete upper secondary school. At the same time, teenage pregnancy is alarmingly common, with 111 births per 1,000 girls aged 15-19.\n\nThe risks are even greater for those with fewer resources, as adolescent birth rates are eight times higher among girls without a primary education and four times higher for those from the poorest households compared to their wealthier peers, according to the survey.\n\nOf the 1,291 adolescent girls and young women who participated in the survey, 40% aspired to complete at least a bachelor degree, but only 4% of them reached this level. Also, 47% expressed a desire to complete a university degree, whether a bachelor or postgraduate degree qualification if there were no constraints.\n\nAccording to the researchers, there was no significant difference in aspirations between rural and urban areas or across different age groups in all 10 districts, which included Epworth, Hopley, Beitbridge, Chinhoyi, Kwekwe, Murehwa, Mutasa, Redcliff, Umguza, and Zvimba. The high educational aspirations are noteworthy, especially considering the low level of secondary school completion among girls in Zimbabwe, compared to other countries in East and Southern Africa.\n\nBreaking male dominance?\n\nHowever, there are no indicators that girls and young women in Zimbabwe are prepared to break barriers related to venturing into male-dominated occupations in engineering, finance, and technology. Whereas only 10% of the respondents currently work in these male-dominated sectors, only 14% expressed a desire to transition into such sectors.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers noted that gender norms related to the acceptance of male authority still significantly influence decisions in Zimbabwe. Most girls and young women who have already made the transition to male-dominated careers have expressed a desire to return to female-dominated sectors, including production and manufacturing, retail, hospitality, and health.\n\nAccording to the researchers, an aspiration to work in production and manufacturing is a distinctive feature of Zimbabwean girls and young women (25%). In contrast, the sector has a lower preference in Zambia (12%) and Mozambique (7%). In Zambia, business services are a dream job for 25% of girls and young women, while in Mozambique, 32% aspire to work in education.\n\nIn their assessment, Sahay and her co-researchers argued that, whereas it is free for Zimbabwean girls and young women to dream about higher education, turning the dream into reality is a challenge. It comes with a price, often linked to tough decisions about education, employment, marriage, or fertility.\n\nAccording to the survey findings, 80% of the respondents were unable to achieve their desired level of education, and about six out of 10 young women were unable to find a job in their chosen sector.\n\nVoices from the field show a multitude of aspiration gaps. For instance, one young woman told the researchers: I did not complete my secondary education. I left school when I was in Form 3 at the age of 15, because I did not have the money for the fees. Going back to school for me will not be possible because I now have kids that need my care, and no one will take care of them.\n\nShe is a single parent and sells fruits and vegetables, the respondent said. She has not sought employment since she lacks the required qualifications.\n\nFear of social judgment\n\nAlthough the survey revealed that some traditional gatekeepers of social norms are slowly becoming more progressive, the researchers note that the fear of social judgment continues to discourage girls and young women in Zimbabwe from accessing higher education or pursuing higher-earning opportunities.\n\nFor instance, eight in 10 respondents in the survey believed that boys education should be prioritised over girls when resources are limited, irrespective of academic ability. Furthermore, although 86% of women in Zimbabwe are reported to agree that it is acceptable to delay marriage or childbearing to pursue higher education, 56% of the sample began childbearing before the age of 20.\n\nAbout 50% of the surveyed group agreed that a womans primary responsibility is household care, that men should be the sole financial providers, and that men should have the final say in decisions in the home. These regressive attitudes, according to the researchers, are common among girls and women in rural areas, creating additional barriers to their higher education ambitions and economic empowerment.\n\nHowever, there are indications that girls and women in Zimbabwe with more positive egalitarian attitudes and self-confidence were fuelling ambitions, as they tend to have higher educational aspirations.\n\nRespondents who rejected the idea that boys should receive more academic resources than girls had higher aspirations for university education. Likewise, self-confidence, as measured by self-efficacy and career decision-making process, is strongly linked to higher educational goals, stated the researchers.\n\nIn this regard, the new survey serves as a reminder that gender equality in accessing higher education and well-paying jobs remains a mirage, not only in Zimbabwe, but also in many countries in Africa. The issue is that, unlike their male counterparts, girls and young women on the continent continue to be influenced and impacted negatively by their social environment.\n\n",

            "content": "Midfielder hasnt featured for Luton this season\n\nLutonboss Matt Bloomfield has confirmed that midfielder Marvelous Nakamba will be back in contention for the Hatters following his first outing of the season forZimbabwelast week, although faces a real battle to regain a place in the side.\n\nThe 31-year-old won his 30th cap when playing 74 minutes for the Warriors as they as they lost 1-0 to Benin in their World Cup qualifier on Friday at the Stade de lAmiti, although didnt feature in their 1-0 home loss to Rwanda at the National Sports Stadium on Tuesday, a result which left Zimbabwe firmly rooted at the bottom of their group table.\n\nNakamba is yet to play for Luton this term, or be involved in any first team squads, as with rumours of a move away surrounding his pre-season at Kenilworth Road, he has been restricted to just one outing for the U21s. However, with thoughts of an exit ended following the closure of the transfer window last Monday evening, it means that the experienced player will now remain in Bedfordshire until January at least, with Bloomfield stating he will come into consideration for the Hatters League One fixtures.\n\nAsked just how close he is fitness-wise to being able to do so, the Town chief said: Hes managed to get himself through 90 minutes for Zimbabwe so hes a lot closer than what he was before which is great. He was really keen to go on international duty, weve had some good competition in that midfield area but a fit and ready Marvelous Nakamba is obviously a plus for us as well, so hell come back into the group.\n\nWell welcome him back and look forward to seeing him, although competition for places is fierce in the middle of the pitch. I think George (Saville) has done particularly well, Clicker (Jordan Clark) is evergreen, Zacks (Nelson) done great the last couple of games, weve got Lamine (Fanne) as well and Walshy (Liam Walsh), so competition is fierce but Marv comes back into the thinking.\n\nWith Nakamba expected back from his country later in the week, on how hungry he was to still be a part of the Hatters squad, as the former Club Brugge and Aston Villa player, who has made 57 appearances since joining the club in January 2023, last starting for Town in their 2-0 defeat to fierce rivals Watford in February, injury restricting him to just one other sub appearance at Derby County in the run-in after that, Bloomfield added: Marv has had some interest, as a number of our players have had.\n\nTheres so many different situations that weve spoken about a number of times, but hes still with us now, so hes our player and hell be ready to contribute. Hes got to get back safely from international duty and we welcome him back into training on Friday and hell be ready to compete. Hes had, weve spoken about before, a bit of a slow summer, working his way back and its great for us and for him that hes gone and played 90 minutes for Zimbabwe. He was obviously really keen to play for his country as he always is, so another proud moment for him and good for us to have him back to fitness.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nPrimary and Secondary Education Minister Torerayi Moyo says his ministry has given unregistered schools until December 31, 2025, to regularise their operations or risk closure.\n\nResponding to questions in Parliament during a Wednesday Question and Answer session, Moyo said government had extended a four-month grace period for illegal private schools and colleges to comply.\n\nHe explained that authorities were cautious not to disadvantage learners who had already registered for examinations, hence the extension to the end of the year or early 2026.\n\nZanu PF legislator for Mt Pleasant, George Mashavave, had asked whether government had a policy framework to monitor and regularise the mushrooming of unregistered schools and colleges across the country.\n\nMoyo confirmed the existence of such a framework and stressed the need to act carefully.\n\nWe have given illegal schools a grace period of four months because we did not want to close them haphazardly, as this would disadvantage learners and violate their fundamental right to education.\n\nI want to assure this august House that very soon in November, or perhaps early next year, we may extend to January 2026. Come January, however, those schools still operating illegally and failing to regularise will be closed, said Moyo.\n\nThe minister admitted that unregistered schools were mushrooming countrywide but insisted that the ministrys Schools Psychological Services and Special Needs Education (SPPRS) department was responsible for school registration and providing technical advice to prospective investors.\n\nHe said circulars had already been sent out warning directors of illegal schools.\n\nI have made a clarion call to those directors of illegal schools to regularise their operations or face penalties at our disposal. All schools that are not registered are operating illegally. While we have avoided immediate closures to protect learners, the grace period expires on December 31, after which circulars will be enforced, and closures implemented, he added.\n\nMoyo also highlighted the governments progress in addressing the countrys school infrastructure deficit.\n\nAccording to a 2022 survey, Zimbabwe required 3,000 additional schools. Since then, more than 600 have been constructed.\n\nFrom 2022 to date, we have built over 600 schools. This year alone, we are targeting at least 200 more, he said.\n\nHowever, Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) MP Ellen Shiriyedenga argued that the school deficit could be fuelling the growth of illegal institutions.\n\nWe were told there is a deficit of 3,000 schools. This gap may be the reason for mushrooming schools, as children should not have to walk long distances. How far has the ministry gone in addressing this deficit? she asked.\n\nOther MPs raised concerns about exploitation, quality of education, and adherence to government policy in unregistered institutions.\n\nZanu PF legislator Clemence Chiduwa questioned whether private schools were being monitored to ensure local languages were taught at primary level.\n\nIn response, Moyo said this was precisely why government insisted on registration.\n\nOur policy is clear, schools must regularise so that we can monitor compliance, including adherence to curriculum and language policy. As it stands, we do not know what is happening in many backyards where illegal schools exist. That is why registration is critical, he said.\n\n",
