            "content": "By Business Report\n\nTHE diversified company, propelled by its mining sector which is seeing new orders for its regional markets on the back of a rebound in copper and battery metals, achieved robust results and delivered bumper dividends.\n\nOmnia Holdings delivered a resilient performance for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 despite set backs in the agriculture division, which was impacted by currency issues in Zimbabwe, drought in Zambia, and the civil unrest in Mozambique.\n\nThe diversified company, propelled by its mining sector which is seeing new orders for its regional markets on the back of a rebound in copper and battery metals, achieved robust results and delivered bumper dividends.\n\nThe agri business Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique didnt perform well, Seelan Gobalsamy, CEO of Omnia told Business Report in an interview.\n\nZimbabwe had the usual currency issues and a lot of uncertainty (and) we had some regulatory challenges and in Zambia, we saw a massive drought that impacted revenue.\n\nThe unrest that rocked Mozambique in 2024 and early into this year also affected Omnia. The company had to send products via Namibia into Zambia as routes through Mozambique were disturbed by the unrest, impacting working capital and profits negatively.\n\nWith strong performance from Agriculture RSA and mining segment, Omnias revenues for the year to the end of March grew 2.7% to R22.82 billion. Mining has emerged as Omnias strongest business from an outdoor projective.\n\nThere is still a strong demand for metals, you know, the metals that drive that transition to cleaner energy, you know, the battery metals, uranium. So, we are positively disposed to the mining market, and we are winning new customers, renewing new customers, explained Gobalsamy.\n\nHeadline earnings per share increased by 1% to 704 cents, while operating profit remained unchanged at R1.7bn despite the inclusion of the Chemicals restructuring costs, along with the impact of severe drought conditions and currency depreciation in Agriculture Rest of Africa.\n\nThe Mining segment delivered an improved operating margin of 12.4% from 12.1%, supported by strong performance from Mining RSA and Mining International, as well as higher throughput and efficiencies.\n\nIn the mining sector, sustained demand for critical minerals supporting the global energy transition, underpinned exploration activity and supported positive fundamentals for the explosives market.\n\nHowever, geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainty presented ongoing risks.\n\nThe group had a net cash balance of R1.77bn was down from R2.3bn.\n\nThe board declared a total dividend of 675 cents per share for the year. This comprises an increased ordinary dividend of 400 cents, from 375 cents the prior year, and a special dividend of 275 cents per share, returning R1.1bn to shareholders.\n\nDespite persistent macroeconomic headwinds, Omnia delivered sustained profitability and continued to create long-term value for shareholders. This performance reflects the strength, quality, and growing diversity of our portfolio, underpinned by a sharpened focus on manufacturing efficiency, supply chain resilience, and customer-driven innovation, Gobalsamy said\n\nThe increased ordinary dividend payout, and special dividend declared is a clear signal of our confidence in the sustainability of our earnings and the successful execution of our growth and diversification strategy.\n\nLooking ahead, Omnia said the outlook for its Agriculture segment remained positive, driven by expected improvements in agronomic conditions across key regions such as the proprietary Nutriology model.\n\nOmnia said 2026 will be a significant transition year in which non-core assets and business lines will be sold, capital released and returns improved.\n\n",

It is widely considered a critical juncture for Zimbabwes reform agenda.\n\nWhile the Staff Monitored Programme (SMP) does not provide funding, its successful implementation is a prerequisite for future access to concessional financing, potential debt restructuring, and the restoration of confidence among international creditors and investorsall of which Zimbabwe desperately needs.The southern African nation is burdened with a burgeoning public debt that has now exceeded US$21 billion, including more than US$12.3 billion owed to external creditors.Following the visit, IMF Mission Chief Maliszewski said the IMF would like to see a fully functioning local ZiG currency and fiscal discipline with a balance between expenditure and revenue.He also addressed the issue of corruption and stressed the need for a genuine currency exchange market, as well as a credible debt restructuring process.In an attempt to put a positive spin on this, Mangwana posted on his X account his own interpretation of the IMFs comments.The IMF sees macroeconomic stability in Zimbabwe we see it too.

We stress that the ban should be implemented immediately to prevent further depletion of our natural capital due to unchecked lithium exploitation, which has devastating socio-economic and environmental implications, CNRG stated.\n\nThe organisation further urged the government to address the issue of porous borders, which have allowed some lithium to be smuggled into South Africa and Mozambique without any benefit to Zimbabwe\n\nZimbabwes lithium wealth risks being squandered, as unchecked exports, weak regulation, and opaque deals undermine its potential for industrial transformation.\n\nAlready, allegations of lithium smuggling across porous borders into South Africa and Mozambique raise concerns regarding corruption and illicit mineral and financial flows.\n\nUnverified reports indicate that up to 3,000 tons of lithium ore leave the country dailya staggering total of 1.62 million tons over the past 18 monthswith minimal accountability, little benefit to the state, and no protection for affected communities.\n\nDuring a post-cabinet media briefing in Harare yesterday, Mines Minister Winston Chitando said the government will ban the exportation of lithium ore as part of an effort to promote value addition and ensure that the country comprehensively benefits from its natural resources.\n\nCabinet reaffirmed the ban on the export of chrome ores and stressed the need to develop the ferrochrome industry locally. The Ministry of Mines and Mining Development will strengthen the implementation of the use it or lose it principle, and holders of all unutilised mining titles, particularly chrome, are requested to take note of the Governments position, Chitando said.\n\nHe added that Bikita Minerals and Arcadia Lithium are in the process of establishing lithium sulphate value addition facilities to beneficiate locally produced lithium ores. From January 2027 onwards, the export of lithium concentrate will no longer be permitted.\n\nLithium plays a crucial role in the clean energy transition due to its essential function in energy storage. It is a key component in lithium-ion batteries, which power electric vehicles (EVs) and facilitate large-scale energy storage systems for renewable energy sources.\n\n",

A 2022 Centre for Natural Resource Governance report on illicit financial flows in the artisanal mining sector estimated that as much as $1.9 billion is lost annually due to leakages.\n\nOn their part, artisanal miners have since cried foul over ill treatment, stigma and underpayments for the minerals by gold buyers in the shadowy economy.\n\nSpeaking to NewZimbabwe.com on Wednesday, ZAMA national coordinator, Elias Masuku, said the formalisation program will solve all the problems around artisanal mining once and for all.\n\nWe are currently rolling out a formalisation exercise which is driven by the motive of regularising every mining workspace across Zimbabwe. We are also pushing for the availability of workspaces through negotiations with people who have idle claims for them to cede. Such initiatives will go a long way to create opportunities for those willing to venture into mining, he said.\n\nMasuku said the association is offering legal services to support small-scale miners who often face the risk of harassment from the sectors big players who enjoy a firmer financial muscle. This, he said, is over and above other benefits like housing schemes, which will soon be tabled.\n\nWe have since begun work in places like Mberengwa. We are going to have a project in Buluwewe and other places as we drive the agenda of formalising, capitalising and capacitating the artisanal miner. Formalisation will benefit the miners and all the stakeholders in the value chain and is now long overdue, added Masuku.\n\n",
