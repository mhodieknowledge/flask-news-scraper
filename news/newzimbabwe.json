            "content": "By Cricinfo\n\nBEN Duckett brought up his fifth Test hundred and first at his home ground at exactly a run ball. Zak Crawley got a first Test century since July 2023, 28 innings ago. Between them, they shared in Englands highest-opening stand at home since 1960.\n\nOllie Pope added the trimmings with his third hundred in as many Tests at Trent Bridge and eighth against as many different oppositions and England scored the most runs on the first day of a Test in England. If that reads like all-out dominance, it was.It was also a rude welcome for Zimbabwes XI, none of whom had played a Test in England before, and many of whom will not remember the last time their team were in the country 22 years ago.After Craig Ervine chose to bowl first under cloudy skies, Zimbabwes four-seam, single-spinner attack struggled for consistency and were hurt by the loss of one of their cogs for most of the day.Opening bowler Richard Ngarava left the field ten minutes into the second session with what was later confirmed to be a back spasm. He returned an hour and five minutes into the third, with a ginger step. He fielded for a few minutes but was soon back in the dressing room, which limited his days work to nine overs in the morning.Premier seamer Blessing Muzarabani, who was also the most threatening of the quicks, bowled 20 overs while Sikandar Raza delivered 24 overs but little Zimbabwe tried hurt England. The hosts top-order batted with exactly the right mix of caution and aggression, though the scoring rate of 5.66 would suggest only the latter.Duckett and Crawley started with some circumspection and the first six overs brought just 19 runs. But that was as good as it got for Zimbabwe as boundaries came soon after, and regularly.Crawley announced himself with a cracking drive through the covers, which was followed by Duckett taking on Muzarabani off the front and back foot. After 10 overs, Ervine made his first change and introduced Tanaka Chivanga, whose opening over cost 12.Chivanga was the only one to find some swing and Duckett had a nervy moment when he miscued a drive into the off side but there was no fielder close enough to attempt a catch.Duckett lashed the next ball over the slips and to the boundary to bring up fifty off 47 balls. Crawleys fifty came in Victor Nyauchis first over, when he whipped the ball through square leg and ran a comfortable two, and England went to lunch on 130 for 0.Zimbabwe thought they had some luck in the over after the break when Nyauchi, from around the wicket, believed he had found Ducketts edge. It turned out to be a flick of his jumper. At the end of that over, Duckett edged Nyauchi between wide slip and gully and moved into the 80s. He reverse-swept and cut Raza to enter the 90s and then worked him square for a single to bring up his century.Still, Zimbabwes hopes of seeing the back of Duckett were kept alive. On 104, he popped Nyauchi a return chance but the ball fell short. And then Duckett went full throttle. He cut Chivanga over cover point and pulled him over deep backward square for the first six of the match, and seemed unstoppable.With Duckett on 130 and Zimbabwe all but out of options, Wessly Madhevere was brought on and immediately hit for four through the covers and then launched over midwicket for six.Against the run of play, Duckett hit Madheveres next ball straight to Ben Curran at cover and could not believe what he had done. He trudged off as Zimbabwe enjoyed their first smiles of the day, only to look up and see Pope.In the first 18 balls he faced, Pope hit six fours, a sign of what was to come. By tea, Pope was on 49 off 46 balls. Crawley, content with the supporting act, had worked his way to 93.Popes fifty came two balls into the third session and he had reached 61 when Crawley got a leading edge off Nyauchi and ran the single that took him to three figures. His sedate celebration seemed to spell relief, not jubilation, and could quieten criticism ahead of sterner challenges to follow. He added 24 more runs before missing a sweep against Raza, to be given out lbw. Crawley reviewed but replays showed it was hitting leg stump.Popes charge continued undeterred with an array of strokes all around the ground and his hundred came up with a cut. It marked the eighth different opponent he had scored a century against. The milestones kept coming as Joe Root became the fifth player to score 13,000 Test runs and the numbers may have made Zimbabwe giddy.They took the second new-ball as soon as it became available and it only gave England more scoring opportunities. Root hit the first delivery for four, then Pope took two more fours off a tiring Muzarabanis 17th over (and ensured he conceded 100) to reach 150.To add insult to injury he followed an Nyauchi inswinger and helped it over fine leg, which meant England had scored 22 runs off seven deliveries. It did not all go their way, however. Muzarabani finally had some reward when he sent down a surprise bouncer and Root top-edged to Sean Williams at fine leg.That was as much reward as Zimbabwe got as Pope and Harry Brook batted out the rest of the day to finish two short of 500. Pope was unbeaten on 169 off 163 balls.\n\nOllie Pope added the trimmings with his third hundred in as many Tests at Trent Bridge and eighth against as many different oppositions and England scored the most runs on the first day of a Test in England.

After 10 overs, Ervine made his first change and introduced Tanaka Chivanga, whose opening over cost 12.Chivanga was the only one to find some swing and Duckett had a nervy moment when he miscued a drive into the off side but there was no fielder close enough to attempt a catch.Duckett lashed the next ball over the slips and to the boundary to bring up fifty off 47 balls. Crawleys fifty came in Victor Nyauchis first over, when he whipped the ball through square leg and ran a comfortable two, and England went to lunch on 130 for 0.Zimbabwe thought they had some luck in the over after the break when Nyauchi, from around the wicket, believed he had found Ducketts edge. It turned out to be a flick of his jumper. At the end of that over, Duckett edged Nyauchi between wide slip and gully and moved into the 80s. He reverse-swept and cut Raza to enter the 90s and then worked him square for a single to bring up his century.Still, Zimbabwes hopes of seeing the back of Duckett were kept alive. On 104, he popped Nyauchi a return chance but the ball fell short. And then Duckett went full throttle. He cut Chivanga over cover point and pulled him over deep backward square for the first six of the match, and seemed unstoppable.With Duckett on 130 and Zimbabwe all but out of options, Wessly Madhevere was brought on and immediately hit for four through the covers and then launched over midwicket for six.Against the run of play, Duckett hit Madheveres next ball straight to Ben Curran at cover and could not believe what he had done. He trudged off as Zimbabwe enjoyed their first smiles of the day, only to look up and see Pope.In the first 18 balls he faced, Pope hit six fours, a sign of what was to come. By tea, Pope was on 49 off 46 balls. Crawley, content with the supporting act, had worked his way to 93.Popes fifty came two balls into the third session and he had reached 61 when Crawley got a leading edge off Nyauchi and ran the single that took him to three figures. His sedate celebration seemed to spell relief, not jubilation, and could quieten criticism ahead of sterner challenges to follow. He added 24 more runs before missing a sweep against Raza, to be given out lbw. Crawley reviewed but replays showed it was hitting leg stump.Popes charge continued undeterred with an array of strokes all around the ground and his hundred came up with a cut. It marked the eighth different opponent he had scored a century against. The milestones kept coming as Joe Root became the fifth player to score 13,000 Test runs and the numbers may have made Zimbabwe giddy.They took the second new-ball as soon as it became available and it only gave England more scoring opportunities. Root hit the first delivery for four, then Pope took two more fours off a tiring Muzarabanis 17th over (and ensured he conceded 100) to reach 150.To add insult to injury he followed an Nyauchi inswinger and helped it over fine leg, which meant England had scored 22 runs off seven deliveries. It did not all go their way, however. Muzarabani finally had some reward when he sent down a surprise bouncer and Root top-edged to Sean Williams at fine leg.That was as much reward as Zimbabwe got as Pope and Harry Brook batted out the rest of the day to finish two short of 500. Pope was unbeaten on 169 off 163 balls.\n\nPremier seamer Blessing Muzarabani, who was also the most threatening of the quicks, bowled 20 overs while Sikandar Raza delivered 24 overs but little Zimbabwe tried hurt England.

The milestones kept coming as Joe Root became the fifth player to score 13,000 Test runs and the numbers may have made Zimbabwe giddy.They took the second new-ball as soon as it became available and it only gave England more scoring opportunities. Root hit the first delivery for four, then Pope took two more fours off a tiring Muzarabanis 17th over (and ensured he conceded 100) to reach 150.To add insult to injury he followed an Nyauchi inswinger and helped it over fine leg, which meant England had scored 22 runs off seven deliveries. It did not all go their way, however. Muzarabani finally had some reward when he sent down a surprise bouncer and Root top-edged to Sean Williams at fine leg.That was as much reward as Zimbabwe got as Pope and Harry Brook batted out the rest of the day to finish two short of 500. Pope was unbeaten on 169 off 163 balls.\n\nPopes charge continued undeterred with an array of strokes all around the ground and his hundred came up with a cut.

            "content": "By Pan Pylas l Associated Press\n\nLONDON: The British government will roll out the use of medication to suppress the sex drive of sex offenders, as part of a package of measures to reduce the risk of reoffending and alleviate the pressures on the prison system, which is running out of space.\n\nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said Thursday that so-called chemical castration would be used in 20 prisons in two regions and that she was considering making it mandatory.Of course, it is vital that this approach is taken alongside psychological interventions that target other causes of offending, like asserting power and control, she said in a statement to Parliament following the release of an independent sentencing review.Though the review highlighted the treatment wouldnt be relevant for some sex offenders such as rapists driven by power and control, rather than sexual preoccupation, Mahmood said that studies show that chemical castration can lead to a 60% reduction in reoffending.Its been used in Germany and Denmark on a voluntary basis, and in Poland as mandatory for some offenders.The recommendation was part of a wide-ranging review led by former Justice Secretary David Gauke. As well as looking at ways to cut reoffending, Gauke recommended reforms to overhaul the prisons system, which is running at near capacity.One of the first things Mahmood did as justice minister after Labour returned to power after 14 years last July was sanction an early-release program for prisoners to free up space.She says she inherited a judicial system that had been neglected for years by the previous Conservative government and set up the review as a means to stabilize it.If our prisons collapse, courts are forced to suspend trials, she said.The police must halt their arrests, crime goes unpunished, criminals run amok and chaos reigns. We face the breakdown of law and order in this country.The review recommended that criminals could be released from prison earlier than they are now for good behavior, while judges could be given more flexibility to impose punishments such as driving bans.It also recommended that sentences of less than 12 months would also be scrapped for tougher community sentences. It also called for the immediate deportation for foreign nationals handed a three-year sentence or less.The review called for higher investment in the probation service to allow officers to spend more time with offenders for their rehabilitation and extra funding for the many more who are monitored with electronic tags in the community.Mahmood responded by giving a 700 million-pound ($930 million) a year for probation within years.If the government doesnt put the resources into probation that is necessary, then the risk here is that we wont make progress on rehabilitation that we need, and there will be a public backlash against it, Gauke said.The prison population in England and Wales has doubled over the past three decades or so to nearly 90,000. Thats despite a fall in crime rates and is driven in part by the fact that longer sentences are being handed out amid pressure to be tough on crime.Robert Jenrick, the justice spokesman for the Conservatives, warned that scrapping short sentences would be effectively decriminalizing offenses like burglary, theft and assault. And monitoring tags, he said, are as useful as smoke alarms putting out bonfires in stopping reoffending.In response, Mahmood said that she was clearing up the mess left by the Conservatives and that the government has also embarked on the largest expansion of prisons since Victorian times in the 19th century.\n\nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said Thursday that so-called chemical castration would be used in 20 prisons in two regions and that she was considering making it mandatory.\n\nOf course, it is vital that this approach is taken alongside psychological interventions that target other causes of offending, like asserting power and control, she said in a statement to Parliament following the release of an independent sentencing review.Though the review highlighted the treatment wouldnt be relevant for some sex offenders such as rapists driven by power and control, rather than sexual preoccupation, Mahmood said that studies show that chemical castration can lead to a 60% reduction in reoffending.Its been used in Germany and Denmark on a voluntary basis, and in Poland as mandatory for some offenders.The recommendation was part of a wide-ranging review led by former Justice Secretary David Gauke.

This is despite video evidence, such as that shared by legislator Takudzwa Ngadziore, of identified Central Intelligence Organisations (CIO) operatives abducting him.\n\nRecently, journalist Blessed Mhlanga was locked up for 73 days for daring to publish a press conference by outspoken war veteran Blessed Geza, who is demanding President Emmerson Mnangagwas immediate resignation.\n\nACHPRs Janet Ramatoulie Sallah-Njie, who doubles as Country Rapporteur for Zimbabwe and ACHPR Chairperson Rmy Ngoy Lumbu are some of the commissioners who questioned efforts being done by Zimbabwe to protect rights of ordinary citizens.\n\nAsked on the continued disappearance of Itai Dzamara, government said a reward was still up for anyone who would come with information, but then failed to prove investigations or a search was still in progress.\n\nOn safety of journalists, the sharing of press jackets was presented as the biggest milestone in the journey to ending abuse of the media.\n\nHaving taken over from late President Robert Mugabe in a coup in November 2017, most Zimbabweans assumed Mnangagwas regime would be better off.\n\nAfter years of surviving in fear of Mugabes State security, they never assumed Mnangagwas troops would kill innocent souls on August 1, 2018 or literally ban peaceful protest by citizens and political parties as was done leading to the 2023 general elections.\n\nEven arrests of journalists were expected to have been a thing of the past, but they have continued.\n\nMnangagwa has continuously struggled to rid himself of the pariah tag put on him by Western countries, which he so fervently wants to re-engage with.\n\n",
