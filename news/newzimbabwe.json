Unfortunately, her condition continued to deteriorate, leading to her death on 5th October 2025, ZRP national spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi said in a statement.It was during the childs burial when rumour started circulating that the deceased may have been poisoned leading villagers to alert Chief Ziki, who then instructed the victims mother to report the case to the police.Following investigations Gamera implicated Kwanga as the person who advised her to poison the child as well as Tavengerarwei as the supplier of the poison.Police have since recovered rat poison and a liquid substance suspected to be a cotton pesticide, believed to have been used in the commission of the offence.Meanwhile, the body of the victim has been exhumed and taken to Silveira Mission Hospital mortuary for a post-mortem examination.Nyathi urged members of the public to resolve disputes through lawful and peaceful means.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) confirmed that Sabina Maziva (4) died a week ago after she was allegedly fed the poisoned food by a neighbour, Violet Gamera (60), who accused the childs parents of letting their goats stray and destroy her crops.\n\nGamera, along with Chamunorwa Kwanga (60) and Regina Tavengerarwei (30), have since been arrested as police continue investigating the suspected murder.Initial investigations reveal that on 1st October 2025, Violet Gamera allegedly gave the victim poisoned rice as an act of revenge against the childs parents, whose goats had previously destroyed her crops.The child later began vomiting and was referred to a local clinic, where she received medical attention.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAS the Zanu PF annual conference kicks off this week, the ruling party is urging discipline within its rank-and-file amid social media claims alleging plans to heckle Vice President Constantino Chiwenga during the event, as the succession debate intensifies.\n\nChiwenga is widely regarded as the frontrunner to succeed President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2028 when his second term expires. However, his path to the presidencywhile seemingly straightforwardis reportedly being obstructed by Mnangagwas loyalists, who are pushing for an extension of the Presidents tenure to 2030.\n\nAmong these loyalists is a group of controversial business figures, including convicted businessman Wicknell Chivayo, Paul Tungwarara, and Kudakwashe Tagwirei, who have publicly and repeatedly pledged to support Mnangagwas continued leadership beyond 2028.\n\nIn recent days, social media has been awash with claims that Zanu PF youths are being bussed to Mutare, Manicaland province, for the sole purpose of booing Chiwengaa development seen as a sign that the succession battle is escalating.\n\nZanu PF Director of Communication, Farai Marapira, dismissed the allegations, insisting that the partys conference would not be used to heckle senior leaders, as attendance is restricted to vetted delegates.\n\nWe are not going to a rally. We are going to a conference. This is not a free for all. This is a meeting of delegates. This is a meeting of leadership. There is no time to heckle. This is just once again social media trying its best to push agendas on us as Zanu PF. But of course it will fail, he said.\n\nMarapira further stated that those promoting claims of planned disruption were ignorant of the partys internal procedures.\n\nThis issue of being bussed to boo, how are they going to enter when they are not accredited? We are not accrediting crowds, we are accrediting delegates. This is mischief being created by people who are ignorant of the ways of the party and how it conducts its conferences, Marapira said.\n\nThe alleged plans to heckle Chiwenga come against the backdrop of his sustained stance against corruption, which he has consistently described as a threat to national security. Chiwenga has publicly condemned prominent businessmenamong them Chivayo, Tungwarara, Tagwirei, and Delish Nguwayathough without naming them directly, referring instead to the group as Zvigananda a deragatory term for plunderers.\n\nLast month, Chiwenga reportedly presented a detailed corruption dossier during a Zanu PF Politburo meeting, implicating Nguwaya, Chivayo, Tagwirei, and Tungwarara. Analysts claim the dossier was so damaging that President Mnangagwa had to abandon his planned trip to the United States, where he was scheduled to lead Zimbabwes campaign for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.\n\n",
