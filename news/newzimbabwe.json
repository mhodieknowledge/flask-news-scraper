            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nA REHABILITATED former inmate at Chinhoyi Farm Prison has found renewed hope of life after undergoing training in horticulture, which will be his source of livelihood post-incarceration.\n\nBernard Bennet (37), who completed a two-year jail term for robbery, at the weekend, upon his release, became the first beneficiary of the reintegration programme, receiving a horticultural starter pack consisting of a water pump, knapsack sprayer, seed and fertilizers.\n\nBennet is expected to start an income-generating horticultural project at his rural home in Zvimba.\n\nSpeaking at the handover ceremony, Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) Officer Commanding Mashonaland West, Commissioner Luke Zondai Makuvire expressed confidence that the pilot project will help reduce chances of re-offending.\n\nZPCS Officer Commanding Mashonaland West Commissioner Makuvire hands over a knapsack sprayer, among other goods, to ex-convict as he heads home\n\nWhat makes this event more special than any other release is that for the first time in Mashonaland West province, Bernard Bennet is being released and given a starter pack to go and start a new life devoid of crime, said Makuvire.\n\nThe ZPCS provincial commander noted that the event marked a major milestone in prison management as enunciated in his turnaround blueprint rolled out on May 15, 2023.\n\nThe turnaround strategy is meant to address certain challenges bedevilling the ZPCS thereby improving the welfare of both inmates and officers. This is exactly what we are witnessing today.\n\nMakuvire said the occasion marked the fulfilment of ZPCS mandate which is to protect society from criminal elements through incarceration and rehabilitation of offenders for their successful reintegration into society whilst exercising reasonable, safe, secure and human control.\n\nHe reiterated progress ZPCS has made in recent years in closing the missing link of reintegration of inmates back into society.\n\nWe have been doing well in terms of fulfilling our mandate of incarceration and rehabilitation, but the missing link has been the reintegration aspect. I am proud but remain humble that this aspect has finally been realised, said the commissioner.\n\nFormer inmate Bernard Bennet bid ZPCS officers farewell\n\nWithout reintegration, he added, ex-convicts find it difficult to join society and face rejection resulting in recidivism.\n\nAddressing guests gathered to witness the release and handover ceremony, Chinhoyi Prison Farm Officer-in-Charge Superintendent Gilbert Mavhako said Bennets release was a unique milestone.\n\nThis event is more than just the end of a prison sentence; it is a powerful symbol of renewal, personal growth, and the triumph of rehabilitation. It reflects the core purpose of our correctional efforts  to restore dignity, rebuild lives, and return individuals to society better equipped to contribute positively.\n\nBennets journey reminds us all that with the right support, opportunities, and determination, transformation is not only possible but attainable.\n\nHe is a shining example of how rehabilitation programmes can cultivate not only crops, but character.\n\nDuring his time in incarceration, Bennet did not allow his circumstances to define his future. Instead, he embraced the opportunity for growth and development through the prisons rehabilitation programmes. He dedicated himself to horticultural training, acquiring hands-on experience in crop production, nursery management, soil preparation, composting, and sustainable irrigation techniques.\n\nThe produce from the farm not only fed fellow inmates but also supported prison operations, giving him a clear purpose and a feeling of being useful once again.\n\nOn his part, Bennet thanked the ZPCS command element led by Commissioner Makuvire for moulding him into a better and purposeful citizen.\n\nI promise to put the skills and resources to good use and rebuild my life free of crime. I will never return to this system as a criminal but to give back to a system that gave me a fresh start to life, said Bennet, who returns to his wife who stood by him throughout his incarceration.\n\nThe reintegration initiative will benefit inmates pursuing other vacations in animal husbandry, crop production, tailoring, carpentry, among other projects.\n\nThe initiative reinforces ZPCSs commitment to ensuring the rehabilitation of offenders and supporting their reintegration into the community through practical empowerment initiatives.\n\n",

The applicant is entitled to the declaratory order sought.\n\nSandra had alleged that she was removed from the trust without her knowledge or consent and that her signature was fraudulently appended to documents purporting to authorise the change.\n\nShe also claimed that two properties held under the trust were sold without her involvement.\n\nThe trust, established in 2014 and meant to safeguard family assets and benefit the couples children, had listed both Sandra and Simon Mupindu as trustees.\n\nThe court noted that Simons unilateral actions violated the terms of the original trust deed, which specified that only beneficiaries could alter trustee appointments.\n\nSimon had argued that the trust was his initiative and claimed his wifes role was symbolic.\n\nHowever, the court dismissed his arguments and those of the other respondents, including his legal firm Mupindu Legal Practitioners, and Chitopota.\n\nThe fourth respondent, the Registrar of Deeds, did not oppose the application and has been ordered to amend official records accordingly.\n\nJustice Ndlovu also dismissed all preliminary objections raised by the respondents, including claims of lis pendens (pending litigation), material falsehoods, and misjoinder.\n\nIn a stinging rebuke, the judge ordered Simon Mupindu, Chitopota, and the law firm to pay costs on a legal practitioner-client scale.\n\n",
