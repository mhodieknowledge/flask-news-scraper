There may be good reasons why the professors and lecturers are striking, but we cannot say that every strike that happens somewhere is a condemnation of the government.\n\nThere is nothing untoward about lecturers or any other Zimbabwean saying, I am not happy with what my employer is doing. It is not a political issue; it is an employer-employee relationship, said Mutsvangwa.\n\nThe Association of University Teachers, which is campaigning for a salary increase, has been met with silence from UZ.\n\nUZ responded heavy-handedly, suspending five of the striking lecturers, with reports indicating that newly recruited adjunct teachers will earn US$3 per hour.\n\nMutsvangwa said a solution must be found to avert further chaos at UZ.\n\nNo, it is an expression of the democratic nature of Zimbabwean society. There is nothing wrong with striking, but hopefully, they will sit down together and assess each others grievances and demands.\n\nThere is no way we can be permanently without lecturers at such an important institution as the University of Zimbabwe. I am sure something good will come out of it, said Mutsvangwa.\n\n",

How can you be a law officer without knowledge of using IECMS, especially since it was introduced back in 2022? Malaba remarked.\n\nYou cant pursue such a post when you score zero in a crucial test meant to prepare you for this role. All lawyers should know how to use the IECMS.\n\nHe continued to express his disappointment, saying, There is a component of laxity in you Your attitude toward IECMS is worrying. We cannot understand why a senior lawyer like you doesnt know these things or seems indifferent to the changes occurring not just in Zimbabwes judicial space but globally.\n\nIn response, Masango vowed to amend his approach if granted the position.\n\nI will never do that again. If I am given the post, I will change that attitude and put my all into this job, he said.\n\nMy CV shows that I have not been stagnant; Ive received promotions because my supervisors were satisfied with my performance. If there was laxity in my work, clients would have reported me to the Law Society. Im a go-getter, and I adhere to ethical conduct.\n\nThe JSC is interviewing 28 candidates who are competing for eight positions on the Labour Court bench. The process began on Tuesday. Initially, the commission received 53 nominations, but following a review, six submissions were invalidated, and two were withdrawn.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, 45 candidates participated in the first-level examination, with 28 qualifying for the final interviews.\n\nThe panel of interviewers includes Malaba, his deputy, Elizabeth Gwaunza, Attorney General Virginia Mabhiza, Judge President Mary Zimba Dube, and Chief Magistrate Vongai Guuriro Muchuchuti, among others.\n\n",

Equally, I wish a speedy recovery to all those nursing injuries from the incident. I have since directed the responsible arms of my Government to declare this traffic accident a national disaster.\n\nThis crucial legal step paves the way for Government to move in and take all-round responsibility for the interment of all those who perished the accident, and for support to those hospitalised. May all the bereaved and other affected families find comfort and a solace in that our Nation joins and mourns with them in this hour of deep grief and pain, said Mnangagwa.\n\nHe urged the public to support law enforcement in addressing reckless driving.\n\nThe deadly incident adds yet another grim statistic to the needless toll which reckless driving levies on our people and our Nation. While I am pleased that the Zimbabwe Republic Police is moving speedily towards a full deployment of high-end technologies for traffic management, and for curbing waywardness on our roads, more still has to be done to arrest the ever-spiralling fatalities we face as a Nation.\n\nThe duty for safe traffic conduct squarely falls on all road users, while the responsibility to call out reckless road-users includes the general public who should support our law enforcement agencies to tame what in essence has become a traffic jungle, added Mnangagwa.\n\n",

It would have been a release for us not to make that visit because we are aware that Parliament is where it started. Parliament is where the Constitution was made and where that provision, Section 210 of the Constitution, was created, which enables us as the Commission to investigate cases of misconduct or violations of the Constitution by members of the security services, that is the Army, the CIO, the prison service and the police.\n\nIts mainly cases of assaults by police officers and allegations of abuse of our office, and those are the main cases, and also delays in handling of our cases when reports are made to the police about violations,Chinamora said.\n\nChinamora also highlighted that the Commission had received tremendous support from the President in the form of offices being sequenced to it from the Office of the President and Cabinet and support from the Public Service Commission (PSC).\n\nWe are also informing the Speaker that we have made a draft of the regulations which set out the procedure for receiving complaints, investigating complaints and ending the hearings when they do come to us. So, we are telling them that we did our own draft as a Commission, and we presented it to the Attorney General, and the drafters are now working on it, so that the draft crystallises into a statutory instrument.\n\nWe also got support from the Speaker himself, with very invaluable suggestions that we have a retreat with senior officers for the top brass of the Security Services, so that we build that trust which is required, and that will help us in terms of preventing the actual making of complaints if the top brass knows how to avoid cases of misconduct, how to avoid mistakes which generate the mistakes.\n\n",
