            "content": "By Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal\n\nLand reforms gave Zimbabweans farms  but contract tobacco deals have handed power to private companies.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  Zimbabwes tobacco sector was once on the brink of collapse. Now, its booming again. Last year alone, it earned the country close to US$1 billion in revenue.\n\nBut though the crop is one of the countrys top exports and production has soared, small-scale contract farmers say they see little profit due to restrictive financing agreements.\n\nThe tobacco boom, farmers say, is keeping them in debt.\n\nGift Ngoma is among them. When he lost his clerk job eight years ago, tobacco farming was the only way he could feed his family. But fertilizer, seeds and labor proved expensive. Even money from the few cows he sold wasnt enough.\n\nLike many rural Zimbabweans, hed gotten land  about 3.5 hectares (9 acres)  through traditional tenure. But those who secured land that way often lack a title deed. For Ngoma, formal credit was out of the question.\n\nNgoma knew of local farmers who had entered agreements with private companies. The deals looked good at first: Each planting season, a company provided farmers with seeds and fertilizer on credit. Theyd offer technical support throughout the season. In return, farmers sold enough of their crop to the company and used part of the revenue to cover what they owed.\n\nNgoma signed on with Premium Leaf Zimbabwe, a subsidiary of Premium Tobacco  a global company headquartered in Dubai.\n\nThe company provided him with seeds and some money for labor. Once harvest came, he sold enough tobacco to the company to pay off his debt. But over time, he says, this agreement came to feel like a trap. The seeds and other inputs are overpriced, he says, and theres little money left over to find true success as a farmer.\n\nGift Ngoma, a tobacco farmer, waits to sell his crop in Harare. He turned to farming after losing his formal job, but he says contract agreements have trapped him in debt. He now advocates for land rights and alternative financing. Photo Credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nMore than 100,000 small-scale tobacco farmers in Zimbabwe have entered into contracts with tobacco companies, according to data from the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board, a statutory body that oversees tobacco production in the country.\n\nThe contracts  heavily financed by companies such as British American Tobacco and Tian Ze (China Tobacco)  now support over 95% of Zimbabwes tobacco production.\n\nThat production has rebounded from just 44 million kilograms in 2006 to 232 million kilograms in 2024. The industry brings in hundreds of millions of United States dollars each year and contributes nearly 10% of Zimbabwes gross domestic product. It accounts for 30% of all exports and over 50% of agricultural exports. In 2024, Zimbabwe was the worlds third-largest exporter of raw tobacco, accounting for 10% of global exports, behind Brazil and India.\n\nSources: International Trade Centre; Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency; UN COMTRADE\n\nBut smallholding farmers dont feel that success. In December 2024, the government announced plans to issue title deeds to beneficiaries of the land reform program, which would give farmers a chance to use their land as collateral and rely less on contract farming. But for now, many still rely on tobacco contracts.\n\nWe are in a cycle of oppression, Ngoma says. There is poverty in contract farming. Its as if we are laborers on our farms.\n\nWhen Global Press Journal reached out to Premium Leaf Zimbabwe for comment, they said it was the companys policy to protect the privacy of our farmers and operational integrity. Tian Ze and British American Tobacco did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nTobacco farmers Chamu Rukwere and Rudo Nedziwe grade their harvest at home in Rusape, Zimbabwe. While contract farming connects them to global markets, they say it strips away the autonomy land reform was meant to provide. Photo credit: Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nZimbabwes shift to contract farming has roots in a wider story of land reform.\n\nAt independence in 1980, white Zimbabweans  who made up less than 2% of the population  controlled nearly half of all agricultural land. The majority black population was confined to degraded, overcrowded communal areas.\n\nIn 2000, then-President Robert Mugabe launched the controversial Fast Track Land Reform Programme. The government redistributed millions of hectares of land from about 6,000 large, white-owned farms to more than 168,000 black-owned farms, according to a Human Rights Watch report.\n\nThe reforms were rushed, controversial and violent, but they brought a new agrarian structure. Tobacco, at the time one of the most valuable crops and dominated by white-owned farms, shifted to small-scale operations by the new landowners.\n\nBut the new generation of farmers didnt have access to traditional bank credit since they didnt hold deeds to their land. Tobacco production dropped dramatically, from over 197,000 tons in 1998 to about 44,000 tons in 2006.\n\nSource: Food and Agriculture Organization; The Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development; Tobacco Industry & Marketing Board Election Commission of India, New Delhi\n\nFarmers needed support, and into the vacuum stepped contract schemes, mostly by Chinese agribusinesses such as Tian Ze. They supplied seeds, fertilizers and technical support in exchange for crop guarantees, price control and access to global markets. Ultimately, those contracts played a key role in the post-reform tobacco boom.\n\nContract schemes now dominate Zimbabwes tobacco farming, says Emmanuel Matsvaire, acting chief executive officer of the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board. In the 2024-25 season alone, the board recorded a total of 106,555 small-scale growers, he says, and about 89% of these are contract farming. In the 2025 season, the board licensed 43 companies to contract tobacco farmers.\n\nThe countrys economy has long struggled and local financing is generally limited, Matsvaire says. These companies fill the gap.\n\nBut farmers say the fine print works against them.\n\nSeeds and fertilizer are overpriced, Ngoma says. For half a hectare, he receives seven bags of fertilizer for US$65 each. At the shops, the same bag costs about US$40. Many farmers dont have ready cash to buy directly from shops, so they rely on private companies to provide fertilizer and other inputs, even if it means paying more when harvest comes.\n\nPiles of tobacco await processing in Rusape, Zimbabwe. Though tobacco is one of the countrys top exports and production has soared, small-scale contract farmers say that thanks to restrictive agreements, they see little profit. Photo credit: Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nBecause of poverty, we continue to be dependent, Ngoma says.\n\nOnce contract farmers pay back the debts, very little is left. In some cases, the total earnings dont even cover the debt, Ngoma says, which forces them to grow tobacco for the same company the next season.\n\nThe companies control the whole process, including land use, Ngoma says, adding that at times they bring in agricultural experts who dictate seed types, planting times and farming methods, completely disregarding local farming knowledge.\n\nPeter Neshumba, 36, began contract farming for Premium Leaf Zimbabwe in 2024. He says these companies go as far as controlling whether farmers can plant anything else. They want full devotion for their crops, he says. Until harvest, the land essentially belongs to them.\n\nIf a farmer doesnt stick to the rules, the company might refuse to buy their crop or leave them without a contract the next season, he says.\n\nA contract analyzed in a 2023 study in Oikos, a journal published by Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University, shows just how tobacco contracts lock small-scale farmers into risky debt. The 2019-20 Tian Ze contract required farmers to repay loans before seeing any profit, even requiring some to put their property on the line as collateral.\n\nThese arrangements undermine Zimbabwes land reforms, says George Seremwe, the president of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Growers Association. The reforms were meant to redress colonial imbalances, but contract farming introduces new vulnerabilities for small-scale farmers as they cede control of their land to contracting companies.\n\nBut Nelson Marongwe, an independent land expert who has researched tobacco farming and land rights, doesnt think so. The contracts are valid, he says, and address a production gap.\n\nBut it needs to be for a limited period, he says, as there is a risk of farmers losing autonomy and companies abusing their bargaining power.\n\nTobacco farmer Peter Neshumba waits for payment after selling his crop to Premium Leaf Zimbabwe in Harare. He says contract farming controls nearly every aspect of production, leaving farmers with little say over their land until harvest. Photo credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThe tobacco board is trying to make these arrangements fairer to farmers, Matsvaire says. The government is implementing a framework to ensure farmers receive a fair share of profits, receive inputs in time and arent burdened with overpriced or substandard inputs. The framework will also set a minimum input package for farmers.\n\nMatsvaire adds that this farming season, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has mandated that tobacco farmers retain 70% of their earnings, in US dollars to protect them from exchange-rate losses.\n\nBut Ngoma says other issues, like land control and alternative financing methods, still need to be addressed.\n\nOne solution, Marongwe, the land expert, says, is to secure rural land rights for all farmers, which would expand access to other financing options.\n\nSeremwe says farmers need fairer terms, but the solution is not to abandon contract farming, since the country needs the foreign investment.\n\nDespite the challenges, Neshumba plans to keep contract farming. He doesnt have financing alternatives. When he started, he hoped for better returns. Now that Im in it, he says, I feel used.\n\nFor farmers like Ngoma, the goal is self-financing.\n\nContract farming, he says, is a bondage.\n\nLinda Mujuruis a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.

But both this claim  and that the war was provoked  have been repeatedly rebuffed by Western allies.\n\nIt was in 2014 that Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Years later, in February 2022,Putin then ordered Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPutins latest comments come days after Russia launched itssecond biggest aerial attackon Ukraine in the war.\n\nOn Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron said that Putin faced a Monday deadline set by Trump to agree to peace talks with Zelensky.\n\nIf the Russian leader does not agree, it will show again President Putin has played President Trump, said Macron.\n\nBut in an interview with CNN, on 22 August, Trump himself again gave Putin a couple of weeks to give a response before the US takes action, in the latest of a series of ultimatums and deadlines he has issued to the Russian leader.\n\nTrump had previously said he could solve the Ukraine war in one day.\n\nFollowing his meeting with Putin last month, Trump dropped a demand for a ceasefire and called instead for a permanent peace deal.\n\nHe also met Zelensky along with top European leaders who paid an urgent visit to Washington DC.\n\nTrump insisted there would be no going into Nato by Ukraine as part of a peace deal.\n\nBut he also hinted there would be security guarantees, saying Europe was the first line of defence and that the US would be involved.\n\nWell give them good protection, he said, though he clarified it would not mean sending US troops to Ukraine.\n\nUS Special Envoy Witkoff also told CNN thatPutin had agreed to security guarantees.\n\nHe said this would see the US and Europe effectively offer Article 5-like language to cover a security guarantee, referring to the Nato clause which states that member states should defend another member that has come under attack.\n\nZelensky has said he expected a framework for security guarantees to be set out on paper as soon as this week.\n\nBut last Friday, Russia criticised Western proposals as one-sided and clearly designed to contain Russia, adding that it turned Kyiv into a strategic provocateur.\n\nRussian attacks on Ukraine have continued. Last Thursday, Moscow fired 629 drones and missiles at Kyiv, killing 23 people in one of the biggest aerial assaults of the war so far, prompting outrage from European leaders.\n\nGermany and France have since pledged to put pressure on Russia to agree to a deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Zelensky hasrejected proposals for a buffer zonewith Russia as part of a peace deal.\n\nHe has accused Russia of not being ready for diplomacy and seeking ways to postpone the end of the war.\n\n",
