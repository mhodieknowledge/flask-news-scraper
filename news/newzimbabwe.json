            "content": "The Citizen\n\nThe Young Nurses Indaba Trade Union (YNITU) hasexpressedits supportfora nurse who appeared in a controversial viral videorecordedby a Zimbabwean patient at Halfway House Clinic in Midrand on Thursday, 16 January.\n\nAccording to YNITUs media statement released on Friday, the widely shared video was carefully cropped to show only a portion of an hour-long confrontation.\n\nThe union emphasised that despite the heated exchange, the patients constitutional right to healthcare services was not denied.\n\nThe Nurses in South Africa through their vigorous training understands that section 27 of the Constitution provides that everyone has the right to have access to health care services, the unions statement read.\n\nAccording to the statement, the nurse reacted the way she did because she was provoked by the patient.\n\nShe reported this incident to her superior with no assistance and had no choice but to stand firm and defend herself.\n\nWatch the video below:\n\nAccording to YNITUs statement, the incident unfolded around 1 PM when the nurse, who had just completed her morning patient roster, was called back from lunch by her line manager to attend to additional patients.\n\nAmong them was a reportedly impatient individual demanding priority treatment.\n\nThe situation escalated when the Zimbabwean patient, described as a regular clinic user with a history of targeting the same nurse, entered the consulting room while filming.\n\nWitness statements gathered by the union said the patient demanded immediate attention and a referral to see a doctor at another facility, disrupting an ongoing consultation.\n\nYNITU said its investigation revealed that the confrontation turned physical, with the patient allegedly preventing the nurse from leaving the room to seek assistance.\n\nHowever, the viral video begins only after the nurse had managed to exit the room and was speaking with her line manager on the phone.\n\nWe understand and accept the presumption of innocence as the legal principle. However, in this instance, we are standing firmly behind the officer as a moral principle, YNITU secretary-general Lerato Mthunzi toldThe Citizen.\n\nMthunzi highlighted broader systemic issues, explaining: The South African health system is strained and the strain that the health system is experiencing is based on lack of human resources, material resources, and either a plethora of factors.\n\nIm highlighting the two because this is the main thing that causes the frustration of the community we serve and all the frustrations that are experienced by the community using public facilities.\n\nShe further pointed out that nurses, as frontline workers, often bear the brunt of public frustration.\n\nThe first line of attendance or the people in the front line are always nurses. Anger and those outbursts are projected on them. Incorrectly so, because all this frustration of lack of resources, you know, bad infrastructure and lack of material resources. Its the responsibility of the Department of Health that is not able to provide so that the healthcare system has got steady and sound processes and systems.\n\nDiscussing the impact on healthcare quality, Mthunzi noted that nurses often have to deal with a lot of patients with limited resources and capacity.\n\nWhen ratios are supposed to be maybe one is to 13 a day, a nurse would see more than 100 patients a day. And that compromises the quality of care that is given to them, to the patients.\n\nAnd I mean, then the treatment that is giving is that of substandard because its more on quantity rather than quality.\n\nAccording to the YNITU SG, the nurse has since pressed charges against the patient for assault.\n\nMthunzi also revealed that the patient also faces additional charges filed by another patient who was forced out of the consulting room during the incident.\n\nShe explained that demanding specific care and priority treatment is a common challenge: The issue of patients demanding that their care rendered to them is done the way they want, demanding referrals and wanting to be prioritised is a daily occurrence.\n\nLooking at solutions, Mthunzi concluded: Yes, I think on paper, we are a country that is very good at writing policies and systems, but implementation is the problem. Look, putting policies to prevent similar occurrences, that is, is there and it can still be proved or can be done.\n\nThe issue here is that our clinics need security. We need Management that is present, that is responsive when help is required.\n\nThe union emphasised that the incident highlights the need for a zero-tolerance policy against threats and assaults on healthcare workers, while also calling for improved security measures and management support in healthcare facilities.\n\n",

Human waste carrying disease agents have apparently been contaminating freshwater sources in Glendale and beyond.\n\nOn December 26, 2024, 10 members of one family in Glendale had to be rushed to the Tsungubvi Cholera Treatment Centre after they showed symptoms of the waterborne disease.\n\nThe Nyirongo family had been relying for years on their shallow well as their main source of water, but sewage had lately been seeping into the underground water supply as rains persisted across the country.\n\nIt rained heavily for two consecutive days on December 24 and 25 () leading to the contamination of our well with sewage, even before that, possibly, 71-year-old Erecta Nyirongo told media.\n\nWe hope they will supply us with clean water going forward to avoid these diseases.\n\nThroughout Zimbabwe  including the capital Harare, there are no reliable water sources at the moment, as raw sewage has been flowing into water sources amid the overall state of disrepair of the water system.\n\nSleiman Timios Kwidini, Zimbabwes deputy minister of health and child care, recently visited the Mazowe district to assess the extent of the cholera outbreak after one life was claimed there by the illness.\n\nKwidini says that the government has partnered with other organisations to drill two boreholes in Glendale.\n\nKwidini believes that some local wells can remain in use as the government is planning to provide tablets which are going to assist killing the bacteria, which is found in water.\n\nAlso, we are encouraging our community to boil water, even if its coming from a clean or protected water source () so that we reduce chances of getting cholera.\n\nThe deputy minister further highlighted that after inspecting toilets in communal ablution blocks, she found that the facilities are not properly sited.\n\nSo we have agreed that we are going to site them where it is proper, so that they do not mixwhere they get water and the toilets.\n\nIt is unclear, however, how long it might take to roll out these improvement plans.\n\nHygiene practices\n\nKudzai Masunda, a public health specialist at the private voluntary health organisation JF Kapnek Zimbabwe, is also calling for an improvement of hygienic practices in households and at the community level as part of overall efforts to contain cholera.\n\nCholera is mainly a waterborne disease and also afeco-orally communicable disease,meaning people get infected from what they consume. Thus, hygienic practices are important, said Masunda, who also serves as the secretary general of the Zimbabwe College of Public Health Physicians think tank.\n\nIf we want to eliminate cholera, we need to improve on water and sanitation within our suburbs and rural areas since the previous cholera outbreaks have also happened in the rural areas, he added.\n\nOne of the short-term measures that have already taken place to eliminate cholera is theuse of vaccinesto ensure we reduce incidences of cholera for at least three to four years while we embark on water and sanitation improvements that need to be done.\n\nMasunda added that thewhole of Africa has been hit bythe disease, with cholera cases reported in Burundi, Cameroon, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique,Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, according to theWorld Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nZimbabwes last cholera outbreak according to the WHO was in 2023, with all the countrys 10 provinces reporting instances affecting a total of 62 districts.\n\nDuring that outbreak, the country recorded 34,549 suspected cases, 4,217 confirmed cases and 33,831 recoveries.\n\nThe countrys worst recorded cholera epidemic was in 2008 and 2009, which resultedin nearly 100,000 confirmed cases and 4,288 deaths, according to theWHO.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.comhas invited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal)to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, we want to continue with our discussion from last week on Immigration Law, our readers were asking for further understanding on foreign Visa applications specifically as they relate to reasons for denials and the appeal processes in various countries\n\nLet me start by asking what are the common reasons for visa being denied?\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nWe touched on the issue briefly in my last interview with you.\n\nEach country has its own benchmark that has to be satisfied with visa applications. Further to the general benchmark set by the country of interest, each visa type, for example, visitors, working or asylum visa, has specific conditions that have to be met and the requirements are likely to be different from other visa types within the same country. It is essential that the applicant is able to discern the must-haves in the application and ensures that all the requirements of the must haves are included with supporting evidence or thoroughly explained.\n\nIn general terms, visa applications are denied because applicants have failed to satisfy the immigration officer reviewing the application that they qualify for the visa under the application. This could be as a result of failing to supply sufficient supporting information for the type of visa or where the country receiving the application utilizes a score point approach, a failure to score enough points for the visa. Incorrect or false information may also disqualify a person from securing a visa.\n\nPast activities like a criminal record or history of overstaying in the host country may hinder or reduce the chances of securing a visa as this portrays an applicant as an undesirable person.\n\nRELATED:Legal Discussions With Vengai Madzima: Foreign Visa Applications\n\nReporter: Can a person be denied a visa or entry into a country because of HIV status?\n\nVM: Each country will have its own requirements on the different visa categories on who can enter the country and can list the reasons and requirements for qualification.\n\nGenerally, international human rights laws discourage discrimination on the basis of HIV status. Countries that are signatories of human rights protocols are under obligation to treat all applicants equally and without discrimination. Should an applicant feel aggrieved by a decision based on their status, subject to the laws that land, I would encourage them to seek a review of that decision.\n\nReporter:In what circumstances should a person consider reapplying for a visa instead of appealing?\n\nVM: After having read and understood the reason for the visa denial and seeing that it will be impossible to gather sufficient information to satisfy the immigration officer in the period afforded to submit an appeal by the particular country, the applicant can opt to reapply as it affords them sufficient time to gather evidence and deal with the areas where the previous application fell short.\n\nThis also applies in situations where the initial application had insufficient supporting evidence. A reapplication affords the applicant the opportunity to submit an improved application with better chances of success. Reapplication however does not necessarily guarantee success, it improves the chances. Most countries have sections within their application forms which allow you to explain why the previous visa was declined.\n\nIn circumstances where a person was banned from reapplication, an appeal process may be the only option available where the country offers appeals against bans.\n\nReporter: In what circumstances will an appeal be the best option to take?\n\nVM: In cases where the applicant has been banned and the country offers an option to appeal the decision. In such a case, the appeal process will be the best option to address the banning where the applicant considers the decision to be unjustified.\n\nFurther, where the Applicant understands or fully comprehends the reasons the visa application was declined and is capable of getting the supporting information within the period afforded to submit an appeal, then an appeal may be the best route. It is important that the Applicant avoids mistakes in the appeal process and addresses all areas of concern,\n\nReporter: Can I appeal again if my visa application was refused on appeal?\n\nVM: Generally, most countries allow for one appeal. However, rules differ per country under application. Unless the visa denial also bans reapplication, the applicant has the option of reapplying and addressing in the fresh application all issues they neglected to address in the initial application and the appeal\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima atvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

The defendant shall pay the costs of suit, the judge ruled.\n\nMarian had acknowledged that the plaintiff had represented her diligently and that she had benefited from the legal services provided.\n\nShe, however, insisted that the fee claimed was unreasonable and suggested a reduced amount of US$50,000 as fair compensation.\n\nThe defendant testified that she made efforts to settle the debt by offering stands received from the divorce settlement.\n\nHowever, when the plaintiff attempted to verify the existence and value of the stands, it was discovered that the stand numbers provided did not correspond to any existing stands.\n\n",

The local government system structures have not been performing up to standards, said Akili.\n\nResidents in Harare have been made to bear the brunt of maladministration and corruption of the City fathers enduring days with access to clean water.\n\nHeaps of uncollected garbage in residential areas which have become a common sight are a stern reminder of how the local authority has been failing to carry out its mandate.\n\nAkili said reforms in the laws that govern the local authorities will transform the cities.\n\nWe have been calling for local government reform for more than 3 decades as CHRA but again it has been facing resistance from those who are supposed then to ensure that there is good local governance and we end up setting up structures such as Commission of Inquiry.\n\nThere is a need to reform our local government system. Our local government system promotes corruption and does not promote the participation of citizens. Our local government system does not promote transparency and accountability in its format at the moment.\n\n",
