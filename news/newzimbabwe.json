            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe ZWG annual inflation rate has tumbled to 32.7%, marking a significant step toward stability, the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZimStat) reported this week.\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) had earlier projected a slowdown in annual inflation for October 2025, citing the consistent containment of month-on-month inflation within an average of 1.6% since the price shocks of September 2024.\n\nAccording to ZimStat, annual inflation fell sharply from 82.7% in September 2025 to 32.7% in October 2025, representing nearly a 50% decline over the period.\n\nThis means that prices, as measured by the all-items USD Consumer Price Index (CPI), increased by an average of 13.0% from October 2024 to October 2025. The year-on-year inflation rate is derived from the percentage change in the index of the current years reference month compared with the same month of the previous year, said ZimStat.\n\nDuring the same period, the ZWG month-on-month inflation rate stood at 0.4%, slightly lower than the 0.2% recorded in September 2025, indicating a modest decline in average prices.\n\nThis means that prices, as measured by the all-items ZWG CPI, decreased by an average rate of 0.4% from September 2025 to October 2025, the agency added.\n\nThe ZWG month-on-month Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages inflation rate rose to 0.7% in October 2025, up 0.5 percentage points from 0.2% in September 2025. In contrast, the non-food inflation rate stood at 0.9%, compared to 0.5% the previous month.\n\nOn the USD front, the month-on-month inflation rate for October 2025 was 0.3%, up from 0.0% in September.\n\nThe USD year-on-year inflation rate (annual percentage change) for October 2025, as measured by the all-items USD CPI, was 13%, further underscoring a trend toward stabilising prices in both the local and foreign currency economies.\n\n",

Zimbabweans do not panic, we are going to announce the next course of action after this, said Sikhala.\n\nThe recently adopted resolution by the ruling party at its just-ended conference in Mutare, to set legal wheels in motion for President Mnangagwa to stay beyond 2028, has ignited political tensions.\n\nWithin ZANU-PF, a clique backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga is opposing the move to amend the constitution, rooting for the former army general to succeed Mnangagwa.\n\nWorld Council of Churches (WCC) programmes director, Kenneth Mtata, said the move to extend Mnangagwas term will have ripple effects on the countrys position in the global community.\n\nThe proposal to extend the presidential term will hurt Zimbabwe at many levels. Here are five main reasons\n\nFirst, it will undermine all the hard work of international re-engagement pursued since 2017. It will signal to global partners that Zimbabwe cannot be trusted to honour its own constitutional and democratic commitments.\n\nSecond, it will jeopardise the ongoing debt restructuring efforts. Third, this extension will discourage investment. Recently, Forbes magazine is said to have identified Zimbabwe as one of the most attractive tourist destinations. Investors would be wary of systems that change rules to suit political convenience. Policy inconsistency and instability will scare away the very capital needed for national economic recovery.\n\nFourth, the term extension will shatter the fragile social trust that had begun to form after years of political violence. Coercive force and intimidation would likely return to our national life in order to enforce such an unpopular measure. This will reopen old wounds and further divide communities once again.\n\nFifth, this decision will remove any chances of the President leaving a positive legacy. He will be classified with all those leaders remembered for clinging to power, rather than those honoured for serving with integrity and stepping aside with dignity, said Mtata.\n\n",

During that time, they contracted occupational diseases such as tuberculosis and silicosis.\n\nThe MoU enables the Tshiamiso Trust to facilitate compensation for former Wenela workers who were employed in the neighbouring country between March 12 1965, and December 10 2019.\n\nTshiamiso Trust Chief Executive Officer, Munyadziwa Kwinda, said the agreement is a turning point for the majority of the former mineworkers and their dependants who have had to endure a long wait.\n\nWe are honoured to mark this moment in partnership with the Government of Zimbabwe and NSSA. Thousands of Zimbabwean ex-mineworkers have been waiting for Tshiamiso Trust services to commence so that they can access compensation that they may qualify for.\n\nTodays agreement means they can now lodge their claims and complete the medical assessments required to determine their eligibility for compensation. This is about restoring dignity and delivering on the promise made to the men and families who built the mining industry, said Kwinda.\n\nProspective claimants, however, must meet certain criteria, including providing proof that they suffered from a work-related illness.\n\nDependants of the deceased can claim after providing proof of relationship and a death certificate indicating the cause of death.\n\nThe National Social Security Authority (NSSA), which partnered with Tshiamiso on behalf of the government, said the compensation will bring relief to the former mineworkers and their dependants.\n\nZimbabwe is home to many who spent their working lives in South Africas mines and returned home with illnesses that changed their futures. Through this collaboration, we are ensuring that those who qualify can now access the compensation due to them, closer to where they live.\n\nNSSA remains committed to working with regional partners like Tshiamiso Trust to expand social security and strengthen cross-border protection for our workers, said NSSA Chief Executive Officer Charles Shava.\n\nThe Tshiamiso Trust has already paid R2.4 billion to 25,000 beneficiaries in Lesotho, South Africa, Mozambique, Eswatini, and Botswana.\n\n",

This marks a 511% increase from 2019 levels, a remarkable turnaround in just six years.\n\nThe expansion aligns with Zimbabwes broader strategy to reduce dependence on imports, especially following the global grain price spikes triggered by theRussiaUkraineconflict.\n\nWheatis the countrys second most important cereal after maize, and domestic self-sufficiency is seen as critical to stabilising food prices and strengthening food security.\n\nFocus on export opportunities and market stability\n\nWith domestic needs fully met, Zimbabwe is now seeking export opportunities within the region, particularly in neighboring countries that continue to face wheat shortages.\n\nHowever, Masuka emphasized that local supply remains secure and that the government has taken measures to stabilise pricing and ensure smooth distribution.\n\nThe government has released 6,518 metric tonnes to millers in recent weeks to stabilise supply and pricing levels of wheat products, he said, noting that the Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) continues to coordinate marketing and distribution to maintain market balance.\n\nDespite the surplus, Zimbabwe will continue importing limited volumes of high-gluten wheat, which is preferred by some millers for specific bread formulations.\n\nCertain millers have indicated that their mills and bread styles require high gluten content wheat not achievable in locally produced wheat, Masuka explained.\n\nAccording to him, as per current policy, such wheat will continue to be imported under existing arrangements, without any additional costs.\n\nThe government is urging registered millers and industry players to collaborate closely with authorities under the AMA framework to ensure a consistent balance between production, demand, and market stability.\n\nZimbabwes wheat success story reflects years of deliberate investment in irrigation infrastructure, farmer training, and private-sector partnerships.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), sub-SaharanAfricastill imports over 80% of its wheat consumption, underscoring Zimbabwes rare achievement in the region.\n\n",

When he defaulted, Mashamhanda sued and obtained a default judgment in May 2024 after Fabris and his lawyer ignored several letters and court notices.\n\nThe businessman argued that his former lawyer, Alex Mambosasa, failed to file a plea because he was in South Africa and had left the parties to negotiate an out-of-court settlement. But the court found that documents had been both emailed and hand-delivered to the lawyers office, which confirmed receipt, making the excuse untenable.\n\nNo reason is given to suggest he was not in wilful default, said Justice Manzunzu. With the advent of the IECMS system, absence from the country can no longer be an excuse for failure to file a plea. Technology allows a lawyer in South Africa to file court documents from that location.\n\nThe judge emphasised that there was a limit to how far courts could sympathise with litigants blaming their lawyers negligence.\n\nTime has come when our courts should be slow in sympathising with litigants who fail to comply with the rules due to lack of diligence by their legal representatives, he ruled. Applicant made his choice of a legal representative and he must stand by his choice.\n\nJustice Manzunzu also questioned Fabriss claim that he had a solid defence, noting that his earlier correspondence with Mashamhanda contained admissions of liability and proposals to settle the debt through shares in his mining company, Hotburn Minerals (Pvt) Ltd.\n\nThis is incongruent with a party who denies liability, the judge said. The applicants conduct shows wilfulness and absence of prospects of success.\n\nFinding the rescission application to be a mere delaying tactic, the judge ordered Fabris to pay costs on a higher scale, citing the respondents unnecessary expenses caused by Fabriss negligence.\n\nThe respondent has been put out of pocket by the applicants conduct, he said. The circumstances of this case warrant the granting of costs on a higher scale.\n\nThe ruling means the default judgment stands, and Mashamhanda may proceed with execution to recover the US$500,000 loan plus interest and legal costs from Fabris.\n\n",

He can declare his candidacy. There is no provision in the Zimbabwean constitution that the vice president is the automatic leader of the country afterwards. We go to elections, and people vote in Zimbabwe for the leadership. So he needs to be voted.\n\nThis is not a papacy. This is not cardinals in Rome, sitting in a cabal, deciding that this is going to be the person succeeding the pope. This is a democratic country, and people go to elections. If he wants, he can declare his candidacy for elections in the party or outside the party and do the test of the vote. This effort of someone being anointed for whatever reason, it is totally against the tenets of democratic governance, Mutsvangwa told SABC News.\n\nMutsvangwa said Chiwenga is not the only politician aspiring for higher office in Zimbabwe.\n\nWhy this particular preoccupation with this particular person, except that there are some people who feel that he should be anointed as the leader of Zimbabwe. This is not a papacy. This is a democratic, constitutionally-run country, Mutsvangwa insisted.\n\nMnangagwa has previously said he is a constitutionalist and would step down in 2028.\n\nThe resolution has drawn a mixed response. Opposition activists and civil society figures have warned the move risks entrenching authoritarian tendencies. Some analysts say the extension could be framed domestically as necessary for continuity while simultaneously raising concerns among donors and regional partners about democratic backsliding.\n\nZimbabweans in the diaspora  including those living in South Africa  have also voiced unease. In interviews with IOL, some critics argued the extension reveals ZanuPFs reluctance to allow a generational leadership change, while supporters countered that stability and economic recovery require continuity at the top.\n\nLast week,former Zanu PF bigwig and cabinet minister Saviour Kasukuwererubbished the former liberation movements bold plans to extend Mnangagwas term of office to 2030, warning that the move will end badly for both the president and Zimbabwe.\n\nSpeaking to IOL, Kasukuwere said:He (Mnangagwa) is dreaming and he has set himself up for a gigantic failure. Greediness knows no boundaries, and this will lead to a huge disaster for the country.\n\nZanu PF has emboldened its move to push through the proposal allowing Mnangagwa to remain in powerbeyond his current constitutional term, which ends in 2028. The party recently adopted a resolution at its annual conference backing the extension to align with the governments so-called Vision 2030 development agenda.\n\nKasukuwere, once a senior figure in the Zanu PF government led by Robert Mugabe before going into exile during the 2017 military intervention, became one of the most prominent former insiders to condemn the partys Mnangagwa plan publicly.\n\nThe political debate in South Africa is further complicated by rising antiimmigrant sentiment and calls by some local groups for Zimbabwean migrants to return home. Observers warn that prolonged political uncertainty in Harare could exacerbate tensions in host communities across the region.\n\nIf ZanuPF moves ahead, the party would refer the resolution to parliament  where, with its twothirds majority, it could initiate the constitutional amendment process. That would likely trigger legal and political challenges from opposition parties and civil society, and could prompt increased scrutiny from regional bodies such as SADC and the AU.\n\nWhether Mnangagwas extension will be presented as a caretaker continuity measure or a hard political move to shape succession remains the central political question for the months ahead.\n\n",

            "content": "Cape Argus\n\nA Zimbabwean national has been arrested, admitting he has been selling illegal medicine to the public which he has been hiding under his bed in Khayelitsha.\n\nThe polices Operation Shanela II received information from intelligence teams of suspected illegal activity taking place at a premises in Ilitha Park.\n\nOnce inside the house, police found quantities of illegal medicine hidden inside a bedroom.\n\nPolice spokesperson,Constable Ndakhe Gwala explained: On Wednesday, October 29, members of Operation Shanela II received intelligence of suspected illegal activity taking place at an address in Ilitha Park, Khayelitsha.\n\nThe members found a 42-year-old Zimbabwean male in the house. And during the search, they found large quantities of medicine hidden under the bed.\n\nThe suspect admitted that he sells the medicine to his fellow countrymen. He was then arrested for Contravention of Medicine and related substances Act 101 of 1995.\n\nThe suspect is detained at Harare SAPS, and once charged, he will appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrates court.\n\nThe arrest comes just as the, South Africa launched its National Action Plan (NAP)to address the persistent threat of substandard and falsified medical products, marking a significant step toward safeguarding public health, protecting peoples health across South Africa and beyond, and strengthening regulatory collaboration.\n\nIt was unveiled by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) in partnership with the National Department of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO), the NAP addresses a crisis that continues to harm and claim countless lives.\n\nAccording to WHO data, at least one in ten medical products in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including South Africa, is substandard or falsified. This leads to severe health complications, treatment failures and thousands of preventable deaths annually.\n\nWHO said economically, rogue products cost global health systems an estimated US$ 30.5 billion each year and further deepen the financial burdens on South African households, already strained by rising healthcare costs and limited access to quality care.\n\nIn South Africa, where falsified and substandard medicines often masquerade as essential treatments for HIV, tuberculosis and chronic conditions, the NAPs three pillar strategy, grounded in prevention at borders, rapid detection in supply chains, and decisive response through enforcement, aims to protect vulnerable populations from this silent threat, WHO said via a statement issued.\n\nDr Boitumelo Semete-Makokotlela, CEO of SAHPRA added: Through unwavering collaboration, weve transformed a fragmented challenge into a unified front, ensuring that every family, from rural clinics to urban pharmacies, can access medicines they can trust. The NAP will not only detect and destroy fake products but empower communities to report threats, turning passive victims into active guardians of health.\n\nMinister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said in his keynote address on the issue: Fake medicines dont discriminate! They strike the poorest the hardest, stealing futures from our children and hope from our elders.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe normal soundtrack that accompanies Jamaican life is silent this morning as many have woken to no electricity.\n\nAbout three-quarters of the island is without power and many parts of its western side are under water, with homes destroyed by strong winds after Hurricane Melissa tore across the island with catastrophic force.\n\nAs wind and rain lashed through the night, one local official said the destruction resembled the scene of an apocalypse movie.\n\nWith communications crippled, the true scale of the disaster remains unknown. Prime Minister Andrew Holness declared the island a disaster area late Tuesday, warning of devastating impacts and significant damage to hospitals, homes and businesses.\n\nAlthough no deaths have yet been confirmed, Montego Bays mayor Richard Vernon told the BBC his first task at daybreak would be to check if everybody is alive.\n\nGetty Images Trees had already been uprooted in St. Catherine before the hurricane made landfall\n\nHurricane Melissa, the strongest storm to strike Jamaica in modern history, barrelled across the country on Tuesday, leaving behind a trail of ruin.\n\nAt its peak, the hurricane sustained winds of 298 km/h (185 mph)  stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005 and killed 1,392 people.\n\nIt resembled the scene of an apocalypse movie, an MP in western Jamaica told Kingston-based journalist Kimone Francis of The Jamaica Gleaner.\n\nFrancis described the night as stressful and intense, marked by relentless heavy wind and rain.\n\nYou dont have a connection. You cant speak to the people you normally speak to, she told the BBC World Services Newsday programme.\n\nAcross Jamaicas central parishes, Francis said, floodwaters rose to the roofs of two-storey homes.\n\nOne anonymous woman told the BBC: There is water coming in through the roof of my house. I am not okay.\n\nWhile no fatalities had been confirmed, Jamaicas prime minister told CNN he feared there would be some loss of life. Damage, he said, was widespread  hitting hospitals, schools, homes and businesses.\n\nLocal government minister Desmond Mckenzie said on Tuesday afternoon that the southwestern parish of St Elizabeth was under water, with at least three families trapped in their homes in the community of Black River.\n\nRescue teams are struggling to reach them because of the dangerous conditions, he said at a news conference.\n\nVerna Genus was sheltering from the storm at her four bedroom home in the village of Carlisle, St Elizabeth, when the hurricane ripped the zinc roof off her house.\n\nThe 73-year-old vegetable farmer was in the house with her sons and baby grandchild when the hurricane made landfall over the area.\n\nVerna has lost communications due to the power lines being down. But her UK-based sister, June Powell, spoke to the BBC about what happened.\n\nShe was crying on the phone, June said, adding: You are huddled up inside and then you look up then the roof is gone. I have never heard her like that  she was wailing we are all finished.'\n\nShe is anxiously waiting for the communications networks to be restored so she can talk to her sister.\n\nSt Elizabeth, known as Jamaicas breadbasket, produces much of the islands produce. With crops submerged and fields destroyed, many farmers will struggle to financially recover.\n\nOn the north coast, Montego Bay  the heart of Jamaicas tourism industry and home to its main airport  will also take time to get back on its feet. This hurricane has put a hand around the neck of the Jamaican economy.\n\nMontego city was split in two by floodwaters, Mayor Vernon said. He told BBC Breakfast: Once the wind subsided, we started to get a lot of heavy rain and that has led to massive floods right across the city. One side of the city is now cut off from the other due to roads being inundated by flood water.\n\nHis immediate concern, he added, was simple: Check if everybody is alive.\n\nIn rural Jamaica, the storm has left people shaken. Tamisha Lee, president of the Jamaica Network of Rural Women Producers, said: Right now, what Im seeing is heavy rain, powerful wind, a lot of things flying all over the place, and trees uprooted. There is no electricity. I am feeling anxious and tense. The damage will be enormous.\n\nMeteorologists said Hurricane Melissa intensified at a speed rarely seen, its rapid strengthening fuelled by abnormally warm Caribbean waters  part of a broader trend linked to climate change.\n\nBy the time it struck Jamaica, the storm had reached Category 5 strength, with gusts fierce enough to tear roofs from concrete homes, uproot trees and snap power poles.\n\nHealth officials even issued a crocodile warning, cautioning that floodwaters could drive the reptiles into residential areas.\n\nFor thousands of tourists caught on the island, the storm brought terror and uncertainty.\n\nIve never heard anything like it, said Pia Chevallier from Cambridge, who travelled to Jamaica with her 15-year-old son on Saturday.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live from her darkened hotel room, she said: The glass in the windows and patio doors was all vibrating. The doors sounded like they were slamming, even though they were closed. It was horrendous.\n\nShe added: Theres debris everywhere  palm trees, coconuts, branches, all over the place. The big palm trees with all the roots are up. Thats how strong the winds have been.\n\nOn the north coast, Wayne Gibson, a British tourist from Kent holidaying in Ocho Rios with his wife and two teenage daughters, told BBC Radio 4s Today programme that they were sheltering in a communal hall.\n\nKyle Holmes from Bolton, visiting Lucea in the north west, described the hotel as a disaster zone and said he had no idea when they will be able to get home.\n\nHurricane Melissa had moved on to make landfall in Cuba by early Wednesday morning, leaving Jamaica paralysed and silent. Though it has since weakened to a Category 3 hurricane, it remains powerful with wind speeds of over 200km/h (124mph).\n\nJamaica has a catastrophe bond  a type of insurance for the country  which will hopefully allow people to get back on their feet, but the issue is whats done in the interim.\n\n",
