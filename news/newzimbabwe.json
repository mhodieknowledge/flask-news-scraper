            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nZimplow Holdings Limited has significantly reduced its losses in the first half of 2025, reporting a deficit of US$499,500,a 70% improvement from the US$1.66 million loss recorded during the same period last year.\n\nThe turnaround follows the companys aggressive cost-cutting measures, which included staff reductionsand streamlined administrative expenses. Zimplow also disposed of outdated equipment to free up capital for reinvestment. Proceeds from the sale of its Dagenham Road property have been channelled toward the establishment of a new mining and logistics hub in Msasa.\n\nThe groups strategic shift toward the mining sector is part of efforts to cushion itself from the volatility of the agriculture industry. However, a poor weather outlook,with forecasts predicting below-average rainfall,is expected to weigh heavily on its agriculture-focused subsidiaries, Farmec and Mealie Brand, which depend on rain-fed farming. This could dampen sales and create financial pressure, compounded by potential inventory build-ups from trade loans that may increase storage costs and force price cuts.\n\nDespite these headwinds, Zimplows mining-related operations remain robust. Subsidiaries such as Scanlink and Tractive Power Solutions continue to perform well, buoyed by sustained demand for heavy equipment in Zimbabwes mining sector. Similarly, Powermec is benefiting from increased demand for solar-powered generators amid persistent power shortages caused by drought conditions.\n\nThe company is also exploring drought-adaptive innovations, including modular irrigation kits and scalable solar power solutions, to diversify its revenue streams.\n\nHowever, smuggling continues to undermine operations at Trentyre and CT Bolts, with the influx of grey market imports eroding revenues.\n\nZimplows diversification strategy, supported by cost discipline and its pivot toward mining and renewable energy solutions, positions the group for potential recovery in the second half of 2025,provided it successfully navigates the prevailing economic and regulatory challenges.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nIndirect talks aimed at reaching a final agreement on a US peace plan to end the war in Gaza are set to continue on Tuesday in the Egyptian city of Sharm El-Sheikh.\n\nPalestinian and Egyptian officials have told the BBC that the sessions are focused on creating the field conditions for a possible exchange that would see the release of all Israeli hostages in return for a number of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nIsraels prime minister said on Saturday that he hoped to announce the release of hostages in the coming days.\n\nAs the officials met on Monday, US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House: We have a really good chance of making a deal, and itll be a lasting deal.\n\nHamas has said it agrees to the peace plan proposals in part, but has not responded to several key demands  including its disarmament andnot having any future role in the governance of Gaza.\n\nA senior Israeli security source said the talks initially would focus only on the release of hostages and give Hamas a few days to complete that phase.\n\nThe second day of thetalks, which will see Egyptian and Qatari officials holding shuttle meetings with delegations from both Israel and Hamas separately, will be taking place on the second anniversary of the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response. Since then, 67,160 have been killed by Israeli military operations in Gaza, including 18,000 children, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nIn a statement commemorating the 7 October anniversary, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Trumps plan presents an opportunity that must be seized to bring this tragic conflict to an end.\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reiterated his support for the plan in his statement commemorating the anniversary, saying: We welcome the US initiative towards peace in the Middle East, and this government will do everything in our power to bring about the day where every child of Israel can live peacefully, alongside their Palestinian neighbours, in safety and security.\n\nThese discussions are expected to be among the most consequential since the start of the war and could determine whether a path toward ending the conflict is finally within reach.\n\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner and Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani are among those attending.\n\nTrump, writing on social media, has urged everyone involved in efforts to end the Gaza war to move fast and says he has been told the first phase of the peace plan  which includes the hostage release  should be completed this week.\n\nOn Monday, he told reporters at the White House that Hamas has been agreeing to things that are very important.\n\nI really think were going to have a deal, he added.\n\nA Palestinian official close to the negotiations told the Reuters news agency that the first session ended late Monday evening, and more talks were due to take place on Tuesday.\n\nState-affiliated Al-Qahera News also said talks would continue on Tuesday  and that the first day had ended amid a positive atmosphere.\n\nThe 20-point plan, which has been agreed upon by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, proposes an immediate end to fighting and the release of 48 hostages, only 20 of whom are thought to be alive, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans.\n\nThe plan stipulates that once both sides agree to the proposal full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip.\n\nIt also states that Hamas would have no role in governing Gaza, and it leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state.\n\nHowever, after the plan was announced publicly a week ago, Netanyahu reinstated his longstanding opposition to a Palestinian state, saying in a video statement: Its not written in the agreement. We said we would strongly oppose a Palestinian state.\n\nOn Friday,Hamas responded to the proposalin a statement, in which the groupagreed to release all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead, according to the exchange formula contained in Trumps proposal  if the proper conditions for the exchanges are met.\n\nIt did not specifically mention or accept Trumps 20-point plan but said it renews its agreement to hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats), based on Palestinian national consensus and Arab and Islamic support.\n\nThe statement made no mention of the demands that Hamas agree to its disarmament and to playing no further role in the governance of Gaza.\n\nIt added that the part of the proposals dealing with the future of Gaza and the rights of Palestinian people was still being discussed within a national framework, of which it said Hamas will be a part.\n\nMany Palestinians described Hamas response to the peace plan as unexpected, after days of indications that the group was preparing to reject or at least heavily condition its acceptance of Trumps peace plan proposal.\n\nInstead, Hamas refrained from including its traditional red lines in the official statement, a move many interpret as a sign of external pressure.\n\nEuropean and Middle Eastern leaders have welcomed the proposal. The Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has called the US presidents efforts sincere and determined.\n\nIran  which has been one of Hamass main sponsors for many years  has also now signalled its support for Trumps Gaza peace plan.\n\nIsraeli bombardment continued in several parts of the Gaza Strip on Monday ahead of the talks beginning.\n\nIsrael is carrying out an offensive in the city, which it has said is aimed at securing the release of the remaining hostages.\n\nMahmoud Basal, spokesman for Gazas Hamas-run civil defence, told the BBC that no aid trucks have been allowed into Gaza City since the offensive began four weeks ago.\n\nThere are still bodies we cannot retrieve from areas under Israeli control, he said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Gaza City residents have been forced to flee after the Israeli military ordered evacuations to a designated humanitarian area in the south, but hundreds of thousands more are believed to have remained.\n\nIsraels defence minister has warned that those who stay during the offensive would be terrorists and supporters of terror.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, 21 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and a further 96 injured, the Hamas-run health ministry said in its latest update.\n\nInternational journalists have been banned by Israel from entering the Gaza Strip independently since the start of the war, making verifying claims from both sides difficult.\n\n",

Most of the purveyors of this succession issue are known not to be members of Zanu PF; they are known not to be within the structures of Zanu PF.\n\nAs Zanu PF, we will not allow a conversation to be imported into the party. We are going to a conference to check on the mandate which we received from the people in 2023.\n\nAlthough party slogans declaring that Mnangagwa will be in power up until 2030 appear to have been silenced, at provincial, district or cell meetings, they continue being chanted, even in the presence of party bigwigs such as Kazembe Kazembe and Owen Ncube in the Midlands Province.\n\nRecent Politburo meetings have been nothing short of explosive, with Chiwenga standing up to Mnangagwa and bringing dossiers to nail his allies and fear abounds that their tussle could result in another coup.\n\nChiwenga, then Commander of Zimbabwes military, led the 2017 coup that installed Mnangagwa as state leader. Although his influence in the army might have been diluted by his decision to join politics, there is fear that he has a lot of sympathisers within its ranks.\n\nMnangagwa has most of Zimbabwes cash-rich individuals, all of whom would be ready to defend his stay to protect their interests.\n\nAdded Marapira: The relationship between the President and his two Vice Presidents is friendly.\n\nAll this talk of animosity, hatred and fighting is a narrow agenda by other parties hoping to bring alarm and despondency within our rank and file.\n\n",

The first and second respondents (Labenmon Investments and the director Daniel Mlalazi) and are hereby found to be in contempt of this courts provisional order issued under Case Number HCCC15/25.\n\nShe further directed that the respondents are hereby ordered to immediately stop all works at the Wih-Zim Construction Material Investments Cement Manufacturing plant in Magunje, Hurungwe until the matter under HCCC15/25 is finalised.\n\nThe first respondent was fined US$3,000 payable within one month, while Mlalazi was sentenced to 30 days imprisonment, wholly suspended on condition that the company complies with the court order.\n\nMuzofas ruling comes after villagers from Kapere and Chasara under Ward 11 in Hurungwe, represented by Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) lawyers Tinashe Chinopfukutwa and Kelvin Kabaya, challenged the setting up of the cement plant, saying it was encroaching on their grazing and farming land.\n\nAccording to the villagers, the Chinese firm Labenmon Investments, which is linked to Wih-Zim, arrived in July 2024 and began fencing off the land without consultation.\n\nThe villagers later learnt that Labenmon Investments was going to establish a cement manufacturing plant on the pegged area, and they were prohibited from accessing their grazing fields and farming land, ZLHR said in a statement.\n\nThe lawyers argued that the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) erred in law by issuing an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) certificate to Labenmon Investments without receiving or properly evaluating the companys EIA report  a violation of sections 100(1) and 100(2) of the Environmental Management Act.\n\nThe Director-General of EMA violated the principles of natural justice as espoused in section 136 by failing to consult the appellants who are affected by the proposed cement manufacturing plant and giving them an opportunity to be heard, the lawyers said.\n\nThey further contended that the Director-General of EMA failed to exercise his powers by not inviting the developers and affected villagers to a consultative meeting as required by law.\n\nAbout 23 families are reportedly affected by the project, which has sparked outrage in the rural community for displacing farmers and cutting off access to communal grazing land.\n\n",
