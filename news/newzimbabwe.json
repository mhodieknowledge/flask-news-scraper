Lungelo Ndhlovu/Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nAround Hwange, last years drought dried up the boreholes and waterholes, threatening wildlife in the park and depriving people in Mabale of drinking water.\n\nAnd although rainfall from December to February this year was normal or above, fallout from the last drought persists.\n\nDespite this years rains, we had to close one of our boreholes, Mudima said, explaining how water table levels were still very low.\n\nBecause there are too many people in my village and not enough boreholes, people walk 5 km to a neighbouring village with a solar borehole, she said, referring to a borehole pumped by solar power.\n\nFaced with these recurrent water crises, people in Hwange have started building rainwater tanks, helped by the Soft Foot Alliance, a community-based trust registered in Zimbabwe.\n\nConstance Ndaba, 75, who lives in Masikili Village 2, said the tank harvesting system saves her walking 2 km to the next village.\n\nFor a family of seven, drinking water from the rainwater tank lasts us up to three months. Im not sure when I last went to fetch water from a borehole.\n\nConstance Ndaba poses next to a giant rainwater harvesting jar at her home in Masikili Village 2. The jar helps her family cope with water shortages when nearby boreholes and rivers run dry. 7 May 2025. Lungelo Ndhlovu/Thomson Reuters Foundation\n\nRainwater is collected in giant jars made by moulding canvas and chicken wire around sand. A thin cement plaster fixes the form, then the inside is plastered. The jars are placed near house walls to collect run-off from the roof.\n\nTheir simplicity makes for an easy upkeep  a key benefit in remote communities.\n\nWe use chicken wire, plain wire, four bags of cement and 24 buckets of river sand which is locally available. To build the jar tank takes four days and it can collect up to five drums of water, which can last up to three months, said Austin Nkomo, one of the builders of jar tanks based in Hwange.\n\nMsungwe Sithole, a creative facilitator at the Soft Foot Alliance, said the project aimed to build resilience to drought and help people live sustainably in a depleted landscape.\n\nErratic rains are not the only reason for water scarcity, said Chipo Mpofu-Zuze, manager for the Environmental Management Agency in the Matabeleland North province.\n\nMpofu-Zuze said deforestation, crop-growing along streams, poor farming methods, alien species invading wetlands and the release of effluent into local waters were also responsible.\n\nSimba Guzha, regional project manager with Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) Zimbabwe, trains farmers to adapt to the increasingly hot and dry conditions.\n\nVSO is working with smallholders in the eastern provinces to improve productivity while safeguarding the environment  helping them stay safe from any shock drops in aid.\n\nMost of the farmers who have been trained on infiltration pits, earth dams, and rooftop water harvesting systems are now using these systems even without any foreign support, he said.\n\n",

This verse encapsulates the essence of pursuing a relationship with Jesus Christ, the ultimate source of hope and strength.The story of Zacchaeus in Luke 19:1-10 serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of our efforts to seek Christ. Zacchaeus, a tax collector, was determined to see Jesus, even climbing a sycamore tree to catch a glimpse of Him.Interestingly, despite his efforts, it was not Zacchaeus who found Jesus first; rather, Jesus saw him. This teaches us that even our smallest attempts to seek Christ matter.When Jesus called out to Zacchaeus, saying, Hurry and come down! For I must stay at your house today, He demonstrated that He is always ready to respond to our desires for connection. Jesus sees us before we see Him, and He invites us into a relationship that transforms our lives.Jesus invites us to try me and see if I dont find favour in you. This call to test His goodness is echoed in Malachi 3:10, where we are encouraged to bring our whole selves to Him.When we seek the face of Christ, we open ourselves to the possibility of His grace and favour, enabling us to confront our challenges with renewed strength.As we invite Christ into our lives, He establishes a permanent relationship with us. This relationship empowers us to conquer our difficulties and stand firm against the adversities we face.When we put our minds and faith in Christ, we are reminded that we are not alone. He walks with us, guiding and supporting us through every trial.The call to seek the word of the cross is a call to embrace a relationship with Jesus Christ. Like Zacchaeus, let us not be discouraged by our limitations but instead be encouraged by the knowledge that every effort we make to seek Him is met with His love and grace.As we draw closer to Him, we prepare ourselves to be called children of God when He returns.

We acknowledge that in the midst of our challenges, it is easy to lose sight of You, but we desire to seek Your face with all our hearts.Lord, just as Zacchaeus climbed the sycamore tree in his pursuit of You, grant us the courage to climb beyond our fears and doubts.

We trust that You are always looking out for us and that Your love is eager to embrace us.As we navigate the trials of life, may we find strength in Your Word and comfort in Your promises.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA PROMINENT white commercial farmer, Daniel Brink Bosman, is at the centre of controversy after allegedly piercing the skull of a 12-year-old boy with the front-end of a combine harvester, leading to the childs death in 2022.\n\nThe tragedy occurred at Dandreanum farm in Lions Den, on the outskirts of Chinhoyi, Mashonaland West, when the victim, Suarance Moffat, and two other minors were marvelling and cheering on the farmer as he steered the giant machine across his maize field.\n\nAccording to the now deceased boys parents, the farmer, for unknown reasons, drove the harvester towards the children and started chasing them, striking Suarance with a sharp object from the machine.\n\nThe late Suarance, far right in red T-shirt, with his aunt and siblings.\n\nThe bereaved family is convinced that at the time of the incident, Bosman connived with one of his drivers, Douglas Zhanewo to concoct circumstances surrounding the boys death.\n\nThe victims father, Tichaona Moffat, told NewZimbabwe.com that in 2022, after the tragedy, Bosman then proceeded to Murereka Police Station, where he made a false report stating that his tractor driver, Zhanewo, had run over the child.\n\nThe employee was subsequently arrested and appeared in court on a culpable homicide charge. This is despite our vehement denial that our boy had not been run over by a tractor, which weighs so much it could have flattened his body, said Moffat.\n\nInstead, we noticed that there was a deep cut on his head, which was corroborated by the postmortem results. So, this narrative that he had been run over was a blue lie to cover up for murder deliberately committed by Bosman, who chased the minors before killing my son, he added.\n\nMoffat painted a gory picture, as narrated by his other son who witnessed the tragedy, of Suarences body dangling from the fork on the combine harvester bleeding profusely until he died. Thereafter, Moffat further claimed, Bosman instructed a terrified Zhanewo to remove the body which they later dumped near his homestead.\n\nAt the purported scene of the accident, there was no sign of blood at all. This suggests the incident happened elsewhere and the body was dumped where it was found as a broader plot to conceal the murder. Despite raising all these facts, the police are reluctant to arrest Bosman and l strongly suspect money is exchanging hands, said Moffat.\n\nA postmortem conducted by Dr. Ivene Maponga on May 24, 2022, concluded that the boys death resulted from a deep laceration on the head, causing a perforation of the skull.\n\nAs a result, Zhanewo was discharged in 2024 following the conclusion of the State case under Number CHN/CD/1983/24, which established that the deceased had not been run over by a tractor.\n\nThe slain boys family says it has not known peace ever since the unfortunate 2022 incident, which claimed the life of their second-born child.\n\nIn a desperate bid to seek justice,Moffat recently opened a fresh case against Bosman.\n\nThe victims father Tichaona Moffat and mother\n\nAs is tradition, a memorial service should have been held for our murdered son but until now nothing has been done because our boy Suarances soul is not resting. We demand Bosmans immediate arrest so that he is prosecuted as an accused person, not as an informant, said Moffat.\n\nResultantly, police have since opened a murder case against Bosman under CR Number 45/04/25, as well as a case for filing a false report, CR Number 46/04/25.\n\nHowever, Bosman has not yet been arrested.\n\nZimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) Mashonaland West spokesperson, Inspector Ian Kohwera professed ignorance over the case.\n\nThe family, which suspects corruption which also involves National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) officials, has intensified pressure, through its lawyer Tungamirai Chamutsa of Chamutsa and Partners Legal Practitioners, to have Bosman arrested for murder.\n\nIn a letter to District Public Prosecutor, Herald Matura, officially received on May 15, 2025, the late Suarances father demanded justice to take its course.\n\nOn 11 April 2025 our client reported criminal allegations against the above accused person (Bosman), of murder of his child Suarance Moffat and making a false report as defined in the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act (Chapter 9:23).\n\nStatements were recorded at Murereka Police Station from our client and his son Junior Mephis Moffat (a juvenile) on the same day However, a docket of road traffic culpable homicide was opened wrote the lawyers.\n\nThe same Chinhoyi Traffic police arrested and investigated the wrong person on the same facts under CR28/05/22.\n\nThey arrested and charged Douglas Zhanewo with road traffic culpable homicide despite protestation from our client that his son, Suarance Moffat, was not killed by the tractor which was being driven by Douglas Zhanewo, further argued the lawyers.\n\nOur client reported a case of murder against the accused person, but Chinhoyi Traffic preferred a charge of culpable homicide arising out of a road accident.\n\nFurther, they distilled the original report of the eyewitness Junior Mephis Moffat. Kindly compare the typed statement of the witness dated 9/04/25 and the handwritten statement recorded at Murereka Police Station on 11 April 2025. Key names of participants and vital materials which are in the long-hand statement, are missing in the typed statement.\n\nOur client is baffled by the statement self-recorded by the investigating officer, one Muchihwa Misheck, dated 16 May 2025, a date which we are yet to live and see. In that statement, what is disturbing is the attitude of Mr Muchihwa in which he is discounting the credibility of other witnesses and evidence. This is outside the investigating officers jurisdiction and purview, Chamutsa wrote.\n\nThe lawyers also noted that the wheels of justice are turning slowly.\n\nWe are, therefore, instructed to inform you, as we hereby do, that our client strongly thinks that it is in the interest of justice that the accused Daniel Brink Bosman be charged with the crime of murder as defined in section 47(1) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23\n\nThis is said so because there is reasonable suspicion that he killed our clients child, one Suarance Moffat. A prima facie case for the prosecution can be raised, Chamutsa wrote.\n\nWhen contacted for comment on the matter, Bosman refused to shed light on the tragic incident and subsequent allegations raised against him.\n\nI am not at liberty to comment as this matter is still in the courts, Bosman told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\n",
