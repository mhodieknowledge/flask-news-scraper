There may be good reasons why the professors and lecturers are striking, but we cannot say that every strike that happens somewhere is a condemnation of the government.\n\nThere is nothing untoward about lecturers or any other Zimbabwean saying, I am not happy with what my employer is doing. It is not a political issue; it is an employer-employee relationship, said Mutsvangwa.\n\nThe Association of University Teachers, which is campaigning for a salary increase, has been met with silence from UZ.\n\nUZ responded heavy-handedly, suspending five of the striking lecturers, with reports indicating that newly recruited adjunct teachers will earn US$3 per hour.\n\nMutsvangwa said a solution must be found to avert further chaos at UZ.\n\nNo, it is an expression of the democratic nature of Zimbabwean society. There is nothing wrong with striking, but hopefully, they will sit down together and assess each others grievances and demands.\n\nThere is no way we can be permanently without lecturers at such an important institution as the University of Zimbabwe. I am sure something good will come out of it, said Mutsvangwa.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nChief Justice Luke Malaba on Wednesday encouraged the judicial officers to embrace technological advancements.\n\nMalaba said individuals lacking basic computer skills have no place in Zimbabwes judiciary at a time when the world is evolving technologically.\n\nThis urgent call for proficiency arose during the ongoing public interviews conducted by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) for candidates vying for the post of Labour Court judges.\n\nThe JSC has implemented the internet-based Integrated Electronic Case Management System (IECMS), designed to streamline the digital management of court cases.\n\nTo effectively utilise this system, users must possess devices such as laptops, computers, tablets, and smartphones, along with reliable internet access.\n\nThey must also complete a registration process and receive adequate training on the IECMS platform.\n\nMalabas scrutiny fell on local lawyer Joseph Masango, who was applying for the Labour Court judge position.\n\nThe Chief Justice criticised Masangos apparent lack of initiative in keeping up with necessary skills, revealing that he had scored a zero on a test integral to the selection process.\n\nWhen Malaba inquired about Masangos computer literacy, the lawyer confidently affirmed his ability.\n\nHowever, when confronted with his test score, Masango attributed his failure to a lack of experience with IECMS, as his cases had not reached higher courts.\n\nIECMS is now a critical component in the justice system. How can you be a law officer without knowledge of using IECMS, especially since it was introduced back in 2022? Malaba remarked.\n\nYou cant pursue such a post when you score zero in a crucial test meant to prepare you for this role. All lawyers should know how to use the IECMS.\n\nHe continued to express his disappointment, saying, There is a component of laxity in you Your attitude toward IECMS is worrying. We cannot understand why a senior lawyer like you doesnt know these things or seems indifferent to the changes occurring not just in Zimbabwes judicial space but globally.\n\nIn response, Masango vowed to amend his approach if granted the position.\n\nI will never do that again. If I am given the post, I will change that attitude and put my all into this job, he said.\n\nMy CV shows that I have not been stagnant; Ive received promotions because my supervisors were satisfied with my performance. If there was laxity in my work, clients would have reported me to the Law Society. Im a go-getter, and I adhere to ethical conduct.\n\nThe JSC is interviewing 28 candidates who are competing for eight positions on the Labour Court bench. The process began on Tuesday. Initially, the commission received 53 nominations, but following a review, six submissions were invalidated, and two were withdrawn.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, 45 candidates participated in the first-level examination, with 28 qualifying for the final interviews.\n\nThe panel of interviewers includes Malaba, his deputy, Elizabeth Gwaunza, Attorney General Virginia Mabhiza, Judge President Mary Zimba Dube, and Chief Magistrate Vongai Guuriro Muchuchuti, among others.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has declared the fatal accident involving a fuel tanker, a two-tonne truck and a van, which claimed 12 lives near Kwekwe, a national disaster.\n\nThe accident occurred at the 200 kilometre peg along the Harare-Bulawayo Road near Sebakwe River.\n\nAccording to the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP), the fuel tanker with two trailers, travelling towards Kwekwe, collided with a truck travelling from the opposite direction, resulting in a head-on collision with a Nissan AD van, which had 12 people on board.\n\nThe tanker dragged the van for several metres before overturning and falling on top of it, trapping the 12 occupants inside.\n\nPolice have released names of eight of the victims  James Ncube (23), Marvellous Mapanzure (20), Emilly Mpofu Mucheuki (25), Joshua Muza (35), Reward Nyatsongo (28), Farai Bisendi (47), Emmanuel Mangomana (21) and Maria Jasi (43).\n\nFour females are yet to be identified.\n\nIn a statement, Mnangagwa declared the accident a national disaster.\n\nMy heart goes out to families that have lost their loved ones in this horrific accident. Equally, I wish a speedy recovery to all those nursing injuries from the incident. I have since directed the responsible arms of my Government to declare this traffic accident a national disaster.\n\nThis crucial legal step paves the way for Government to move in and take all-round responsibility for the interment of all those who perished the accident, and for support to those hospitalised. May all the bereaved and other affected families find comfort and a solace in that our Nation joins and mourns with them in this hour of deep grief and pain, said Mnangagwa.\n\nHe urged the public to support law enforcement in addressing reckless driving.\n\nThe deadly incident adds yet another grim statistic to the needless toll which reckless driving levies on our people and our Nation. While I am pleased that the Zimbabwe Republic Police is moving speedily towards a full deployment of high-end technologies for traffic management, and for curbing waywardness on our roads, more still has to be done to arrest the ever-spiralling fatalities we face as a Nation.\n\nThe duty for safe traffic conduct squarely falls on all road users, while the responsibility to call out reckless road-users includes the general public who should support our law enforcement agencies to tame what in essence has become a traffic jungle, added Mnangagwa.\n\n",

Mhlanga, a first-year law student, and another University of Zimbabwe Economics student were denied the opportunity to sit for their examinations while in custody, whilst inmates experienced inhumane living conditions, mostly due to overcrowding.\n\nPrison cells designed for 35 inmates were reportedly holding more than 80, leading to unsanitary and degrading living conditions.\n\nSeveral detainees raised allegations of police abuse during their arrests, including physical violence and theft of personal belongings.\n\nThe commission revealed there were 66 irregular migrants of different nationalities whose detention was in violation of their rights, as they were not facing any criminal charges and were not awaiting trial.\n\nZHRC urged relevant authorities to take immediate action to prioritise urgent bail applications, conduct thorough investigations into allegations of police misconduct and ensure accountability for any abuses.\n\nThe Commission called for improved prison conditions, reduced crowds, restoration ofcommunication facilities, and access to adequate medical care for all detainees.\n\nPrison officers were urged to desist from imprisoning irregular migrants whose issues should be handled without resorting to indefinite detention.\n\nInmates were advised to report any complaints to the Officer In Charge, who indicated that he was ready to receive reports of assaults by prison officers and bullying by fellow inmates.\n\n",
