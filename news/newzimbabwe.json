Hes pleaded not guilty.\n\nUnder the racketeering conspiracy charge, prosecutors accusedDiddy in the indictmentof creating a criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.\n\nIn a letter to the court, the government proposed dropping three theories related to the racketeering conspiracy charge as a way to streamline jury instructions. They still intend to pursue the racketeering charge but removed instructions related to attempted kidnapping, attempted arson and aiding and abetting sex trafficking.\n\nThe Government is no longer planning to proceed on these theories of liability so instructions are no longer necessary, prosecutors wrote in the letter.\n\nFederal prosecutors narrowed the racketeering charge against Diddy in final stage of trial (REUTERS)\n\nAll of the five federal charges against Diddy remain.\n\nThe move comes after Alexandra Shapiro, one of the 55-year-old moguls defense attorneys, passionately argued in court on Tuesdayfor a judgment of acquittal on all counts.She claimed there were deficiencies to each count and then walked through each charge, outlining why it should be dropped.\n\nShapiro argued that two of the three of the governments examples of kidnapping were insufficient.\n\nIn one kidnapping allegation, Capricorn Clark, Diddys former employee, testified about being driven by Diddys then-head of security to a dilapidated building where she was subjected tolie detector tests for five daysin a row. If she failed, a man told her she would be thrown in the East River, she testified. But Shapiro argued there was no evidence that Diddy knew this was happening or that a co-conspirator had kidnapped her.\n\nSean Diddy Combs hugs his lawyer Nicole Westmoreland as he enters the courtroom during Combs sex trafficking trial in New York City, New York, U.S., June 16, 2025. (Reuters)\n\nThe arson allegation stems from a claim by Scott Mescudi, better known as Kid Cudi, thatDiddy firebombed his Porschein early 2012 after he discovered the rapper had dated his longtime girlfriend Cassie Ventura. Shapiro argued that there was no evidence that her client was involved, noting that Mescudi didnt witness the incident. She added that there was female DNA found on the bottle used for the Molotov cocktail.\n\nProsecutors plan to focus the racketeering conspiracy charges instead on proving forced labor and sex trafficking.\n\nThe judge said he would reserve a decision on the defenses motion. Closing arguments are set to begin Thursday morning.\n\n",

We were suspended on the 6th of May, and the letters stated that the dismissal is effective from the date of our suspension.\n\nWe wrote to the registrar that we wished to use the great hall for the purposes of balloting on the 28th of March and the balloting was meant for the 2nd of April, but the registrar did not respond to our letter of request.\n\nThen came the second of April, the university opened the hall and also brought in a legal officer of the University of Zimbabwe to be part of the proceedings.\n\nThe university also supplied security guards to oversee the process until the end and then two days later, that is when they said we used the hall without authorisation, Vengeyi said.\n\nHe added that they will continue picketingand plan to pursue legal action.\n\nWe are still AUT members, we will continue with our strike and our picketing. We will also seek legal remedy, which we will discuss later with our legal advisor.\n\nWe are not disturbed at all, not worried. We knew they would reach this decision because, even during the disciplinary hearings, they classified the offence under Schedule D, which allows dismissal on the first offence and we knew this was their intention, to fire us in the hope that it would stop the strike.\n\n",
