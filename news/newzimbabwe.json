            "content": "BBC\n\nElon Musk has hit out at President Donald Trumps signature tax and spending bill, describing it as a disgusting abomination, in a widening rift between the two.\n\nThe tech billionaire posted on X that the bill would add to the US budget deficit and saddle Americans with crushing debt.\n\nThe budget, which includes huge tax breaks and more defence spending, was passed by the House of Representatives last month and is now being considered by senators.\n\nShame on those who voted for it, said Musk, hinting that he may try to unseat the politicians responsible at next years midterm elections.\n\nThe bill has the backing of President Donald Trump and would be the legislative linchpin of his second-term agenda if it passes Congress.\n\nMusk left the administration abruptly last week after 129 days working to cut costs with his team, known as Doge.\n\nThe comments mark his first public disagreement with Trump since leaving government, after having previously called the plan disappointing.\n\nThe South African-born tech billionaires time in the Trump administration came to an end on 31 May, although Trump said that he will, always, be with us, helping all the way.\n\nIn its current form, the bill  which Trump refers to as the big beautiful bill  has been estimated to increase the budget deficit  the difference between what the government spends and the revenue it receives  by about $600bn (444bn) in the next fiscal year.\n\nIn a series of posts on X on Tuesday, Musk said that the outrageous, pork-filled spending bill will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America [sic] citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.\n\nIn American politics pork refers to spending on projects in lawmakers constituencies.\n\nMusk has previously vowed to fund campaign challenges against any Republican that votes against Trumps agenda. But on Tuesday he fired a warning to those who backed the bill.\n\nIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people, he wrote.\n\nAsked about Musks comments soon after the first post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the President already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill.\n\nThis is one, big, beautiful bill, she added. And hes sticking to it.\n\nThe legislation also pledges to extend soon-to-expire tax cuts passed during the first Trump administration in 2017, as well as an influx of funds for defence spending and to fund the administrations mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.\n\nTo the dismay of fiscal conservatives, it would lift the limit on the amount of money the government can borrow, known as the debt ceiling, to $4tn.\n\nThe comments from Musk reflect wider tensions among Republicans over the plan, which faced stiff opposition from different wings of the party as it worked its way through the House.\n\nThe Senate has now taken it up, and divisions are already emerging in that chamber, which is also narrowly controlled by Republicans.\n\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul has said over the last few days he will not support the bill if it raises the debt ceiling.\n\nThe GOP [the Republican Party] will own the debt once they vote for this, he told CBS News, the BBCs US partner, over the weekend.\n\nTrump responded to Paul with a series of social media posts, accusing him of having very little understanding of the bill and saying that the people of Kentucky cant stand him.\n\nHis ideas are actually crazy, Trump wrote.\n\nRepublican lawmakers pushed back on Musks comments, with Senate majority leader John Thune telling reporters the party plans to proceed full speed ahead despite a difference of opinion.\n\nWe have an agenda that everybody campaigned on, most notably the president, he said.\n\nMike Johnson  the Republican Speaker who has ushered the legislation through the House  told reporters on Capitol Hill that my friend Elon is terribly wrong.\n\nIts a very important first start. Elon is missing it, Johnson said.\n\nJohnson said he had a 20-minute phone call with the tycoon about the bill on Monday, adding that its phasing out of electric vehicle tax credits could have an effect on Tesla, Musks firm.\n\nI lament that, Johnson said, expressing surprise that Musk criticised the bill despite their call. I just deeply regret hes made this mistake.\n\nAmong the issues that upset Musk involved air traffic control at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), according toAxios.\n\nMusk was hoping it would be run on his Starlink satellite system, but he was denied because of issues relating to the technology and the appearance of a conflict of interest, the political outlet reported.\n\nSome Democrats welcomed Musks comments despite their previous criticism of him and the work of Doge.\n\nEven Elon Musk, whos been part of the whole process, and is one of Trumps buddies, said the bill is bad, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. We can imagine how bad this bill is.\n\nTrump and Republicans in Congress have set a deadline of 4 July to get the measure passed and signed into law.\n\nMusk supported Trump in last years November election with donations of more than $250m.\n\nTo make peace with spending hawks, Trump is also asking Congress to pass a plan that would reduce current spending by $9.4bn, a figure derived from Doges work.\n\nIt would mainly slash funding for foreign aid, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and for broadcasters NPR and PBS.\n\n",

The road to be used during the exercise is Solomon Mujuru, formerly known as Kirkman Road, Dube said.\n\nThe army spokesperson reiterated that the exercise will be conducted during the day and the public is, therefore, urged to remain calm.\n\nThe public is therefore requested not to panic as the training exercise is part of routine training by ZNA units, added Col Dube.\n\nThe preemptive move was ostensibly timed conveniently to counter the misconception that the drill was a signal for masses to take to the streets in protest against President Emmerson Mnangagwas government, as hoped for by war veteran Blessed Bombshell Runesu Geza.\n\nGeza has on numerous broadcasts vaguely stated that a signal shall come at the appropriate time and Zimbabweans must march in the streets demanding Mnangagwas exit on accusations of a slew of charges, including grand corruption.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nHIGH Court judge Justice Christopher Dube-Banda has dismissed an application against a Murewa widow who was being sued US$60,000 for malicious prosecution by her stepson.\n\nThe complainant in the case, Collin Benyure, was suing his stepmother, Anna Benyure, claiming US$$20,000 for emotional stress, US$$30,000 for damages to his reputation, and US$10,000 for legal costs incurred during the prosecution.\n\nThe widowdid not file a notice to defend, resulting in the matter being set down on the unopposed roll.\n\nThe judge dismissed the claim, ruling that Collin had no evidence to support his claim.\n\nThe declaration stated that on 8 May 2024, Anna falsely claimed that the plaintiff, Collin, destroyed her seven-roomed house at Benyure homestead, Nyamakosi Village, Mutoko.\n\nThe court heard Collin was subsequently charged with the crime of contravening s 140 of the Criminal Law [Codification and Reform] Act [Chapter 9:23].\n\nHe was subsequently arrested before he was later cleared, resulting in him filing the present application.\n\nIn casu, in her statement to the police, Anna stated that on 8 May 2004, she received an anonymous call informing her that the plaintiff had demolished her house.\n\nOn the same day, she passed through the homestead and saw that indeed her seven-roomed, unroofed house had been demolished.\n\nThis is the information the defendant provided to the police.\n\nShe mentioned the plaintiff only as a suspect and informed the police that she did not seehimdemolishing the house.\n\nThe court heard she was candid that her information was based on an anonymous call she received.\n\nOn the premise of that account and the investigations, the police arrested and preferred a charge against the plaintiff.\n\nIn dismissing Collins claim, the judge said the decision to arrest and charge the plaintiff was exclusively that of the police.\n\nThe question whether she had a right or not to build a house at the homestead does not arise in this matter. It is irrelevant. The point is that she had a house at the Benyure homestead. Her house was demolished, and this is what she reported to the police. The conduct of the defendant cannot be said to amount to an active instigation of criminal proceedings, said the judge.\n\nIn addition, the judge said Collins affidavit of evidence merely recycles the contents of the summons and declaration.\n\nSuch is unhelpful. The allegation that the defendant made a false statement is not in sync with the facts of this case.\n\nThe demolished house was at the centre of the case; the police could not have arrested, and the prosecution could not have prosecuted the plaintiff if there had been no demolished house. There was a demolished house.\n\nBanda said there is no evidence that, besides giving information to the police, the defendant proceeded to lay a charge and was overbearing on the police to institute proceedings when they would not have otherwise done so.\n\nThe defendant in this case confined herself to giving information on what she believed transpired.\n\nHe said malice may be inferred from the absence of reasonable and probable cause to commence or continue a prosecution.\n\nIn other words, a want of reasonable and probable cause may be evidence of malice, where the court may conclude that there was no honest belief in the accusation made. In casu, there is no evidence of malice.\n\nIn other words, the plaintiff has not proved an absence of reasonable and probable cause operating on the mind of the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiff failed to prove the aspect of malice in the context of a claim for malicious prosecution, the court ruled.\n\n",

Sammons says the two teams will go into that match on an equal footing.\n\nI think South Africa have a great chance of taking that World Test Championship final. Two evenly matched teams. Its going to be a really good game and ultimately it will be decided by the batting unit that can fare best against two quality bowling attacks, he predicted.\n\nThe former Proteas batting consultant is also quite excited to be facing his native nation over the next few days.\n\nThis will also serve as good preparation for the official test series that the neighbours will play at the end of this month in Bulawayo.\n\nThe next four days against South Africa offer our team an amazing opportunity to prepare for what promises to be an exciting and challenging winter, with two tests against the same team and another two against New Zealand.\n\nSo the guys are really looking forward to the challenge and obviously the learnings that will come from it.\n\nIt is good for this group and for Zimbabwean cricket in general that theres so much test cricket available for them this year and obviously towards the end of last year. Its where your fundamentals are tested, and as a young group of players, its where youre going to take the greatest amount of learnings, concluded Sammons.\n\nZimbabwe played a one-off test match against England almost two weeks ago, and were ruthlessly beaten by an innings and 45 runs.\n\nThe coach admitted that the occasion got the better of his team, and says that there was a lot of anxiety among the players.\n\n",
