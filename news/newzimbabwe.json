Among those whom he allegedly attacked are goalkeeper Washington Arubi, Emmanuel Jalai, and Chirewa.Inside sources within the camp have revealed that senior players have since launched a formal complaint to the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) regarding the coachs conduct.In addressing Chirewas issue, ZIFA has since released a statement clarifying Chirewas withdrawal from the squad ahead of Mondays match against Qatar.ZIFA wishes to inform the nation, the media fraternity, and all that midfielder Tawanda Chirewa has been granted permission to leave the national team camp, as had been agreed prior to the player joining the camp.This decision was reached with the full blessing and consent of ZIFA, after Wolverhampton Wanderers formally requested an opportunity for the player to be assessed by their new technical team as part of their internal preparations for the season ahead.ZIFA emphasises that this development is not a withdrawal, nor does it reflect any dispute or disagreement. Instead, it represents a professional and mutually respectful alignment between the national association and the players parent club, an alignment that prioritises the athletes long-term development while safeguarding Zimbabwes national football interests, read part of the statement.Meanwhile, senior players in the Warriors are said to have threatened to retire from playing international football if Marinica doesnt change his attitude and approach.\n\nThe 22-year-old player is reported to have had a fallout with new Warriors coach Mario Marinica, who is alleged to be exhibiting unprofessional conduct towards the players.\n\nMarinica is alleged to be insulting players in camp.
