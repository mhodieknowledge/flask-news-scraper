Those found wanting will regret the day of their existence.\n\nAccording to Parliament, the generator had been activated at midday, with ZESA engineers on site to monitor proceedings.\n\nHowever, the backup system reportedly developed a technical fault approximately two and a half hours into the address, causing the blackout while Mnangagwa was still delivering his speech.\n\nA letter from Acting Clerk of Parliament Nomasonto Sunga to Local Government Permanent Secretary John Bhasera, dated October 21, had requested a serviced, fully tested and fit generator for the SONA, citing previous blackouts during important sessions.\n\nThis is the second time a blackout has occurred at the Parliament Building in Mnangagwas presence, following a similar incident in November 2024 during Finance Minister Mthuli Ncubes 2025 National Budget presentation.\n\nWe request your ministrys coordination and oversight in ensuring uninterrupted power supply during the State of the Nation Address (SONA), which has been tentatively scheduled for 28 October 2025 at Parliament Building.\n\nIt is noted that there is an approved arrangement to run the event using the generator as the primary source of power, with ZETDC on standby, following previous power disruptions experienced during important sessions, Sunga wrote.\n\nIn view of this, the generator must be serviced, fully tested, and confirmed fit for uninterrupted operation during the event. ZETDC technical staff should be physically on standby throughout the proceedings to provide an immediate response if required.\n\nParliament also assured that it would promptly pay the company contracted to provide generator services and supply sufficient fuel to ensure smooth power supply throughout the event.\n\nParliament will ensure timely payment to the service provider contracted for the generator service, as well as the provision of adequate fuel to power the system throughout the duration of the event, added Sunga.\n\n",

There is a correlation between what happened after midnight,the arson, the abduction of the security guard.\n\nIt was done by people who know the job of fear. They seem to have forgotten that we have endured such harassment for the past two years, said Mandaza.\n\nThe ruling party has endorsed a resolution seeking to extend Mnangagwas presidency to 2030, which would require amending Section 91(2) of the Constitution, which limits a president to two terms, and Section 328(7), which bars incumbents from benefiting from constitutional amendments.\n\nAccording to party insiders, ZANU PF intends to use its parliamentary majority to push through the proposed changes.\n\nSpeaking at the disrupted event, Biti condemned the attacks and reaffirmed the groups commitment to defending the Constitution.\n\nWe are very sorry to Dr. Mandaza over the arson, and to Gilbert Mbwende, whose house was also attacked.\n\nThis is a new initiative by concerned citizens to resist the mutilation of the Constitution. It is not a political effort, but a civic one, to defend the rule of law, Biti said.\n\n",

The resolution, adopted at the partys annual conference in Mutare, directed the ruling partys Legal Affairs Secretary to begin drafting the necessary constitutional amendments.\n\nMnangagwa is currently serving his second and final term, as is mandated by the constitution. While he has previously described himself as a constitutionalist, adding he will step down in 2028, he has done nothing to oppose his loyalists, who are pushing for him to hang onto power.\n\nIn a statement of solidarity with the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), ITUC-Africa Secretary General Joel Odigie said African workers have consistently upheld democracy and constitutionalism as the foundation of peace, justice, and shared prosperity.\n\nITUC-Africa Secretary General JoelOdigie\n\nWe join ZCTU in urging African citizens, civil society, and the labour movement to remain vigilant and steadfast in defending the integrity of their constitutions, said Odigie.\n\nSocieties that work are those governed by the rule of law, not the law of force. When constitutions are trampled, democracy dies and with it, the hopes of workers for decent work, social justice, and equitable development.\n\nOdigie called on African Union member states, regional economic communities, and global partners to reaffirm their commitment to constitutional rule and accountable democratic governance as essential pillars of Africas transformation agenda.\n\nThe continental labour leader also rejected military involvement in civil governance and condemned civilian coups, where leaders manipulate constitutions to unlawfully extend their stay in power.\n\nHe further criticised attempts to silence opposition voices, manipulate electoral systems, or stage sham elections designed to entrench authoritarian rule, saying such actions erode hard-won democratic gains.\n\nWe commend leaders across Africa who have resisted the temptation to alter term limits or manipulate constitutions for personal gain. These are true statespersons, guardians of constitutional democracy worthy of respect by future generations, Odigie said.\n\nHe added that leaders who dismantle constitutional order and weaken democratic institutions for the sake of political survival corrode governance, polarise societies, and expose their nations to instability, insecurity, and economic decline.\n\n",

She also found them to be flight risks given the gravity of the allegations.\n\nThe ten, Rose Chirenje (65), Nyarai Chigudu (52), Kenesia Jera (62), Edward Mandikutse (69), Dexter Jena (69), Hazvinei Machingura (69), Stephen Chagwiza (48), Jacob Masaraure (75), Mapengo Mapengo (57) and Joephrey Chigwerewe (70) were charged with participating in a gathering with intent to promote public violence, breaches of peace or bigotry under Section 37(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23].\n\nProsecutors allege that on October 17, the accused, acting on Gezas social media calls, gathered near Africa Unity Square in Harare, intending to join the protest against Mnangagwas government.\n\nAccording to police, the group was intercepted at the corner of George Silundika Avenue and Sam Nujoma Street while singing and dancing to a protest song with the lyrics, Zvigananda chera mwena nguva yakwana, chera mwena zvigananda, meaning Economic saboteurs, your time is up.\n\nDetectives from CID Law and Order said six suspects were arrested at the scene, while four others Chagwiza, Masaraure, Mapengo and Chigwerewe were later found hiding in a silver Toyota Probox parked at Corner Sixth Street and Kwame Nkrumah Avenue.\n\nInvestigators claim they recovered stones, boulders, and other missiles hidden near the protest site.\n\nIn opposing bail, Detective Sergeant Lovemore Chisi said releasing the accused could endanger public order.\n\nThe nature of the offence suggests a propensity for inciting or engaging in further public disorder, he said. Releasing the accused could reignite unrest or embolden others.\n\nChisi also warned that the accused might abscond from trial, given the lengthy custodial sentence they face if convicted, an argument upheld by the magistrate.\n\nPolice said investigations were ongoing and that several other suspects linked to the planned march remain at large.\n\n",
