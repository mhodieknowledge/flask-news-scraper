            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nIN the wake of another disastrous performance by the senior mens cricket team, The Chevrons, against New Zealand, a Harare lawyer has petitioned the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) to probe allegations of regionalism, tribalism and nepotism in the selection of players at Zimbabwe Cricket.\n\nPaidamoyo Madondo, through his lawyers, Saunyama, Dondo Legal Practitioners is seeking the intervention of the sports mother body to investigate team selection of cricket players, which is alleged to be biased and based on regionalism and tribalism.This comes on the back of uninspiring performances by the Chevrons, who suffered a white wash at the hands of New Zealand in two Test matches that ended in Bulawayo Saturday.Prio to the disastrous Test, Zimbabwe failed to win a match in the tri-nations tournament featuring South Africa and New Zealand at Harare Sports Club.This has prompted questions on the selection of players with inform players in the local leagues being ignored by Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC).In his petition, Madondo raised concerns over the selection criteria, which he described as sloppy and questionable.Our client is deeply concerned and disturbed by the systemic decline and rapid nosedive in the performance of Zimbabwe Crickets national teams, which has been occurring over the past ten (10) years.While this decline may be attributable to some structural and developmental factors, our client asserts; based on observable trends and statistical evidence; that nepotism, tribalism, regionalism, and discrimination in team selection are the dominant factors contributing to national failure, read the petition.ZC convener of selectors David Mutendera has not been spared in the criticism, having been accused of snubbing players such as Brad Evans and Emerst Masuku, who boast of decent performances on the domestic scene.Former Chevrons captain, Elton Chigumbira also faced criticism after players from his academy were selected into the national team raising concerns of conflict of interests since he is also the head coach of the Zimbabwe Under 19.Another and more pressing example of conflict of interest exists through Mr. Elton Chigumbura in the selection of the Zimbabwe national cricket team. It is common cause that Mr. Chigumbura has accepted numerous prominent positions in the Zimbabwe domestic cricket ecosystem.He is head coach of the Zimbabwe Under-19 team, head coach of Takashinga Cricket Club, and head of a private cricket developmental side operating under the name and style Elton Chigumbura Cricket Academy.These positions would reasonably give rise to issues of bias and disclosure of conflicts of interest demonstrated in player selection; especially where Mr. Chigumbura is put in a position to select players, and likely is prone to select those players with which he has prior connections or vested personal developmental interest, read the petition further.Madondo beseeched SRC to conduct an investigation into ZC and publicise a report of a 2023 inquiry, which was headed by Lloyd Mhishi.The Sports Recreation Commission Zimbabwe must conduct a comprehensive, independent, impartial and public investigation into the Zimbabwe Cricket selection processes with respect to allegations of nepotism, discrimination, tribalism, and regionalism in player selection.A detailed report be made public, with clear corrective recommendations.

The Rights Offer was fully subscribed through a combination of shareholder take up underwriters in accordance with the underwriting agreement, she said.\n\nThe Board expressed its appreciation to shareholders for their continued support and to the underwriters for their commitment to the success of the capital raising exercise.\n\nProceeds from the Rights Offer will be applied towards partial settlement of legacy creditors, supporting the Companys working capital expenditure requirements and unlocking fresh supplier support.\n\nThe board also wishes to advise shareholders that the process relating to property disposal programme remains on-going.\n\nThe company are currently receiving and evaluating offers for the identified properties, with discussions under way to ensure that any transactions concluded are in the best interests of shareholders and are consistent with the companys strategic objectives, added Munyuru.\n\n",

The time to act is now, not later, he said.But in a statement, the ZCTU acting secretary general, Runesu Dzimiri said issuing such drastic measures move without an alternative is not favourable for the people of Zimbabwe, especially at a time when 88% of the population is working in the informal economy.He reminded the government that the chaos in the streets is a direct result of poor policies and weak governance systems, which have plunged the nation into chaos.The streets are congested with millions of graduates from tertiary institutions, because the economy has failed to create enough jobs to absorb job seekers owing to the collapse of the industry. Unemployment and the high cost of living are also factors forcing citizens into night vending.The National Development Strategy 1 had envisioned to create 760,000 jobs for the period 2020-2025 however, this has not been the case, he said.Dzimiri urged the government to accept the reality that even the smaller percentage currently employed is barely receiving a living wage and are now subsiding salaries with vending machines, making the trade the only option in the face of unsustainable unemployment levels.The ZCTU criticised the government for overseeing the construction of irrelevant workspaces across the country arguing that such initiatives lack the appreciation of how the informal sector works.We note and appreciate the establishment of vending stalls in places like Mbare and other sites as a great move. However, issues of accessibility to these sites are a barrier discouraging people to go and occupy those stalls, he said.He said going forward, Local authorities need to learn and apply the City of Mutare model which identified areas for night vending and established such places for licensed vendors in a move which has assisted in controlling waste disposal, poor sanitation and has also boosted revenues while for local enhancing service delivery.Dzimiri said the governments mantra of leaving no person and no place behind should encompass policy making processes.This ban will leave many unemployed and vulnerable women, youths and graduates roaming in the streets vending behind, suffering and continuously wallowing in poverty.The Vision 2030 of an upper middle class income economy needs strategic interventions to address the economic crisis, not these drastic, repulsive orders that will only cause chaos as police chase vendors without addressing the root causes of the challenges facing millions of Zimbabwe, he added.\n\nRecently, Local Government Minister, Daniel Garwe touched a raw nerve after issuing a directive to ban night vending.\n\nNight vending has brought with it illicit drug and substance dealings, which is a threat to health, economy and national security.The importation and selling of second-hand clothing is banned, and consequently street and night vending activities are equally banned.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Ministry of Health and Child Care has warned the public to be on high alert over the risk of an outbreak of Mpox, despite the country having no confirmed cases to date.\n\nIn a statement, the ministry said the World Health Organisation (WHO) has reaffirmed that Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\n\nMpox, a viral disease related to smallpox, has resurged in several regions, including non-endemic countries. According to the ministry, localised person-to-person transmission has been documented, often through household contact and healthcare-associated exposure, particularly in settings lacking appropriate protective measures.\n\nThe WHO is reporting ongoing outbreaks across Africa, including some Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, raising fears of cross-border spread.\n\nThis poses a heightened risk of cross-border transmission, the ministry cautioned.\n\nIn response, Zimbabwe has scaled up disease surveillance and reinforced screening measures at all Points of Entry (PoEs).\n\nThe ministry urged the public to strictly follow WHO-recommended preventive measures, warning including avoiding physical contact with individuals showing symptoms of Mpox, sharing clothes, bedding and towels among other things.\n\nThe ministry also encouraged the public to be vigilant and act swiftly if they suspect infection. Members of the public are encouraged to report any suspected cases to the nearest health facility promptly, it said.\n\nMpox spreads primarily through close contact and can cause fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes, sometimes leading to severe illness.\n\n",
