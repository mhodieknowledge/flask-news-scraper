            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nMDC President Douglas Mwonzora has laid into businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei, describing him as one of the worst politicians who has unsuccessfully attempted to use money to get his way in Zanu PF.\n\nMwonzora was responding to donations and pledges made by Tagwirei in Epworth, where his party candidate Alice Nyahunzvi is set to battle Zanu PFs Civilised Bushe in a Ward 6 by-election on August 2.\n\nTagwirei, who has had quite a difficult month since being asked to leave a Central Committee meeting by Vice President Constantino Chiwengas allies, donated 15 solar-powered boreholes, two graders to rehabilitate the poor neighbourhoods roads, 100 primary school scholarships and 3,000 family food hampers.\n\nHarare province chairman Godwills Masimirembwa had endorsed Tagwirei to join Zanu PFs central committee, two months after the Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) senior member joined active politics.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on Wednesday, Mwonzora said Tagwireis use of money to lure supporters would fail the same way his cars and donations were failing to land him a seat in Zanu PFs powerful committee.\n\nHe said they had told residents of Epworth to eat his money and vote wisely.\n\nIn Epworth, our fight is no longer against the Zanu PF candidate only; it is a fight against thetenderpreneurs, commonly known aszvigananda, who are trying to use the Epworth election as a launchpad to get senior places in Zanu PF, said Mwonzora.\n\nThey are flaunting ill-gotten wealth, churning out false charity. The people of Epworth and Zimbabwe cannot be bought by trinkets.\n\nWe have said to the people of Epworth, eat their money and vote wisely. We are confident that we are going to defeat these bourgeoisie people who are flaunting their wealth.\n\nDespite being a long-time benefactor of the ruling party, Tagwirei has had his efforts to participate in Zanu PF politics resisted by senior members of the party, such as spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa and, reportedly, Chiwenga himself.\n\nTagwirei has been touted as Mnangagwas preferred successor ahead of Chiwenga while Mutsvangwa reportedly harbours presidential aspirations too. He has been referred to as the Prime Minister in circles closer to deals struck amongstzvigananda.\n\nAdded Mwonzora: Why was Tagwirei not doing it before? Why is he trying to promise us now?\n\nTagwirei has shown Zimbabwe that he has very bad political table manners. In fact, he is one of the most incompetent politicians I have ever seen.\n\nHe has tried to use money and cars to get into the central committee of his party and he has failed. He will try to use money and wealth in Epworth and he will equally fail.\n\nAccording to Mutsvangwa, Tagwirei promised Zanu PF politburo and central committee members top-of-the-range vehicles for unspecified reasons.\n\nThis, according to the former presidential advisor, was an attempt to bribe, gain favour and influence the decision on his co-option.\n\nZanu PF is targeting 8,000 votes at the Epworth polls, while the MDC believes it can easily upset its monied rivals.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nORAL reports from senior politicians and journalists will tell you that in the 1990s, late liberation war hero Eddison Zvobgo once refused to come out of bed to welcome back late President Robert Mugabe, who was set to arrive in the wee hours of one winter morning at the then Harare International Airport from one of his many international trips.\n\nAlthough Zvobgo was never Mugabes deputy, it was common practice that a select number of Ministers, Vice President(s) would always welcome him back from these trips.\n\nVideos of high-ranking government officials lined up on one side with Mugabe shaking hands with each one of them, fresh from disembarking an Air Zimbabwe plane, are still etched in the memories of many.\n\nThe practice, interpreted as some power flexing opportunity by most Zimbabweans, has been explained by President Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesperson, George Charamba.\n\nMany would have wondered why Mugabe did not just disembark and head straight home, be it to his fancy Blue Roof or State House, when he arrived late or too early.\n\nApparently, it is protocol for an Acting President to send off and receive the President whenever they leave.\n\nWhoever would have been named Acting President has to physically be at the Presidents point of exit and entry for a tradition that had remained unknown, unasked and unexplained up until now.\n\nThe law of the land spells out who acts in place of the Head of State when he is away and out of the country for whatever reason. The Head of State is required by the same law to designate the person who stands in his place, said Charamba on X in response to questions around Chiwengas decision to welcome Mnangagwa late at night on his return from Equatorial Guinea, Japan and Algeria.\n\nThe person so designated is required to be at the point of exit, which is the port at which the extant Head of State leaves the country. So important is this procedure that the person designated has to be physically present, or else the Head of State may not leave the country.\n\nThe port of exit is that point where the sitting Head of State hands over instruments of power to the character chosen to act. This is why the Acting character actually gets saluted by the command, led by the Commander of Defence Forces (CDF), once the incumbent is airborne.\n\nFast forward to the Head of States return. Again, the Acting President must be at the port of re-entry to hand back the instruments of power temporarily given him in an acting capacity.\n\nHe appears together with the command and is the first one to greet the Head of State upon his return. In that welcome and handshake is the symbolic act of handing back power ceded temporarily to its elected owner.\n\nThe tradition, presumably adopted from Britain, has often been blasted as archaic, unnecessary and a waste of taxpayers money.\n\nExpectedly, it is practised in neighbouring Zambia, Malawi and Tanzania, all of which were British colonies.\n\nPresident Hakainde Hichilema of Zambia, his Malawian counterpart Lazarus Chakwera and TanzaniasSamia Suluhu Hassan all participate in the tradition.\n\nDesktop research on whether Britain was still practising it proved inconclusive.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nPeople in a gold-mining area in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo have been using their bare hands and basic tools to free miners trapped underground.\n\nSix have been pulled out alive, with one seriously injured, since shafts collapsed in Lomera in the early hours of Sunday, local journalist Ashuza Barack told the BBC.\n\nThere have been conflicting reports on the death toll. One resident said that 12 bodies had been found but Barack said no bodies had been recovered.\n\nThe area, in South Kivu province, has been under the control of M23 rebels since they captured swathes of DR Congos mineral-rich east earlier this year. The M23 rejected reports that hundreds were trapped underground.\n\nLomera has witnessed a gold rush since the end of last year when the precious ore was discovered in the hills near what was then a quiet village, according to medical charity MSF.\n\nThousands of people arrived hoping to make money as freelance, or artisanal, miners, turning the area into a sprawling chaos of mineshafts and makeshift shelters, MSF said in a statement on a cholera outbreak in the area last month.\n\nReports said a series of cascading landslides buried up to 15 of these makeshift shafts without warning.\n\nRescue efforts have slowed as debris and large stones continue to block access.\n\nJournalist Barack told the BBC that the lack of proper equipment has hampered attempts to clear the site. Survivors told him that many miners remain stuck.\n\nWeve been digging since Sunday night but have not recovered any bodies. We are exhausted, one miner said.\n\nOfficials from M23 visited the site and ordered mining activities to stop in parts of the area.\n\nDozens of mining sites across this region of DR Congo supply the global electronics industry with vital metals and minerals. Many are not properly regulated and safety standards are not observed.\n\nThe region has also been hit by conflict for decades as various rebel groups and the government have been fighting over control.\n\nThe M23 made significant territorial gains earlier this year, capturing Goma, the main city in eastern DR Congo.\n\nIt signed a ceasefire deal with the government at the weekend in talks brokered by Qatar.\n\n",
