Whenever we passionately ask questions which are aimed at advancing the lives of Zimbabweans, we are met with insinuations that you are the owners of sanctions, you are the people who brought sanctions, which is not really fair, said Hamauswa.\n\nIn response, Mudenda bluntly told the National Assembly that the leaders of the opposition had invited economic sanctions on the country.\n\nThe element of sanctions is very genuine. If you recall the earlier leaders of the opposition, then MDC, they actually went to America to ask for those sanctions. Please recall. If you do not know your history, can you research on it? said Mudenda.\n\nSanctions have been a point of contention in Zimbabwean politics, with the ruling party ZANU PF using them as an excuse for the decay of the economy.\n\nThe economic ruin is marked by the comatose industry.\n\nThe government predicted to have lost millions in funding as a result of sanctions that were imposed by the United States of America and Britain.\n\n",

            "content": "University World News\n\nMost girls and young women in Zimbabwe dream big about pursuing a tertiary education. Still, their dreams are shattered by barriers that hold them back, according to the findings of a new survey conducted in 10 districts across the country by researchers from the World Bank and local research assistants.\n\nThesurvey, A Girl Can Dream: Analysing aspirations, gender norms, and influencers among girls and women in Zimbabwe, released on 25 August 2025, noted that 80% of girls in the country aspire to attain higher levels of education and eventually get jobs in the manufacturing, retail or healthcare sectors.\n\nHowever, only 4% eventually acquire a tertiary education, according to Dr Abhilasha Sahay, an economist at the World Banks gender group, and her associates, Sara Troiano, a senior economist at the World Banks Social Protection and Jobs Global Practice, and Sreelakshmi Papineni, an economist who focuses on gender issues at the Office of the Chief Economist Office (Africa region).\n\nOdds that include limited reproductive rights, traditional norms, domestic roles, acceptance of male authority, financial constraints and other indicators of poverty are invariably stacked against too many girls from an early age, the researchers state in the survey report.\n\nThe survey, which explored the aspirations and challenges faced by girls and young women aged 15-35, revealed that financial constraints were the primary obstacles: 80% of the respondents cited poverty as the main barrier to their pursuing higher education opportunities.\n\nAccording to the research team, this is consistent with the situation in most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Girls and young women are more likely to live in poverty than men and, characteristically, have less access to higher education and, subsequently, rarely benefit from productive economic opportunities.\n\nEarly-age risks\n\nDespite progressive views on gender equality as reflected in the countries legal systems, especially regarding education and reproductive rights, the researchers point out that traditional norms persist. This particularly happens in rural areas, where domestic roles, male-dominated careers, and acceptance of male authority still influence decisions that negatively impact girls access to higher education.\n\nCiting some of the early-age risks in Zimbabwe, the survey found that one in three girls is married before turning 18, and only 9% manage to complete upper secondary school. At the same time, teenage pregnancy is alarmingly common, with 111 births per 1,000 girls aged 15-19.\n\nThe risks are even greater for those with fewer resources, as adolescent birth rates are eight times higher among girls without a primary education and four times higher for those from the poorest households compared to their wealthier peers, according to the survey.\n\nOf the 1,291 adolescent girls and young women who participated in the survey, 40% aspired to complete at least a bachelor degree, but only 4% of them reached this level. Also, 47% expressed a desire to complete a university degree, whether a bachelor or postgraduate degree qualification if there were no constraints.\n\nAccording to the researchers, there was no significant difference in aspirations between rural and urban areas or across different age groups in all 10 districts, which included Epworth, Hopley, Beitbridge, Chinhoyi, Kwekwe, Murehwa, Mutasa, Redcliff, Umguza, and Zvimba. The high educational aspirations are noteworthy, especially considering the low level of secondary school completion among girls in Zimbabwe, compared to other countries in East and Southern Africa.\n\nBreaking male dominance?\n\nHowever, there are no indicators that girls and young women in Zimbabwe are prepared to break barriers related to venturing into male-dominated occupations in engineering, finance, and technology. Whereas only 10% of the respondents currently work in these male-dominated sectors, only 14% expressed a desire to transition into such sectors.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers noted that gender norms related to the acceptance of male authority still significantly influence decisions in Zimbabwe. Most girls and young women who have already made the transition to male-dominated careers have expressed a desire to return to female-dominated sectors, including production and manufacturing, retail, hospitality, and health.\n\nAccording to the researchers, an aspiration to work in production and manufacturing is a distinctive feature of Zimbabwean girls and young women (25%). In contrast, the sector has a lower preference in Zambia (12%) and Mozambique (7%). In Zambia, business services are a dream job for 25% of girls and young women, while in Mozambique, 32% aspire to work in education.\n\nIn their assessment, Sahay and her co-researchers argued that, whereas it is free for Zimbabwean girls and young women to dream about higher education, turning the dream into reality is a challenge. It comes with a price, often linked to tough decisions about education, employment, marriage, or fertility.\n\nAccording to the survey findings, 80% of the respondents were unable to achieve their desired level of education, and about six out of 10 young women were unable to find a job in their chosen sector.\n\nVoices from the field show a multitude of aspiration gaps. For instance, one young woman told the researchers: I did not complete my secondary education. I left school when I was in Form 3 at the age of 15, because I did not have the money for the fees. Going back to school for me will not be possible because I now have kids that need my care, and no one will take care of them.\n\nShe is a single parent and sells fruits and vegetables, the respondent said. She has not sought employment since she lacks the required qualifications.\n\nFear of social judgment\n\nAlthough the survey revealed that some traditional gatekeepers of social norms are slowly becoming more progressive, the researchers note that the fear of social judgment continues to discourage girls and young women in Zimbabwe from accessing higher education or pursuing higher-earning opportunities.\n\nFor instance, eight in 10 respondents in the survey believed that boys education should be prioritised over girls when resources are limited, irrespective of academic ability. Furthermore, although 86% of women in Zimbabwe are reported to agree that it is acceptable to delay marriage or childbearing to pursue higher education, 56% of the sample began childbearing before the age of 20.\n\nAbout 50% of the surveyed group agreed that a womans primary responsibility is household care, that men should be the sole financial providers, and that men should have the final say in decisions in the home. These regressive attitudes, according to the researchers, are common among girls and women in rural areas, creating additional barriers to their higher education ambitions and economic empowerment.\n\nHowever, there are indications that girls and women in Zimbabwe with more positive egalitarian attitudes and self-confidence were fuelling ambitions, as they tend to have higher educational aspirations.\n\nRespondents who rejected the idea that boys should receive more academic resources than girls had higher aspirations for university education. Likewise, self-confidence, as measured by self-efficacy and career decision-making process, is strongly linked to higher educational goals, stated the researchers.\n\nIn this regard, the new survey serves as a reminder that gender equality in accessing higher education and well-paying jobs remains a mirage, not only in Zimbabwe, but also in many countries in Africa. The issue is that, unlike their male counterparts, girls and young women on the continent continue to be influenced and impacted negatively by their social environment.\n\n",

He was then charged with murder. He is expected to appear before the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Thursday, 11 September 2025, said Masondo.\n\nHe confirmed that the murder case was opened at Wonderboompoort police station in Pretoria, and the matter is under investigation.\n\nFamily members of the murdered victim described Shawn as a humble young man, who was deeply in love with the woman he met in Pretoria in December.\n\nI recall vividly that the love relationship between my cousin Shawn and her girlfriend (name withheld by IOL) started on a high. They seemed to be deeply in love with each other. I can tell you with certainty that Shawn really loved the woman and would do many things to show his love. The two quickly moved in together after they met in December, Shawns uncle, Everton Wazara, spoke to IOL.\n\nShawn Wazara during happier times with her girlfriend. Image: IOL\n\nThe two moved into an apartment in Mayville, in Pretoria. However, the woman maintained another romantic relationship with another man, who later showed up at the apartment on Saturday around midnight and (allegedly) brutally killed my cousin.\n\nRight now, Shawns mother is inconsolable since we broke the news to her. She has been crying nonstop. I do not know what I will say to my sister, he said.\n\nEverton said the relationship between Shawn and his girlfriend had started off promising, but cracks soon appeared.\n\nOn Saturday, I am told Shawn visited her girlfriends workplace, a popular pub in Pretoria. She works as a bartender. They later went to their home, but there was an argument between the couple, with Shawn asking her where her phone was. The context is that Shawn had somehow become informed about the other boyfriend. The lady insisted she had left her phone at work, Everton narrated.\n\nAs the fight escalated, the girlfriend contacted her other boyfriend, who then rushed to the scene. The man rocked up on a bike, just before midnight on Saturday, and the lady went out to talk to him. The man was insisting on taking the woman away. As someone who truly loved the woman, Shawn also went out in an effort to persuade the woman, but that was when he was repeatedly stabbed. He had several deep stab wounds.\n\nEverton described the murder scene as devastating.\n\nEven though I knew the girlfriend well and had maintained contact with her, from the early days of the relationship, I am still asking myself why she never contacted me, as a representative of the family, to alert us that Shawn had been brutally murdered. We only became aware of the death from a Facebook post made by (socialite and Gauteng-based lawyer) Moreboys Munetsi, who was looking for family members of a murdered man.\n\nRight now, we are appealing for justice for Shawn. He did not deserve to be killed like an animal. For what? Some witnesses saw everything taking place. We are grateful for the work done by the South African Police Service (SAPS) detective so far, who has also been supportive in our quest for answers. We will be in court today (Thursday) so that we can come face to face with the killer, he said.\n\nEmmanuel Mahamba was run over by a Ford Ranger, and killed in Rivonia, Sandton, earlier this year Image: Supplied\n\nIn April,IOL published another story of Emmanuel Mahamba, who was brutally murdered in a horrific incidentthat sent shockwaves in South Africa.\n\nIn the video, widely shared on social media, Mahamba is seen seated on the road while a Ford Ranger runs over him repeatedly. He died at the scene.\n\nIn a previous update, Gauteng police said they were still searching for the motorist implicated in the brutal death of a man following a heated dispute, linked to a love triangle.\n\nMahambas murder attracted international news headlines, with many social media users expressing shock over the gratuitous violence and murder.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nPrimary and Secondary Education Minister Torerayi Moyo says his ministry has given unregistered schools until December 31, 2025, to regularise their operations or risk closure.\n\nResponding to questions in Parliament during a Wednesday Question and Answer session, Moyo said government had extended a four-month grace period for illegal private schools and colleges to comply.\n\nHe explained that authorities were cautious not to disadvantage learners who had already registered for examinations, hence the extension to the end of the year or early 2026.\n\nZanu PF legislator for Mt Pleasant, George Mashavave, had asked whether government had a policy framework to monitor and regularise the mushrooming of unregistered schools and colleges across the country.\n\nMoyo confirmed the existence of such a framework and stressed the need to act carefully.\n\nWe have given illegal schools a grace period of four months because we did not want to close them haphazardly, as this would disadvantage learners and violate their fundamental right to education.\n\nI want to assure this august House that very soon in November, or perhaps early next year, we may extend to January 2026. Come January, however, those schools still operating illegally and failing to regularise will be closed, said Moyo.\n\nThe minister admitted that unregistered schools were mushrooming countrywide but insisted that the ministrys Schools Psychological Services and Special Needs Education (SPPRS) department was responsible for school registration and providing technical advice to prospective investors.\n\nHe said circulars had already been sent out warning directors of illegal schools.\n\nI have made a clarion call to those directors of illegal schools to regularise their operations or face penalties at our disposal. All schools that are not registered are operating illegally. While we have avoided immediate closures to protect learners, the grace period expires on December 31, after which circulars will be enforced, and closures implemented, he added.\n\nMoyo also highlighted the governments progress in addressing the countrys school infrastructure deficit.\n\nAccording to a 2022 survey, Zimbabwe required 3,000 additional schools. Since then, more than 600 have been constructed.\n\nFrom 2022 to date, we have built over 600 schools. This year alone, we are targeting at least 200 more, he said.\n\nHowever, Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) MP Ellen Shiriyedenga argued that the school deficit could be fuelling the growth of illegal institutions.\n\nWe were told there is a deficit of 3,000 schools. This gap may be the reason for mushrooming schools, as children should not have to walk long distances. How far has the ministry gone in addressing this deficit? she asked.\n\nOther MPs raised concerns about exploitation, quality of education, and adherence to government policy in unregistered institutions.\n\nZanu PF legislator Clemence Chiduwa questioned whether private schools were being monitored to ensure local languages were taught at primary level.\n\nIn response, Moyo said this was precisely why government insisted on registration.\n\nOur policy is clear, schools must regularise so that we can monitor compliance, including adherence to curriculum and language policy. As it stands, we do not know what is happening in many backyards where illegal schools exist. That is why registration is critical, he said.\n\n",
