            "content": "It has been a disappointing period for fans of Mexican soccer, as the premier soccer gaming option hasnt had the licensing rights for the Liga MX since FIFA 22.\n\nThe leagues absence has been a big miss for gamers, especially those that wish to play as some of the major teams from the region such as Club America and Tigres.\n\nHowever, there could yet be good news on the horizon for Liga MX fans as the competition is set toreturn to the EA Sportsfranchise in time to be included in the upcoming release later this year.\n\nPrevious Partnership Ends\n\nThe reason for Liga MXs exclusion from recent EA releases is due to the competitions ongoing partnership with Konami, meaning that it was only able tofeature in theeFootballseries.\n\nThat has been a major blow for fans of the competition, especially considering that the quality of the Konami titles has diminished compared to the offerings provided by EA Sports throughout modern history.\n\nHowever, it was revealed on the site of the eFootball series that Liga MX is no longer listed as an official partner for the title, which signals the end of their three-year agreement.\n\nWhile it has not yet been officially announced that the competition will return to the EA series, there is an expectancy that one of the worlds most popular leagues will once again feature in the worlds most popular soccer gaming title.\n\nWhy is Liga MX So Important?\n\nThe absence of Liga MX clubs in the EA Sports game would have been felt by the developer, especially considering the popularity of the competition across the Americas. The Mexican league is very popular in Americas, as you can see in mostLiga MX betting apps.\n\nWith no Liga MX clubs licensed, sales of the game in Mexico have diminished, with many fans opting to instead play as their favorite clubs in the eFootball series. Gaining licensing rights for the competition is vitally important for the long-term success of the EA Sports game, as the tournament is one of the most followed across the Americas.\n\nThat is reflected by the fact that Liga MX is second to only the Premier League in terms of average viewing figures in the United States. Not only that, but the atmospheric stadiums available to players in Mexico offer players a unique environment to play matches.\n\nThere are also important factors that should be considered when it comes to the stadium licenses, as EA FC will have the rights to include all major arenas that will be used for next summers World Cup. However, the title of the competition will need to be different due to the ending of the agreement between EA Sports and FIFA.\n\nWhen Was Liga MX Last in an EA Sports Game?\n\nIt has been a long wait for Liga MX fans, as the competition hasnt been included an EA Sports series since FIFA 2022. The absence was felt by fans in the proceeding years, as it greatly reduced the number of teams available to players.\n\nHowever, its return is likely to appease the vast majority of gamers that like to experience and play with new teams that they wouldnt typically come across. It is also a further reminder that EA Sports are committed to offering the most authentic and comprehensive soccer gaming experience to their customers.\n\nOther Teams That Will Miss Out on EA FC 26\n\nThere will be a host of teams that will miss out on being included in the upcoming release of EA FC 26. Among those include teams that have been relegated from the bottom available tiers in the title. That includes English clubs such as Carlisle United and Morecambe.\n\nHowever, Barnet will replace one of the teams following their promotion from the National League. Two of the biggest teams in world soccer will also be likely to be missing in the title this year. EA has been missing Italian teams in recent editions of the title, and once again, it appears unlikely that either Inter Milan or AC Milan will be licensed in time to feature in the 2026 title.\n\nWith the World Cup fast approaching, there will also be major concerns that some of the biggest national teams in the world are also not licensed. The most notable of those is Brazil, who havent been licensed in the EA Sports series since FIFA 23.\n\nBelgium was unlicensed in EA FC 25, but featured in the previous edition of the title. Other nations that could make the World Cup but are unlikely to be licensed in time for the release this year include Australia, Canada, China, and Turkey. The latter of the nations hasnt featured in an EA Sports series title since FIFA 2021.\n\nWhen is EA FC 26 Released?\n\nSoccer fans still face a lengthy wait before the upcoming title in the EA Sports series is released, as EA FC 26 isnt set to hit shelves until late September.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nChief Justice Luke Malaba on Wednesday encouraged the judicial officers to embrace technological advancements.\n\nMalaba said individuals lacking basic computer skills have no place in Zimbabwes judiciary at a time when the world is evolving technologically.\n\nThis urgent call for proficiency arose during the ongoing public interviews conducted by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) for candidates vying for the post of Labour Court judges.\n\nThe JSC has implemented the internet-based Integrated Electronic Case Management System (IECMS), designed to streamline the digital management of court cases.\n\nTo effectively utilise this system, users must possess devices such as laptops, computers, tablets, and smartphones, along with reliable internet access.\n\nThey must also complete a registration process and receive adequate training on the IECMS platform.\n\nMalabas scrutiny fell on local lawyer Joseph Masango, who was applying for the Labour Court judge position.\n\nThe Chief Justice criticised Masangos apparent lack of initiative in keeping up with necessary skills, revealing that he had scored a zero on a test integral to the selection process.\n\nWhen Malaba inquired about Masangos computer literacy, the lawyer confidently affirmed his ability.\n\nHowever, when confronted with his test score, Masango attributed his failure to a lack of experience with IECMS, as his cases had not reached higher courts.\n\nIECMS is now a critical component in the justice system. How can you be a law officer without knowledge of using IECMS, especially since it was introduced back in 2022? Malaba remarked.\n\nYou cant pursue such a post when you score zero in a crucial test meant to prepare you for this role. All lawyers should know how to use the IECMS.\n\nHe continued to express his disappointment, saying, There is a component of laxity in you Your attitude toward IECMS is worrying. We cannot understand why a senior lawyer like you doesnt know these things or seems indifferent to the changes occurring not just in Zimbabwes judicial space but globally.\n\nIn response, Masango vowed to amend his approach if granted the position.\n\nI will never do that again. If I am given the post, I will change that attitude and put my all into this job, he said.\n\nMy CV shows that I have not been stagnant; Ive received promotions because my supervisors were satisfied with my performance. If there was laxity in my work, clients would have reported me to the Law Society. Im a go-getter, and I adhere to ethical conduct.\n\nThe JSC is interviewing 28 candidates who are competing for eight positions on the Labour Court bench. The process began on Tuesday. Initially, the commission received 53 nominations, but following a review, six submissions were invalidated, and two were withdrawn.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, 45 candidates participated in the first-level examination, with 28 qualifying for the final interviews.\n\nThe panel of interviewers includes Malaba, his deputy, Elizabeth Gwaunza, Attorney General Virginia Mabhiza, Judge President Mary Zimba Dube, and Chief Magistrate Vongai Guuriro Muchuchuti, among others.\n\n",

Mhlanga, a first-year law student, and another University of Zimbabwe Economics student were denied the opportunity to sit for their examinations while in custody, whilst inmates experienced inhumane living conditions, mostly due to overcrowding.\n\nPrison cells designed for 35 inmates were reportedly holding more than 80, leading to unsanitary and degrading living conditions.\n\nSeveral detainees raised allegations of police abuse during their arrests, including physical violence and theft of personal belongings.\n\nThe commission revealed there were 66 irregular migrants of different nationalities whose detention was in violation of their rights, as they were not facing any criminal charges and were not awaiting trial.\n\nZHRC urged relevant authorities to take immediate action to prioritise urgent bail applications, conduct thorough investigations into allegations of police misconduct and ensure accountability for any abuses.\n\nThe Commission called for improved prison conditions, reduced crowds, restoration ofcommunication facilities, and access to adequate medical care for all detainees.\n\nPrison officers were urged to desist from imprisoning irregular migrants whose issues should be handled without resorting to indefinite detention.\n\nInmates were advised to report any complaints to the Officer In Charge, who indicated that he was ready to receive reports of assaults by prison officers and bullying by fellow inmates.\n\n",

It would have been a release for us not to make that visit because we are aware that Parliament is where it started. Parliament is where the Constitution was made and where that provision, Section 210 of the Constitution, was created, which enables us as the Commission to investigate cases of misconduct or violations of the Constitution by members of the security services, that is the Army, the CIO, the prison service and the police.\n\nIts mainly cases of assaults by police officers and allegations of abuse of our office, and those are the main cases, and also delays in handling of our cases when reports are made to the police about violations,Chinamora said.\n\nChinamora also highlighted that the Commission had received tremendous support from the President in the form of offices being sequenced to it from the Office of the President and Cabinet and support from the Public Service Commission (PSC).\n\nWe are also informing the Speaker that we have made a draft of the regulations which set out the procedure for receiving complaints, investigating complaints and ending the hearings when they do come to us. So, we are telling them that we did our own draft as a Commission, and we presented it to the Attorney General, and the drafters are now working on it, so that the draft crystallises into a statutory instrument.\n\nWe also got support from the Speaker himself, with very invaluable suggestions that we have a retreat with senior officers for the top brass of the Security Services, so that we build that trust which is required, and that will help us in terms of preventing the actual making of complaints if the top brass knows how to avoid cases of misconduct, how to avoid mistakes which generate the mistakes.\n\n",
