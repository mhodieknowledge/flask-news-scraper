It amounted to little more than a stay-away, punctuated by a few isolated flash demonstrations in the capital.\n\nIn a press briefing yesterday, Muswere implored Zimbabweans to remain united and pay no heed to Gezas shutdown appeals.\n\nWe must remain united against cyber terrorism and enemies of progress. We have a responsibility to build our country. Zimbabweans should utilise the internet for development.\n\nWe should continue to ignore calls from unproductive charlatans and merchants of falsehoods who seek to reverse the gains of the liberation struggle through demonisation of Zimbabwes image, its people and leadership through misinformation and malice, he said.\n\nIn his Saturday night address, delivered from an undisclosed location, Geza, who was wearing military garb, called on Zimbabweans to stay at home in protest against Mnangagwas misrule.\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, the 22nd and 23rd of April 2025, everyone must stay home. We must shut down Zimbabwe completely. This is to send a strong message to Mnangagwa and his zvigananda.\n\nShops and industries will not open and kombis will be parked. The police will not tear gas you, but if they ever come to you, you have the right to defend yourselves, Geza said.\n\nThe ex-combatant, who has been on the police wanted list since early February, also assured the 95 protesters arrested March 31 in Harare, and Heart and Soul Television and Radio (HSTV) journalist Blessed Mhlanga, that they will be released from prison soon.\n\nGeza told Zimbabweans that the writing is on the wall, claiming that Mnangagwa will soon be out of office.\n\nAddressing delegates at the 45th Independence celebration in Gokwe last Friday, Mnangagwa, without naming Geza directly, urged Zimbabweans to ignore instigators on social media, which Geza has been using to communicate with the public.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHIGH Court judge Justice Esther Muremba has finally released her detailed judgement in the case of a Chinese national jailed 30 years for killing a miner in Zhombe and also for attempted murder and assault.\n\nCai Yulong was slapped with a 20-year jail term in September last year, but the judge issued an extempore ruling.\n\nYulong, the owner of Stone Steel Mine also known as Blue Mine in Zhombe, fatally shot Goni Goni after accusing him and his colleagues of encroaching into his mine on May 24 last year.\n\nHe also attempted to kill John Muchawaya Bera by shooting him once on the right knee and once on the left thigh, before he unlawfully struck Lovemore Mapfanya with a clenched fist.\n\nHe was convicted on all counts.\n\nYulong, who was in the country on a Temporary Work Permit, had pleaded not guilty to all the charges.\n\nIn his defence, the accused did not dispute shooting the deceased in the murder charge and the complainant in the attempted murder charge.\n\nHe claimed that his actions were in self-defence and in defence of his property.\n\nRegarding the assault charge, the accused stated that it was fabricated.\n\nHowever, the court ruled that his defence was weak.\n\nThe court heard that on the fateful day, the deceased, the complainant and their colleagues who were employed by Blackhand 10 Mine were working underground erecting the barricade.\n\nIt was heard the accused entered his mine using his shaft and proceeded to the intersection between the two mines. A confrontation ensued between the accused and the Blackhand 10 Mine workers, during which the accused shot at them.\n\nIn her ruling, Muremba said there was no justification for what Yulong did.\n\nIn this case, the offence of murder is further aggravated by the fact that the accused shot the deceased and his colleagues as they were fleeing for their lives.\n\nEven if it were accepted that the deceased and his colleagues were illegally panning for gold in the accuseds mine, the accused had no right to shoot them while they were running away.\n\nThe sanctity of human life must be upheld, and the accuseds actions demonstrate a cold-blooded killing.\n\nThe accused intentionally killed the deceased, and the deceaseds father provided a victim impact statement indicating the profound trauma caused by his sons death.\n\nThe father, who had expected his 23-year-old son to marry and provide him with grandchildren, was devastated by the unnatural and violent nature of his death, she said.\n\nThe judge also said the deceased was also the breadwinner for his family, and his loss has left them facing significant financial and emotional challenges.\n\nThe father had expressed a desire for the death penalty to be imposed, while the State has prayed for a sentence of 40 years imprisonment.\n\nIn relation to the charge of attempted murder, the accused used a firearm to shoot the complainant twice in both legs, causing serious injuries.\n\nWhen he was shooting the complainant, he was actually holding his legs to make sure that he would not escape.\n\nWhilst the doctors report states that there will not be permanent injury, we noted that the complainant was still walking with the aid of crutches when he came to court to testify, the judge said.\n\nDuring trial his right leg was still in plaster.\n\nThe complainant was shot while running away, and the victim impact statement reveals the profound pain and trauma he has endured.\n\nHe lost a workmate during the shooting and remains deeply affected by the incident. He is still nursing his injuries and is unable to provide for his family as the breadwinner.\n\nThe complainant has no hope of returning to the mining industry due to his inability to perform heavy duties, the judge noted.\n\nThe judge said the statutory penalty for attempted murder committed in aggravating circumstances is 20 years imprisonment up to death.\n\nShe said the presumptive penalty for attempted murder committed under such circumstances is five years imprisonment, but given the severity of the offence, a higher penalty is warranted.\n\nThe accused exhibited a high degree of cruelty by holding the complainant with one hand while shooting him in the back of his legs, completely disabling him from walking.\n\nThe court agrees with the States submission for a sentence of 10 years imprisonment.\n\nHowever, to avoid an excessive overall sentence, five years of this sentence will be suspended for five years on the condition that the accused does not commit an offence involving violence on the person of another during this period, she said.\n\nShe said the effective sentence for attempted murder will be five years imprisonment, which we will order to run concurrently with the sentence for murder.\n\nFor the first count Yulong was jailed 30 years.\n\nFor count two, he was jailed 10 years imprisonment of which five years imprisonment was suspended for 5 years on condition the accused does not within that period commit an offence involving violence on the person of another and for which upon conviction he is sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine.\n\nHe effectively sentenced to five years for the count.\n\nThis effective sentence of five years imprisonment will run concurrently with the sentence for murder.\n\nFor assault, Yulomg was fined US$100 in default of payment he will serve one month imprisonment.\n\n",

Matthew 25:40\n\nAs we celebrate 45 years of independence, we must remember that true freedom is not just about political liberation but also about economic empowerment. Unfortunately, many Zimbabweans are struggling to make ends meet, living on less than a dollar a day, and civil servants earn far below the poverty datum line.\n\nFor the needy will not always be forgotten, and the hope of the poor will not perish forever.  Psalm 9:18\n\nWe implore our political leadership to value the lives of the majority, to prioritize their economic well-being, and to take concrete actions to alleviate poverty. Hunger and poverty can cause disharmony in communities and harden souls.\n\nWe pray that our government authorities will take the economic situation of its citizens seriously, that they will value the lives of the poor and vulnerable, and that they will work towards creating a more just and equitable society.\n\nRighteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.  Proverbs 14:34\n\nLET US PRAY:\n\nDear Lord, we come before you today, asking that you guide our leaders to prioritize the economic well-being of their citizens.\n\nMay they value the lives of the poor and vulnerable, and may they work towards creating a more just and equitable society.\n\nAs long as our people are hungry and unhappy, our country cannot enjoy true happiness. We ask that you give our leaders wisdom, compassion, and courage to take action today and the time is now.\n\nAMEN.\n\n",
