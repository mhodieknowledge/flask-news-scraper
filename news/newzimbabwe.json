            "content": "By DD News\n\nZIMBABWE has recorded a rise in AIDS-related deaths in the first half of this year, Health and Child Care Minister Douglas Mombeshora said on Friday.\n\nAddressing a media workshop on HIV reporting and stigma reduction in the capital Harare, Mombeshora stated that between January and June 2025, the country recorded 5,932 AIDS-related deaths, up from 5,712 during the same period last year.An increase of 220 deaths is a reminder that our work is not done, he said, without specifying the main cause behind the rise.The minister noted that while Zimbabwe has made significant strides in combating HIV/AIDS  particularly in achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets  the gains remain fragile and are threatened by multiple challenges, including limited resources, stigma, and discrimination.As a nation, we must confront these realities with honesty and resolve. Addressing stigma and discrimination is not only a moral obligation; it is a public health imperative, he said.Zimbabwe is now seeking to transition to full domestic financing for its HIV and AIDS response amid declining external funding, Mombeshora said.During this transition, the country is facing difficulties in maintaining outreach staff and ensuring continuity of community-based services, according to a report by Xinhua.Operational adjustments are being made to safeguard service delivery, he added, stressing the need for innovation, stronger domestic partnerships, and a resilient, self-sustaining national response to the epidemic.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) attacks the bodys immune system, specifically the white blood cells, weakening the bodys defense against infections and diseases. If untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), the most advanced stage of the infection.HIV is transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk, and can also be passed from mother to child. It is not spread through casual contact like kissing, hugging, or sharing food.The disease can be prevented and managed through antiretroviral therapy (ART). Without treatment, HIV can take years to develop into AIDS.\n\nAddressing a media workshop on HIV reporting and stigma reduction in the capital Harare, Mombeshora stated that between January and June 2025, the country recorded 5,932 AIDS-related deaths, up from 5,712 during the same period last year.\n\nAn increase of 220 deaths is a reminder that our work is not done, he said, without specifying the main cause behind the rise.The minister noted that while Zimbabwe has made significant strides in combating HIV/AIDS  particularly in achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets  the gains remain fragile and are threatened by multiple challenges, including limited resources, stigma, and discrimination.As a nation, we must confront these realities with honesty and resolve.

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week, we want to discuss what happens on the ground or in reality when a person dies without a will.\n\nVM: A person can die without a will and in some instances, they may have drafted a will but the will is considered invalid, possibly for lack of formality; in either event, the person is deemed to have died intestate.\n\nIn such circumstances, there is normally a conflict among family members on what law applies, whether it is customary law or statutory law. In situations where the person is of means, that is, if the person has acquired assets in their lifetime or is considered rich, you will always find family members who consider it apt to apply customary law, which is then interpreted in a skewed manner leaning towards self  aggrandizement motivated by greed.\n\nIf I may put it in more palatable words, family and friends usually feel entitled to benefit from whatever contribution they may have made in the deceaseds lifetime, that contribution has to then be compensated by acquiring some of the estate assets to the obvious detriment of the eligible and deserving beneficiaries.\n\nWhat is disconcerting is that in several such situations, some relatives have indeed benefited and deprived the deserving beneficiaries of their inheritance, whether by coercion, force or undue influence. This is common in cases where the beneficiaries are too young to fight for themselves.\n\nOne would think that the greed is only from relatives, but you will be surprised by claims that are lodged by friends and even business acquaintances, aimed at getting whatever they can get from the estate, especially where they assume that there are plenty of assets in the estate.\n\nIf you want to study unadulterated human nature, watch the reactions of family and friends when a person of means passes away.\n\nReporter:What law applies and how or who is considered a beneficiary in terms of that law?\n\nVM: Our statutory law has made provision to address such instances where a person dies without a will or where the will was considered invalid. Aspects of customary law is blended in practice with our statutory law.\n\nThe overarching intention of our statutory law is to protect the spouse and children of the deceased so that they are also not left economically orphaned.\n\nThat being said, the spouse and children are prioritised in the distribution of the estate; in the event that there is no spouse and children, then the estate is passed on to the deceaseds parents. In the absence of a spouse, children and parents, the siblings and extended family may inherit.\n\nReporter: Are there circumstances when this statutory approach does not achieve favourable outcomes?\n\nVM: Well, that question really depends on what side of the table one is sitting on. I will give one or two examples where there were unfavourable outcomes for one side. It is open for a person to decide whether its a favourable or an unfavourable outcome.\n\nThe law is clear that the surviving spouse is entitled to solely benefit the house and household goods and effects that the surviving spouse used immediately with the deceased spouse before the loss of life. In this particular case, I will give, the house was a large farm under title deeds, the deceased spouse had recently married the surviving spouse after divorcing a long-time partner. The new spouse had her own daughter with another man who was active in the daughters life. At the farm, the grown sons of the deceased also stayed on another part of the farm\n\nThe question in the estate was who would own the farm? The surviving spouse claimed it as the matrimonial home and it was awarded to her by the Master. The effect of this award was that the farm was to be registered in her name and on her death, would go into her estate. Her only beneficiary at the time would be her daughter. This means that the property or legacy had shifted completely from one family to another. The remaining sons argued that their father was big on legacy and this was never his intention.\n\nReporter: That is a lot to take. What other situations can have detrimental consequences for a potential beneficiary?\n\nVM: Well, if we remain on the spouse issue, the spouse is entitled to the house and household goods and a childs share of the remaining estate after expenses relating to the distribution of the estate are subtracted. The childs share is calculated as the number of children the deceased sired, then adding the surviving spouse and dividing each beneficiary as a fraction of the total beneficiaries. In simple terms, if there are 4 children plus a surviving spouse, the childs share will be one-fifth.\n\nOur constitution prescribes that children are children and none should be disadvantaged because they were born out of wedlock. I know of a case where the surviving spouse was expecting a significant portion of the estate on the death of her husband. Unbeknownst to her, the deceased had sired over 15 children out of the marriage, making the total potential beneficiaries over 20, dissipating the hopes of the surviving spouse in benefiting an economic portion of the estate, which she alleged they had accumulated together.\n\nAs I stated before, the outcomes have differing views depending on who is benefiting and who has been deprived of benefits.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima. We have to end here because of the time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

The teenager struck Brian Bennet flush on the helmet, which forced the Zimbabwean opener to retire hurt with concussion on 19. Prince Masvaure was the concussion substitute.Maphaka also struck Williams with a searing bouncer, but the veteran brushed it off to continue his fine innings.The left-hander was much more fluent against the spin of Keshav Maharaj, often skipping down the pitch to dispatch the Proteas stand-in skipper over midwicket.His celebration upon reaching three-figures was particularly special with Williams screaming in delight and punching the air.Unfortunately for Williams, and Zimbabwe, he did not have much support apart from skipper Craig Ervines 36 with allrounder Wiaan Mulder running through the middle-order with figures of 4/50.Ervine was Maharajs 200th Test victim.Maharaj had the last laugh, though, with the wily left-arm spinner flummoxing Williams with a well-flight delivery. With Williams stretching forward, and missing the delivery, it proved Proteas wicket-keeper Kyle Verreynne to whip off the bails in a flash to bring about the end of a wonderful innings by the hometown hero.Yusuf chipped in with a further wicket towards the end before Maharal also picked up his third of the innings as Zimbabwe were bowled out for 251  a deficit of 167.The Proteas innings once again started poorly with Matthew Breetzke edging Tanaka Chivanga early on, but Tony de Zorzi and Mulder ensured there were no more further alarms as the Proteas built their lead to 216 runs by stumps.First Test, Day 2, StumpsSouth Africa: 418/9 & 49/1 (De Zorzi 22*, Mulder 25*, Chivanga 1/18)Zimbabwe: 251 (Williams 137, Mulder 4/50, Yusuf 3/42, Maharaj 3/70)South Africa lead by 216 runs.\n\nWilliams 137 was the mainstay of Zimbabwes 251 after the Proteas declared on their overnight 418/9.\n\nThe 38-year-old battled through the initial new-ball onslaught after debutant Codi Yusuf picked up his maiden Test wicket in his first over before following it up with another a couple of overs later.Kwena Maphaka may not have tasted success, but the teenager built up a good head of steam.

late strike by Salif Cheya in the 87th minute was all Lloyd Mutasas side needed to walk away with three points.So important was the win for MWOS that it leapfrogged Simba Bhora, who played a 1-1 draw against FC Platinum at Mandava Stadium Saturday.MWOS is now on 37 points, one ahead of Simba Bhora who are second.Meanwhile, at Rufaro Stadium Rodwell Dhlakamas Green Fuel held CAPS United to a nill all draw.Sundays match was the first for Dhlakama, who was appointed on Wednesday last week by the club.For Dhlakama walking away with a point from Rufaro Stadium is confidence booster for his team which has been struggling for consistency before his arrival.For me its a massive result, the confidence of the boys had gone down after last weeks heavy defeat to Triangle.So a draw against a big team like CAPS United will boost the morale, he said.On the other end CAPS United coach Ian Bakala was not happy with the result as stating that his side did not play the way he had planned.We did not perform the way we wanted, but a point is much better looking at where we are.So, for now we just have to take this and focus on the coming game, he said.After Sundays match CAPS United moved to position 11 on the log with 20 points, the same with Green Fuel who are on position 12.In other league match played at Gibbo Stadium, Scottland FC recorded a 0-0 draw against relegation threatened

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nAN economic analyst has urged the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) to be cautious following the decision to halt the sale of gold coins.\n\nIn a statement, RBZ governor Dr John Mushayavanhu informed members of the public that the mop up sale of gold coins had been suspended, with immediate effect, following the successful completion of the exercise.\n\nThe RBZ would like to clarify that this was a sale meant to clear remaining stock and not the minting of new gold coins which had been suspended in April 2024.The latest round of gold coin sales also included coins redeemed by holders, he said.\n\nThe central bank exchequer advised members of the public that future gold coin sales will be undertaken upon accumulation of a sizable quantity from redemptions with gold coins in the market remaining tradable and redeemable.\n\nThe gold coins were introduced by the RBZ in 2022 as an investment avenue for holders of excess local currency, who could easily purchase the bullion coins to store value.\n\nAgainst the backdrop, a respected economist who preferred anonymity warned the RBZ against the decision to block the sale of gold coins arguing the decision exposes the local currency to inflationary pressure.\n\nThese coins eased pressures from the market because they provided a valve to a safe investment instrument. Upon their introduction, several companies avoided flooding the parallel exchange market to pursue the local currency and in a way this maximized currency stability. The RBZ just has to be very careful because apart from sustaining tight liquidity, they have few options in place in the event of shifting such a policy stance, he said.\n\nThe economist said the possibility of loosening the grip on liquidity is very high considering the current pressures mounting from industry which leaves the ZWG currency vulnerable.\n\nSo at some point we are likely to see companies and other individual holders of excess ZWG flooding the foreign exchange market in search of the greenback and such a scenario is very dangerous, he said.\n\nAs at February 2023, gold coins worth ZW$20 billion had been sold with the bulk being snapped up by corporates, in the process contributing towards mopping up of excess liquidity.\n\nIn the same year, several companies and the Insurance Pension Fund (IPEC) reported that gold coins were seen as an investment opportunity by several pension funds which spent ZW$2,29 billion purchasing the investment instruments.\n\nIn the same year, several companies and the Insurance Pension Fund (IPEC) reported that gold coins were seen as an investment opportunity by several pension funds which spent ZW$2,29 billion purchasing the investment instruments.\n\n",

In an apparent sign of a shake-up backstage, the schedule was changed last-minute, according to the original lineup, Enzo Ishall was supposed to close the show early Sunday morning.\n\nNasha Ts, who had been expected to perform earlier, was slotted in at midnight. The Zimdancehall musician appeared to have forced her way onstage, with faint sound, delays and technical mishap, frustrating Tinashe Mutarisi, who was visibly irritated and animated onstage.\n\nThe backstage politics, delays, and chaotic organisation marred the concert. However, gloss could not be taken way from Freeman, Master H, and Killer T, who delivered solid performances.\n\nOnce the performances got underway, numbers gradually grew at the HICC, a significant reason for the young musicians to hold their heads high as they dared to challenge their limits.\n\n",

Night roadblocks and motorised patrols will continue to be carried out throughout the country including highways, said the Home Affairs secretary.\n\nAmong most targeted offenders are pirate taxis colloquially known as mushikashikas, commuter omnibuses and conventional buses, which are causing mayhem in the countrys cities and towns resulting in fatal road accidents.\n\nAlso, the system will target members of the public who cross the streets without following road traffic lights (robots) or pedestrian crossings (jaywalking)\n\nJaywalking will attract a fine, according to Ambassador Faranisi.\n\nDue to the complexity of the system, the police cannot sorely rely on ZINARA or VID infrastructure.\n\nCurrently, the ZRP is leveraging on ZINARA database to track vehicle owners whose vehicles are captured on cameras flouting road rules and regulations in Harare and Bulawayo Central Business Districts (CBD), Faranisi told the committee chaired MP Tawanda Karikoga.\n\n",
