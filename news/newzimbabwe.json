            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nSouth African authorities have started auctioning the property of Marry Mubaiwa, the ex-wife of Vice President Constantino Chiwenga to compensate victims of financial crimes she allegedly committed years ago, an official has announced.\n\nThe property in Pretoria is suspected to be linked to illicit activities.\n\nThe National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe announced the development in a statement on Monday.\n\nIn a gesture against transactional financial crime, the South African High Court had declared Mubaiwas luxury immovable property located at ERF 191 Sterrewag, Extension 3, and two Land Rovers as assets that should be forfeited to the South African state in December 2022.\n\nThese assets had been placed under a preservation order since February 9 2022, due to their alleged connection to proceeds from crimes such as money laundering and illicit financial flows.\n\nThe High Court ordered that the said properties be placed under the custody of an auctioneer, with proceeds of the public sale to be directed towards compensating the victim(s) of the offence.\n\nOne of the forfeited vehicles was recently auctioned with the proceeds set to be transferred to the victim, announced the NPA.\n\nThe NPA also said this case is a landmark demonstration of the strength and efficacy of cross-border legal cooperation within the Southern African Development Community (SADC).\n\nThe outcome reflects the enduring partnership between the NPA of South Africa and its Zimbabwean counterpart in addressing transnational financial crimes and the recovery of proceeds of crime, reads the statement.\n\nDocuments show that South Africas NPA on October 14 2021, received a request for Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) for Zimbabwe against Mubaiwa.\n\nZACC Commissioner Frank Muchengwa told South African authorities the anti-graft body had received information from a whistleblower that Mubaiwa had fraudulently exported funds to South Africa to buy some properties.\n\nIt is alleged that Mubaiwa instructed Memory Chakulinga, her relative and Managing Director of her two companies in SA, Falcon Project Pty and Bonnets Electrical Pty in Pretoria, to raise proforma invoices for the purchase of event tents and chairs and prepaid meters.\n\nMuchengwa said the invoices would then be referred to the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe (CBZ) as if they specifically intended to purchase the goods, but the funds were allegedly diverted to purchase her personal properties.\n\nChakulinga states further that Mubaiwa is her aunt and she recalls Mubaiwa approaching her to assist in setting up a business in South Africa, as she indicated that she had won a tender in Zimbabwe. Chakulinga also allegedly said Mubaiwa had told her that she had the facility to get money from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for funding the business, Muchengwa said.\n\nChakulinga allegedly offered assistance with a place to open a business at her premises.\n\nShe was then asked to do proforma invoices in the name of Tanor Investment for the supply of event hosting accessories, tents for R203 308 and the invoices had Mubaiwas Falcon Suppliers FNB bank accounts.\n\nCourt papers show that in December 2018, R203,308 was deposited into the account from CBZ and according to the narration, it was intended for the purchase of tents.\n\nAccording to Chakulinga, upon receipt in her account the funds, Mubaiwa instructed her to divert the funds towards purchase of Range Rover at Menlyn in Pretoria, reads court papers.\n\nChakulinga states that she paid R4 million to Range Rover Menlyn and she was told by Mubaiwa that the motor vehicle was to be taken to Zimbabwe but to her surprise, it was registered in South Africa under Marry Mubaiwa.\n\nIn May, according to Chakulinga, another R2 million was deposited into Bonnette Electrical FNB account and she was called by the bank to confirm the receipt of the funds.\n\nShe did what she had been instructed to do before but this time on the invoices indicated she was to buy electrical prepaid meters.\n\nChakulinga added that after the release of the funds, Mubaiwa ordered her to transfer R4 96 500 to the Martin Potgieter Trust Account at Standard Bank.\n\nAccording to Muchengwa, there was a financial flow from CBZ to FNB that was detected on the accounts.\n\nIt was established that one of the signatories at Mubaiwas East Town Commodities was Jeffery Jenje and he allegedly confirmed this.\n\nJenje also confirmed payments that were made and also that Mubaiwa indeed purchased two vehicles.\n\nProof of vehicle purchase was provided by Jacobus Hercules Du Preez.\n\nDu Preez said Mubaiwa bought two vehicles worth R1,6 million and R1,8 million, respectively.\n\nThe ongoing investigations also revealed that Mubaiwa bought a house by sourcing cash from individual companies to purchase on her behalf.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nZimbabwean beverage giant, Delta Corporation, is experiencing contrasting fortunes in its regional markets after it battled labour disruptions in South Africa and recorded brisk business for its lager beer volumes back home, driven by tobacco sales and resurgent gold prices.\n\nIn South Africa, Deltas subsidiaryUnited National Breweriesvolumes fell by 8% in the quarter to the end of June.\n\nDeltas company secretary, Faith Musinga, said United National Breweries witnessed someunfortunate disruptions from labour unions andpressure groupsin South Africaduring the quarterunder review.However, she said this has now been resolved.\n\nIn contrast, Delta said it has been experiencing significant changes to market channelsarising from the informal sector growth,operational pressures in formal retail sectors as well as varied application of route-to-marketregulations in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe company also had to operate against the currency exchangerate related price distortions and challenges facing the formal retail channelsin Zimbabwe.\n\nNonetheless, signs of strong consumer spending driven by what the company described as stability in the local currency exchange rate, a record-breaking tobacco marketing season and increased gold mining activity helped drive up volumes in Zimbabwe.\n\nDiaspora remittances are benefiting fromthe firming cross exchange rates such as the randand pound, our key source markets. The pricingdistortions arising from exchange rate disparitieshave moderated following the promulgation ofrevised exchange controls on pricing, said Musinga.\n\nThis had seen lager beer volumes in Zimbabwe grow by 19% over the previous contrasting quarter. More so, demand has remained strong, benefiting from the increase in consumer incomes and stable pricing.\n\nIn the soft drinks category, where the company has been facing intense competition from the local Pepsi bottler, Delta volumes remained subdued over the quarter to end June. It also blamed the recently imposed high sugar content surtax, saying it was impacting on price competitiveness.\n\nThe surtax had also resulted in theinflux ofsimilar products imported from the region where the sugar tax does not apply. Smuggling is also adding to the woes for Delta.\n\nA total of $4.5 million in sugar tax was paid during the quarter. The prevailing sugartax structure continues to place unsustainable pressure on the viability of the category, said the company.\n\nDespite these challenges, Delta raised overall revenues for the quarter by 25%, mainly as a result ofvolumegrowth in the alcoholic beverage businesses inZimbabwe, helping to offsetthe pricemoderation in the sparkling beverages business.\n\nAbout 85% of Deltas sales volumes were undertaken in US dollar, said the company.\n\nIn a recent securities and advisory research note on Zimbabwes consumer sector, analysts at IH Securities saidthey anticipate an uplift to volumes for consumer-facing companies this year owing to a likely recovery in consumer spend.\n\nHowever, this was against the backdrop of general cost structures continuing to be on the rise corresponding to a volatile policy environment and the crystallization of costs in US dollars.\n\nOn the demand side, private consumption growth,which had slowed down from 4.8% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2024, is expected to have a rosier year with household spending rebounding by 6.6% in 2025, said the report.\n\nZimbabwean consumer discretionary spend, however, remains subdued, with data from Zimstats recently showing average earnings of 55% of the employed population earning less than $100.\n\nWorse still, job losses within the past 3 months emanated mainly those engaged in agriculture and domestic activities, whilst IT and Electricity sectors had the lowest job losses.\n\n",

His service weapon was recovered at the scene.\n\nThe matter is under investigation by SANDF authorities in co-operation with environmental and wildlife officials to determine the exact circumstances surrounding the incident. A formal board of inquiry has been initiated, said Tshabalala.\n\nTshabalala said Raynards next of kin, from Kimberley, Northern Cape, have been formally notified, and psychosocial support is being provided to the family and his unit members.\n\nOperation Corona is a national border safeguarding initiative aimed at combating transnational crimes along the countrys borders.\n\nTshabalala said that soldiers deployed in these operations face harsh terrain, isolation and exposure to unpredictable natural conditions.\n\nLauren Liebenberg from the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve said:At this time of year, the crisis with the elephant populations that roam the Limpopo River Valley intensifies.When elephant hunting starts in the dry season they come across the Limpopo River [into SA] in huge numbers, she said, adding that the elephants neededa well-managed migration corridor.\n\nThe problem extends along the whole length of the 200km strip between Mapungubwe and Kruger National Park. We become a massive human-wildlife conflict zone.\n\nLiebenberg said a programme by the US Agency for International Development to manage the problem collapsed after the US administration cancelled it earlier this year.\n\nThrough the programme, they trained elephant herders and provided all sorts of defence interventions.\n\nDeaths still remain rare and at the extreme end of the human wildlife conflict interface, but the elephants do massive damage to crops, to infrastructure  especially fencing and water infrastructure, and to the natural vegetation in the nature reserves, said Liebenberg.\n\n",

Those ranged from attempting to repay its debts using the proceeds of metal sales and recently approaching 10 nations for help to raise $2.6 billion to pay its arrears.\n\nAjay Banga. Image: Bloomberg\n\nTrying to figure it out on your own, youll be doing this for the next five years, Banga said in an interview in Maputo, Mozambiques capital. They need to figure out a way to reach out to the G20 and say, we raise our hand, wed like to be part of this process.\n\nZimbabwe first defaulted on repayments to the World Bank in 2000. Its debts to a host of multilateral institutions and bilateral lenders mounted amid a failed land-reform program and a quarter century of economic turmoil, shutting it out of international debt markets and limiting its ability to borrow even during the global pandemic and a recent devastating drought.\n\nThe government has asked the African Development Bank to advise on clearing its debt with the institutions outgoing president, Akinwumi Adesina, and former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano asked to negotiate with creditors. It also hired Global Sovereign Advisory, a Paris-based consultancy, to help. The fact that Zimbabwean officials, including President Emmerson Mnangagwa, have been sanctioned by the US has complicated the process.\n\nWhile Belarus, Syria and Eritrea are also in arrears to the World Bank, Zimbabwes default is by far the longest. South Africa, which currently holds the G-20 presidency, last month said it has been approached by Zimbabwe to try and garner the groups support for a debt workout.\n\nZambia, Ghana and Ethiopia are among nations that have employed the G20s Common Framework, which was created in 2020 to help poor nations bring together a diverse set of creditors to restructure debts. While they have made progress in reaching deals, the process has been criticized for being too slow.\n\nZimbabwe isnt technically poor enough to be eligible to utilise the framework, yet Sri Lanka  a nation in a similar situation  approached the group in 2023 for help with dealing with its creditors.\n\nStart talking to the G20 and the Paris Club and whoever else has given them money and we can help, Banga said. We try and bring an understanding of what write down you need to take. It takes a while.\n\nZimbabwes Treasury didnt respond to a request for comment.\n\n",
