            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. We understand you will be part of the team that will be presenting at theZim Diaspora Property Showcase USA-Canadain Dallas, United States of America, on legal issues affecting diasporansin America and Canada when investing in Zimbabwe. What are we to expect?\n\nVM: Firstly, allow me to thank Seeff Zimbabwe for coming up with the idea of this event and executing it. The exchange of ideas at such events is invaluable.\n\nOur experience in Birmingham, United Kingdom, at the Zim Diaspora Property Showcase UK in July last year taught us that the diaspora property market is hungry for one-on-one interactions with the potential Zimbabwe service provider, specifically those in the real estate sector where most of their investments are housed. This allows for a better understanding of each others operating models.\n\nI am sure my colleagues in the real estate sector of Zimbabwe are preparing something special for the USA and Canada markets at this particular showcase. The attendees will be able to access special deals prepared specifically for the showcase, including structured payment options that the diaspora market normally fails to get access to.\n\nReporter:Are you suggesting that they will be specific deals prepared only for the USA-Canada diaspora market?\n\nVM: Yes.The property showcase is not just to showcase our real estate to the diaspora, it is also to expose the diaspora market to our Zimbabwean businesses. It will be negligent as a business person to use a one size fits all approach in all dealings with the local and various markets in the diaspora.\n\nThe attendees from Zimbabwe will also be using it as a fact  finding conference, to understand the market from that part of the world, their interests, considerations and concerns when investing with the aim to tailor make products that are attractive to that market, taking into consideration their specific needs for a mutually beneficial relationship going forward.\n\nMy understanding is that the organizers of the event will also be intentionally exposing the Zimbabwean real estate businesses to the Dallas real estate sector. It is anticipated that sufficient synergies and networks will be created from that exchange.\n\nREAD MORE: The Premier Zimbabwe Diaspora Property Showcase is coming to the USA!\n\nReporter: What can we expect from your presentation on legal issues affecting property investments?\n\nVM: My mandate at the conference is to educate potential investors on the Zimbabwean legal framework, specifically when it comes to investing in the real estate sector. My presentation will cover a variety of issues, example, the property titles that are in Zimbabwe, how to conduct a due diligence on the various property titles, other legal issues that affect your investment in Zimbabwe, if a member of the diaspora, issues to do with Zimbabwe registered marriages, death et cetera.\n\nIf the investors are foreign, we will also discuss the property investment regulatory framework with the aim of ensuring that the investments are safe and protected and also that the investor is able to repatriate capital and profits on disinvestment.\n\nReporter: Will that include how to avoid being duped when investing in property from the diaspora?\n\nVM: That will be one of the topics in the presentation. The overarching aim of the presentation is to safeguard potential buyers against fraudsters. Our economy is in transition, with a lot of real estate developments mushrooming across our cities. There are notable and significant gains in value on existing real estate as a result of this real estate development boom. This creates a lot of opportunities for investors and also fraudsters.\n\nOur local property developers have also been creative in their fundraising initiatives to complete developments when access to mainstream finance is limited. This, however, motivates for thorough due diligence by professionals to ensure that the development financial and legal structures are sound and also that the investor is sufficiently protected.\n\nReporter: How do you engage a lawyer from the diaspora and track your property transaction?\n\nVM: Most of our lawyers across Zimbabwe can be found online if the investor cannot get a lawyer by reference. If in doubt of the lawyers track record, our Law Society of Zimbabwe is available to assist people with various enquiries on the legal practitioners in Zimbabwe.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have to end here because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\nFor those looking to attend the Zim Diaspora Property Showcase USA-Canada, please sign up by connecting with the event organizers atwww.zimpropertyshowcaseusa.com.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mark Wilberforce l BBC\n\nWHEN my mother told me at the age of 16 that we were going from the UK to Ghana for the summer holidays, I had no reason to doubt her.\n\nIt was just a quick trip, a temporary break  nothing to worry about. Or so I thought.\n\nOne month in, she dropped the bombshell  I was not coming back to London until I had reformed and had earned enough GCSEs to continue my education.\n\nI was hoodwinked in a similar way to the British-Ghanaian teenager who recently took his parents to the High Court in London for sending him to school in Ghana.\n\nIn their defence, they told the judge they did not want to see their 14-year-old son become yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\n\nBack in the mid-1990s, my mother, a primary school teacher, was motivated by similar concerns.\n\nI had been excluded from two high schools in the London Borough of Brent, hanging out with the wrong crowd (becoming the wrong crowd)  and heading down a dangerous path.\n\nMy closest friends at the time ended up in prison for armed robbery. Had I stayed in London, I would have almost certainly been convicted with them.\n\nBut being sent to Ghana also felt like a prison sentence.\n\nI can empathise to a degree with the teenager, who said in his court statement that he feels like he is living in hell.\n\nYet, speaking for myself, by the time I turned 21 I realised what my mother had done had been a blessing.\n\nUnlike the boy at the centre of the London court case  which he lost  I did not go to boarding school in Ghana.\n\nMy mother placed me in the care of her two closest brothers, they wanted to keep an eye on me, and it was felt that being around boarders could prove too much of a distraction.\n\nI first stayed with my Uncle Fiifi, a former UN environmentalist, in a town called Dansoman, near the capital, Accra.\n\nThe lifestyle change hit hard. In London, I had my own bedroom, access to washing machines and a sense of independence  even if I was using it recklessly.\n\nIn Ghana, I was waking up at 05:00 to sweep the courtyard and wash my uncles often muddy pick-up truck and my aunts car.\n\nIt was her vehicle that I would later steal  something of a watershed moment.\n\nI did not even know how to drive properly, treating a manual like an automatic and I crashed it into a high-ranking soldiers Mercedes.\n\nI tried to flee the scene. But that soldier caught me and threatened to take me to Burma Camp, the notorious military base where people had disappeared in the past.\n\nThat was the last truly reckless thing I did. It was not just discipline that I learnt in Ghana  it was perspective. Life in Ghana showed me how much I had taken for granted.\n\nWashing clothes by hand and preparing meals with my aunt made me appreciate the effort needed.\n\nFood, like everything in Ghana, required patience. There were no microwaves, no fast-food runs.\n\nMaking the traditional dough-like dish fufu, for example, is laborious and involves pounding cooked yams or cassava into a paste with a mortar.\n\nAt the time, it felt like punishment. Looking back, it was building resilience.\n\nInitially, my uncles considered placing me in high-end schools like the Ghana International School or SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College.\n\nBut they were smart. They knew I might just form a new crew to cause chaos and mischief.\n\nInstead, I received private tuition at Accra Academy, a state secondary school that my late father had attended. It meant I was often taught on my own or in small groups.\n\nLessons were in English, but out of school those around me were often speaking local languages and I found it easy to pick them up perhaps because it was such an immersive experience.\n\nBack home in London, I used to love to learn swear words in my mothers Fante language  but was far from fluent.\n\nWhen I later moved to the city of Tema to stay with my favourite uncle, Uncle Jojo  an agricultural expert, I continued private tuition at Tema Secondary School.\n\nIn contrast to the boy making the headlines in the UK, who claimed Ghanas education system was not up to standard, I found it to be exacting.\n\nI was considered academically gifted in the UK, despite my troublesome ways, but actually found it tough going in Ghana. Students my age were far ahead in subjects like maths and science.\n\nThe rigour of the Ghanaian system pushed me to study harder than I ever had in London.\n\nThe result? I earned five GCSEs with grades C and above  something that once seemed impossible.\n\nBeyond academic achievements, Ghanaian society instilled values that have stayed with me for life.\n\nRespect for elders was non-negotiable. Throughout the neighbourhoods I lived in, you greeted those older than you, regardless of whether or not you knew them.\n\nGhana did not just make me more disciplined and respectful  it made me fearless.\n\nFootball played a huge part in that transformation. I played in the parks, which were often hard red clay with loose pebbles and stones, with two square goalposts fashioned out of wood and string.\n\nIt was a far cry from the neatly maintained pitches in England, but it toughened me up in ways I could not have imagined  and it is no wonder some of the greatest footballers seen in the English Premier League have come from West Africa.\n\nOn Sundays children and teenagers flock to Ghanas beaches to play football\n\nThe aggressive style played in Ghana was not just about skill  it was about resilience and endurance. Getting tackled on rough ground meant picking yourself up, dusting yourself off and carrying on.\n\nEvery Sunday, I played football on the beach  though I would often be late because there was absolutely no way either of my uncles would allow me to stay home instead of attending church.\n\nThose services felt like they lasted forever. But it was also a testament to Ghana as a God-fearing nation, where faith is deeply embedded in everyday life.\n\nThe first 18 months were the hardest. I resented the restrictions, the chores, the discipline.\n\nI even tried stealing my passport to fly back to London, but my mother was ahead of me and had hidden it well. There was no escape.\n\nMy only choice was to adapt. Somewhere along the way, I stopped seeing Ghana as a prison and started seeing it as happy home.\n\nI know of a few others like me who were sent back to Ghana by their parents living in London.\n\nMichael Adom was 17 when he arrived in Accra for school in the 1990s, describing his experience as bittersweet. He stayed until he was 23 and now lives back in London working as a probation officer.\n\nHis main complaint was the loneliness  he missed his family and friends. There were times of anger about his situation and the complications of feeling misunderstood.\n\nThis largely stemmed from the fact that his parents had not taught him or his siblings any of the local languages when growing up in London.\n\nI didnt understand Ga. I didnt understand Twi. I didnt understand Pidgin, the 49-year-old tells me.\n\nThis made him feel vulnerable for his first two-and-a-half years  and, he says, liable to being fleeced, for example, by those increasing prices because he seemed foreign.\n\nAnywhere I went, I had to make sure I went with somebody else, he says.\n\nBut he ended up becoming fluent in Twi and, overall, he believes the positives outweighed the negatives: It made me a man.\n\nMy Ghana experience matured me and changed me for the better, by helping me to identify with who I am, as a Ghanaian, and cemented my understanding of my culture, background and family history.\n\nPatience Wilberforce, a primary school teacher, was determined her son should leave school with qualifications\n\nI can concur with this. By my third year, I had fallen in love with the culture and even stayed on for nearly two more years after passing my GCSEs.\n\nI developed a deep appreciation of the local food. Back in London, I never thought twice about what I was eating. But in Ghana, food was not just sustenance  each dish had its own story.\n\nI became obsessed with waakye  a dish made from rice and black-eyed peas, often cooked with millet leaves, giving it a distinctive purple-brown colour. It was usually served with fried plantain, the spicy black pepper sauce shito, boiled eggs, and sometimes even spaghetti or fried fish. It was the ultimate comfort food.\n\nI enjoyed the music, the warmth of the people and the sense of community. I was not just stuck in Ghana any more  I was thriving.\n\nMy mother, Patience Wilberforce, passed away recently, and with her loss I have reflected deeply on the decision she made all those years ago.\n\nShe saved me. Had she not tricked me into staying in Ghana, the chances of me having a criminal record or even serving time in prison would have been extremely high.\n\nI went on to enrol at the College of North West London aged 20 to study media production and communications, before joining BBC Radio 1Xtra via a mentoring scheme.\n\nThe guys I used to hang out with in north-west London did not get the second chance that I did.\n\nGhana reshaped my mindset, my values and my future. It turned a misguided menace into a responsible man.\n\nWhile such an experience might not work for everyone, it gave me the education, discipline and respect I needed to reintegrate into society when I returned to England.\n\nAnd for that, I am forever indebted to my mother, to my uncles and to the country that saved me.\n\nMark Wilberforce is a freelance journalist based in London and Accra.\n\n",
