            "content": "Business Report\n\nZimbabwean companies are grappling with severe economic challenges, including soaring inflation, a skewed exchange rate, and escalating operational costs, forcing some to retrench workers and others to reduce stock levels.\n\nAmong the hardest hit is Tongaat Huletts Zimbabwean subsidiary, Triangle, which announced job cuts after other cost-saving measures failed. Retailers like OK Zimbabwe are also struggling, with de-stocking becoming a growing concern as businesses navigate the countrys volatile economic landscape.\n\nAn uncertain monetary framework, characterised by run away inflation, a skewed exchange rate and pricing distortions, has left corporates in Zimbabwe battling for survival. Some of them have had to retrench while the retailers are de-stocking.\n\nZimbabwe is already battling a high unemployment rate that has driven droves of locals to seek greener pastures in South Africa and elsewhere on the region and internationally at a time the countrys economic challenges are mounting.\n\nTongaat Huletts Zimbabwean unit, Triangle, said this week that it was facing operational challenges that had forced it to retrench employees after cost cutting measures failed to yield a respite.\n\nThe current economic environment in Zimbabwe has presented unprecedented challenges for Triangle Limited over the past [three] years. After careful deliberation and extensive evaluation of our operational and economic realities, we have made the extremely difficult decision to implement a phased retrenchment process, Tendai Masawi, the managing director of Triangle, said in a note to employees this week.\n\nHe cited escalating operational costs particularly in areas such as fertiliser, fuel, maintenance costs and imported goods/services, combined with inflationary pressures, currency losses, the inability to claim VAT on inputs after sugar was exempted from VAT, and competition from low cost duty-free imported sugar as having severely impacted the companys ability to sustain continued production.\n\nTriangle, which housed Tongaat Huletts Zimbabwean interests that also include Hippo Valley, said it had seen profit margins decline significantly by 55%with manpower costs is spiking by 133% as a proportion of revenue, and debt levels rising to unsustainable levels.\n\nTriangle had thus been unable to generate positive cash flows from its operating activities over the past three years as it had faced a very constrained working capital position.\n\nThese financial realities underscore the urgent need for corrective action so that the business can generate sufficient cash flows to reduce debt and reinvest in its future. This (retrenchment) decision has been taken to protect the long-term sustainability of our organisation and ensure that Triangle Limited continues to play its vital role in Zimbabwes economy, the company said.\n\nTongaat Hulett Limited, is currently preparing to dispose of the Zimbabwe operations to the owners of the Vision Group for about R5.9 billion. The Zimbabwe operations for Tongaat Hulett were among a few stable divisions under the crisis ridden and troubled South African sugar and agro-processing unit that also had operations in Mozambique.\n\nRetailers are equally affected, with OK Zimbabwe and other operators like Choppies reducing stock levels due to policies that mandate local currency transactions despite widespread use of foreign currencies.\n\nDe-stocking levels across most of OK Zimbabwes outlets have raised the alarm and concerns that the company is buckling under Zimbabwes policies that force retailers to trade in local currency against widespread use of foreign currencies in a country battling for currency stability.\n\nIn a statement, OK Zimbabwe acknowledged that it had faced stocking levels over the past few weeks. The company faced intermittent product supply challenges during the festive period. The Company, as well as most of the formal retail sector, has been adversely impacted by a volatile operating environment, said OK Zimbabwe.\n\nMeanwhile, manufacturers like Mega Mart have appealed to government officials for structural reforms to expand the formal sector, which they argue would boost tax revenues and support economic recovery.\n\n",

It must consider that sentence first, it can go down or up.\n\nThese sentencing guidelines tend to be followed. In this case, it provides for two presumptive sentences.\n\nWhere the prejudice is insignificant it can be six months.\n\nWhere the item, funds, or property is of high value or State funds, it will be an aggravating factor.\n\nIf the fraud is committed by an offender who is a holder of a public office, it is an aggravating actor and the court should start from there.\n\nIf it involves public funds, it is an aggravating actor and the court should start from there, he said.\n\nThe judge also criticised lawyers for delaying progress and how Mpofu made his application, noting that he laboured the court with unnecessary submissions.\n\nWhat should be important to a practitioner is to provide facts that there are compelling reasons.\n\nKwenda said the fact that the Constitutional Court took the entire third term of the 2024 judicial year was regrettable, although it was dismissed.\n\nHe said the bail application by Mpofu also did not meet the basic provisions of a bail application.\n\nA bail application is expected to be simple and unemotional presentations of facts supporting ones entitlement to bail, he said.\n\nHe also said some submissions were not persuasive.\n\nThe State had persuaded Kwenda to hold that the two were resisting trial.\n\nProsecutors also said their likelihood of absconding was higher because the legal woes had increased.\n\nKwenda said each case depends on its circumstances.\n\nMy analysis of facts and submissions before me are as follows. Bail matters should be simplehowever, as a profession, we tend to be so obsessed and end up unwittingly infringing upon the matter that will be before a court.\n\nHe further complained about how the court sat for two days only to hear a bail application which was regarded as urgent.\n\nIt was extraordinarythat speed resolution of bail cannot be completed if we take two days on a bail application.\n\nThe simple issue before me was whether the applicants should be granted bail.\n\nA lot of time was lost while parties tussled over what type of an application was before me.\n\nI must criticise both counsels before me. There is no need to give a process like bail application, a name that does not appear in the CPEA Act.\n\nIm just saying to show that we delayed this case for no reason, he said.\n\n",
