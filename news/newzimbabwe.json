            "content": " officer apologised for police forces poor relationship with public\n\n ordered Chinese nationals to leave within 48 hours\n\nBy Leopold Munhende\n\nASSISTANT Inspector Simbarashe Mandizvidza, a rogue member of the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has been arrested after declaring himself the new leader of the police force in a video circulating online.\n\nMandizvidza, who is Member in Charge of the Senior Officers Desk at ZRPs headquarters in Harare, had declared himself its new leader and apologised for their poor relationship with the public, promised a new working relationship and urged Zimbabweans to trust him and his colleagues.\n\nThe ZRP is headed by Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba, who was appointed after the resignation of Godwin Matanga.\n\nBefore Mandizvidzas video had been released, the ZRP was in active pursuit of him after he reportedly hijacked a branded police Ford Range Rover from its headquarters (registration number 033).\n\nOur relationship with the Zimbabwean public has not always been ideal, and for any harm or mistrust caused during the execution of our duties I wish to offer a sincere apology, said Mandizvidza in a 12-minute address that has been shared widely.\n\nWe recognise the importance of building trust and fostering a positive partnership with the communities we serve.\n\nAs of today, the ZRP are committed to serving the people and we pledge to uphold the highest standards of integrity and professionalism.\n\nIn light of recent developments, I am announcing that I will be taking charge of the ZRP with immediate effect, with a focus on empowering young officers to lead and drive positive change within the organisation and country at large.\n\nIn Mandizvidzas address, done in a similar fashion to those shared by war veteran Blessing Bombshell Geza ahead of protests that shook internal security, the non-commissioned officer urged Zimbabweans to forgive past differences, choose to pick up officers at bustops and avoid straining their resources by shunning illegal taxi operators (mushikashika).\n\nPolice officers are rarely picked up by private commuter omnibuses or private vehicles due to a broken-down relationship with the public.\n\nMandizvidza had ordered the Chinese to pack and go so as to allow Zimbabweans to talk.\n\nHe added: I really want to thank the Chinese, they have flooded our communities and taken up mining across the country, but I would like to ask the President (Emmerson Mnangagwa) to allow that they go back to their home within the next 48 hours.\n\nIf they are to be allowed back, they will come back after we have agreed on it as a country.\n\nMandizvidzas arrest was announced by the police late Thursday night in a statement that described him as rogue and his actions treasonous.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police categorically disassociates itself from the treasonous social media videos and statements issued by Assistant Inspector Simbarashe Mandizvidza.\n\nThe errant member has since been arrested and is now facing both disciplinary charges and criminal proceedings.\n\n",

            "content": "NBC News\n\nPriscilla Presleys former business partners accused the rock widow of hastening daughter Lisa Maries death to secure her own spot atop Elvis massive financial kingdom, according to a bombshell lawsuit filed in Los Angeles this week.\n\nPlaintiffs Brigitte Kruse and Kevin Fialko accused Priscilla Presley, the former wife of Elvis Presley, of fraud, breach of contract and other civil misdeeds in a Los Angeles County Superior Court action entered on Monday.\n\nElvis Presley is the King of Rock n Roll,' the lawsuit says. Defendant Priscilla Presley always wanted to the Queen. In fact, despite flaunting a public persona that only wanted to protect and keep her family together, Priscilla ultimately wanted one thing, power, no matter the cost.\n\nPriscilla Presleys attorney Marty Singer disputed the allegations in a two-page statement Thursday.\n\nThis is without a doubt, one of the most shameful, ridiculous, salacious and meritless lawsuits I have seen in my practice, Singer said in a 648-word statement.\n\nThese fabricated claims have absolutely no validity and we are confident this case will be dismissed.\n\nKruse, an auctioneer who specialized in Elvis sales, and Fialko, an Elvis memorabilia collector, said they had been collaborating with Priscilla Presley for years to leverage her name for maximum profits.\n\nBut once Kruse and Fialko got her back on stable financial footing in November 2023, they allege, she abruptly cut ties with them and denied themcompensation from themoviePriscilla.\n\nEarlier that year, the defendants daughter, Lisa Marie, died atage 54.\n\nLisa Marie had been ailing, but Priscilla insisted they attend a Golden Globes event together on Jan. 10 as Priscilla clasped to the spotlight, the lawsuit said.\n\nLisa Marie had collapsed at herhome days earlier and diedofsmall bowel obstruction, the medical examiners office ruled.\n\nPriscilla rushed to West Hills Hospital and despite Lisas clear directive to prolong her life, Priscilla pulled the plug within hours of Lisa being admitted, according to the lawsuit.\n\nPriscilla knew that Lisas death neutralized the threat of Lisas efforts to have Priscilla removed as the sole trustee of Lisas irrevocable life insurance trust and Priscilla ultimately wanted to control the Promenade Trust and Graceland. At her house the week following (before Lisas funeral), Priscilla exclaimed, Im the queen, Im in charge of Graceland. Kruse and Fialko were heartbroken by the unsettling behavior.\n\nSinger, Priscilla Presleys lawyer, said his clients granddaughter Riley Keough stands behind her grandmother 100%.\n\nKeough is equally disgusted with this latest, vicious attempt by Kruse to attempt to ruin her grandmothers life, Singer said.\n\nA rep forKeough, Lisa Maries daughter andPriscillas granddaughter, could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nElvis and Priscilla Presleywere married for six years and divorced in 1973, four years before Elvis died.\n\nPriscilla Presley is now 80, and Elvis was 42 when he died onAug. 16, 1977, at Graceland.\n\n",

My issue is if you go and check attendance, it is showing it seems as if we might be at a position where we are spending more on trips and workshops that are not also having a direct benefit to the Council. For example, you see a report that has three councillors, officials 20. Some of the justifications.\n\nI have been previously attending those workshops, but most of the people during the workshops people will be in rooms, not even contributing to whatever that will be happening, said Ngadziore.\n\nThis is a slap in the face for residents, who are bearing the brunt of the City Councils poor service delivery, often attributed to a lack of funds, while officials attend numerous workshops.\n\nWorkshops have become a feeding trough for council officials, who are reportedly pocketing hefty allowances.\n\nThe City Councils extravagance also became a bone of contention at the Commission of Inquiry, which was investigating the local authoritys governance systems.\n\nIn response, Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume said workshops should be downsized to reduce the burden on the City Council.\n\nLet us look at some of the workshops so that we reduce the cost to the organisation. Let us look at the bottom line as far as that issue is concerned, said Mafume.\n\n",

Plaintiff is legally represented and should be advised on what steps to take to enforce his rights granted by an order of Court.\n\nThe judge also noted that Musara was seeking to have custody of the children awarded to Motsi, making it more appropriate for the Canadian Court to deal with the issue of the maintenance of the minor children.\n\nDismissing the case, Justice Maxwell advised Musara that if Motsi is unnecessarily dragging the process there should be ways in which he can have that matter dismissed by the Canadian Court Once that is done, he can then properly approach this Court.\n\nThe special plea was upheld, effectively halting the Zimbabwe proceedings.\n\n",
