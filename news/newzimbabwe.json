Firstly money was not circulating as it should,making it difficult to have proper preparations for the children, said Chitemere.\n\nHarare was a hive of activity Monday as parents made last-minute preparations for the reopening of schools.\n\nStationery and uniform shops were abuzz with parents making a beeline, and some taking advantage to make a killing by hiking the prices of school necessities.\n\nWith big supermarkets short on some goods, many resorted to informal shops in the downtown Harare Central Business Districts to purchase vital school materials.\n\nThe financial strain on some was exacerbated by the just-ended festive season which hit hard the pockets of many.\n\nOne parent identified as Chirisamhuru said the reopening of schools has left him breathing through the wound.\n\nPreparations were not easy. It started during the festive period when we also spent the little that we had. We have sacrificed for my children with one in form six and another one in form two. Essentials were a bit expensive but we did not have an option but to purchase, said Chisiyamhuru.\n\nAs the new yearbegins, Zimbabwes economy continues to tank, picking up where it left in 2024.\n\nAt the heart of the meltdown is the underperforming local currency, Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG), which was introduced nine months ago in an attempt to stabilise the faltering economy.\n\nHowever, ZiG has continued to lose valueagainst the United States dollar with many preferring to transact in the US dollar.\n\nSchools have not been immune to the economic pressures, as many now demand tuition fees in US dollars.\n\nChirisamhuru said the shunning of ZiG by many shops left many, like him,who earn in the local currency in a dilemma.\n\nWe had to reach an agreement with the school to allow kids to go to school after paying a part of the fees and then pay the remaining later. I do not even know ZiG. It is scarce I do not know why maybe it is circulating at RBZ and we are working with what is being demanded, he said.\n\n",

One migrant openly admitted to crossing illegally, stating, Im not afraid to say this. Im crossing illegally here because theres no immigration or whatever. You cant stop someone suffering.\n\nFor those who make it across, the challenges only multiply. Shelters near the border, such as one for women and children, are filled with stories of despair. Some migrants, like a 14-year-old girl trafficked into South Africa, endure harrowing journeys. They passed through people who were robbing others. Some were taken away, and some were raped, she recounted.\n\nThe situation for men isnt any better. Many travel to Johannesburg only to find themselves trapped in poverty and forced into hijacked buildings. These decrepit structures are rife with overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, and the ever-present threat of fire.\n\nOne resident remarked, Youd rather be in this hijacked building than back home in Zimbabwe. Theres nothing to go back to.\n\nThe migration crisis has fueled xenophobic sentiment across South Africa. Movements like Operation Dudula have gained traction, calling for the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.\n\nCritics argue that undocumented migrants are straining public resources and competing for jobs in an already struggling economy. Yet, human rights advocates, such as attorney Nomzamo Zondo, call for a more constructive approach.\n\nOnce you are here, how do we make sure that you are regularised, that we know who you are, and that you contribute to this economy? Zondo questioned. She warned against policies driven by hate and exclusion, urging the government to address systemic issues instead of scapegoating migrants.\n\nThe lack of border enforcement, compounded by South Africas flawed immigration system, leaves migrants in a perpetual cycle of vulnerability.\n\nAs authorities ramp up arrests and deportations, experts and activists continue to debate whether this strategy addresses the root causes or simply exacerbates the crisis.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/most-african-men-at-risk-of-prostate-cancer-new-study-flags-genetic-causes/",
            "content": "The Conversation\n\nA breakthrough study has identified the genetic risk factors that contribute to increased prostate cancer in African men. The study, the largest of its kind, recruited 7,500 men from eastern, southern and west Africa. The study is especially important because African men have a high risk of prostate cancer.\n\nMedical scientistWenlong Carl Chenexplains why the findings are significant and the promise they hold for future treatment.\n\nProstate cancer disproportionately affects men ofAfrican descent. Studies from the US and African countries report ahigher occurrence of prostate cancer in men of African ancestrywhen compared with men of other ancestries. Men of African and African Caribbean ancestry were also found to be at higher risk of developing amore aggressive form of prostate cancerand of developing it at a younger age when compared with men of European ancestry. Prostate cancer also accounts for nearly one-quarter of all cancer cases diagnosed in Africa.\n\nOurstudyaimed at uncovering aspects of genetic architecture of prostate cancer that were specific to men of African descent. In other words, we wanted to understand what it is about African mens genetic makeup that puts them at higher risk for prostate cancer.\n\nEvidence emerging in theliteraturesuggests that genetic risk factors significantly contribute to the development of prostate cancer. Genetic risks can be put into two groups:\n\nHereditary risk factors or germline mutations:There are rare genetic mutations in genes, such asBRCA1andBRCA2, that have been linked to increased risks for developing cancers. Mutations inBRCA2particularly are linked to higher risks of developing more aggressive prostate cancer.\n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms or variants:These are common genetic variants that are linked to increased disease risk. Each variant by itself confers a very small increase in risk. But several variants combined may raise the risk profiles for a disease.\n\nIn this study, we assessed the risk contributed by inherited genetic variants to prostate cancer.\n\nDespite the high burden of disease, genetic studies of prostate cancer in continental African populations are limited. The technology needed for these studies is typically very expensive and requires specialised instruments which are very scarce in Africa.\n\nTo better understand the geneticcausesof disease, we needed to study diverse populations, particularly African populations. African populations have muchhigher genetic diversitywhen compared with other populations. As the place oforigin ofHomo sapiens, the African population is much older than other populations and has therefore had more time to accumulate genetic variations.\n\nOurs is the largest study to date to investigate the ancestry-specific genetic architectures and disease associations for prostate cancer across multiple regions in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nNumerous studies like this have been conducted worldwide. But participation from Africa, both in terms of researchers and study participants, is very low.\n\nOur consortium, theMen of African Descent, Carcinoma of the Prostate(MADCaP), was formed in 2016. Hospitals and universities in five African countries  Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Uganda and South Africa  partnered with several US-based universities to form the consortium. The US National Institute of Health provided funding.\n\nThe African centres enrolled men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and, as controls, men of the same population groups who did not have cancer. Demographic, social, economic, and clinical information and bio-samples were collected from the participants.\n\nOur study consisted of 3,963 prostate cancer cases and 3,509 controls. Most bio-sample processing and genotyping was performed in Africa, using a custom genotyping array. A genotyping array provides information on hundreds of thousands of DNA variants. This specific one was designed and optimised to capture African genetic variations.\n\nWe identified three loci (genetic regions) with a strong association with increased prostate cancer incidence. The lead signals within these loci were common in African populations but were almost absent in non-African populations.\n\nAlthough these three loci were previously found in other populations, our signals within these loci are unique to African populations. They would not have been found if we had not studied African populations.\n\nThere are also differences within Africa. The genetic parts that contribute to prostate cancer risk differ by geographical population.\n\nIt is crucial to study diseases in populations with the highest disease burden.\n\nOur findings highlight the importance of studying the possible causes of disease in diverse populations.\n\nWe found novel associations by studying the genetics of prostate cancer across Africa. These signals would not have been found in studies done outside Africa.\n\nThe genetic diversity of African populations further allowed us to fine-map the regions of associations to better understand whats driving the signals.\n\nOur findings pave the way for the development of genetic tools that could grade people by their degree of risk.\n\nAnother example of this was a 2019studypublished in the American Journal of Human Genetics which used genetics to predict the risk of breast cancer. Women placed in higher risk groups would become eligible to enter the UK breast cancerscreening programmeat a much earlier age.\n\nThe results from our study will lay the foundation for the development and implementation of similar tools in an African setting.\n\nResearcher, University of the Witwatersrand\n\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.Read the original articlehere.\n\n",
