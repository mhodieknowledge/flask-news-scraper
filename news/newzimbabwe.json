            "content": "UNICEF\n\nFrom 29 June to 4 July 2025, Zimbabwe conducted its second Joint External Evaluation (JEE) to assess the countrys capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats under the International Health Regulations (2005). The JEE, coordinated by the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) with support from WHO and partners, marks a critical milestone in strengthening Zimbabwes public health emergency preparedness and response systems.\n\nThe JEE is a voluntary, collaborative process used globally to assess a countrys readiness to manage infectious disease outbreaks and other health emergencies. It is conducted every five years, with the countrys first evaluation completed in 2018.\n\nThe JEE gives us a structured opportunity to check how ready we are to detect and respond to public health threats and we thank all the partners who have made this possible, said Dr Wenceslaus Nyamayaro, MoHCC Acting Chief Director, Public Health.\n\nThe internal self-assessment, the first phase of the JEE, was completed in July 2025 with over 100 participants from across sectors including health, environment, veterinary services, defense, disaster management, civil society, and development partners including WHO, UNICEF, FAO, Africa CDC and others. This participatory process assessed 19 technical areas ranging from biosafety and surveillance to legislation and points of entry.\n\nKey areas that emerged as requiring urgent attention include outdated or poorly implemented legal instruments, coupled with limited availability of legal support at subnational levels. Gender equity in emergencies remains a concern, with notable gaps in funding for gender-based violence (GBV) prevention and response, as well as low representation of women in emergency preparedness and decision-making processes. Funding for emergency response activities was also highlighted as inadequate.Surveillance systems for foodborne illnesses and healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are still fragmented, highlighting the need for stronger cross-sector coordination. Coordination between the human, animal and environmental health sectors is still weak, showing the need to improve how these groups work together. Biosafety and biosecurity capacities also require strengthening, particularly in terms of laboratory infrastructure and staff training. Additionally, readiness at points of entry remains limited, with gaps in the ability to detect and respond to public health threats at borders and airports.\n\nZimbabwe also assessed its progress in tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a growing global threat. While the country has developed a robust One Health AMR National Action Plan and established 14 multisectoral surveillance sites, challenges remain in laboratory capacity, integration of data systems and containment of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs).\n\nThe next phase of the JEE will involve an external validation mission scheduled for 613 September 2025. A team of international subject matter experts, coordinated by WHOs Regional Office for Africa, will work with technical teams in Zimbabwe to validate scores, review documentation and conduct site visits to key health facilities including laboratories and points of entry. Following the mission, Zimbabwe will develop or update its National Action Plan for Health Security (NAPHS). This plan will consolidate findings from the JEE, past outbreak reviews, and risk assessments to guide future investments and reforms in public health preparedness.\n\nThe evaluation is about continuous improvement. It reflects Zimbabwes commitment to protect the health of its people through stronger systems, better data, and broader collaboration, said Dr. Desta Tiruneh, WHO Representative to Zimbabwe.\n\nThe evaluation was made possible with funding from the Health Resilience Fund (HRF) through WHO, with additional support mobilised by MoHCC from Africa CDC and UNICEF.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nZANU PF Mbire District Coordinating Committee chairman in Mashonaland Central province, Takesure Chikwamba has been accused of orchestrating the arrest of former Agriculture deputy minister Douglas Karoro on theft charges.\n\nThe move was allegedly driven by revenge after Chikwamba lost the Mbire Constituency to Karoro in the 2018 harmonised elections.\n\nThis came out in court this Thursday when Chikwamba appeared as a State witness against Karoro who is accused of diverting fertilisers that were meant for Mbire district under the Presidential Input Programme.\n\nThe former deputy minister, who is being represented by Admire Rubaya, denies the allegations, describing them as a fabrication by his political rivals, among them Chikwamba, whom he outclassed in the partys primary elections to represent the constituency in parliament.\n\nChikwamba told Regional Magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa that he reported the matter to the police after he received reports from his party subordinates of suspicious movement of fertilisers at GMB Mushumbi.\n\nHe said he was not in Mbire at the time but was at his home in Ruwa when he was informed about the movement of fertilisers at Mushumbi GMB depot heading to Guruve GMB and rushed to the Police Morris Depot to report.\n\nWhen I got information from Nawo Gumbo and Mutukudzi about the fertilisers I got in touch with intelligence officers from the Presidents office. I also made investigations at GMB Guruve, where I was told there was no ammonium nitrate which was said to be going to be exchanged with compound D which had been taken at Mushumbi.\n\nWe expected the compound D would be returned but it was never delivered to the people of Mbire, he said.\n\nThe defence argued that Chikwamba had no locus standi to receive information at GMB and this shows he had a motive to get back at Karoro who had beaten him in elections.\n\nThey argued that in pursuit of his vendetta, Chikwamba rushed to the police despite not having any evidence but just words from his security officers on the ground.\n\nThey added that Chikwamba never called Karoro to inquire about the allegations but rushed to the police as he had the intention to sink him.\n\nYou had ulterior motives; that is why you did not call him to ascertain whether it was true or not. You just concluded he was a thief and rushed to report without even hearing his side of the story, Rubaya argued.\n\nChikwamba responded, saying he went to the police because he had been told a whistleblower whom he could not name was processing documents at GMB to substantiate the allegations against the former legislator.\n\nThe defence insisted the allegations were a fabrication as they were not supported by evidence, adding that the report was not even made where the alleged offence occurred.\n\nThey said Chikwamba ignored his nearest police stations, Ruwa, Mabvuku and Harare Central and instead rushed to CCD, which ordinarily gets reports through referrals.\n\nThis, they said, showed malice and an intention to get back at Karoro because he had a bone to chew with the accused for defeating them in the elections.\n\nYou were determined to be in the new building in Mt Hampden (parliament) that you sought to have him dismissed through baseless allegations. You ignored all the police stations and just rushed to Morris Depot, now Mkushi Depot, Rubaya said.\n\nChikwamba said he was not bitter after losing the election to Karoro but instead he was happy because it was a learning curve and first time to compete, adding that Karoro was just raising it as a defence to the allegations.\n\nHearing continues next Thursday.\n\n",
