            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nPRESSURE continues to mount on the National Prosecution Authority (NPA) over a recent judgement in which Chinese nationals escaped jail despite being found in possession of drugs.\n\nThe judgement has been met with public outrage, and on Tuesday it was raised in the National Assembly, with legislators calling for the deportation of the Chinese nationals.\n\nWe call through you, Madam Speaker, for an appeal of the recent judgement of foreign nationals who were fined US$150 for being arrested in possession of dangerous drugs. We further propose the immediate deportation of these foreign nationals, who are bad apples amongst us, said Tendai Pinduka, a ZANU PF MP.\n\nHarare magistrate Vakayi Chikwekwe ruled that the quantity of cocaine the nine Chinese nationals were in possession of was insignificant.\n\nThe leniency of the judgement has been widely criticised, with the Zimbabwean government accused of being too soft on the Chinese, with whom it maintains a strong relationship.\n\nBy comparison, being found in possession of drugs in China is met with far harsher punishment, in some cases, a death penalty.\n\nThe judgement has been viewed as a mere slap on the wrist and one that undermines the governments stance on fighting drug abuse in communities.\n\nSurprisingly, foreign nationals were recently found in possession of dangerous drugs and cocaine, arrested, and fined a paltry US$150, which in our view is not deterrent enough. It further undermines the authority of His Excellency the President, Dr E.D. Mnangagwa, in combating the menace and scourge of drugs and substance abuse, said Pinduka.\n\nChinese nationals have been accused of committing crimes and escaping harsh sentences by leveraging their all-weather friendship with Zimbabwe.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe 14th edition of the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba (ZAMI) kicked off in Bulawayo on Tuesday, with participants urging government and industry players to embrace mining initiatives that place people and communities at the centre of resource exploitation.\n\nZimbabwe is endowed with vast mineral wealth, including platinum-group metals (PGMs), chrome, lithium, gold, coal, diamonds, nickel, copper, black granite, and asbestos, alongside potential resources such as iron ore, tungsten, and semi-precious stones. Yet, despite this vast mineral basket, the majority of Zimbabweans continue to face economic hardship.\n\nThe Borgen Project estimates that 60% of the population lives on less than US$3.65 a day, making Zimbabwe one of the poorest countries in the SADC region. Rural communities, home to about 67% of the population, remain most vulnerable to food insecurity, drought, and economic shocks. Meanwhile, the health sector continues to struggle, with 87% of Zimbabweans lacking medical aid coverage and persistent shortages of medicines, staff, and resources worsened by an ongoing brain drain.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) Secretary General Wilfred Dimingu described mining in the country as a story of plunder rather than stewardship.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, we have witnessed rivers polluted, communities displaced, and workers exploited in the name of short-term gains. This is not stewardship. It is idolatry, worshipping mammon over the Creator. Theologically, we are called to a different path, he said.\n\nDimingu stressed that sustainable development must be rooted in justice and fairness.\n\nThis means harnessing Zimbabwes minerals, particularly those critical for renewable energy and battery technologies, not through voracious extraction that scars the land and sidelines the poor, but through operations that ensure equity and sustainability, he added.\n\nZandile Mvududu, a project officer at Silveira House, emphasised the need for collaboration in shaping the extractive sectors future.\n\nStakeholders must continue to dialogue, hinging on the faith-based approach which we encourage in the districts we work in. The coming Mines and Minerals Bill presents an opportunity for communities to give input and resolve legacy issues in the sector, she said.\n\nProfessor Tumai Murombo, a legal and environmental expert from the University of the Witwatersrand (South Africa), echoed calls for reform, urging a total overhaul of Zimbabwes minerals governance and environmental management framework.\n\n",

Yet under the current law, numerous men have been imprisoned in circumstances where paternity was disputed or later disproved.\n\nBelieve Guta\n\nFounder of Big Brains Legal Aid Trust, Guta said the current system had caused irreparable harm, including loss of liberty, reputational damage, and psychological trauma.\n\nThere is no ministry responsible for men, yet we have one for Womens Affairs. The plight of men has been neglected. Many are suffering in silence, he told the committee.\n\nHe proposed the insertion of a new subsection to the Maintenance Act: No proceedings shall be instituted unless the paternity of the child has been established by voluntary acknowledgement, court declaration, or DNA testing where paternity is disputed.\n\nGuta further suggested that Parliament introduce a statutory review mechanism to reassess past cases where men were imprisoned without conclusive proof of paternity.\n\nCiting statistics, he said the African Institute of Bio-Medical Research found that 32% of maintenance-related disputes in 2019 revealed non-biological fathers, while Global DNAs data indicated up to 72% exclusion rates in tested cases\n\n",
