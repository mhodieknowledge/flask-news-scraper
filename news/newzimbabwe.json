In a stark revelation, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Police Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, claimed a powerful criminal syndicate has infiltrated South Africas law enforcement and judicial systems.\n\nMkhwanazi went one step further, accusing Mchunu of meddling in sensitive cases and colluding with a businessman accused of murder, aiming to dismantle the task force investigating a spate of political killings in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nIn light of these explosive allegations, President Ramaphosa has taken decisive action, placing Mchunu on special leave while also initiating a judicial commission of inquiry to be led by Acting Deputy Chief Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga.\n\nThe commission is tasked with investigating claims of interference in investigations, complicity among government officials, and the suppression of crucial law enforcement activities.\n\nMchunu, embroiled in controversy over the past week, has been accused by Mkhwanazi of being entwined with drug cartels and influential business concerns.\n\nAmong the allegations presented was an assertion that Lieutenant-General Shadrack Sibiya, deputy national commissioner for crime detection, colluded with Mchunu and a known information dealer, Brown Mogotsi, in a plot to disband the KwaZulu-Natal political killings task team.\n\nPolice Commissioner Masemola announced that Sibiya would also be requesting a leave of absence while investigations unfold, indicating a stern approach to restoring integrity within the police service.\n\n",

The bourse was once considered one of the best investment options in the southern African nation for hedging against exchange-rate volatility and inflation.\n\nUnrealistic valuations\n\nToday, too many pension funds are heavily weighted toward property, which is overvalued in our view, and alternative assets that have neither been marked down to realistic valuations nor have clear exit mechanisms, Sibanda and Legat wrote.\n\nThe failure to accurately value such holdings is worsening the situation: overvalued pension funds lead to inflated pension payouts, putting further pressure on the ZSE and Zimbabwes Victoria Falls Securities Exchange (VFEX) in the absence of adequate contributions, they said.\n\nThe result is a self-fulfilling prophecy, due to notable selling pressures to meet liquidity needs, prices of assets on both the ZSE and VFEX are very low and that has led investors to panic.\n\n",
