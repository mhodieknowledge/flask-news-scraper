            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Labour Court has overturned the dismissal of former Immigration Department officer Herbert Admire Makani, ruling that the Civil Service Commission (CSC) bungled the disciplinary process and misdirected itself in law.\n\nMakani was fired in August 2021 after being found guilty of sexually harassing a former colleague, Fortune Nyamuremba, through alleged calls and text messages between 2011 and 2014, as well as for alleged indecorous conduct.\n\nBut Justice Bridget Chivizhe, in a judgment delivered recently said the CSCs case was riddled with procedural flaws and a lack of evidence.\n\nThe Disciplinary Committee merely pronounced the appellant guilty and recited the alleged facts, Justice Chivizhe said.\n\nIt failed to clearly link those facts to the specific charges or to distinguish which conduct constituted a contravention of paragraph 4 and which fell under paragraph 7 of the Public Service Regulations, 2000.\n\nThe court found that the Commission misrepresented Makanis testimony by claiming he had not denied contacting Nyamuremba,a statement contradicted by the official record.\n\nAt page 6 of the minutes the appellant categorically denied the allegations.\n\nFurther when specifically asked whether he had ever called Ms Nyamuremba, the appellant responded unequivocally that he had never phoned her, the court noted.\n\nChivizhe also ruled that the CSC failed to provide key evidence, such as the alleged messages or phone numbers involved.\n\nIn the absence of such evidence, the Disciplinary Authority could not reasonably or lawfully conclude that the elements of the offence were satisfied, she said.\n\nA finding of guilt in such circumstances is unsupported by the evidentiary record and cannot stand.\n\nThe judge stressed that the CSC wrongly shifted the burden of proof onto Makani.\n\nIt is a cardinal principle of the law of procedure that he who alleges must prove Where he fails to prove, his case will not stick, Justice Chivizhe wrote.\n\nThe onus was on the respondent to establish the appellants guilt. The appellant did not carry the burden of proof.\n\nCiting theKazingiingizi v Dzinorumaprecedent, the court warned that decisions without clear reasoning are susceptible to being perceived as arbitrary or capricious.\n\nThe court allowed the appeal with costs and ordered that Makani be reinstated without loss of salary or benefits from the date of dismissal. If reinstatement is impossible, the CSC must pay damages to be agreed upon within 30 days.\n\n",

I try to be kind to myself as my body finds a new normal. The pressure put on us to bounce back when everything is new and different isnt realistic. Life is beautiful, you are beautiful.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nBrazen! It is brazen! Prof Paul Sereno says down the phone line from Chicago.\n\nHe makes no effort to disguise his anger that a rare meteorite from Mars discovered two years ago in the West African nation of Niger ended up being auctioned off in New York last month to an unnamed buyer.\n\nThe palaeontologist, who has close connections with the country, believes it should be back in Niger.\n\nThis millions-of-years-old piece of the Red Planet, the largest ever found on Earth,fetched $4.3m (3.2m) at Sothebys. Like the buyer, the seller was kept anonymous.\n\nBut it is unclear if any of this money went to Niger.\n\nFragments of extraterrestrial material that have made their way to Earth have long inspired reverence among humans  some ending up as religious objects, others as curiosities for display. More recently, many have become the subject of scientific study.\n\nThe trade in meteorites has been compared to the art market, with aesthetics and rarity affecting the price.\n\nAt first, there was a sense of awe surrounding the public display of this extraordinary Martian find  less than 400 of the 50,000 meteorites discovered have been shown to come from our planetary neighbour.\n\nThe photographs taken at Sothebys of the 24.7kg (54lb) rock  appearing in the lights to glow silver and red  compounded this feeling.\n\nBut then some people started asking questions about how it ended up under the auctioneers hammer.\n\nNot least the government of Niger itself, which,in a statement, expressed doubts about the legality of its export, raising concerns about possible illicit international trafficking.\n\nReuters The meteorite, seen here in close-up, travelled some 225 million kilometres before crashing down to Earth\n\nSothebys strongly disputes this, saying the correct procedures were followed, but Niger has now launched an investigation into the circumstances of the discovery and sale of the meteorite, which has been given the scientific and unromantic name NWA 16788 (NWA standing for north-west Africa).\n\nLittle has been made public about how it ended up at a world-renowned auction house in the US.\n\nAnItalian academic articlepublished last year said that it was found on 16 November 2023 in the Sahara Desert in Nigers Agadez region, 90km (56 miles) to the west of the Chirfa Oasis, by a meteorite hunter, whose identity remained undisclosed.\n\nMeteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, but because of the favourable climate for preservation and the lack of human disturbance, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery. People scour the inhospitable landscape stretching across several countries in the hope of finding one to sell on.\n\nAccording to the Italian article, NWA 16788, was sold by the local community to an international dealer and was then transferred to a private gallery in the Italian city of Arezzo.\n\nThe University of Florences magazine described the person as an important Italian gallery owner.\n\nA team of scientists led by Giovanni Pratesi, mineralogy professor at the university, was able to examine it to learn more about its structure and where it came from. The meteorite was then briefly on display last year in Italy, including at the Italian Space Agency in Rome.\n\nIt was next seen in public in New York last month, minus two slices that stayed in Italy for more research.\n\nSothebys said that NWA 16788 was exported from Niger and transported in line with all relevant international procedures.\n\nAs with everything we sell, all relevant documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved.\n\nA spokesperson added that Sothebys was aware of reports that Niger is investigating the export of the meteorite and we are reviewing the information available to us in light of the question raised.\n\nProf Sereno, who founded the organisation NigerHeritage a decade ago, is convinced Nigerien law was broken.\n\nThe academic with the University of Chicago, who has spent years uncovering the countrys vast deposits of dinosaur bones in the Sahara, campaigns to get Nigers cultural and natural heritage  including anything that has fallen from outer space  returned.\n\nA stunning museum on an island on the River Niger that runs through the capital, Niamey, is being planned to house these artefacts.\n\nInternational law says you cannot simply take something that is important to the heritage of a country  be it a cultural item, a physical item, a natural item, an extraterrestrial item  out of the country. You know weve moved on from colonial times when all this was okay, Prof Sereno says.\n\nA series of global agreements, including under the UNs cultural organisation Unesco, have tried to regulate the trade in these objects. But,according to a 2019 studyby international law expert Max Gounelle, when it comes to meteorites, while they could be included, there remains some ambiguity about whether they are covered by these agreements. It is left to individual states to clarify the position.\n\nNiger passed its own law in 1997 aimed at protecting its heritage.\n\nProf Sereno points to one section with a detailed list of all the categories included. Mineralogical specimens are mentioned among the art works, architecture and archaeological finds but meteorites are not specifically named.\n\nIn its statement on the Sothebys sale, Niger admitted that it does not yet have specific legislation on meteorites  a line that the auction house also pointed out. But it remains unclear how someone was able to get such a heavy, conspicuous artefact out of the country without the authorities apparently noticing.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Meteorite hunters, like this one in Morocco, search the landscape for the space rocks\n\nMorocco has faced a similar issue with the huge number of meteorites  more than 1,000  found within its borders, which include a part of the Sahara.\n\nMore than two decades ago the country experienced what author Helen Gordon described as a Saharan gold rush, fuelled in part by laxer regulations and a more stable political environment than some of its neighbours.\n\nIn her recent book The Meteorites, she wrote that Morocco was one of the worlds greatest exporters of space rocks.\n\nProf Hasnaa Chennaoui Aoudjehane has spent much of the past 25 years trying to hold on to some of that extraterrestrial material for her country.\n\nIts a part of us, its a part of our heritage its part of our identity and its important to be proud of the richness of the country, the geologist tells the BBC.\n\nThe professor is not against the trade in meteorites but has been instrumental in the introduction of measures aimed at regulating the business. She admits though that the new rules have not been entirely successful in stemming the flow of the meteorites.\n\nIn 2011, Prof Chennaoui was responsible for gathering material in the desert from an observed meteorite fall that turned out to be from Mars.\n\nLater named the Tissint meteorite, it weighed 7kg in all, but now she says only 30g remain in Morocco. Some of the rest is in museums around the world, with the biggest piece on display in Londons Natural History Museum.\n\nReflecting on the fate of Nigers Martian meteorite, she says she was not surprised as it is something that Im living with for 25 years. Its a pity, we cannot be happy with this, but its the same state in all our countries.\n\nProf Sereno hopes that the Sothebys sale will prove a turning-point  firstly by motivating the Nigerien authorities to act and secondly if it ever sees the light of day in a public museum, [the museum] is going to have to deal with the fact that Niger is openly contesting it.\n\n",
