Among those whom he allegedly attacked are goalkeeper Washington Arubi, Emmanuel Jalai, and Chirewa.Inside sources within the camp have revealed that senior players have since launched a formal complaint to the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) regarding the coachs conduct.In addressing Chirewas issue, ZIFA has since released a statement clarifying Chirewas withdrawal from the squad ahead of Mondays match against Qatar.ZIFA wishes to inform the nation, the media fraternity, and all that midfielder Tawanda Chirewa has been granted permission to leave the national team camp, as had been agreed prior to the player joining the camp.This decision was reached with the full blessing and consent of ZIFA, after Wolverhampton Wanderers formally requested an opportunity for the player to be assessed by their new technical team as part of their internal preparations for the season ahead.ZIFA emphasises that this development is not a withdrawal, nor does it reflect any dispute or disagreement. Instead, it represents a professional and mutually respectful alignment between the national association and the players parent club, an alignment that prioritises the athletes long-term development while safeguarding Zimbabwes national football interests, read part of the statement.Meanwhile, senior players in the Warriors are said to have threatened to retire from playing international football if Marinica doesnt change his attitude and approach.\n\nThe 22-year-old player is reported to have had a fallout with new Warriors coach Mario Marinica, who is alleged to be exhibiting unprofessional conduct towards the players.\n\nMarinica is alleged to be insulting players in camp.

ICAN is the leading global forum for ICAO Member States to conduct bilateral, regional, and plurilateral air services negotiations and consultations. These agreements aim to boost air connectivity, promote industry growth, and establish regulatory frameworks for international air transport.\n\nTransport and Infrastructure Development Permanent Secretary Joy Makumbe (right) signing MoUs\n\nThe event facilitated negotiation meetings between delegations, business-to-business (B2B) meetings, and a high-level roundtable discussion addressing the future of international air transport.\n\nSpeaking to NewZimbabwe.com shortly after the 2025 ICAN rolled down its curtains in D.R, Transport and Infrastructure Development Ministrys permanent Secretary, Engineer Joy Makumbe said four MoUs and three bilateral agreements were forged during the event.\n\nAs the foremost global event for air transport negotiations, ICAN serves as the main international platform for discussing and negotiating air transport matters in line with the sectors rapid developments. It also provides a key opportunity for countries to negotiate bilateral and multilateral air services agreements, she said.\n\nMakumbe said concluding air services agreements offers benefits such as increased connectivity, economic growth, and a more competitive market.\n\nThese agreements facilitate more routes, flights, and capacity, which can lead to lower prices for air freight and faster transportation.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nCBZ Holdings, Zimbabwes largest financial services group by assets and deposits, has posted a 10% increase in profit after tax for the nine months ending 30 September 2025, reaching ZWG1.11 billion, up from ZWG1.01 billion in the same period last year.\n\nPresenting a trading update for the nine months ended 30 September 2025, CBZ Group Chief Legal Advisor and Governance, Rumbidzayi Jakanani, said the growth recorded comes as the countrys macroeconomic environment stabilises, with the ZWG holding steady against the US dollar and inflation easing into single digits.\n\nCBZ Group Chief Legal Advisor and Governance, Rumbidzayi Jakanani\n\nThe Group recorded a profit after tax of ZWG 1.11 billion, representing a 10% increase from ZWG1.01 billion recorded in the same period of the previous year. Total income amounted to ZWG4.23 billion, 58% above the ZWG 2.68 billion reported in the prior year, reflecting stable performance, she said.\n\nWhile the increase in profits may seem modest, it reflects CBZHs strong cost control and strategic diversification, as the bank navigates a period of monetary tightening and stable gold-backed reserves. This stability has allowed CBZH to focus on organic growth rather than hedge against extreme inflation volatility.\n\nTotal income surged 58% to ZWG 4.23 billion, up from ZWG 2.68 billion in 2024, with non-funded income contributing a significant 65% (ZWG 2.75 billion), reflecting a 54% increase year-on-year. This jump in non-interest income underscores CBZHs advantage in transactional banking, supported by its leading deposit base and robust digital channels, which have thrived amid growing electronic payment adoption and a stable exchange rate.\n\nFunded income also grew 66%, reaching ZWG 1.46 billion, as the bank selectively lent into higher-yielding sectors while maintaining strong asset quality, unlike some competitors who have struggled in volatile periods.\n\nThe balance sheet expanded 13% to ZWG 38.93 billion, with deposits rising by 25% to ZWG 27.09 billion. This strong growth in customer deposits has enabled CBZH to maintain a healthy loan-to-deposit ratio while maintaining high liquidity levels. The banks focus on stable, low-cost retail and corporate deposits has helped shield it from risks associated with short-term interbank funding.\n\nCapital adequacy remains strong, with all divisions meeting regulatory requirements. The bank is also planning fresh capital injections for its growth subsidiaries, positioning it for future opportunities in a fragmented market.\n\nLooking ahead, the global economy is expected to record moderate growth on the back of easing inflation, improving financial conditions, and technological productivity gains. The local economy is set to continue on the positive growth trajectory, supported by expected better rainfall season, higher prices for gold, improved energy supply, coupled with the ongoing fiscal reforms that will enhance the ease of doing business, added Jakanani.\n\n",
