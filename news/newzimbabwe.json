            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nHigh Court judge Priscilla Munangati-Manongwa and prominent lawyer Advocate Thabani Mpofu have been drawn into controversy after an anonymous whistle-blower accused them of a conflict of interest in a leaked letter seen by NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nThe letter, addressed to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) and copied to the Judicial Service Commission, claims the alleged personal and professional links of the two compromise judicial impartiality.\n\nThe author, who says they are writing anonymously for fear of victimisation, alleges that Advocate Mpofu continues to take instructions from Munangati and Associates, a law firm they say still bears the judges name.\n\nI write to raise my concern over a serious conflict of interest between the above-mentioned court officials.\n\nDespite having a brother who works at Munangati and Associates, where I believe the Honourable Judge still has interests as her name still appears at the law firm, Advocate Mpofu takes instructions from the law firm and appears before Justice Munangati in those matters.\n\nThe whistle-blower argues that this arrangement is highly undesirable and grossly unfair to other litigants who will be in the dark about the relationship between the Honourable Judge and Advocate Mpofu.\n\nThe letter goes on to list several cases the author believes demonstrate the alleged conflict. Among them is HC 2312/24  Collin Zondai Makoni vs The State, which the writer says came [before] Justice Munangati despite the fact that it was from her law firm, involving lawyers Skumbuzo Mpofu and Skyvaine Vongai Tendere. This matter is pending decision pronouncement, the letter notes.\n\nThe whistle-blower also cites Thelma Chimbanga vs L Gono Enterprises (HC 1518/24), which they say was heard by the same judge despite originating from the same law firm, and is still awaiting a set down.\n\nAnother flagged case is Blue Star Logistics vs Harare Motorways (HC 8108/24), where Thabani Mpofu is representing the Applicant, with the author adding: I believe this anomaly is being overlooked since Thabani Mpofu and Webster Chiikwanha are the best of friends.\n\nThe author insists that Justice Munangati Manongwa should not hear any matters instructed to Advocate Mpofu by Munangati and Associates legal practitioners, urging ZACC to intervene because these allegations, which are very serious in nature be investigated so as to avoid prejudice to other litigants.\n\nThe writer further notes that this is not their first complaint to ZACC: Kindly note that I once wrote to your good office again on the 24th of June 2024.\n\n",

Stability for beyond one year is crucial for the market to accept a mono-currency arrangement,  he said.\n\nThe Reserve Bank attributes the increase to several factors, including:\n\nGold reserves currently stand at around 3.5 tonnes, and the authorities say the country has benefited from the global gold price rally.\n\nZimbabwe also continues to accumulate reserves through the foreign-currency surrender system, in which exporters convert part of their earnings into local currency.\n\nAt the rate we are accumulating these reserves, it is quite encouraging. Our exports are increasing, and this is what funds reserve accumulation.\n\nHowever, they cautioned that beyond building reserves, confidence in the ZiG and broader economic performance will determine the success of the 2030 single-currency target.\n\nOur economy has been performing to expectations, and in some cases exceeding expectations, despite external shocks. But stability remains the foundation for trust in the currency, Gwanyanya said.\n\n",

His appointment was scheduled for review at the end of his army tenure.\n\nWith tensions reportedly deepening over Mnangagwas succession, analysts view the elevation of his close allies to key military positions as a move to consolidate and secure his political interests.\n\nThe military played a pivotal role in the 2017 coup that propelled Mnangagwa to power, making control of the security sector crucial in maintaining his hold on the state.\n\nTapfumaneyi was placed under US sanctions in 2024 for his alleged role in disrupting the 2023 general elections through the Forever Association of Zimbabwe (FAZ), which was accused of intimidating voters at polling stations.\n\n",

That contrasts with the ZSE  long a haven for investors during bouts of high inflation  which is slightly lower.\n\nThe VFEX has been the standout performer, with market capitalisation rising over 40% year to date, the Harare-based brokerage said in its latest equity report, attributing the strong performance to gold-linked and consumer-facing stocks.\n\nLiquidity on the VFEX has also improved significantly, the brokerage added. With average daily turnover up 197% from the prior year, reflecting deepening participation by both institutional and retail investors.\n\nThe main exchange in Harare has borne the brunt of a yearlong liquidity squeeze thats been in place since the 43% devaluation of the ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, last September.\n\nTrading on the ZSE has slumped, and IH Securities expects the slowdown will continue to suppress stock market activity.\n\n",

The arrival of the passengers raised alarms within government circles, as it has since emerged that the refugees did not know where they were being taken.\n\nA source in the NEC said during discussions, members were shocked that the intelligence services failed to detect this situation.\n\nKeep in mind that this is not the first time something like this has happened; there is another plane that has arrived before, and there have been people coming from Palestine and, we understand, others from Ukraine. However, the intelligence service was unaware; how can that be? We now want them to be investigated, stated the source.\n\nThe NEC members said that both the domestic and foreign intelligence arms should take responsibility for this security breach.\n\nA plane filled with people just landed in our country and they know nothing about it. We wanted answers because this means this could happen again and again.\n\nThe source said the issue was not about the Palestinian refugees but the fact that such a security breach was allowed to happen. The party also wants a profile of everyone that is in the country.\n\nWe are concerned that some of the people that have arrived stated that they paid about R30 000 to be taken here, and we wanted to confirm if that is indeed the case.\n\nThe NEC member also said the party would want to put more stringent visa regimes in place going forward, pointing out that Palestinians and Israelis could get into the country with visas, and that could be beefed up going forward. We have to know who is in the country.\n\nSeveral attempts to get comment from the ANC yesterday were unsuccessful.\n\nPolitical analyst Thabani Khumalo said the situation has left many questions for the ruling party to answer.\n\nIn South Africa, you do not know whether this is a country or what; the manner in which this unfolded has left many people feeling unsafe. We do not feel safe, and the visitors to the G20 will feel unsafe as well.\n\nHow many people are roaming the streets that are unknown? There have been reports of people operating training camps, and even the defence members are complaining, indicating that many things are not going well.\n\nInternational Relations Minister Ronald Lamola said the flight was part of a clear agenda to cleanse Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank.\n\n[This] is a clearly orchestrated operation because they are not only being sent to South Africa. There are other countries where such flights have been sent, he said.\n\nIt was reported that the Palestinian embassy in South Africa stated that the group left Israels Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, without any prior notice or co-ordination.\n\nThe embassy added that an unregistered and misleading organisation had exploited the plight of the Gaza citizens, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner.\n\n",
