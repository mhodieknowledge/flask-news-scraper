The directive given to the local authority is a direct attack on Section 276 of the Constitution, which enshrines devolution.\n\nIn fact, this entire land issue is an assault on devolution as provided for in Chapter 14 of the Constitution, particularly Sections 274 and 276. Local authorities must retain autonomy in decision-making, Akili told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nGovernment has been at loggerheads with Pinnacle Holdings over the land in Harare South which the latter claims ownership of.\n\nThe directive awaits approval from the local authority through a council resolution, which would facilitate the land transfer to Pinnacle Holdings.\n\nAkili further argued that the HCC should not be entangled in the dispute between the government and Pinnacle Holdings, as the council was not party to the original agreement.\n\nIt would be prudent for the local authority, particularly the councillors, to be guided by Chapter 14 of the Constitution on devolution.\n\nThe councillors must recognise that they cannot transfer any land to Pinnacle Holdings, which has no existing agreement with the City of Harare. In fact, Pinnacle Holdings has no locus standi in this matter, Akili said.\n\n",

In 2021, the minister of home affairs announced plans to terminate the ZEP permits, sparking legal actions from the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation, Magadzire told IOL.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Immigration Federation was inspired to go through courts due to the South African minister of home affairs decision to terminate the permits. The decision would have significant implications for approximately 180,000 Zimbabweans living and working in South Africa under the ZEP permit program.\n\nMagadzire said his organisation is requesting the superior court to declare the termination of the ZEP permits unlawful, setting aside the termination decision, and protecting permit holders rights.\n\nIn Magadzires view, a lasting solution would be granting the ZEP holders permanent residence status in South Africa.\n\nThe latest development in the court case is that the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed the minister of home affairs appeal. This decision upholds a Johannesburg High Court interdict that shields approximately 180,000 ZEP holders from arrest and deportation, said Magadzire.\n\nLast year,IOL reported thatthe High Court in Pretoria heard arguments from the Helen Suzman Foundation to enforce the courts order that the ZEP remains valid, while the minister of home affairs conducts a fair and rational inquiry into the impact of its termination.\n\nThe foundation turned to court in a bid to give ZEP holders a lifeline.\n\nWhen the minister first signalled his intention to appeal the courts June 2023 judgment, the foundation asked him to leave the ZEP in place until he exhausted the appeal process. The minister refused, Nicole Fritz, executive director of the foundation said at the time.\n\nThe court had held earlier that the ministers appeal had no prospects of success. Home Affairs then decided to turn to the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n\n",

It is reported that there were 4,912 injuries and 76 fatalities throughout the year. What about those accidents that went unreported? It is our demand that we cannot continue to suffer from workplace neglect as workers without the responsible authorities being brought to account for the injuries and deaths being experienced in the workplace, she said.\n\nTaruvinga said the mining industry has become synonymous with unsafe shafts, equipment failure, and weak regulations that are causing unnecessary deaths.\n\nIn Agriculture, she said, employees work without personal protective equipment and are exposed to chemicals, heat stress, and poor living conditions, while in the retail and commercial sectors, workers are exposed to long hours of work, job insecurity and poor ergonomics.\n\nTaruvinga said that in the informal sector, over 80% of workers operate with no safety laws, medical care, or recognisable rights, while the transport and manufacturing sectors have also not been spared, as workers work with very dangerous old and archaic machinery, poorly maintained and without proper safety nets.\n\nAs the voice of workers, we clearly pronounce that enough is enough. We demand the following: Full enforcement of OSH laws across all economic sectors, establishment of functional health and safety committees in every workplace and access to adequate PPE, occupational health training, and medicalservices for all workers, added Taruvinga.\n\nThe June 6 commemorations are held annually to reflect on the Kamandama Mine Disaster, in which 427 miners were killed in 1972 in a mine explosion. The accident, which was attributed to a methane gas explosion, forced the permanent closure of the mine.\n\n",

The Times had no obvious motive to favor Livelys version of events.\n\nIn a statement shared with US media, Livelys lawyers called the opinion a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and The New York Times.\n\nAs we have said from day one, this $400 million lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it, her lawyers said.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Baldonis lawyers for comment.\n\nJudge Liman said Baldoni would be allowed to amend and refile his allegations related to interference with contracts by 23 June.\n\nJudge Limans dismissal comes a week after Lively asked to withdraw two of the claims in her suit against Baldoni  intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n\nIn the original lawsuit, she claimed she experienced severe emotional distress in response to the alleged sexual harassment and smear campaign.\n\nIt Ends With Us is an adaption of a best-selling Colleen Hoover novel, which features Blake Lively as the main character, Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse and finds herself in the same position years later.\n\n",

Following US mediation, Rwanda and DR Congo are working on a draft peace plan that is expected to be signed later this month.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Congolese presidency, the Eccas leaders at the summit acknowledged the aggression against the Democratic Republic of Congo by Rwanda and ordered the aggressor country to withdraw its troops from Congolese soil.\n\nIt added that until the dispute was resolved, it was decided that Equatorial Guinea would remain in the chairman role to the detriment of Rwanda.\n\nIn comments directed at Rwanda, Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said that one cannot continually and voluntarily violate the principles that underpin our regional institutions and claim to want to preside over them.\n\nHe added that the Eccas decision should inspire other regional organisations to adopt a firmer stance against Rwanda.\n\nRwanda has been accused of supporting M23 rebels in the east of DR Congo. The group has made major advances at the beginning of the year, taking the key regional cities of Goma and Bukavu.\n\nDR Congos government, the US and France have identified Rwanda as backing the M23.\n\nLast year, a UN experts report said that up to 4,000 Rwandan troops were fighting alongside the rebels.\n\nBut Rwanda has denied the accusations, saying instead that its troops were deployed along its border to prevent the conflict spilling over into its territory.\n\nRwanda has once before, in 2007, left Eccas, whose mission is to foster co-operation and strengthen regional integration in central Africa.
