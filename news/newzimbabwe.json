Were not giving up,we still have to keep fighting and see how this happens, said MapezaDespite the defeat, FC Platinum is still on fourth position with 40 points and a game in hand.Saturdays match gave the fans value for their money as both side staged classic displays.However, the visiting death depth was the x-factor, which saw them walking away with three points.Scottland had the luxury of starting star players Khama Billiat and new high profile signing Knowledge Musona on the bench, only to introduce them in the dying minutes of the game while they were already leading 4-2.Striker Tymon Machope was the hero as he managed to score a brace before he was substituted in the 63rd minute.I think the quality showed today, and Ive always said that football is played by quality.But at the same time, if you have quality that doesnt run, then you risk not winning matches.Im happy that today we saw the running from the quality that we have, and that then got us the results, said Scottland FC coach Tonderai Ndiraya.Meanwhile, fellow title contenders TelOne FC were handed a 1-0 defeat at home by Manica Diamonds, who ended their seven match winless run at Ascot Stadium in Gweru.Elsewhere, at Nyamhunga Stadium in Kariba, Greenfuel recorded a 1-0 win against ZPC Kariba while Dynamos shockingly defeated MWOS 1-0 at Rufaro Stadium to mark their third defeat of the season.\n\nThe result saw Scottland FC maintaining pressure on log leaders Simba Bhora, who are now on 47 points after beating Chicken Inn 1-0.\n\nWith 46 points, Scottland FC are second on the table, and thave now gone for five games without dropping a point.Saturdays result had a huge impact not for FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza as an individual, who revealed that this was his highest score margin defeat since he started coaching.Its my first time in my coaching career to lose by five goals, its my first time.I think they managed to make use of their chances, which we gave them.

follows the graduation with drone pilot certificates of a cohort of 27 police officer in Harare this Wednesday after successfully undergoing rigorous training.National police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the event underscored ZRPs commitment to modernising policing and keeping abreast with international best standards and protocols.As the ZRP continues to embrace technology in policing, 27 police officers graduated with drone pilot certificates at ZRP Sports Club this afternoon, Nyathi said in a statement Wednesday.The CommissionerGeneral of Polices thrust of modernising the ZRP through the Electronic Traffic Management System and use of technology in crime management is certainly taking effect, he added.Drones are a game-changer in combating crime as they can be deployed in surveillance and monitoring large crowds, areas, or events, helping to prevent and respond to crimes.They can also track suspects, monitor traffic, and survey crime scenes while drones with facial recognition technology can help identify known troublemakers or wanted individuals in crowds.In search and rescue operations, drones equipped with thermal sensors and high-zoom cameras can quickly locate missing persons or suspects in vast areas while in crime scene Investigation they can help investigators analyse evidence and piece together what happened.In border control, Zimbabwe has already started using drones to patrol its borders, helping to curb cross-border crimes like smuggling and human trafficking.Also, these special tools, equipped with specialised sensors, can detect explosives or hazardous materials from a safe distance, protecting police officers and the public.\n\nThis follows the graduation with drone pilot certificates of a cohort of 27 police
