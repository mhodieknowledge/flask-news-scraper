            "content": "By Dyepkazah Shibayan and Aamer Madhani l Associated Press\n\nUNITED States President Donald Trump on Saturday said hes ordered the Pentagon to begin planning for potential military action in Nigeria as he stepped up his allegations that the government is failing to rein in the persecution of Christians in the West African country.\n\nThe president also warned that he will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria.If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, guns-a-blazing, to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities, Trump posted on social media.I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!The warning came after Nigerias President Bola Ahmed Tinubu earlier on Saturday pushed back on Trump announcing a day earlier that he was designating the West African country a country of particular concern for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.Nigerias president Bola TinubuIn a social media statement on Saturday, Tinubu said that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so, Tinubu said.Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.Trump on Friday said Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria and radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter.Trumps comment came weeks after U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz urged Congress to designate Africas most populous country as a violator of religious freedom with claims of Christian mass murder.Nigerias population of 220 million is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims. The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough.Attacks in Nigeria have varying motives. There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes.While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigerias Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.Kimiebi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated the commitment of Nigeria to protect citizens of all religions.The Federal Government of Nigeria will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion, Ebienfa said in a statement on Saturday.Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.Nigeria was placed on the country of particular concern list by the U.S. for the first time in 2020 over what the State Department called systematic violations of religious freedom.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Government of Zimbabwe has consolidated 11 different local authority licences into a single unitary business licence to improve the ease of doing business.\n\nThe reduction in fees is expected to stimulate entrepreneurship, encourage the formalisation of entities and create free funds for investment in growth and job creation.The review came in the wake of representations from industry and commerce stakeholders, who raised concern over the multiplicity and steep licences needed to operate businesses lawfully.The new policy consolidates 11 different local authority licences into a single, unified shop licence.The reprieve, which has been met with optimism from various stakeholders, extends across various sectors, including retail, tourism, food and confectionery, liquor trading and butcheries.Previously, a food factory licence alone could set a business back as much as US$2,300. Now, that entire cost, along with 10 others, is swept away into one simple licence, said Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube in a statement at the weekend.Bottle stores operating within a licensed retail shop will no longer require a separate licence, while businesses dealing in both wholesale and retail will need only a single permit.Integrated factories and retail outlets on the same premises will be covered by one licence, cutting multiple regulatory costs.Further, supermarkets are exempted from Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) licence requirements, unless they operate in designated tourist jurisdictions.To cushion small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the government has directed that councils set a sliding scale for licence fees, with a maximum limit of US$500.This measure is designed to ensure that the cost of doing business remains proportionate to the size of the enterprise, providing significant relief to emerging operators.These measures are meant to aid in the creation of a conducive economic environment where jobs will be created, productivity improved across all sectors of the economy, achieving high growth rates through improving the ease of doing business, said Ncube.Government remains committed to improving the business environment to encourage domestic and foreign investment in which Zimbabwe can become an upper middle-income society by 2030.The retail sector is one of the fastest growing sectors in Zimbabwe, and to further strengthen it, Government has moved to remove the fragmentation of licences, added Ncube.The Medical Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ) has also removed the permit for the sale of veterinary products, as its functions overlap with those of the Department of Veterinary Services.Tourism businesses, including hotels and lodges, have seen their licence fees reduced by 50 percent, also pegged at a maximum US$500.Change of property use fee has been capped at US$1,000, down from highs of US$3,500 thereby dealing a huge blow to local authorities which were amassing revenue from the transactions.Liquor licensing has been simplified, with the Liquor Licensing Board compressing all permits into one, regardless of location.The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Financial Services Licence for local businesses has been cut to US$20, down from US$186, while the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) will now issue a single licence across business categories at a cost of between US$50 and US$120, applicable to all branches of a company.\n\nThe reduction in fees is expected to stimulate entrepreneurship, encourage the formalisation of entities and create free funds for investment in growth and job creation.\n\nThe review came in the wake of representations from industry and commerce stakeholders, who raised concern over the multiplicity and steep licences needed to operate businesses lawfully.The new policy consolidates 11 different local authority licences into a single, unified shop licence.The reprieve, which has been met with optimism from various stakeholders, extends across various sectors, including retail, tourism, food and confectionery, liquor trading and butcheries.Previously, a food factory licence alone could set a business back as much as US$2,300.

            "content": "By Oluthando Keteyi l IOL\n\nKUDI Maradzika is a visionary, award-winning Zimbabwean screenwriter, director, producer, performer, and creative entrepreneur. She is dedicated to redefining the future of African storytelling.\n\nShe is the creator, executive producer, and head writer of Netflix Original Series Bad Influencer.Bad Influencer is a seven-part crime drama series that balances high-stakes survival with the glossy illusions of influencer culture.At its heart is BK (Jo-Anne Reyneke), a street-smart single mom whose greatest hustle is protecting her son. Destiny puts her in the path of Pinky (Cindy Mahlangu), a rising influencer with flair and chaos to spare.Maradzika shared with IOL that she used to be a micro-influencer and attended brand events. Although she didnt stay long, she thought it was an interesting world.I didnt stay in it, but what I kept was an interesting story which I pitched and we turned it into an idea through 18 months of development, working with my company Lincoln Green Media, also working with Gambit, who are incredible producers, to put something together that is unique and fresh for an audience.On Bad Influencer, BK and Pinky descend into Joburgs counterfeit economy, selling fake luxury handbags. Fame and fraud become indistinguishable, likes and lies trade places, and instinct demands they walk the knife-edge between heart and hustle.The series takes a look at the different social issues that come with the world of influencers.
