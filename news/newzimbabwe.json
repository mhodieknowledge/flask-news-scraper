            "content": "By Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal.\n\nNational laws aimed at redressing colonial imbalances reserve retail sectors, like that of brickmaking, for locals. But companies with outside investment, particularly from China, routinely flout the rules.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  For nearly a decade, Stanley has made a living laying out bricks for drying at Willdale Bricks, one of Zimbabwes oldest brick manufacturers. That work paid his rent and kept his three children in school. But orders at the company have slowed and, like many other colleagues, he hasnt seen a salary in two months.\n\nWe used to be self-sufficient through our salaries, says Stanley, who asked to use his middle name for fear of losing his job. That stability is gone.\n\nCompanies in Zimbabwes brickmaking sector are feeling the pressure from growing competition by foreign-backed companies expanding into the retail end of the industry.\n\nBy law, this shouldnt be happening. The countrys Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act reserves the retail sector and others  including wholesale trade, employment agencies and advertising  for its citizens. Foreign nationals require permission from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to operate in these sectors.\n\nThe law, passed in 2007, is among policies pursued by the former President Robert Mugabes government to redress colonial imbalances that excluded Zimbabwes black majority from owning or meaningfully participating in key sectors of the economy.\n\nBut like the land reforms, which also meant to address these imbalances, the policy has long been controversial. Some say it has mostly created regulatory uncertainty, benefited those with close links to the state, and driven away much-needed foreign direct investment, among other concerns.\n\nSince its introduction, the policy has undergone some changes under President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration to open up the economy for more investment. Through a 2018 Finance Act, the government revised the language and reserved these sectors to Zimbabwean citizens rather than indigenous Zimbabweans as the original policy stated. It also limited a 51% local ownership requirement to businesses that extract diamonds and platinum.\n\nCritics say while well-intentioned, the policy is inconsistently applied. Some foreign firms sidestep the requirements with relative ease.\n\nIn the brickmaking sector, companies like Willdale Bricks  which once dominated the industry and employs hundreds  are being edged out by foreign-backed manufacturers that are extending into retail.\n\nGlobal Press Journal directly contacted several companies registered with Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency as brick manufacturers  including Tiger Bricks, Preedon Bricks and Obrim Bricks  all registered as foreign investments. Each confirmed they sell directly to customers.\n\nWhen asked if the companies had the permission required, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce did not respond. Global Press Journal also requested information on special licenses issued in recent years but did not get any response by the time of publication.\n\nHowever, an official in the department of economic empowerment at the ministry familiar with the matter, who did not want to be named for fear of losing his job, says that since he joined the ministry in 2019 it has not allowed any foreign companies to sell bricks. If [foreign] companies are selling bricks either through retail or wholesale without such permission, its unlawful, he says.\n\nSuch licenses usually last five years, he says, and if there are any companies that had these licenses before his arrival at the ministry, they would have lapsed by now.\n\nEven if they have licenses, its still a problem, says Godfrey Kanyenze, founding director of the Labour and Economic Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe. Brickmaking, he says, is one of the clear areas that should be reserved for locals.\n\nThere is no real point in having people come from far away to do what locals can do. Brickmaking is not a complicated economic activity that should require foreign direct investment, Kanyenze says, adding that the country should seek foreign investment in more complex capital- and skill-intensive areas.Our locals, even in the villages, make bricks.\n\nBricks move along the production line at Obrim Bricks. Despite laws reserving the retail sector for citizens, foreign companies continue to sell directly to customers, raising concerns among local producers. Photo: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThe indigenization policy is increasingly tested as Zimbabwe, like many other countries in Africa, embraces Chinese investment. In 2023, the government issued about 369 new licenses to Chinese investors, accounting for 60% of all foreign investment that year and representing about 154% more investors than 2022.\n\nWhile the capital that comes from foreign direct investment can be beneficial to the country, the cost is steep. Its a double-edged sword, says Joe Muzurura, a political analyst who has written extensively about this issue in Zimbabwe. Its eroding local industries, he says, citing the example of Willdale Bricks, which is no longer the giant it used to be.\n\nIf well regulated, foreign direct investment could support local players and help grow domestic industry, Muzurura says. Instead, he says, its stifling [them].\n\nAlready, local brick companies are under strain from the countrys worsening economic conditions. Willdale Bricks 2024 annual report shows that the company was struggling with liquidity constraints and high production costs. And a 15% value-added tax introduced in 2024 on the supply of bricks has pushed customers to cheaper, often non-compliant alternatives.\n\nBeta Bricks, also a local brick manufacturing company and part of the Beta Holdings group, entered corporate rescue proceedings in January after defaulting on loans.\n\nBoth companies did not respond to Global Press Journal requests for interviews.\n\nObrim Brick Manufacturers is an investment company registered as a manufacturer and majority-owned by Chinese shareholders. Anesu Kondo, an accountant at Obrim, says their operations are fully compliant.\n\nWhile Kondo says they do not have a special license from the ministry that would allow them to operate in retail, he says selling their product directly to customers should not be mistaken as retail trade. We are not acting as middlemen. We are selling what we produce, he says.\n\nForeign companies are only filling a gap left by struggling local companies, Kondo adds. When we entered the market, the major players werent meeting demand. Local companies werent recapitalizing, and many still rely on outdated brickmaking technologies.\n\nSuch interpretation is simply stretching the law, says Nyasha Brighton Munyuru, a managing partner at Muvingi and Mugadza Legal Practitioners, adding that the law is clear: Such a company needs permission from the ministry to operate in retail.\n\nWorkers stack bricks for delivery at Obrim Bricks. Analysts warn that foreign-backed firms with greater production capacity are edging out Zimbabwean companies already struggling with rising costs and economic instability. Photo: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThe government has failed to implement the law, says Henry, a senior employee at Willdale Bricks who has worked at the company for nearly 25 years. He requested the use of his first name only, for fear of losing his job.\n\nBefore a foreign business sets up its operations, there should be strict rules in place and enforcement to match. But that rarely happens, he says, adding that some foreign companies operating in the country arent formally registered with authorities.\n\nGenerally, there is a double standard in how authorities implement regulations, he says. They allow foreign investors to evade taxes and regulations, while local businesses face intense scrutiny. Were expected to comply fully, bank all our earnings, and accept local currency that constantly loses value, he says.\n\nForeign companies bypass the requirements that weigh down local producers, making it hard for locals to compete, Stanley says.\n\nOn top of that, the foreign companies have the added advantage of superior technology and greater production capacity, says Muzurura, the analyst.\n\nZimbabwe isnt the only one grappling with the ripple effects of foreign investment on local businesses.\n\nIn Zambia, Chinese-owned enterprises dominate sectors such as mining and retail, often undercutting local entrepreneurs with lower prices, according to 2018 research by the International Institute for Environment and Development.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, according to a 2023 report by the International Collective in Support for Fishworkers, the Hambantota Port project, largely funded by Chinese investment, has strained local livelihoods. The projects large-scale fishing operations have encroached on traditional fishing grounds, making access difficult for local fishermen.\n\nAnd in Vietnam, while Chinese manufacturing companies in the textiles and electronics sectors have created jobs, they also have displaced small Vietnamese producers who struggle to compete with the Chinese firms lower prices and greater production capabilities, according to a 2017 report from the Harbin Engineering Universitys School of Economics and Management.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, this shift happens at a time when the economy is fragile and unemployment is high  a dangerous mix.\n\nAs their salaries havent been guaranteed, both Stanley and Henry have had to find other means to subsist.\n\nHenry takes on side jobs to make ends meet.\n\nIn the past, working at Willdale was something to be proud of. Now, even informal vendors seem better off, Henry says. We are in a dire state.\n\nLinda Mujuruis a Global Press Journal reporter-in-residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nGlobal Press Journal delivers bold, investigative and in-depth explanatory reporting on the worlds most urgent issues.\n\n",

Power has been taken by the Ministry. Legally Ministry does not have the power to withhold a letter of good standing, but it is still doing that.\n\nLetter of good standing is supposed to be given so that one can go wherever he wants. If I have done anything wrong just write rather than withholding it.

The original concept always had influencers, crime and counterfeit bags at its core, although the story did evolve in development. Bad Influencer allowed me to explore these worlds with humour, social tension and emotional depth, while still having fun with the wildness of internet culture.\n\nShe tells Drum that she also wanted to interrogate how we measure value in a world where women dont have power or financial freedom.\n\nInfluence, beauty, wealth and success are often curated illusions, and chasing them without grounding can feel exhilarating but can be dangerous. That said, I also want audiences to laugh, reflect, and question the ladders we climb to attain power and social currency.\n\nLed by Jo-Anne Reyneke, Cindy Mahlangu and Thapelo Mokoena, the cast brings to life the female-driven crime story rooted in the belly of Johannesburg streets.\n\nArt plays in the hands of reality as the Zimbabwean producer also leads in various male-dominated creative spaces.Im redefining power on my own terms. Im taking up space, building ecosystems instead of waiting for permission, and creating opportunities for others as I climb. My responsibility is not just to tell stories, but to help create platforms and initiatives where African women can own, build and lead their creative futures.\n\nShe explains how she bridges storytelling across TV, comics and gaming.\n\nI build worlds first. The medium becomes an extension of the universe. Each platform deepens the audience experience and longevity of the intellectual property (IP). Africa doesnt yet have the full transmedia infrastructure, but thats also the opportunity. The goal is not just to make content from one IP, but also to build entire story universes with unique offerings at each product vertical, from video games to merchandise, to animation and film.\n\nIP is legacy. Its economic freedom. Its how we build generational wealth in storytelling, she adds.\n\nFrom as far back as she can remember, her imaginative mind has always bred stories itching to be told.\n\nAs a child, I would write my own version of Peter Rabbit stories, and later, Id write plays in high school. That instinct followed me into journalism, and eventually into film production and screenwriting. For me, storytelling has always been a way of making sense of human behaviour, power, identity, and possibility.\n\nHer upbringing between different cultures, countries and identities also turned her perspective into a muscle she could exercise from an early stage in her life.\n\nWith a background in journalism, I also learned to observe and question narratives early in my career. Id like to believe that my upbringing shaped my hunger, resilience, and belief in creating things that outlive me, whether thats a story world, a book, a platform, or a shift in how we imagine African stories.\n\nOver the years, the creative in her late 30s has been part of international fellowships and labs in which shes championed feminine power and ownership.\n\nNow with Bad Influencer out on Netflix, shes already on to the next project. Her new project is Artemis Elixa; she shares with Drum what its all about.\n\nArtemis Elixa is a pan-African sci-fi franchise about a brilliant engineer from the future who time-travels back to stop a rogue super-intelligence from taking over humanity. Each mission sends her across the continent, from Congos mineral frontlines to Nairobis tech corridors.\n\nWith each mission, she confronts power, exploitation, and the ethics of progress. Its an African answer to Lara Croft meets The Terminator, with a touch of Black Panther, grounded in our real-world trajectory of technology, geopolitics, and African innovation. Its part graphic novel, part game, part cinematic world. The comic will be launching in 2026, she concludes the conversation with Drum.\n\n",
