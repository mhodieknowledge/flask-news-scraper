ACF enjoys a strong reputation and has injected hundreds of millions of US dollars into the countrys economy since its inception.\n\nZimbabwe is home to some 19% of global chrome ore reserves  the second largest in the world.

It is also not in dispute that the property they owned was in both their names and that it was sold for US$65,000.00.\n\nIn my view even if the court accepts that they were not in a business partnership, he cannot escape this obvious reality that she owned half of what they considered the marital home.\n\nBy registering the property in both names she obtained a half share.\n\nAlso, since there was no business partnership in the strict sense of that word relating to his cell phone business, the loan to Anita had nothing to do with the plaintiff.\n\nHe could not have used her half share of the proceeds from the sale of the property in which he owned half of it, to cover his own business loan.\n\nHe owes her US$32,500.00, ruled the judge before ordering Naison to pay the amount over a period of six months or such period as the parties may agree between themselves in writing.\n\nThe court heard the couple fell in love in 2013 and started living together the following year.\n\nKadiyo told the court that she gave birth to their first child in 2015 and stopped going to work.\n\nParties agreed to start a joint venture, selling mobile phones, the court heard.\n\nKadiyo said she contributed US$500 to this effect.\n\nShe said they obtained a US$35,000 loan from one Anita based in China which they paid within a month.\n\nThe couple according to Kadiya would make around US$7,000 everyday from their sales.\n\nShe would occasionally go to the shops when her husband was away on business trips as she was saddled with the responsibility of looking after a young child.\n\nThey then bought a stand in Haydon Park and started building up to the roof level whentheydecided to sell the house.\n\nShe also testified that at the time of their separation in 2023, they had cell phone stock worth US$40,000.00.\n\nKadiya had claimed US$20,000.00 as her half share of that stock but she did not have proof to that effect.\n\nIn his evidence, Naison denied that they had a business partnership.\n\nHe denied that she had ever given him US$500.00 to order more stock.\n\nNaison said the plaintiff knew of his business as a wife but that this did not make her a business partner.\n\nHe however admitted that they had bought a stand, which had been put in both their names.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nICT Minister Tatenda Mavetera is facing a firestorm of criticism for leading a provocative song targeting Acting President General Constantino Chiwenga. This dramatic scene unfolded yesterday at the National Heroes Acre in Harare, exposing the deep fault lines within Zanu PF.\n\nMavetera, who formed the Young Women for ED group ahead of the disputed 2023 elections, was seen in the stands leading her group in a song with the lyrics: mupanduki mupanduki nguva yakwana, chera mwena which translates to traitor, traitor, your time is up.This song, like a dagger aimed at the heart, indirectly accused Acting President Chiwenga of being a traitor.\n\nThe burial of national hero Justin Mupamhanga became a stage for open Zanu PF infighting, much to the embarrassment of the party and government.\n\nThe division was evident: two groups in the stands, as different as night and day. One group, dressed in pink Young Women For ED t-shirts and led by Mavetera, clashed with another group sharing space with soldiers.\n\nMaveteras group also waved faux crocodiles in the air, a display of loyalty to President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nThese supporters of Mavetera clashed head-on with the other group, who loudly praised Chiwenga and sang in his support, with the refrain: siyanai naye Chiwenga munovengerei or leave Chiwenga alone, why do you hate him?. This pro-Chiwenga group grew even more fervent every time Chiwenga spoke against corruption  their support, like a tidal wave, building with each denunciation.\n\nNtokozo Msipha, Secretary-General of the General Chiwenga Voluntary Supporters Association, stated that Mavetera had crossed the line, calling her actions at the national shrine not just reckless but provocative.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday morning, Msipha said: Hon Minister, you have crossed the line. This must never happen again. Let this statement serve as a final warning. Discipline, respect and loyalty are the cornerstones of leadership. Those who fail to uphold them will find themselves on the wrong side of history.\n\nLast week, during the burial of three other national heroes, Chiwenga himself had described disrespect as a mortal sin which he said cannot be forgiven on earth and in heaven  a pronouncement now hanging over this conflict like a dark cloud.\n\nClive Malunga, a staunch critic of the Mnangagwa 2030 agenda and a veteran of the liberation struggle, told NewZimbabwe.Com that Mavetera was a disrespectful and a Mnangagwa bootlicker who has neglected her duties, focusing instead on pleasing one man over the needs of the country.\n\nThe calibre of ministers that we have in the current government are just bootlickers and they are always bent on pleasing an individual over the citizens of Zimbabwe. Mavetera should stop that kind of 1950s politics. She should concentrate on her ministry and constituency, Malunga said, his words dripping with disdain.\n\nPolitical analyst Lazurus Sauti, a lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe, said that Mnangagwas cabinet was not formed on merit basis.\n\nMost, if not all, public office holders are not chosen based on merit. So, they lack knowledge on how to formulate policies that can transform our economy in many respects. Mavetera is a prime example. She was busy at the national shrine dancing kongonya dissing political opponents instead of promoting ICT policies, he added, his tone critical.\n\nAttempts to get a comment from Minister Mavetera proved unsuccessful, with her mobile phone going unanswered.\n\nZanu PF spokesperson Farai Marapira distanced the party from Maveteras actions.\n\nYoung Women for ED is an affiliate of the party Zanu PF and it is an independent juristic person therefore it has its own structures that speak and defend on its own behalf. I speak on behalf of the party, Marapira said.\n\nThis event has thrown the simmering tensions within Zanu PF into sharp relief, revealing a party divided and struggling to contain its internal conflicts. The political stage is set for more drama as the rival factions continue to threaten tear each other apart.\n\nSocial media was set ablaze this morning, as many erupted with a cacophony of commentary and fervent debate surrounding Maveteras conduct at the National Heroes Acre yesterday.\n\nThe incandescent display of factionalism at the hallowed grounds of the national shrine has spurred a maelstrom of reactions, with many suggesting that the minister should perhaps commence preparations for an expeditious departure from Zimbabwe.\n\nThese voices, fuelled by historical precedent, posit that her exit strategy should mirror the abrupt exoduses of Professor Jonathan Moyo and his coterie of G40 kingpins who fled the nation during the tumultuous Operation Restore Legacy in 2017.\n\nThis military-led intervention forced the resignation of the late President Robert Mugabe, leaving key loyalists to his wife, Grace Mugabe, under the G40 banner scrambling for sanctuary in disparate locales beyond the borders of Zimbabwe.\n\n",

The Zimbabwean government enforces that formal companies also take the local unit of exchange for purchases while informal players mostly trade in US dollars, leaving retailers at a disadvantage.\n\nThe operating environment in Zimbabwe remains complex, influenced by policy changes and currency instability. The beverages sector faces further challenges relating to uncompetitive retail prices arising from high input costs and taxes which attract lower priced imports from the region and policy driven changes to the route to market, said Delta Corp secretary, Faith Musinga.\n\nDelta Corp cited fluctuations in exchange rates, disruptions in utilities supply (electricity and water), and varied consumer spending patterns during the traditional summer and festive peak period as the key developments that marred the operating environment during the quarter period to the end of December 2024.\n\nDuring the period under review, Delta managed to lift lager beer volumes by 4% over prior year same period. This was despite some disruptions to supply arising from prolonged water and power outages.\n\nInterestingly, demand remained firm and this had resulted in some mismatches in the supply of key brands and packs. The uplift in lager beer volumes was a consequence of the companys recent investments into capacity.\n\nDelta Corps sorghum based opaque beer volume for Zimbabwe grew by 2% for the quarter, but declined by 2% for the nine months compared to prior year.\n\nVolumes for the companys sparkling beverages (that includes brands such as Coca-Cola, Fanta and others) declined by 16% during the quarter compared to prior year.\n\nThe volume loss is attributed to the impact of sugar tax-induced price increases and the surge in imports from the region, explained Musinga.\n\nThe sectors competitiveness was affected by the relatively high sugar tax and cost differentials, leading to an increase in imports of similar offerings from neighbouring countries.\n\nZimbabwe introduced a sugar content surtax in January 2024.\n\nMusinga further said that the exchange rate disparities that dogged the quarter contributed to pricing misalignment in the formal sectors while the tight liquidity conditions that prevailed during the quarter resulted in sub-optimal stocking patterns in key retail channels.\n\nGroup revenue for the quarter only marginally increased by 1% compared to prior year and grew by 7% for the nine months. The company said this reflected the mixed volume performance across its business units.\n\nPart of the revenue increase in soft drinks was also related to the sugar tax induced price increases.\n\nNonetheless, the proportion of sales in US dollars varied month-to-month in response to the exchange rate and changes to the route to market but remained above 70% for the year.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Congress of Trade of Unions (ZCTU) has blamed misdirected Fiscal and Monetary Policy initiatives for accelerated company closures on the back of calls for authorities to avert the crises.\n\nThe calls come on the back of companies such as regional retailer Choppies Enterprise Limited (Choppies) and British multinational professional services and fast-moving consumer goods firms, PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited and Unilever plc indicating the intention to close down operations in Zimbabwe.\n\nFirms like cement manufacturer Khayah Cement Limited and clothing retailer Truworths Limited entered corporate rescue in December and August 2024, respectively.\n\nAt the core of the escalation in problems being experienced by industry is the flooding of the local ZWG currency in the formal sector at a time when companies have no easily accessible route to obtain the much-needed US$.\n\nIn its annual assessment for the just-ended year of 2024, the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) bemoaned the lack of willing foreign currency sellers in the Interbank Market, leaving many companies in a dire situation.\n\nThe complex problems come on the back of limited access to capital from local banks which continue to struggle to meet productive needs at reasonable rates.\n\nIn a statement, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) acting secretary general, Runesu Dzimiri blamed policies in operation for the demise which is leaving the countrys workers hardest hit.\n\nThe companies that are closing are all citing skewed fiscal and monetary policies that are pushing the retail sector out, including imports of not only cheap but also fake goods that are being sold in the informal sector. While those who are importing these cheap goods are not paying any taxes, formal shops are forced to pay hefty taxes, pushing them to bankruptcy, he said.\n\nDzimiri said it is time the government realizes that there is a serious impact on the economy if the retail and wholesale sector is left to collapse.\n\nFirst, when jobs are lost, the government will also lose revenue not only on corporate taxes but also in the form of Pay as You Earn (PAYE) and it will obviously fail to meet its operational requirements as well as meeting social services. As PAYE is depleted, the Value Added Tax will also be eroded as workers will not have disposable income, he said.\n\nSecondly, he said pension schemes both private and public will be affected as every employee whose contract is terminated will look up to the government for social welfare but resources are scarce at the moment.\n\nThe labour organ said lack of access to social protection and benefits usually associated with full-time employment leaves employees vulnerable and dependent on the already strained public service provisions.\n\nThirdly, the ZCTU leader said the general condition of fear and insecurity also dissuades workers from joining trade unions, leaving them even more vulnerable to precarious work arrangements leaving communities in unstable and insecure situations due to disruptions of their life plans.\n\nAdded Dzimiri, The ZCTU demands the government to move fast and address the situation and immediately stop the current wave of company closures. The ZCTU warns the government that the current carnage in the retail and wholesale sector is a recipe for political instability as disgruntled workers will turn against their government for failure to protect them.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nUpmarket residential stands at Spitzkop Farm being sold by property developer, Leengate are under scrutiny after the farm owner stumbled upon adverts of her land being advertised without her knowledge.\n\nSpitzkop farm owner, Diana Catherine Rodrigues has since approached the High Court seeking an order against Spitzkop Farm Residents Association which sold the land to Leengate.\n\nRodrigues said the association illegally obtained a court order declaring the farm as abandoned.\n\nThe order was granted by former judge Webster Chinamhora who resigned from the bench in 2023 ahead of a tribunal inquiry into his suitability to hold office following a litany of allegations against him.\n\nHe was under fire for delivering a judgement in a case he never heard.\n\nIn the present matter, Rodrigues told the High Court that she became aware of the order against her on August 1 2024 after she had engaged her lawyers to find out why Leengate was advertising and selling her land.\n\nThe 1st and 2nd Respondents (Spitzkop Farm Residents Association and Tinashe Mananzva) representing the association had approached the High Court via the chamber book for an order in terms of the Titles Registration and Derelict Lands Act.\n\nThe said process was never served on me. As appears on the record attached above, the 1st and 2nd Respondents alleged that our whereabouts were unknown despite the fact that I was born and raised in Zimbabwe and have always resided in Zimbabwe, she said.\n\nThe record of proceedings also shows that the respondents advertised their provisional and final order in the Herald Newspaper relating to a different deed and not Rodrigues.\n\nHowever, in this digital world, I have not bought a single hard-copy newspaper for the last ten years.\n\nFurther, the matter was filed and processed during the novel Covid 19 era in which most people chose to stay indoors both in compliance with WHO and Zimbabwean regulations around self-distancing and lockdowns.\n\nThe above facts illustrate but one thing; that I was never in willful default. The explanation for my failure to oppose the process commenced before this Honourable Court is reasonable, she said.\n\nShe alleged that no due diligence was done to contact her and went to attach the Zvimba RDC assessment notices for the payment of levies which contains her address as P.O Box 1593, Harare.\n\nRodrigues said the address is still active and houses a company she jointly owns with her late husband.\n\nShe also told the High Court that the residents took advantage of Covid-19 to mount an application with full knowledge that the prospects of it going unopposed and unseen by her were high.\n\nRodrigues said she never abandoned her farm and still has interest in it.\n\nI am the co-owner of the undivided share in two pieces of land situated in the district of Salisbury called Lot 10A and Lot 11Spitzkop registered under Deed of Transfer Number 2568/88. See Annexure C being a copy of my deed.\n\nThe 1st and 2nd Respondents approached the court alleging that the land was abandoned by its owners and desired to acquire it.\n\nThat was not true. I never at any point abandoned my land and still want it. In any event, the 1st and 2nd Respondents founding affidavit referred to DT2563/88. I am advised that a case stands or falls on its founding papers.\n\nShe said the association cannot seek to hold on to a default judgment adding that she deserves to be heard on merits.\n\nShe said she wanted to understand how the court issued an order when the application and all adverts related to a different deed.\n\nRodrigues said she bought the property in question in 1988 together with the late Urebai Rodrigues.\n\nShe said it is therefore not just for her to lose the property to the respondents who did not spend any money on it.\n\nThe applicant also said at no stage did the respondents mistake their status as farm employees.\n\nIn their own words, they were cheap labour, she said.\n\nShe also complained that the court was not told about the current membership of the association and how long they have resided at the property and on what basis.\n\nSecondly, I deny the fact that the 1st and 2nd Respondents resided at the property at any time before the present application.\n\nThe farm was vacant as we always went to check if no land barons had taken up occupation on the land. It was in one of these regular checks that we discovered that access roads were being created in the land and some land developers had started advertising for sale.\n\nThe 1st and 2nd Respondents alleged that they conducted a thorough due diligence with the Zvimba RDC and found that rates had never been paid since 1988. This is false. Of note is the fact that Zvimba RDC only came into being in 1993. So how could rates be paid in 1988 to a non-existent entity?\n\nTo further demonstrate the fabrications, Zvimba RDC would write and deliver a rates assessment letter to me at my physical address which I still use to date, every year until 2002 when it stopped. I would, as such, pay the assessed levy, the last of which was paid in 2002- the last year the RDC sent the assessment.\n\nA perusal of the record will reveal that the application and founding affidavit as well as the draft order referred to Deed of Transfer Number 2563/88. The said Deed of Transfer does not belong to me or relate to my land, she said.\n\n",
