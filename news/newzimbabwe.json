Life can feel overwhelming, and the influence of evil spirits and the devil seems to loom larger as we stray from our spiritual foundations.Yet, in the midst of this turmoil, we are reminded of the powerful promise found in Jeremiah 29:13: You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.This verse encapsulates the essence of pursuing a relationship with Jesus Christ, the ultimate source of hope and strength.The story of Zacchaeus in Luke 19:1-10 serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of our efforts to seek Christ. Zacchaeus, a tax collector, was determined to see Jesus, even climbing a sycamore tree to catch a glimpse of Him.Interestingly, despite his efforts, it was not Zacchaeus who found Jesus first; rather, Jesus saw him. This teaches us that even our smallest attempts to seek Christ matter.When Jesus called out to Zacchaeus, saying, Hurry and come down! For I must stay at your house today, He demonstrated that He is always ready to respond to our desires for connection. Jesus sees us before we see Him, and He invites us into a relationship that transforms our lives.Jesus invites us to try me and see if I dont find favour in you. This call to test His goodness is echoed in Malachi 3:10, where we are encouraged to bring our whole selves to Him.When we seek the face of Christ, we open ourselves to the possibility of His grace and favour, enabling us to confront our challenges with renewed strength.As we invite Christ into our lives, He establishes a permanent relationship with us. This relationship empowers us to conquer our difficulties and stand firm against the adversities we face.When we put our minds and faith in Christ, we are reminded that we are not alone. He walks with us, guiding and supporting us through every trial.The call to seek the word of the cross is a call to embrace a relationship with Jesus Christ. Like Zacchaeus, let us not be discouraged by our limitations but instead be encouraged by the knowledge that every effort we make to seek Him is met with His love and grace.As we draw closer to Him, we prepare ourselves to be called children of God when He returns. Let us seek the face of Christ, for in doing so, we find our true strength and purpose.PRAYERHeavenly Father,We come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your presence and the transformative power of the cross. Thank You for the gift of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who invites us to draw near to Him. We acknowledge that in the midst of our challenges, it is easy to lose sight of You, but we desire to seek Your face with all our hearts.Lord, just as Zacchaeus climbed the sycamore tree in his pursuit of You, grant us the courage to climb beyond our fears and doubts. Help us to reach for You, knowing that even our smallest efforts are seen by You. We trust that You are always looking out for us and that Your love is eager to embrace us.As we navigate the trials of life, may we find strength in Your Word and comfort in Your promises. Teach us to rely on You, and let our faith be unwavering. Help us to recognize the influence of darkness around us and empower us to stand firm in Your light.Lord, we ask that You come into our homes and hearts, establishing a deep and lasting relationship with us. May our lives reflect Your love and grace, and may we be filled with the hope of being called Your children when You return. Remove all the tribulations and pains we find ourselves in today. Restore peace and make us rejoin all our families in love and harmony once again.In Jesus name, we pray.AMEN.\n\nIn todays world, filled with challenges and uncertainties, the call to seek the face of Christ has never been more urgent.
