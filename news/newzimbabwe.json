            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature, and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week we want to discuss public-private partnerships in Zimbabwe, what they are and whether they are a goodconsiderationin theinvestment area.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nAs the name suggests, it is a partnership between the government on behalf of its people and a private player in the development of a particular project. Potential projects capable of investment vary and may range from projects like dam construction, road and rail infrastructure development, power generation and so forth. The opportunities are vast.\n\nThe motivation for the government is to provide its people with the necessary infrastructure at an affordable cost, including in projects where charges are defrayed directly to the public, for example, toll fees, while the motivation of the private sector is to maximise profits.\n\nThese motivations are the underlying guide to the contract negotiation process.\n\nSo in short, a typical Public Private Partnership will have the private company designing, funding, constructing and even implementing the project while the government monitors compliance with the undertakings made in the contract and in some instances allows for concessions within its capacity, like tax incentives to assist in expediting project implementation.\n\nReporter:Are PPPs in Zimbabwe a good area for investment in light of the potential economic risks?\n\nVM: The first thing to consider is that Zimbabwe is a developing country. That being said, it follows that there is a lot of scope where private players can partner up with the government to deliver necessary infrastructure at a profit.\n\nThe issue of risk, which is critical in all negotiations with all governments around the world, can be mitigated by understanding our economic model and laws. Our law makes it a condition precedent before entering any public-private partnership that the company or private party intending to enter into a Public-Private Partnership must undertake a thorough feasibility study of the project.\n\nThis feasibility study will highlight all the potential risks that may emanate from the project and such risks are then allocated to the best party capable of managing or mitigating them in the partnership contract.\n\nReporter: Where will a person contemplating a PPP go in the government to get assistance?\n\nVM: The Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (ZIDA) and specifically the Public Private Partnership Unit within the agency, is responsible for the examination and review of the project, including its risk allocation. For a project to proceed to implementation, it requires the approval of the PPP unit and the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion.\n\nIn unsolicited projects, where for instance, a private player has land that can be utilized in PPP to unlock value, the first port of call will obviously be the local council or responsible ministry with a comprehensive proposal outlining its value to the state and corresponding implementation requirements, be it legal, financial or technical.\n\nShould the government body responsible be satisfied with the proposal, it will then refer it to the PPP unit for evaluation. If the PPP unit gives the go-ahead, then the government body can enter negotiations with the private party for a mutually beneficial operating contract.\n\nReporter: What are the main considerations when negotiating a PPP?\n\nVM: It is critical to understand that PPPs are not a one-size-fits-all. Each PPP will address unique issues in a manner appropriate for that particular transaction. The underlying motivation for the parties remaining, as I stated earlier, the government intends to provide infrastructure at the best cost, and the private player intends to maximise as much profit. It is always best to allocate a portion of the profit as a buffer against unforeseen events like an increase in costs, delays in the project, which also have cost consequences, technical defects etc.\n\nAnother key consideration will be the model of the PPP, whether a Build Transfer PPP, a Build Operate and Transfer, Build Lease and Transfer. The type of structure should be one most suited to address projects particular risks.\n\nThe private partner on the other hand, may also be interested in achieving as many fiscal benefits as possible, which may include duty exemptions on capital goods, investment allowances, tax breaks or special rates et cetera.\n\nSpecial attention should also be afforded to the general contract clauses, like your dispute resolution clauses. They should allow provision for negotiated settlements as a first step in this type of contract, then consider alternative methods when negotiation fails. Other key clauses are your step-in, force majeure, and termination clauses as read with the undertakings clauses.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

            "content": "By UK Correspondent\n\nLabour MP Dawn Butler has withdrawn from an international summit in London after learning she was advertised as a speaker alongsideAuxilliaMnangagwa, Zimbabwes First Lady, who is under US sanctions for alleged corruption and gold smuggling. The decision follows fierce backlash from Zimbabwean activists, who accuse Mnangagwa of hypocrisy and have pledged to disrupt the event with protests.\n\nThe First Ladies of African Impact & Resilience (FLAIR) Summit, due to take place on 17-18 June at the Leonardo Royal Hotelin London, aims to spotlight female leadership and investment in Africa. But Mnangagwas inclusion has ignited controversy, prompting Butlers exit and raising questions about the participation of two other British politicians, Labour MP Diane Abbott and Conservative peer Baroness Sandip Verma.\n\nLabour MP Dawn Butler\n\nIn a statement, Butlers office said: We have never agreed to speaking at this event, so are rightly concerned that Dawn is being advertised as a speaker at this summit. We have contacted the organisers and asked them to remove her name from their programme immediately. The move came after Zimbabwean diaspora activists delivered a petition to 10 Downing Street, calling for Mnangagwa to be barred from the UK.\n\nA Controversial Guest\n\nAuxilliaMnangagwa, married to Zimbabwes President Emmerson Mnangagwa, was sanctioned by the US in 2023 under the Global Magnitsky Act. An Al Jazeera investigation,Gold Mafia, alleged she played a key role in smuggling gold and diamonds, funnelling profits to the ruling elite while Zimbabwes economy crumbled. Over 80% of Zimbabweans are unemployed, and 5.6 million face food insecurity, according to the World Food Programme. Last years elections, widely criticised as fraudulent by the EU, SADCand others, further entrenched the regimes grip on power.\n\nDespite this, Mnangagwa has cast herself as an advocate for womens empowermenta claim activists dismiss as a sham. On 4 June, campaigner JosephineJenje-Mudimbuled a protest outside Downing Street, delivering a petition to block Mnangagwas entry. In a video on X, she said: Charity begins at home.Auxilliashould clean up the mess she and her husband are creating in Zimbabwe. There is no room forAuxilliato come to the UK to present herself at FLAIR.\n\nIve got a message for Auxillia Mnangagwa, the illegitimate First Lady.\n\nThese were the first few words by Josephine Jenje-Mudimbu as she started. She was standing in front of 10 Downing Street in London, on the 4th of June 2025 as part of a protest that was also handing in apic.twitter.com/SbPCPvghXA\n\n Zimbabwe Freedom of Expression (@ZimbabweFreedo1)June 12, 2025\n\nThe outrage has spilled onto social media. X user @MilMillazwrote: AuxilliaMnangagwa must not be given a platform at the #FLAIRSummit. She represents a brutal regime responsible for abductions, mass corruption, and human rights abuses.\n\nPolitical Fallout\n\nButlers withdrawal has turned the spotlight on Abbott and Verma, both still listed as speakers. Abbott, a veteran Labour MP, and Verma, the UKs Ministerial Champion for Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls Overseas, have yet to clarify their stances. For Verma, the stakes are high: her role puts her at odds with sharing a stage with the spouse of a leader linked to state violence. Neither responded to inquiriesemailed to their offices last week.\n\nThe silence has fuelled criticism. Would these MPs sit with the spouse of a Russian oligarch? asked @ChirevoChamisaon X. If not, what makes Zimbabwe different? Activists argue that hosting Mnangagwa undermines the summits stated mission and sends a dangerous signal to Zimbabwean women enduring repression.\n\nThe FLAIR Summits organisers have remained tight-lipped, though sources suggest Mnangagwas participation could be reconsidered as protests mount. With just days until the event, the row exposes a broader dilemma: how to balance diplomatic engagement with accountability for human rights abuses.\n\nAs activists prepare to shut it down, the summits future hangs in the balance.\n\n",

Most of the victims belonged to the minority Ndebele tribe.\n\nMugabe, who died in 2019, never acknowledged responsibility for the massacres, dismissing evidence gathered by Amnesty International as a heap of lies.\n\nAfter taking power in 2017, Mnangagwa promised a resolution and set up a panel of chiefs to probe the massacres.\n\nFlawed process\n\nBut activists said the process was flawed as there had been no official government apology and victims were not consulted.\n\nActivist Mbuso Fuzwayo on Sunday dismissed the initiative as a sham from the start.\n\nThis is being dealt with from the position of the perpetrator and not the victims, he told AFP.\n\nSome of the known perpetrators are people in positions of power and they are the ones who led the initiative from the start, Fuzwayo said.\n\nMnangagwa, who has previously described the massacres as a bad patch in Zimbabwes history, was security minister at the time but has always denied any responsibility.\n\n",

Some countries were overstaying the U.S. visas their citizens were being granted.Other reasons for concern were the nationals of the country were involved in acts of terrorism in the United States, or antisemitic and anti-American activity.The cable noted that not all of these concerns pertained to every country listed.We are constantly reevaluating policies to ensure the safety of Americans and that foreign nationals follow our laws, a senior State Department official said, declining to comment on specific internal deliberations and communications.The Department of State is committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process, the official said.The countries that could face a full or a partial ban if they do not address these concerns within the next 60 days are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cote DIvoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Ethiopia, Egypt, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.That would be a significant expansion of the ban that came into effect earlier this month.

The Zimbabwe sprinting duo took the top two spots on the podium.\n\nTrailing the Zimbabweans was Garrett Kaalund of USC, who broke the 20-second barrier for the first time to claim third in 19.96 seconds.\n\nJust missing the podium was a name that may sound familiar to Big Blue Nation: Jordan Anthony.The former Kentucky wide receiver and sprinter, now competing for Arkansas, finished fourth in 20.01 seconds.\n\nThe dual-sport athlete has continued both his football and track careers with the Razorbacks since transferring in 2022.\n\nTMars McCallum, the early-season world leader from Tennessee, finished fifth in 20.16 seconds.\n\nUSCs Max Thomas followed in sixth with 20.23, Xavier Butler of Texas ran 20.39 to place seventh and Abdul-Rasheed Saminu of South Florida rounded out the heat in 20.55 seconds.\n\nAfter successfully sweeping the event in Nationals this year, he added 10 points to the team total.\n\nMakarawu helped Kentucky finish tied for eighth in the team standings with 22 total points.\n\nThe Harare native will now set his sights on the 2025 World Championships in Tokyo this September, where he will represent his native country alongside some of the NCAAs best to compete against the best athletes the sport has ever seen.\n\n",
