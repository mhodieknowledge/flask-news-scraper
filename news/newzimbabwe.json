            "content": "Xinhua\n\nKirsty Coventry, poised to become the first woman and the first African to lead the International Olympic Committee, has laid out her vision for the future of the Olympic Movement, grounded in its core values and potential for global unity.\n\nCoventry, elected in March during the 144th IOC Session in Greece, will assume the presidency on June 23, succeeding Thomas Bach, who has led the organization since 2013. She received 49 of 97 votes in the first round, prevailing over six other candidates.\n\nValues are what have led this movement for over a hundred years. Its whats kept this movement intertwined together. And that is something that we can never compromise, the 41-year-old Zimbabwean told the Olympic Channel at the Olympic House in Lausanne on Thursday.\n\nWe have to be proud that were a movement that not just lives by its values, but shares its values, and promotes its values, Coventry said.\n\nAnd if we can find more ways to do that in the future, and can reach all households around the world, thats part of my goal. How do we have more reach to communities across our massive globe? How do we reach those children to share our values with them? How do we reach them to inspire them?\n\nDespite the weight of expectations that accompany the role, Coventry expressed enthusiasm about the opportunity to lead.\n\nI dont really look at the presidency as a weight, she said. Are there a lot of expectations? Yes. Does that come with a lot of responsibility? Yes. But Im really so honored to have been given this opportunity, and Im so excited for what the future holds. Its a movement that has been a part of my life for so long, so it almost feels like a very natural progression.\n\nCoventrys deep ties to the Olympics began with her storied swimming career. She competed in five consecutive Games beginning in Sydney 2000, winning seven medals  including two golds  and becoming Africas most decorated Olympian. Her return to Zimbabwe after her Olympic success, during a time of national difficulty, further cemented her belief in sports transformative power.\n\nIn addition to her achievements in the pool, Coventry has played a key role in sports governance. She joined the IOC as an athlete member in 2013, chaired the Athletes Commission, served on the Executive Board, and led initiatives promoting safe sports environments for children through the Kirsty Coventry Academy and the HEROES programme in Zimbabwe.\n\nShe also served as Zimbabwes Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation from 2018, during which she pushed legislation aimed at curbing match-fixing, abuse, and sexual harassment in sport.\n\nBalancing her new role with her home life as the mother of two young daughters has been a challenge, she admitted.\n\nIt has been crazy. And its been hard, but its also been wonderful, Coventry said.\n\nI have a lot more patience, she added. I now realize I can do a lot more with a lot less sleep. [The children] humble you. And when you get home after a rough day, you can look at them and you can realize, Okay, this is why were doing this. But were also doing this so that the Olympic Games and our values remain relevant in this crazy world of ours. Theyre the meaning.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA 21-year-old security guard from Kadoma has avoided jail time following an accidental discharge of a firearm, which resulted in the death of a miner at Sengy Mine.\n\nThe state was insisting on a murder charge, but the High Court found Anthony Mutefara guilty of culpable homicide before sentencing him to three years in jail.\n\nTwelve months of his sentence were set aside for two on condition that he does not commit a similar offence.\n\nThe remaining 24 months were suspended on condition that Mutefara performs 820 hours of community service at Mkoba Clinic.\n\nThe unfortunate incident took place last year when he was 20.\n\nIt is a proven fact that Mutefara, a recently trained security guard, was only two days at the new job when he was deployed at Sengy Mine Post in Kadoma.\n\nHe was to relieve a colleague who was going off duty.\n\nThe deceased, in the company of his two co-miners, was whiling away time sitting by the security guard cabin post.\n\nAccording to the unchallenged testimony of the accused, he had just assumed duty and was inside the cabin when the deceased unnoticeably also entered the mini room.\n\nThe deceased had entered the cabin to collect his already charged phone and to charge another as per their custom.\n\nAn inverter had been placed inside the cabin, but behind the door, for the purpose of assisting the miners coming from the underground mining shafts to recharge their mobile phones.\n\nThe inverter was positioned approximately a meter adjacent to the bed, which was also situated therein.\n\nIt is soon after the deceaseds entrance into the said room that a startling sound was heard, leading the deceaseds colleagues to scamper away for safety.\n\nIt was only after the first witness, Peter Milton, regained composure and retraced his way back to the source of the explosive sound did he find the deceased lying face up with his head protruding from the door hanging unsuspended.\n\nAccording to this witnesss testimony upon entry into the cabin to enquire, he then saw the accused astonished and in shock, holding the gun.\n\nBoth the first witness and the accused placed the deceased in a better lying position outside the cabin, reads court papers.\n\nMutefara, who was visibly shaken, was seen using his own garment to try and stabilise excessive bleeding.\n\nIn his defence, Mutefara stated that he took safety precautionary measures as soon as he was handed the gun.\n\nHe placed the gun in a safety catch or mode.\n\nSince he had just learnt that there was a bullet jammed in the barrel, he emptied the gun.\n\nThe first bullet fell under the bed but the second remained lodged.\n\nIn his effort to retrieve the fallen bullet, he placed the gun on the bed whilst bending.\n\nHe hardly noticed the entrance or presence of the deceased until he heard a loud bang.\n\nAt first, he thought it came from outside, as was the norm with explosives at the mine. He then realised that the gun had discharged on its own accord when he saw the smoke on the mouth of the barrel, signalling recent gunfire.\n\nAt the same time, he observed the deceased, who was in a bent position, falling backwards.\n\nIn convicting him, the judge said the manner in which the events unfolded portrays mere carelessness rather than recklessness.\n\nThe accuseds action of taking safety precautionary measures in a confined space borders on negligence rather than out of realisation of risk or possibility that death may ensue out of his conduct of leaving an unsupervised semi-loaded gun for a short stint of time, noted the judge before convicting Mutefara.\n\n",

RBZ officials noted that bolstering gold reserves not only underpins the currency but also enhances resilience to global financial instability.\n\nAs geopolitical uncertainty rises, many countries are turning to gold as a stable asset. Zimbabwe, as a significant gold producer, is well positioned to follow this global trend, a central bank official said.\n\nThe initiative reflects broader international patterns, with countries such as China, Russia and Turkey also increasing their gold holdings to hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations.\n\nAccording to official figures, Zimbabwe produced more than 30 tonnes of gold in 2024, with a growing share retained by the RBZ under the reserve accumulation strategy.\n\n",

To enforce patriotism legally would infringe upon these basic rights, Madam Speaker.\n\nCreating a legal framework compelling ideological loyalty undermines democracy and pluralism through thriving on diversity of opinion. The dangers of institutionalising ideology are as follows: An ideology institution sounds disturbing.\n\nHistory has shown us that once States begin controlling ideology, State abuse, censorship and suppression of dissent follow. Decisiveness and weaponisation risk, it is also going to be one of the challenges, said Karenyi.\n\nZANU PF is pushing to nationalise the ideological school concept it established within its party. The ruling party has previously proposed enrolling civil servants into the Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology.\n\nThe National Ideology would also be incorporated into the school curriculum, with patriotism as a core component of education from primary to tertiary level.\n\nCCC legislator Gladys Hlatywayo warned that the proposal risks being hijacked by ZANU PFs interests rather than serving the nation.\n\nTerms such as national interest are often euphemisms for advancing party interest and the interest of the ruling class or ruling elite. In this case, legislating patriotism might be legislating the zanufication of the State.\n\nThere is also a danger that legislating patriotism can erode civil liberties and restrict freedoms of speech, assembly and association. These civil liberties are at the heart of any democratic society and encoded in our own Bill of Rights, in our own Constitution, and must therefore be protected and protected rather than taken away by opaque, divisive and undemocratic laws under the guise of legislative patriotism.\n\nThe proposed prayer by the mover of the motion also has a chilling effect on public discourse Madam Speaker. Open, honest public debate that is so instrumental to democratic development might be discouraged as fear grips the country, said Hlatywayo.\n\n",
