So we want to do this for our young people who stay in this community, Chigumbu said.\n\nThe legislator said part of the money for the project will come from the Australian citizens, Zimbabweans in Australia, as the Constituency Development Fund is not enough.\n\nDeputy Head of Mission for the Australian Embassy in Zimbabwe, Isaac Matia, who also attended the ceremony, assured support to the people of Budiriro.\n\nAustralia believes inclusive sport has the power to connect the people of Australia and Zimbabwe which can foster cooperation and understanding which makes anything possible.\n\nThe Australian and Zimbabwean governments both agree that this is an asset we must leverage in the bilateral relationships.\n\nWe are here to support you and your community, he said.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume warned against illegal occupation of public facilities, stating that any structures built on land designated for sports facilities will be demolished.\n\n",

However, Dstv did not air the episode in question; it was only aired on the Podcast and Chill channel on YouTube.\n\nDstvs digital distribution partner, Leading Edge Growth, confirmed toTimeslivethat Dstv has removed the popular podcast.\n\nLeading Edge Growth CEO Lufuno Maliavusa gave the confirmation that the show has been pulled.\n\nCiting To keep our content slate dynamic and engaging, we will continue to make adjustments to our roster. Notably, season one ofPodcast and Chilland season one ofAwkward Datesare nearing their final episodes in the coming weeks, making way for fresh and exciting content to take their place in these time slots.\n\nThis follows after MultiChoice refused to confirm the news of the shows cancellation. The Group only said it licensed a slate of podcasts from Leading Edge Growth, which was responsible for curating the podcast slate, taking into account audience dynamics and content demand.\n\nHowever, MacG is reportedlyunmoved by the news, as he is pursuing other endeavours.\n\nThe episode that spoke about Dlaminireceived attention from the Deputy Ministerof Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Mmapaseka Steve Letsike.\n\nShe said MacGs comments were nauseating in their vulgarity and must be regarded as an unconstitutional violation of Dlaminis rights to freedom and security of the person, equality, and human dignity as enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.\n\nLetsike wanted MacG to be referred to the Parliaments Portfolio Committee, however,this was declined.\n\nI think the majority of members are not in favour of us proceeding as the honorable minister, deputy minister had requested us to do, the committees chairperson Liezl van der Merwe said.\n\nShe pointed out that Dlamini had not approached Parliament nor laid a criminal case.\n\nI think all of you have touched on this point that if we do decide it is our mandate to proceed with hearing one case of cyber-bullying, it would mean that this portfolio committee would have to extend that to every other person because they cannot be selective in choosing one case.\n\nMacG has since apologisedin one his episodes, saying he never intended to offend anyone.\n\nI want to apologise, first and foremost, to all the female chillers, and women in general in SA, I might have offended with that comment. That was not the intention. We never say things to offend people, he said.\n\nI want to extend an invite to Minnie Dlamini to the show. You are more than welcome to come.\n\nThis thing started on the podcastlets end it on the podcast. She said some things, I said some things. Lets squash it once and for all.\n\nDlamini saidshe was hurt and shocked by the commentsmade about her body and personal life on the podcast.\n\nOver the past few weeks, I have watched in disbelief and deep pain as my name, body, and dignity were dragged through the mud of public discourse, she said.\n\nShe described the remarks made by MacG as vile, humiliating, and inexcusable.\n\nDlamini said she is taking legal action to stand up for herself and the dignity of women.\n\n",

Activists, civil society organisations, trade unions, and immigration organisations joined the march.\n\nAfrica Day marks the day the Organisation of African Unity, the precursor to the African Union, was formed.\n\nThe event kicked off with song, dance, and speeches at Mary Fitzgerald Square. Led by drummers, they then marched through the streets of Johannesburg, bringing traffic to a halt. Along Queen Elizabeth Bridge, more speeches were made before marchers proceeded to Constitution Hill in Braamfontein.\n\nMarchers carried colourful banners showing their support for different struggles, from calling for democracy in Swaziland and peace in Palestine, to the end of coal use in South Africa. The marchers also opposed tyranny in other African countries and celebrated victories of the past, from the fall of colonialism to the defeat of apartheid.\n\nWe are calling for the end to absolute monarchy in Swaziland and an end to dictatorial leaders in Congo, Southern Cameroon, Zimbabwe, and South Sudan. We are rising on this walk to build unity and to share our unique stories as Africans, said General Moyo, one of the march conveners from the organisation Keep Left.\n\nSpeakers demanded an end to the plundering of Africas minerals. They condemned xenophobia and called for the eradication of colonial borders in Africa.\n\nOur kids are stateless because of borders, and our people are being harassed because of borders. We should fight against brutal colonial borders to create one Africa, said Rose Roshoa from the Free Basotho Movement.\n\nRoshao said people from Lesotho who work in South Africa as domestic workers and on farms were facing arrests due to struggles with documentation.\n\nMametlwe Sebei, GIWUSA president, called for unity among African workers in South Africa. He accused the ruling elites in the country of inciting xenophobia against African migrants while touting platitudes about African unity.\n\nThis article was first publishedhere.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOPPOSITION leader Nelson Chamisa has criticised the new Broadcasting Services Amendment Act, which compels every motorist to obtain a Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) TV and radio licence before acquiring a Zimbabwe National Road Authority (ZINARA) licence and vehicle insurance.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa signed the controversial Act into law more than three months after parliament gave it the go-ahead.\n\nThe most contentious element of the new broadcasting Act is clause 15, which requires all motorists to pay the ZBC licence fee first to be eligible to renew their vehicle licences with ZINARA and, similarly, to obtain vehicle insurance.\n\nResponding to the Act on X on Monday, Chamisa described the new law as draconian.\n\nA new law requiring motorists to buy a radio licence before renewing their vehicle licences that has been signed into law is too draconian, anti-citizens and outrightly heartless, Chamisa said.\n\nHe added: So a person who owns a car pays Zinara, ZBC, insurance and toll gate  how are people supposed to survive? When shall all this end? Citizens are being pauperised left, right and centre. Why does the citizenry of this country deserve such uncaring and heartless leadership?\n\nChamisa went on to argue that there is no justification for ordinary motorists to be burdened by the ZBC fundraising law, pointing out that the public broadcaster has become a propaganda machine for Zanu PF, rather than serving the public interest.\n\nWhat are people supposed to do with all this cruel taxation? Why must I pay for a service I dont use? Why should I pay for partisan propaganda, where I am attacked in person and demonised from dawn to dusk? Do we have a parliament in Zimbabwe? Chamisa added.\n\nEarlier this month, the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) Zimbabwe urged Information Minister Jenfan Muswere to reconsider the bill before it was signed into law, and to revise it in line with recommendations from the public, as reflected in the parliamentary report following public hearings in December last year.\n\nAccording to the parliamentary report on public hearings specifically regarding clause 15, many participants felt this was a discriminatory law, as it only mandates vehicle owners to pay for ZBC services, while ignoring other members of the public.\n\n",
