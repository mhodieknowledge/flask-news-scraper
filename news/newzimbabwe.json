            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nTHE University of Zimbabwe (UZ) has withheld the salaries of striking lecturers as turmoil continues at the institution.\n\nThe lecturers have now reached 58 days of industrial action, demanding a salary increase that aligns with Zimbabwes soaring cost of living.\n\nWhile UZ has remained silent on the strike, it has retaliated by withholding salaries from the defiant lecturers, who are steadfast in their demand for a return to pre-2018 wages of US$2,250 per month for junior staff  up from the current US$230.\n\nObvious Vengeyi, spokesperson for the Association of University Teachers (AUT), condemned the salary deductions as an attempt to force an end to the strike.\n\nOf course, it is an act of trying to force our members to return to work for the US$230 they initially rejected. Its a way of arm-twisting certain members of our community to resume teaching.\n\nMany here who have not been paid have resolved that, whether they receive the US$230 or not, they will not return. The majority of us have not been paid  yes. But we remain committed. Until junior lecturers get US$2,250, we will not go back to class, said Vengeyi.\n\nThe universitys latest move follows its hiring of adjunct lecturers last month to fill gaps left by the striking staff.\n\nHowever, the AUT has dismissed this as futile, claiming most replacements lack the qualifications to teach at a university level.\n\nThere is no teaching happening at the university. No supervision is taking place. A few scabs have been hired to replace sort of  the lecturers on strike, said Vengeyi further.\n\nThe prolonged strike has disrupted examinations, with planned sittings facing further delays, potentially derailing the academic year.\n\nLast month, six students were arrested after staging flash protests demanding the lecturers return, signalling the growing unrest on campus.\n\n",

We are forced toimprovise daily just to preserve life. But we cannot continue like this. The systemhas failed, and the suffering is unbearable.\n\nWe call on the government of Zimbabwe to urgently prioritise the health sector.Equip hospitals. Support nurses. Save lives. This situation must be addressedwithout delay, Dongo said.\n\nDongo also said public hospitals do not have blankets for patients in this winter season andsome wards do not have windows.\n\nFacilities are deteriorating fast. There are no blankets in many wards as weapproach winter. Some hospitals do not even have proper windows.\n\nX-ray departments are not functioning. Diagnostic centres are almost non-existent.Basic lab services are unavailable.\n\nNurses are unable to conduct essential tests, and the sick are being referred to private hospitals that they cannot afford. They remain in public wards, in pain, waiting, suffering, Dongo added.\n\nRecently, Health Minister Douglas Mombeshora admitted that Zimbabwes biggest referral public hospital, Parirenyatwa, is in a bad state after a tour following a public outcry.\n\nThe situation at Parirenyatwa is a reflection of all public hospitals in the country.\n\nOver the years, health workers have submitted numerous petitions and staged protests calling for urgent government intervention; however, the authorities have taken little to no action.\n\n",
