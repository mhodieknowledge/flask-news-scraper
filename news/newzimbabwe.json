May they possess the insight to listen to the voices of their electorate, addressing their concerns with genuine care and appropriate assistance.We turn to Proverbs 11:14, which says, Where there is no counsel, the people fall; but in the multitude of counsellors, there is safety.Let us pray that our leaders surround themselves with wise counsel and make decisions that reflect the best interests of those they serve. They must remember their sacred duty as bastions of the rule of law, upholding the trust placed in them by the people.It is imperative that they do not become consumed by the cycle of elections, but rather invest their time in fulfilling their electoral promises, embodying the values they espoused in their manifestos.Heavenly Father, we ask You to grant our president and all leaders the capacity to lead with empathy and compassion. May they recognise the weight of their responsibilities and act in accordance with Your will.We pray that they govern with integrity, transparency, and a commitment to the common good, demonstrating the love and service that You call us to.PrayerDear Lord,We ask for Your guidance and wisdom to fill the hearts of our leaders. Help them to listen and respond to the needs of their people with grace and integrity. May they honour the trust bestowed upon them and serve as true representatives of justice and mercy.Strengthen them to act not just in their own interest, but for the welfare of all. We pray that they lead by example, embodying the principles of empathy and the rule of law.

            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nOSCAR-nominated American film producer Alix Madigan concluded her week-long Business of Film workshop in Harare, urging the need for a number of formal structures to bolster Zimbabwes film industry.\n\nThe workshop, which was facilitated by the US Embassy, saw Madigan mentoring local filmmakers at the Zimbabwe Film and Television School of Southern Africa (ZIFTESSA).Speaking at the closeout ceremony on Friday, Madigan underscored the need for institutional support such as a film commission and tax incentives to complement the evident local talent.I do think that the future of filmmaking in Zimbabwe is very, very bright and will be very exciting in the years to come.I think if anything, I could recommend, is there be more formal structures in place to support these remarkable filmmakers that are present in this country, things such as the establishment of a film commission, the discussion of a possible tax incentive. But these things do seem to be well underway with the National Arts Council, said Madigan.Becca Archer-Knepper, Public Diplomacy Officer at the U.S. Embassy in Harare, added that challenges in the Zimbabwean film industry are forcing many creatives to pursue opportunities in other international film industries.However, she confirmed that meetings were held with the Ministry of Sport, Arts and Recreation and the National Arts Council to address these challenges.One of the major challenges is a lot of the very creative people end up going other places, whether they go to South Africa or Kenya, or Nigeria, or someplace in Europe or even America to work in the film industry because its more advanced there. And so I think one of the really great things about this workshop is that it brought together a lot of different filmmakers who are keen to build up the industry here in Zimbabwe.There are challenges, but Alix and Dorin Amina Abubakar, whos also on the programme with the American Film showcase, they met with the ministry, they met with the Arts Council, and they discussed different ideas about how they can strengthen the film industry here.There are simple things like making it easier to get film permits to more complex things, like setting up a film hub hub, giving tax breaks and things like that. So, there are some big things and some small things that could really change the film industry here, said Becca.Among the beneficiaries of the workshop was Kudakwashe Rice, a writer, poet, storyteller, and filmmaker, who shared his key takeaways of securing funding, distributing films, and generating returns.I benefited extremely from this programme that I was part of, which was facilitated by the U.S embassy, where they brought in Alix from the United States. Shes an incredible, incredible independent filmmaker, and she got to teach us about the professional aspect of filmmaking and the business aspect of filmmaking as well as being able to find ways where you get to fund your films and also putting your films into distribution and managing to get some returns from that, and to also get returns from that, said Rice.Filmmaker Yeukai Ndirimani, who began her career with Studio 263 in 2002, said the production of films in Zimbabwe is very low and there is little to no money in return.People argue whether we have an industry or not, but we have a community, and we are making films but the rate at which were making productions is very low, and hardly do we ever make money from our films.So this workshop was really very helpful, especially for me, because I am actually currently working on a few productions where I have been trying to find ways to sort of collaborate to to get money to then distribute that content because, its one thing to produce something its another to then get it seen I think my target audience is really like global, so I think this helps because they bring in that global sort of audience so the way that this workshop has helped is that, they have given us resources in terms of orgnisations where we can get our films screened, organisations that fund films people that can partner with us to make films, said Ndirimani.\n\nThe workshop, which was facilitated by the US Embassy, saw Madigan mentoring local filmmakers at the Zimbabwe Film and Television School of Southern Africa (ZIFTESSA).\n\nSpeaking at the closeout ceremony on Friday, Madigan underscored the need for institutional support such as a film commission and tax incentives to complement the evident local talent.I do think that the future of filmmaking in Zimbabwe is very, very bright and will be very exciting in the years to come.I think if anything, I could recommend, is there be more formal structures in place to support these remarkable filmmakers that are present in this country, things such as the establishment of a film commission, the discussion of a possible tax incentive.

Inmates survive on a single meal daily.During a Question-and-Answer session, Zemura queried government policy on the issue.Is it government policy for people who are in jails to sleep without warm clothes and blankets, without eating, especially during this winter period?I am asking because it seems as if it is now a pattern (norm) people do not have jerseys, blankets and othersZemura was interrupted by the Speaker for using an unacceptable language or word (slang)- pattern.I meant to say, has it become a norm now in Zimbabwe that those who are in jails, whether sentenced or not, suffer from pneumonia as a result of catching a cold? They sleep on dry, cold floors without blankets and mattresses, said Zemura without naming the jail (s).Acting Leader of Government Business in Parliament Anxious Masuka responded that government provided those in prisons with basics but due to the economic challenges, the MP should be specific so that the government can deal with the issues she raised.Government, in its plans, takes those who have been incarcerated for rehabilitation so that they can be reintegrated into society. During the process, the government provides for the basics like food, shelter and clothing.However, when there are challenges, I request that if there is a specific jail, then that communication should be brought forward so that we will be able to address it properly, Masuka said.The Speaker urged the MP to name those prisons without blankets and food.The question should address the jails that do not have blankets, Mudenda said.Before he could finish his statement, Zemura shouted all jails.Mudenda posed a question to the MP before advising her to put her question in writing and to be specific.Did you go to all the jails, Hon. Member? Please put it in writing and be specific as to which jails where there are no blankets, said Mudenda.Most prisons that were visited by a Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs had no blankets and food for inmates.Prisoners complained over a poor diet, surviving on boiled cabbage and sadza once or twice a day.At Chikurubi Maximum Prison, besides being overpopulated, inmates revealed that they had no blankets and most were using blankets supplied by their families or the churches and well-wishers.
