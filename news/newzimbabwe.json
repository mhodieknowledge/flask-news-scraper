            "content": "AFP\n\nIn a field of paprika plants in the heart of Zimbabwe, fourth-generation farmer Daniel Burger and relative newcomer Miriam Mupambawashe discuss the quality of the crop.\n\nBurger, 36, and Mupambawashe, 59, are neighbours and partners in efforts to revive the countrys once-flourishing agriculture sector cut down by a ruinous land reform drive in the 2000s.\n\nThe reform distributed land from the white minority, which still owned most of the best farmland 20 years after independence in 1980, to the black majority.\n\nAround 4,000 white-owned farms were confiscated, some with deadly violence.\n\nMupambawashe was among thousands who received land. Though she initially knew little about farming, her small subsistence plot now thrives.\n\nOther farms failed or were abandoned, with some new tenants unschooled in agriculture and others  including politicians who were handed land  uninterested.\n\nThere were food shortages and Zimbabwe soon required international aid.\n\nThere was a bit of a tough period through the 2000s and, unfortunately, I think it sort of refuelled racial tensions to an extent, Burger told AFP.\n\nBut being so passionate about farming was the motivator for me to move forward, he said.\n\nMupambawashe moved to the area from the southern city of Bulawayo, around 200 kilometres (125 miles) away.\n\nWhen we first came here in 2001, it was a forest and there was nothing built, she said.Some of the white farmers were angry but we managed to talk to each other in good faith and move forward.\n\nThey never let us down and said, You grabbed the farm, lets see if you can do it. But instead they brought their own tractors and equipment to come and help, which we felt was a nice gesture.\n\nIt was hard in the beginning, especially after irrigation equipment was stolen, and the early failures were embarrassing, Mupambawashe said.\n\nBut today her plot does so well that she only needs to buy in sugar and cooking oil.\n\nBurger leases land from her and lends tractors and expertise.\n\nHis familys land was among the few hundreds that were not seized in the 2000s.\n\nNonetheless, For a long time we became wound up in compensation, said Burger, vice-president of the Commercial Farmers Union of Zimbabwe (CFU) that represents mostly white farmers.\n\nBut it wasnt our purpose. Our purpose was driving agriculture and current agricultural affairs forward, he said.\n\nThis year, some farm owners whose land was confiscated received the first compensation payments after decades of waiting.\n\nThe process has been complex and divisive.\n\nThe government committed to compensation as part of an effort to settle arrears and reform the economy in order to be able to regain access to international credit lines cut two decades ago.\n\nIt announced in 2020 the creation of a fund that would pay out US$3.5 billion for infrastructure on farms but not the land, which it says was taken by force by colonial settlers.\n\nUnable to raise cash, the government in 2023 changed the offer to one percent in cash and the remainder in US dollar denominated treasury bonds.\n\nIn April, the first payments were made to 378 of 780 farmers approved for this scheme.\n\nDeon Theron, who represents the Compensation Steering Committee group of former white farmers, says the introduction of the bonds has annulled the original deal and negotiations need to start over.\n\nThe bonds are unsecured and there is limited recourse in the event of non-performance by government, he told AFP.\n\nThe general feeling amongst the farmers is firstly frustration that after 20-odd years we still have not received anything, Theron said.\n\nBut the Property and Farm Compensation Associationsaid its members would take what is on offer.\n\nThe bonds are under international guarantee, said leader Harry Orphanides, adding that digging in and seeking more from the government would be futile.\n\n",

But I think following that intervention, there is now a very marked improvement.\n\nAccording to Guvamatanga, some MDA officers were involved in the scandals involving the loss of millions of dollars by the government.\n\nAnd we did emphasise that there will be an action taken against the accounting officers in the event that they continue with this practice following the intervention of closure, added Guvamatanga.\n\nCommittee chairperson Charlton Hwende requested to have the list of those companies that defaulted on delivery.\n\nWe will provide the list. It is available, said Guvamatanga.\n\nRegarding defaulters, Guvamatanga said, Its the same companies, they change directors, they go and change directors, they get another contract, you know, and its the same players.\n\nSo when we present it for the identity of the companies, we then see the same players all over. We are now calling them, bringing them to where you must bring your bank statements. \n\nThose same people become the directors of the new company. They are then given another tender, which they flout. Three, two years later, they change the name of the company, but they remain with the same directors, Guvamatanga said.\n\n",
