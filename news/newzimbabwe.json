            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) has announced that one of its units will be on a routine field exercise in Harares suburban areas.\n\nIn a press statement, ZNA Director of Public Relations, Colonel Hlengiwe Dube, said troops will conduct training exercises in public spaces, although these will not affect the publics daily routines.\n\nThe ZNA wishes to inform the general public that one of its units is conducting a field training exercise in Harare during the period 03 to 06 June 2025.\n\nThe training exercise will be carried out in the general areas of Glenview, Glen Norah, Kuwadzana, Dzivarasekwa, Mt Hampden and Westgate. The road to be used during the exercise is Solomon Mujuru, formerly known as Kirkman Road, Dube said.\n\nThe army spokesperson reiterated that the exercise will be conducted during the day and the public is, therefore, urged to remain calm.\n\nThe public is therefore requested not to panic as the training exercise is part of routine training by ZNA units, added Col Dube.\n\nThe preemptive move was ostensibly timed conveniently to counter the misconception that the drill was a signal for masses to take to the streets in protest against President Emmerson Mnangagwas government, as hoped for by war veteran Blessed Bombshell Runesu Geza.\n\nGeza has on numerous broadcasts vaguely stated that a signal shall come at the appropriate time and Zimbabweans must march in the streets demanding Mnangagwas exit on accusations of a slew of charges, including grand corruption.\n\n",

Sammons says the two teams will go into that match on an equal footing.\n\nI think South Africa have a great chance of taking that World Test Championship final. Two evenly matched teams. Its going to be a really good game and ultimately it will be decided by the batting unit that can fare best against two quality bowling attacks, he predicted.\n\nThe former Proteas batting consultant is also quite excited to be facing his native nation over the next few days.\n\nThis will also serve as good preparation for the official test series that the neighbours will play at the end of this month in Bulawayo.\n\nThe next four days against South Africa offer our team an amazing opportunity to prepare for what promises to be an exciting and challenging winter, with two tests against the same team and another two against New Zealand.\n\nSo the guys are really looking forward to the challenge and obviously the learnings that will come from it.\n\nIt is good for this group and for Zimbabwean cricket in general that theres so much test cricket available for them this year and obviously towards the end of last year. Its where your fundamentals are tested, and as a young group of players, its where youre going to take the greatest amount of learnings, concluded Sammons.\n\nZimbabwe played a one-off test match against England almost two weeks ago, and were ruthlessly beaten by an innings and 45 runs.\n\nThe coach admitted that the occasion got the better of his team, and says that there was a lot of anxiety among the players.\n\n",
