            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has sentenced Sipho Moyo (20) to 16 years in prison for the brutal killing of a 40-year-old man with an axe and a stone.\n\nIn her ruling, the judge condemned the wave of violent murders linked to Zimbabwes gold panners.Moyo, who was 19 at the time of the crime, was convicted of murder after chasing down the victim at Pinafore Shops in December 2024 and assaulting him with an axe, a stone and booted feet. The victim later died from severe head injuries.Justice Evangelista Kabasa, sitting in Hwange, dismissed Moyos claims of provocation, describing the attack as deliberate and fuelled by revenge.Seeking revenge is a completely different story and has nothing in common with acting in the heat of the moment, she said.Whether the intention was actual or legal is neither here nor there. Murder is murder.The court heard how Moyo pursued the deceased until he caught up with him, struck him with a stone, repeatedly kicked him, and then used an axe that caused fatal injuries.Why would one use an axe on a human being and not expect that person to be fatally wounded? Kabasa asked.In handing down sentence, the judge turned her attention to the mining sectors violence.It appears violence is the language which gold panners speak. It is saddening to note the number of murder cases involving gold panners. You appear not to respect the sanctity of life, she said.While acknowledging Moyos youth as a mitigating factor, the court noted the seriousness of the offence.An axe is never meant to be used on a human being. The assault was vicious, rupturing lung vessels and fracturing the skull. The presumptive penalty, where a weapon has been used, is 20 years imprisonment.

            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nZIMBABWE, one of Africas largest tobacco producers, aims to leverage its booming trade with China to increase tobacco production and promote value addition, a senior government official has said.\n\nMinister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Anxious Masuka made the remarks Thursday on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe-China Tobacco Expo, which opened the same day in Harare, the countrys capital.The two-day event brought together Zimbabwean, Chinese and other global industry stakeholders to discuss ways to enhance tobacco production, processing and value addition.Masuka said that after achieving a record tobacco output of 355 million kilograms this year, Zimbabwe now aims to process 100 million kilograms of the locally produced crop through partnerships with China.China is the biggest export market for Zimbabwean tobacco. We hope that will remain the case in the future, which is why, as we discuss increasing volumes, we have chosen to walk together with them to reach our goal of 500 million kilograms, said Masuka.While about 10 percent of Zimbabwes tobacco leaf is currently processed locally, less than one percent is made into cigarettes, a market segment Zimbabwe now seeks to enter, Masuka said.Through collaboration with China, Zimbabwe aims to ensure that the bulk of its tobacco is processed locally to create jobs, boost export earnings and strengthen the countrys industrial base, he said.Masuka added that Zimbabwe could also benefit from acquiring advanced cigarette manufacturing equipment from China to further enhance value addition and beneficiation.Patrick Devenish, chairman of the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board, said China has long been a pillar of Zimbabwes tobacco trade. He said that Zimbabwe now seeks to explore the vast Chinese market by exporting locally manufactured cigarettes to one of the worlds largest cigarette consumer markets.Cigarettes are all about branding and finding markets for those brands. The biggest market for cigarettes in the world is China. So, if we can work with China to produce more of their cigarettes, that will be better for us, and hopefully for them too, Devenish said.China has the technology, capital and experience, while Zimbabwe has raw materials, skilled farmers, land and policy support for quality tobacco production. Together, the two countries can establish joint ventures in cigarette manufacturing, nicotine extraction, shisha production and alternative tobacco product processing, he said.Devenish also noted that Zimbabwes value addition drive faces challenges, including limited access to affordable long-term financing, underutilized factory capacity and outdated equipment. Collaboration with Chinese partners, he said, could help bridge those gaps.Celani Sithole, sales and marketing manager at the Tobacco Sales Floor, one of Zimbabwes leading tobacco auction platforms, expressed optimism about increasing partnerships with China.I am looking forward to seeing more Chinese businesses participating on our tobacco platform, Sithole said.\n\nMinister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Anxious Masuka made the remarks Thursday on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe-China Tobacco Expo, which opened the same day in Harare, the countrys capital.\n\nThe two-day event brought together Zimbabwean, Chinese and other global industry stakeholders to discuss ways to enhance tobacco production, processing and value addition.Masuka said that after achieving a record tobacco output of 355 million kilograms this year, Zimbabwe now aims to process 100 million kilograms of the locally produced crop through partnerships with China.China is the biggest export market for Zimbabwean tobacco.
