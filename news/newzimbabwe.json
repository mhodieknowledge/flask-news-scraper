            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ) and the Health Professions Authority (HPA) have cautioned the public against the illegal sale, purchase, and use of Ozempic, a prescription medication known as the skinny jab.\n\nThe Ozempic is originally designed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.In a joint statement, MCAZ Director-General Richard Rukwata said there is a surge in the illicit sale of Ozempic through unauthorised channels.He also noted that the public is now misusing the Ozempic for weight loss, prompting serious health concerns.Recent reports indicate an increase in the illicit use of Ozempic for weight loss purposes. However, its use for weight loss outside of medical supervision is potentially dangerous and could lead to serious harm to the user, said Rukwata.As a prescription medicine, Ozempic can only be accessed upon presentation of a valid prescription and should only be used under the strict supervision of a qualified and registered healthcare professional. Self-medicating with Ozempic for weight loss can have serious and potentially life-threatening consequences.We warn the public against purchasing Ozempic from unauthorized sources, including online marketplaces, social media platforms, unlicensed premises, or unregistered individuals.These sources often lack quality control and may offer substandard and/or falsified medications. The illegal sale and distribution of prescription medications is not only illegal but also poses a significant threat to public health.Illegal traders of Ozempic have been warned that selling the product is a criminal offence that attracts jail time.Selling medicines by unlicensed persons from unlicensed premises contravenes Sections 50 and 52 of the Medicines and Allied Substances Control (General) Regulations, 1991, SI 150 of 1991, as read with Section 106 of the same Regulations.Additionally, the sale of unregistered medicines is in contravention of Section 29(1)(a) of the Medicines and Allied Substances Control Act, as read with Section 29(la) of the same Act.The Health Professions Act (Chapter 27:19) Section 126 prohibits unqualified personnel from performing any act specifically pertaining to a registered profession. Therefore, diagnosis and prescribing should only be conducted by qualified and licensed personnel, reads the statement.Both the MCAZ and HPA urged the public to consult only registered health professionals for medical advice and treatment.Mandated to safeguard the public, HPA and MCAZ urge the public to seek medical advice and treatment only from registered health professionals and institutions. These can be identified by the possession of a valid practising certificate from the practitioners respective Council, an HPA licence for premise registration, and an MCAZ licence for both person and premises.It is an offense for an unlicensed individual to diagnose, treat, and sell medicines to the public, reads the statement.\n\nThe Ozempic is originally designed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn a joint statement, MCAZ Director-General Richard Rukwata said there is a surge in the illicit sale of Ozempic through unauthorised channels.He also noted that the public is now misusing the Ozempic for weight loss, prompting serious health concerns.Recent reports indicate an increase in the illicit use of Ozempic for weight loss purposes.

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nTHE Centre for Natural Resource Governance (CNRG) has blasted the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) for issuing permits to Save Valley Conservancy to kill 50 elephants, describing the move as misleading and unethical.\n\nZimParks earlier this week said the culling of 50 jumbos was to curb overpopulation, which exceeds the carrying capacity of Zimbabwes national parks.According to the 2024 aerial survey, there are 2,550 elephants against an ecological carrying capacity of 800 elephants in Save Valley Conservancy.In a statement, CNRG said the culling presented as an elephant management exercise, ignores scientific and humane alternatives, risks harming tourism, and may be driven by hidden commercial interests.While we acknowledge the ecological pressures within Save Valley Conservancy and the challenges posed by elephant overpopulation, we reject culling as a legitimate, ethical, or science-backed solution.Culling is a violent, short-term fix that disregards the complex social structures of elephant herds, risks traumatizing surviving animals, and ultimately fails to address the root causes of habitat stress and human-elephant conflict, CNRG said.Instead of killing, the environmental watchdog also argued that a broader national strategy focused on elephant range expansion, ecological corridors, and humane alternatives like contraception and community engagement is urgently needed.What is needed is a national strategy on elephant range expansion, ecological corridors, and increased investment in trans-boundary elephant conservation. Contraceptive methods, community engagement, and landscape restoration offer far more humane and sustainable options than state-sanctioned killing, CNRG added.The elephant meat from the management exercise will be distributed to local communities.CNRG believes the planned distribution of elephant meat to communities masks what may be a veiled effort to generate ivory stockpiles accusing the government of using conservation as a cover for exploiting wildlife for profit.We are also concerned that the proposed culls ultimately serve the interests of those who stand to benefit from the commercial exploitation of threatened wildlife populations.CNRG noted the militarised and extractive approach to wildlife governance that continues to exclude communities from decision-making will only escalate conflict and deepen mistrust.\n\nZimParks earlier this week said the culling of 50 jumbos was to curb overpopulation, which exceeds the carrying capacity of Zimbabwes national parks.\n\nAccording to the 2024 aerial survey, there are 2,550 elephants against an ecological carrying capacity of 800 elephants in Save Valley Conservancy.In a statement, CNRG said the culling presented as an elephant management exercise, ignores scientific and humane alternatives, risks harming tourism, and may be driven by hidden commercial interests.While we acknowledge the ecological pressures within Save Valley Conservancy and the challenges posed by elephant overpopulation, we reject culling as a legitimate, ethical, or science-backed solution.Culling is a violent, short-term fix that disregards the complex social structures of elephant herds, risks traumatizing surviving animals, and ultimately fails to address the root causes of habitat stress and human-elephant conflict, CNRG said.Instead of killing, the environmental watchdog also argued that a broader national strategy focused on elephant range expansion, ecological corridors, and humane alternatives like contraception and community engagement is urgently needed.What is needed is a national strategy on elephant range expansion, ecological corridors, and increased investment in trans-boundary elephant conservation.

to score its first goal of the match in the 23rd minute, thanks to Wydad AC midfieder Stephane Aziz Ki, who fired in a far post shot which Zimbabwe goalkeeper Washington Arubi failed to stop.Eager to respond, the Warriors quickly re-organised and created a clear chance, which saw them winning a free kick on the edge of the box after Burkina Faso broke a promising attack by fouling Tawanda Maswanhise.Despite getting the half chance, Zimbabwes effort from the free kick was a disapointment as it was nowhere near a goal.The Warriors were then quickly punished in the 29th minute by Cyrique Irie,.who gave Burkina Faso a comfortable 2-0 lead.Having gone to the break trailing 2-0 Warriors coach Michael Nees made tactical changes in the 63rd minute as he brought in a trio of Tawanda

As of 2021, the government held a 65% stake, with the remaining 35% owned by private investors, later described as a management consortium.The Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF), Zimbabwes sovereign wealth fund, initially assumed the governments share and has since acquired full ownership of the company.Speaking to NewZimbabwe.com during a community stakeholder engagement meeting, village head Tofara Zimi praised the company for its role in formalising employment in the district.Since Kuvimba began operations in Mberengwa, weve seen a noticeable drop in informal mining. Nearly 100 youths have been employed, earning decent wages that are paid on time, he said.He added that formal employment has brought significant relief to families in the area.Youths are now able to support their households, including paying school fees. The reduction in drug abuse and petty crime is also linked to their increased engagement in formal work.Chief Mposi Mupangeri echoed similar sentiments, noting a marked improvement in community stability.Youths are no longer idle. Theyre now occupied with work, and reports of violence and disorderwhich used to be commonhave decreased. We have also cautioned them against engaging in illegal small-scale mining, he said.However, Chief Mposi also called on mining companies operating in the area to address growing water scarcity by investing in borehole drilling to meet both community and operational needs.The tiff is emanating from the use of the community-owned Gambure Dam by miners for their operations. In turn, the villagers say they cant sustain their livestock and gardening ventures amid dwindling water supplies.The community engagement was part of broader efforts led by Silveira House, which is facilitating initiatives aimed at improving Environmental Social Governance systems in mining communities like Mberengwa.
