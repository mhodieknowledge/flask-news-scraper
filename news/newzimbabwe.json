Where must they do business? In Zimbabwe? Out of this country?  Mashatile asked on Tuesday.\n\nThey can do business, as long as Im not involved, not because they know me. Because once you say Mr Mashatile is capable of influencing, even if he is sitting in his house, its unfair. You must be able to say he went there to interfere.\n\nThe deputy president stressed that only Trade and Industry Minister Parks Tau had the authority to select the winning bidder.\n\nTau announced Sizekhaya as the winner on 28 May after a lengthy evaluation process and has since promised Parliament that any allegations of conflicts of interest will be investigated.\n\n",

Hes pleaded not guilty.\n\nUnder the racketeering conspiracy charge, prosecutors accusedDiddy in the indictmentof creating a criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.\n\nIn a letter to the court, the government proposed dropping three theories related to the racketeering conspiracy charge as a way to streamline jury instructions. They still intend to pursue the racketeering charge but removed instructions related to attempted kidnapping, attempted arson and aiding and abetting sex trafficking.\n\nThe Government is no longer planning to proceed on these theories of liability so instructions are no longer necessary, prosecutors wrote in the letter.\n\nFederal prosecutors narrowed the racketeering charge against Diddy in final stage of trial (REUTERS)\n\nAll of the five federal charges against Diddy remain.\n\nThe move comes after Alexandra Shapiro, one of the 55-year-old moguls defense attorneys, passionately argued in court on Tuesdayfor a judgment of acquittal on all counts.She claimed there were deficiencies to each count and then walked through each charge, outlining why it should be dropped.\n\nShapiro argued that two of the three of the governments examples of kidnapping were insufficient.\n\nIn one kidnapping allegation, Capricorn Clark, Diddys former employee, testified about being driven by Diddys then-head of security to a dilapidated building where she was subjected tolie detector tests for five daysin a row. If she failed, a man told her she would be thrown in the East River, she testified. But Shapiro argued there was no evidence that Diddy knew this was happening or that a co-conspirator had kidnapped her.\n\nSean Diddy Combs hugs his lawyer Nicole Westmoreland as he enters the courtroom during Combs sex trafficking trial in New York City, New York, U.S., June 16, 2025. (Reuters)\n\nThe arson allegation stems from a claim by Scott Mescudi, better known as Kid Cudi, thatDiddy firebombed his Porschein early 2012 after he discovered the rapper had dated his longtime girlfriend Cassie Ventura. Shapiro argued that there was no evidence that her client was involved, noting that Mescudi didnt witness the incident. She added that there was female DNA found on the bottle used for the Molotov cocktail.\n\nProsecutors plan to focus the racketeering conspiracy charges instead on proving forced labor and sex trafficking.\n\nThe judge said he would reserve a decision on the defenses motion. Closing arguments are set to begin Thursday morning.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Esther Muremba has slapped a 24-year-old Shamva man with a 30-year jail term following his conviction for killing an artisanal miner in cold blood back in 2019.\n\nClaude Makoto was convicted after a full trial with the court hearing that he was only 18 when he killed Christopher Samu, a 37-year-old man, on 3 August 2019 at Nherera Mine in Shamva.\n\nIt was proved that Makoto was part of a gang that included Onias Sindura, Robert Sindura, Tinashe Zvinairo, Bhaureni Chingwaru, Lloyd Kafena, Charles Mhako, Kudakwashe Gutsa, Kudakwashe Karima, and one Jabulani.\n\nOn the fateful day the gang travelled to Nherera Mine in a Toyota Noah, intending to rob gold ore.\n\nUpon arrival, they encountered the deceased and his brother, Shame Samu, who were working at the mine.\n\nThe gang manhandled the deceased, while Shame managed to escape.\n\nThey then assaulted Christopher Samu indiscriminately using various weapons, before dragging him and disposing of his body in a shallow pit near the Mazowe River bank, the court heard.\n\nHis body was discovered the following day, 4 August 2019.\n\nOf the six witnesses presented by the State, only Shame, the brother of the deceased, testified in person during the trial.\n\nThe court found Makoto guilty of murder and his lawyers had proposed a sentence not exceeding 20 years, citing the accuseds age at the time of the offence.\n\nIt was argued that he succumbed to peer pressure due to his youthfulness.\n\nThe lawyers also submitted that the accused, who is a gold panner, got married in 2021 while out on bail and now has a child.\n\nBut the judge said a stiffer penalty was appropriate, taking into consideration that the lawlessness in mining communities is a serious concern.\n\nPeople engaged in gold panning often show no respect for human life, resorting to violence without hesitation.\n\nWhile the accused was young, he willfully participated in an organised gang, engaging in murder during a robberya crime that demands severe punishment, regardless of age, to deter others from exploiting youthfulness as an excuse for criminal behaviour.\n\nGiven the devastating impact of this murder on the deceaseds family, a sentence beyond 20 years imprisonment is warranted, the judge said.\n\nThe court heard Samus firstborn was unable to sit for O-Level examinations due to financial hardship.\n\nHis widow and three children are struggling, forced to survive on menial jobs, while his elderly mother, once dependent on him, has developed a heart condition following his death.\n\nNeither the accused nor his gang members have offered any compensation or contributed towards funeral expenses, further exacerbating the familys struggle.\n\nA sentence of 30 years imprisonment as proposed by the State is just and necessary, reflecting the gravity of the offence and its lasting consequences.\n\nMuremba also said the sentence has been influenced by the fact that the accused is a first offender and was 18 years old at the time of the offence.\n\nHad he been older, we would have readily imposed a life sentence, especially now that the death penalty has been abolished.\n\nBefore its abolishment, capital punishment was the appropriate and fitting penalty for murder committed in the course of a robbery.\n\nAccordingly, the accused is sentenced to 30 years imprisonment, she ruled.\n\n",
