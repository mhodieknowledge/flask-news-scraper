            "content": "Zimbabwe Cricket\n\nWellington Masakadza claimed a career-best four-wicket haul, but Zimbabwe were left clinging to hope after South Africa set a towering fourth-innings target of 537 on day three of the first Test at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Monday.\n\nWiaan Mulders commanding 147 formed the backbone of the visitors second-innings 369, building on their overnight score of 49 for one and a lead of 216.\n\nThe imposing total left Zimbabwe with the daunting task of pulling off the greatest chase in Test history.\n\nWith Blessing Muzarabani unavailable in the morning due to illness, the hosts turned to Tanaka Chivanga and Masakadza to spearhead the attack.\n\nThe day began promisingly for them when Tony de Zorzi, on 22 overnight, edged Chivanga to second slip, where Sean Williams held a sharp, low catch.\n\nMulder, calm and clinical, raced to his fifty with a string of crisp boundaries.\n\nHe then combined with David Bedingham for a brisk 72-run stand that extended South Africas lead beyond 300.\n\nMasakadza broke the partnership, tempting Bedingham, on 35, into a mistimed pull that found Williams at midwicket.\n\nSoon after, debutant Lhuan-dre Pretorius  fortunate to survive several chances in his first-innings hundred  was bowled for four by Vincent Masekesa, ripping one through the gate to clip the top of middle stump.\n\nMasekesa struck again moments later, removing Dewald Brevis for three as the big-hitters wild attempt to clear long-on missed entirely, and the leg-spinner knocked over his stumps to leave South Africa teetering at 155 for five.\n\nBut Mulder stood firm amid the wobble.\n\nHe brought up a well-earned hundred off 149 deliveries with a crisp back-foot drive.\n\nAt lunch, the visitors were 185 for five, leading by 352, with Mulder on 104 and Kyle Verreynne on five.\n\nAfter the break, the pair added 74 before Mulders enterprising stay came to an end.\n\nHe attempted to go aerial against Wessly Madhevere but picked out deep midwicket, where Takudzwanashe Kaitano took a fine catch.\n\nMulders 206-ball innings featured 17 boundaries and two sixes.\n\nMasakadza soon added Verreynne to his tally, drawing an edge off a sharply turning delivery that Ervine pouched at slip, reducing South Africa to 259 for seven.\n\nMaharaj and Corbin Bosch then piled on more frustration for Zimbabwe with a gritty 92-run partnership for the eighth wicket, pushing the lead beyond the 500-run mark.\n\nMuzarabani, now back in action, thought he had Bosch caught behind  only for a no-ball call to spoil the celebration.\n\nBut Bosch didnt last much longer as Masakadza bowled him for 36 after a missed slog-sweep.\n\nMasakadza then removed Maharaj, who danced down the track only to be deceived in flight and turn  the ball crashing into middle stump as South Africa fell to 352 for nine.\n\nMuzarabani wrapped up the innings by bowling Kwena Maphaka for eight, with Codi Yusuf unbeaten on the same score.\n\nMasakadza finished with four for 98, his career-best innings figures in Test cricket, while Masekesa and Chivanga chipped in with two wickets apiece.\n\nSet a colossal 537 for victory, Zimbabwe began cautiously in the final hour.\n\nOpeners Kaitano and Prince Masvaure looked solid  until the very last ball of the day.\n\nJust as the hosts seemed set to survive the session unscathed, Kaitano edged Bosch to second slip, ending a steady 32-run stand.\n\nThey closed on 32 for one, still needing 505 runs with nine wickets in hand.\n\nZimbabwe have passed 500 in an innings six times in Test cricket, most recently in December against Afghanistan at the same venue.\n\nBut their highest fourth-innings total is 331  made in a losing cause against New Zealand in 2001, also in Bulawayo.\n\nTheir most successful chase remains 174, achieved earlier this year against Bangladesh in Sylhet.\n\nThe next best, 162, came back in 1998 against Pakistan.\n\nThe world record fourth-innings chase is 418  set by the West Indies against Australia in 2003.\n\nWith history stacked high against them, Zimbabwe will need to bat with extraordinary discipline, determination and belief to salvage anything from this match.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nCivic rights groups say at least seven people have been killed during a crackdown on protesters who are calling for Togos leader, Faure Gnassingb, to step down and release political prisoners.\n\nSeven bodies were recovered from rivers in the capital city Lom, according to a coalition called Le Front Citoyen Togo Debout which accuses security forces and militias of committing abuses.\n\nThe Togolese government has denied these deaths were linked to last weeks demonstrations.\n\nIt is now threatening legal action against the protest organisers, calling the protests a campaign of disinformation and hatred that was orchestrated from abroad.\n\nThere is growing anger in Togo due to a crackdown on critical voices, and changes to the constitution labelled by labelled by critics and opposition figures as an institutional coup dtat.\n\nThese protests comes weeks after Gnassingb  who was president for two decades and whose family has ruled the country for 58 years  wassworn into a new post of President of the Council of Ministers, which has no official term limits.\n\nDemonstrations have been banned in the West African country since 2022, with the authorities citing security reasons.\n\nThree days of demonstrations by online activists and youth-led movements began in Lom on Thursday, before taking a violent turn on Friday and Saturday.\n\nTear gas was fired by anti-riot police at protesters, who pelted them with stones and other missiles.\n\nSome determined anti-government protesters engaged security forces in street battles in several areas considered to be opposition strongholds, including B, where police chased demonstrators into their hideouts.\n\nA coalition of 23 Togolese civil rights groups  known as the National Platform for Civic Space and Development Effectiveness  has since asked the authorities to carry out investigations into the bloody police repression.\n\nThey condemned what they described as the use of disproportionate force against peaceful demonstrators, adding that peaceful protest is a fundamental right, recognized both by the Togolese Constitution and by international instruments ratified by our country.\n\nBy Sunday calm had returned to most of Lom, with shops reopened at the main central market at Assigam and businesses operating as usual.\n\nThe recent change of regime orchestrated by the Togolese leader continues to fuel resentment. In addition to the new post which he can keep for life, constitutional reform in Togo has ended presidential elections, and introduced a parliamentary system.\n\nLast months arrest and psychiatric detention of the Togolese rapper Narcisse Essow Tchalla, also known as Aamron, acted as a catalyst for public outrage, culminating in over 50 arrests during protests earlier this month.\n\nThough most have been released, at least three people remain in custody.\n\n",
