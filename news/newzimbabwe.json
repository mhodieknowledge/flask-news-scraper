Thats the only way I will find peace.\n\nThese chilling words from Mercy Sinoia, sister of slain taxi operator Aleck Sinoia, encapsulate the raw grief and unyielding demand for punishment from a family convinced his ex-wife orchestrated his brutal murder.Their sentiments come as the accused, Apirizi Sekai (41), and her tenant Munyaradzi Munyaradzi (24), appeared this week before the Chegutu Magistrates Court.Sekai and Munyaradzi were remanded in custody until July 30, 2025, and advised to seek bail at the High Court.They stand accused of hiring hitmen to kill Aleck Sinoia, a local taxi operator, a crime the family claims is the culmination of years of bitter disputes and manipulative behavior from Sekai.In an interview with NewZimbababwe.com, Yeukai Kota, Sinoias niece, painted a vivid picture of the couples stormy history, marked by frequent police interventions.Even though my uncle had taken a second wife, he would visit her because he cared about her and the kids, but eventually she did him bad and took a peace order on him, accusing him that he had raped her.He spent days in remand prison but eventually got out after the court found it was fake because she wanted his fortunes.The family only found out that Sekai was the mastermind behind their brothers death just days after they buried him.We only found out two days later after we buried my brother that Sekai planned his death, when we were informed that she paid her tenant $200 to cripple my brother but then they took away his life.Even if the courts havent decided this case, its the truth because she once took her family members to beat up my brother, and we also retaliated, said Mercy Sinoia.Rodwell Tshuma, a close friend of the now deceased, expressed his profound shock and a new-found fear.I saw my friends body at the mortuary, and I was really pained when I saw the way he was mutilated.He would share his marital problems with me, and when I heard that his former wife had a hand in his death, I started fearing women. I would wish the courts to sentence her to life in prison, said Tshuma.According to the National Prosecuting Authority, Sekai allegedly approached her tenant, Munyaradzi, to find individuals who could eliminate her former husband.The first accused person allegedly approached the second accused person who is her tenant and requested him to look for a person who could kill her ex-husband, the now deceased.The first accused person had a long standing dispute with her former husband over infidelity and property sharing after their separation. The second accused person approached Cleopas Gomarara who roped in one Jefu.The two hired men approached the now deceased purporting to seek a car for hire to Chegutu Hospital. They ambushed the now-deceased, deflated the tyres of the motor vehicle before they stabbed him several times all over the body and disappeared from the scene, said the prosecution.\n\nThese chilling words from Mercy Sinoia, sister of slain taxi operator Aleck Sinoia, encapsulate the raw grief and unyielding demand for punishment from a family convinced his ex-wife orchestrated his brutal murder.\n\nTheir sentiments come as the accused, Apirizi Sekai (41), and her tenant Munyaradzi Munyaradzi (24), appeared this week before the Chegutu Magistrates Court.Sekai and Munyaradzi were remanded in custody until July 30, 2025, and advised to seek bail at the High Court.They stand accused of hiring hitmen to kill Aleck Sinoia, a local taxi operator, a crime the family claims is the culmination of years of bitter disputes and manipulative behavior from Sekai.In an interview with NewZimbababwe.com, Yeukai Kota, Sinoias niece, painted a vivid picture of the couples stormy history, marked by frequent police interventions.Even though my uncle had taken a second wife, he would visit her because he cared about her and the kids, but eventually she did him bad and took a peace order on him, accusing him that he had raped her.He spent days in remand prison but eventually got out after the court found it was fake because she wanted his fortunes.The family only found out that Sekai was the mastermind behind their brothers death just days after they buried him.We only found out two days later after we buried my brother that Sekai planned his death, when we were informed that she paid her tenant $200 to cripple my brother but then they took away his life.Even if the courts havent decided this case, its the truth because she once took her family members to beat up my brother, and we also retaliated, said Mercy Sinoia.Rodwell Tshuma, a close friend of the now deceased, expressed his profound shock and a new-found fear.I saw my friends body at the mortuary, and I was really pained when I saw the way he was mutilated.He would share his marital problems with me, and when I heard that his former wife had a hand in his death, I started fearing women.
