            "content": "By Own Correspondent\n\nThe Zimbabwe Achievers Awards (ZAA) has entered a landmark partnership with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) to scale up diaspora engagement and inclusive investment for Zimbabwes development. The collaboration is part of a multinational initiative by the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to leverage the African diasporas financial and professional contributions to strengthen economic growth and resilience in several African countries, including Zimbabwe.\n\nThe partnership will be anchored on the ZAA Diaspora Forum & Global Awards, a premier platform that connects Zimbabweans abroad with their homeland through structured dialogue, investment opportunities, and recognition of excellence. The collaboration comes at a crucial time when diaspora remittances and expertise are increasingly recognised as critical drivers of sustainable development across Africa.\n\nResearch by IOM has consistently shown that diaspora communities play a pivotal role in shaping national development through remittances, knowledge transfer, and skills development. Zimbabwes diaspora contributes significantly to the national economy, with remittances surpassing foreign direct investment in recent years. The AfDB has equally prioritised diaspora financing as a vital resource for economic transformation and resilience across the continent.\n\nThrough this tripartite partnership:\n\nSpeaking on the partnership, Conrad Mwanza, ZAA Founder, said:\n\nThis collaboration is a milestone in our mission to transform the Zimbabwean diaspora from being just remittance senders into full development partners. By working with IOM and AfDB, we are creating pathways for structured investments, innovation, and lasting impact.\n\nMs. Diana Cartier, IOM Zimbabwe Chief of Mission, added:\n\nBy formalizing partnerships such as this one with ZAA and the African Development Bank, we are ensuring that Zimbabweans abroad are not just celebrated for their achievements but are meaningfully engaged as drivers of social and economic development. IOM is committed to supporting frameworks that connect migration with sustainable growth.\n\nThe upcoming ZAA Diaspora Forum & Global Awards in Harare will serve as the launchpad for this collaboration, bringing together government leaders, private sector actors, and diaspora representatives to explore practical ways of turning geographical dispersion into a powerful national asset.\n\n",

This court cannot be substituted for the executor.\n\nBarns argued that he had advanced payments amounting to US$193,600 on behalf of Mugadza to stave off foreclosure of his Gunhill property, and sought to compel executor Emmanuel Ngwarati to register him as a secured creditor. But the executor rejected the claim, citing a lack of supporting documents, absence of any lending agreement, and the fact that some payments were made to third parties and not to the deceased himself.\n\nMugomba said the executor had duly provided reasons for rejecting the claim.\n\nWhether they are adequate or not is neither here nor there, she observed. The applicant wants this court to put all the claims under a microscope and literally force the first respondent to accept them. All these questions and issues can only lead to one logical conclusion. This court cannot be substituted for the executor.\n\nThe judge also criticised both sides legal representatives for failing to properly engage with the key legal issues. Had all the legal practitioners applied their minds, perhaps they would have been more helpful to the court. Because they did not, this impacts the order of costs.\n\nConcluding, Justice Chirawu-Mugomba dismissed the application, ordering each party to bear its own costs.\n\nThe application is akin to one for review disguised as a court application to compel. It is clearly incompetent, she ruled.\n\n",
