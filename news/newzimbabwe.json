We are forced to improvise daily just to preserve life. But we cannot continue like this. The system has failed, and the suffering is unbearable.\n\nWe call on the government of Zimbabwe to urgently prioritise the health sector. Equip hospitals. Support nurses. Save lives. This situation must be addressed without delay, nurses said.\n\n",

We feel that this is a strategy by the employer to endlessly buy time while we are working as their slaves for free. Its cruel.\n\nBut in principle, non-academics and academics are on the same page, there is no going back.\n\nThey have resolved to join AUT in the industrial job action. There is no going back, he said.\n\nStudents also said they are worried that the situation has remained unresolved for a long time.\n\nZinasu spokesperson for UZ Chapter, Darlington Chigwena, said their future has already been compromised as the review of UZ qualifications has gone down.\n\nHe said students will fight in the corner of their lecturers because they are excessively affected.\n\nThe return of our lecturers means that we are going to have credible and quality education.\n\nWe are together with lecturers, we are working hand in glove.\n\nAlso, as students, we are not only showing substantial solidarity to the lecturers because we are aware that if they are treated in a proper manner, it means that we are going to excel as students.\n\nWe are also aware that as students we are workers in transit so if the rights are being respected it means that our rights as future workers are also going to be respected so the picket which is going to happen on Monday, we are going to partake, we are goi g to participate as students, we are going to be there as many as the sand of the sea showing our solidarity with them making sure that justice prevails both for the lecturers and the students, he said.\n\nThe next picketing will be held on Monday.\n\n",

Procedures have been abused to frustrate execution. Entities linked to the applicant have been used to frustrate genuine execution of court orders.\n\nThese include the PHD Ministries and The Walter Magaya Family Trust, saidGetBucks in the application.\n\nIt also said Magaya and his wife are popular figures in the society with Magaya being a prophet at PHD Ministries.\n\nThe two have presented themselves as individuals with nothing and have used entities as agents. They should show the court how they are settling personal obligations and sustaining themselves, reads the application.\n\nA prima facie case has been made entitling the applicant to be granted a provisional order pending confirmation for the liquidation process to promptly commence.\n\nGetBucks also prayed for costs on a higher scale.\n\nThis is classic abuse of proceedings to frustrate court orders and the creditor. Applicant has been put out of pocket unnecessarily by the 1st Respondent and have been forced to resort to this application. Costs on a punitive scale are warranted in cases of abuse of processes, reads the application.\n\nThe matter was set down for a virtual hearing, Wednesday.\n\n",
