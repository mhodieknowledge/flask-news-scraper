We are all accountable to the President of the Republic in our various workstations.\n\nSo, we must be able to find each other. I told the Mayor of Bulawayo (David Coltart) last week that we have come here not to fight, but to build bridges, Garwe said.\n\nHe revealed that some people were expecting fights in their minds, which was not the mission.\n\nSo, we said there are some ways to build bridges. All these cities, the 32 urban councils, are all ours.\n\nThe 60 rural councils are all ours. There is no person who exists in this kind that doesnt belong to a vote. So, this is how important local authorities are to everybody.\n\nWe do not want to be focusing on fault finding. We want to be focusing on correcting the areas where we are not doing well. We should be able to be corrected as well, he told the officials.\n\nResults for the local authorities performance released showed that most of them had failed to reach their targets for the year.\n\nLet us take responsibility whenever there is something that we have done correctly. There is no one under the sun who does not make a mistake, nobody.\n\nAll of us make mistakes, but the ability to be able to sit down and diagnose the problem and provide the cure is what makes us different from the rest of the people.\n\nGarwe urged the local authorities bosses to tackle challenges without looking at which party one belonged to.\n\nWe must attend ourselves into challenges. In here, we do not have councillors belonging to political parties. We have councillors belonging to government.\n\nWe are all accountable to government, we are all accountable to this existence. So we leave behind all this political culture behaviour the moment we are sworn into offices.\n\nFurther, he said, Right now, there are no any chances. We do not need to be mudslinging. We do need to speak to each other, working together to turn around the fortunes of our local authorities.\n\nThe minister also urged council officials and councillors to change their mindset and forget about past fights.\n\nThe local authorities in central government, officials from the minister of Local Government, change your mindset in a positive attitude towards our local authorities.\n\nWe humbly request you to leave positive attitude towards central government.\n\nWe are one government with one vision. We want to turn- around the local governance and avoid focus on what happened in the past, said Garwe, adding What is done is done. Let us focus on the future.\n\nMost local authorities have not done well in the service provision in the last years, mainly due to political fights and corruption, prompting government to privatise most of the services especially in Harare.\n\n",

A contract that is measured in clean water supply, functioning sanitation, well-maintained roads, and refuse collections.\n\nAs we reflect on the performance of our local authorities, it is essential to acknowledge the policy landscape that will inform our next steps.\n\nThe recent performance outcomes and new significant challenges, none of our local authorities exceeded their targets, Garwe said.\n\nThe minister stated the failure by the local councils to reach targets was a reminder that something must be done urgently.\n\nIn the concerning percentage of what rural and urban councils failed below expectations, this data sets as a wake-up call for all of us, added Garwe saying in the length of these outcomes, councils must strategically adapt from the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), 2021 to 2025, to the forthcoming National Development Strategy 2 (NDS2), 2026 to 2030.\n\nHe stressed that this transition represented not just a change in policy direction, but a critical opportunity to recalibrate governments approach to local governance, which is central to minimum savings in different standards.\n\nNDS2 focuses on enhancing the capabilities of local authorities, ensuring that they are equipped to meet the demands of services delivered in a rapidly changing environment.\n\nCentral to our discussions today is the Cultural Action Group, which is fed with the minimum services delivered standards. And these standards are essential for establishing the baseline for services delivered across all our local authorities.\n\nThey will say this is a guide for local authorities to elevate their performance and ensure that every citizen receives the quality services they deserve.\n\nIt is, therefore, imperative that we institutionalise these standards and hold ourselves accountable for meeting them, said Garwe.\n\nThe minister urged authorities to be focused.\n\nAs we confront the realities of our current performance, let us not lose sight of our goals. The vision of a prosperous and empowered upper-middle income society by year 2030 is within our reach, but it requires a refereeing commitment and collective effort, said Garwe.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, there are 32 urban councils and 60 rural councils, giving a total of 92 councils countrywide.\n\n",

            "content": "By Obert Masaraure\n\nOpen Letter to His Excellency President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nOur nations political history offers costly lessons that cannot be ignored.\n\nThe turning point of Zimbabwes 2017 military intervention, which brought your leadership to the fore, was not only a reaction to governance failure but the culmination of unresolved intra-party succession politics in ZANU PF.\n\nFormer leader Robert Mugabes reluctance to name a successor or allow the selection of one, no doubt, fostered deep-rooted factionalism, empowered opportunistic individuals and destabilised not only the ruling party but the nation.\n\nDuring that period, the unconventional rise of former First Lady Grace Mugabe, with a limited understanding of the partys ideological ethos but with direct presidential favour, no doubt unsettled party structures and alienated key constituencies.\n\nThis treacherous period also demonstrated how closely ZANU PF and the government are intertwined, to the point where internal party manoeuvres have a direct impact on public administration and national policy.\n\nIt became increasingly difficult to distinguish between national governance and party interests, often to the detriment of the common people.\n\nHer ascent mirrored the widening gap between leadership decisions and the realities faced by teachers, civil servants, the formal sector, vendors and the rest of the informal sector, whose incomes eroded while elite political battles consumed national focus.\n\nThis tragic and excruciating economic cost was borne by ordinary Zimbabweans, who endured both the repercussions and consequences of the factional conflict.\n\nToday, Your Excellency, there are troubling echoes of that same toxic environment that spiralled into the military assistance coup.\n\nYour Excellency, the same reluctance you inherited from Mugabe not to publicly outline a clear succession plan is fostering similar factional tensions that resemble events that led to your predecessors demise and the November 2017 coup.\n\nThe growing political profile of businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei, who is a sanctioned figure whose wealth and proximity to power resemble the patronage model that propelled Grace Mugabe, risks creating a perception of leadership capture by private interests.\n\nThis uncertainty is already manifesting in open contradictions among senior party officials, such as ZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa and the partys legal secretary Patrick Chinamasa.\n\nOne of your loyalists, Daniel Garwe, who is the current minister of local government and doubles as ZANU PF Mashonaland East provincial chairperson, recently made a public declaration about no elections in 2028, and strategic manoeuvres to shape ZANU PFs 2027 Congress.\n\nIf such utterances are left unchecked, these developments could fracture the ruling party, which is conflated with our government, in ways that compromise national stability and economic governance.\n\nFor the ordinary citizen, that would again mean delayed salary adjustments for teachers, inconsistent allowances for civil servants, and a widening poverty gap for informal traders who rely on a predictable economic environment.\n\nYour Excellency, your ascendancy to the presidency began with a promise to break from the mistakes of the past.\n\nOn November 22, 2017 when you returned from exile, you issued a powerful and convincing speech where you stated: We want to grow our economy, we want peace, we want jobs, jobs, jobs, to a cheering crowd in Harare.\n\nThis speech served as the backbone of the transformative mantra you envisaged: Zimbabwe is Open for Business.\n\nYet, on succession, the path once again nostalgically appears familiar.\n\nBoth the party and the country require certainty.\n\nZANU PF would be strengthened, the markets would be reassured, and millions of peoples livelihoods would be safeguarded by facilitating the transparent election of a successor at your ZANU PF Congress.\n\nBeing a leader involves more than just retaining power; it also involves facilitating its peaceful transition.\n\nThe alternative is to repeat history at the same human cost that 2017 so painfully taught us.\n\nMr President, maybe its now too late for you to manage the succession. The factions may have lost faith in you. Look across the Limpopo and copy Ramaphosas national dialogue model. That way you broaden the discussion of Zimbabwes future.\n\nYou have an opportunity to rescue your legacy by allowing Citizens to dialogue on the direction they want Zimbabwe to take post your leadership.\n\nDedicate the last 2 years of your term to instituting the reforms that the people so much desire. It is apparent that ZANU PF alone wont allow you to institute the reforms desired by the nation. Rope in a Transitional Council to spearhead the transition agenda within your government.\n\nAt the end of the day, we owe you nothing as a nation. We have allowed you to govern us; we are simply giving you an opportunity to rescue your legacy and protect the interests of your family and allies.\n\nYour Excellency, be warned that if you choose to be indecisive on the succession process, the disenfranchised majority may be forced to take initiatives.\n\nOrdinary people will not allow the replication of 2017, where elites consolidated a system that manufactures poverty for the many.\n\nWe are ready to support a transition towards inclusive governance, but we also stand ready to block the consolidation of elite tyranny.\n\nOn behalf of the disenfranchised masses of Zimbabwe.\n\nObert Masaraure is a unionist and human rights defender. He writes here in his own capacity.\n\n",
