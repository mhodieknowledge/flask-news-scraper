            "content": "Xinhua\n\nZimbabwean authorities on Wednesday called for sustainable domestic financing to fight against tuberculosis (TB) as external funding declined.\n\nOwen Mugurungi, director of AIDS and TB programs in the Ministry of Health and Child Care, said at a conference in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare that the reduction in global donor funding posed a direct threat to the countrys TB response, and the country needs to explore sustainable domestic financing to respond to the infectious disease.\n\nWe can not build a resilient TB response on unpredictable and external funding alone, Mugurungi said, adding that the situation underscores the urgent need for sustainable financing and domestic investment.\n\nHe noted that Zimbabwe faces a high burden of TB/HIV co-infection and a persistent challenge of drug-resistant TB.\n\nAccording to him, the ministry estimated that approximately 15,000 TB cases were missed last year, and the gap represents the single greatest challenge in the fight against the disease.\n\nOur national TB response is at a crossroads. We have the strategy, we have the evidence, and we have the dedicated workforce. What we need now is the collective will to convert our commitments into concrete action. We must find the missing cases, secure the necessary resources and embrace the innovations that will allow us to end TB in Zimbabwe, Mugurungi said.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, Zimbabwean Health and Child Care Minister Douglas Mombeshora commended Zimbabwe for progress in the fight against the infectious disease.\n\nOur TB response has made real progress. But as we celebrate progress, we must also be honest about the road ahead. TB remains a serious public health challenge and the shifting landscape of global health financing is creating uncertainty for critical programs, he added.\n\n",

She always said Id make it in art. I wish she was here to see this.\n\nAfter studying art at Magwegwe High School, Rasta followed his dreams to South Africa. He hustled in restaurants and construction before art came knocking again.\n\nIf its a calling, you cant hide it, he said. I had to slow down everything else when art started shouting my name.\n\nKnown for his often debated portraits of Mzansis late icons, Rasta said painting faces is his way of telling stories.\n\nPortraits show your journey and story, he said. Art is entertainment on its own. If youre not criticised, youre not working.\n\nHes dreaming of exhibitions to honour legends such as Vuyo Mokoena, Lundi Tyamara, Riky Rick, HHP and ProKid, with proceeds going to their families.\n\nHes also made his mark on screen, appearing inDiepCity, Black DoorandGomoraand starring in a viral Chicken Licken ad.\n\nThat ad was a movie. If adverts had awards, that one wouldve scooped it, he laughed.\n\nThrough the fame, criticism and memes, Rasta remains grounded and grateful.\n\nIve been threatened not to paint, but this is my God-given talent, he said.\n\nIm a soldier. I pray, I paint and I bring bread home.\n\nAnd to his critics? Rasta smiles and keeps sketching.\n\nIm an art believer. As long as I have paint, Ill keep telling our stories.\n\n",

This marks a 511% increase from 2019 levels, a remarkable turnaround in just six years.\n\nThe expansion aligns with Zimbabwes broader strategy to reduce dependence on imports, especially following the global grain price spikes triggered by theRussiaUkraineconflict.\n\nWheatis the countrys second most important cereal after maize, and domestic self-sufficiency is seen as critical to stabilising food prices and strengthening food security.\n\nFocus on export opportunities and market stability\n\nWith domestic needs fully met, Zimbabwe is now seeking export opportunities within the region, particularly in neighboring countries that continue to face wheat shortages.\n\nHowever, Masuka emphasized that local supply remains secure and that the government has taken measures to stabilise pricing and ensure smooth distribution.\n\nThe government has released 6,518 metric tonnes to millers in recent weeks to stabilise supply and pricing levels of wheat products, he said, noting that the Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) continues to coordinate marketing and distribution to maintain market balance.\n\nDespite the surplus, Zimbabwe will continue importing limited volumes of high-gluten wheat, which is preferred by some millers for specific bread formulations.\n\nCertain millers have indicated that their mills and bread styles require high gluten content wheat not achievable in locally produced wheat, Masuka explained.\n\nAccording to him, as per current policy, such wheat will continue to be imported under existing arrangements, without any additional costs.\n\nThe government is urging registered millers and industry players to collaborate closely with authorities under the AMA framework to ensure a consistent balance between production, demand, and market stability.\n\nZimbabwes wheat success story reflects years of deliberate investment in irrigation infrastructure, farmer training, and private-sector partnerships.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), sub-SaharanAfricastill imports over 80% of its wheat consumption, underscoring Zimbabwes rare achievement in the region.\n\n",
