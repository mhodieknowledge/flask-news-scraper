            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) is still pinning its hopes on the strength of the local gold-backed Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency to compete against major currencies, including the United States dollar.\n\nSpeaking during a Tourism Business Council of Zimbabwe (TBCZ) indaba recently, RBZ Governor John Mushayavanhu put up a spirited defence against detractors of the ZiG claiming robust monetary policy measures introduced by the bank were ensuring the ZiG remains bouyant.\n\nThe ZiG to USD rate is firming up, Mushayavanhu said.\n\nThe governor claimed this as a clear indication that confidence in the local currency remains the primary mandate of the apex bank.\n\nZimbabwe introduced the currency in April last year after a whirlwind battle with exchange rate volatility and runaway inflation.\n\nPart of the raft of measures adopted by RBZ is the tight monetary policy stance, scaffolded by a relatively high-interest rate regime to discourage speculative borrowing.\n\nThe RBZ governor said the central bank was working to ensure durable ZiG stability and to make the currency the pillar of the economy.\n\nMushayavanhu highlighted that de-dollarisation remained on track to meet the 2030 target of returning to a domestic mono-currency regime.\n\nAuthorities, business leaders and economists admit that the US dollar-denominated currency regime is not sustainable, given the overly strong currency, which suppresses the competitiveness of local goods and services on the global market.\n\nThe limited supply of US dollars also limits the central banks capacity to use its monetary policy tools to influence economic dynamics in the country.\n\nAmong the measures to enhance confidence and performance of the ZiG, the apex bank said economic agents were free to charge prices not fixed to the official exchange rate.\n\nThe market is free to price their goods and services at whatever USD to ZiG rate they prefer without being limited to using the official RBZ exchange rate, Mushayavanhu told delegates.\n\nThis effectively means the pricing system is liberal, allowing companies to use exchange rates that reflect market dynamics.\n\nThe governor noted that the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) would not penalise businesses for not using pricing models fixed to the official exchange rate, for as long as the pricing is with reasonable margins.\n\nMushayavanhu emphasised that economic agents attempting to manipulate the market by using untenable exchange rates would soon price themselves out of competition.\n\nThe governor revealed that some fuel traders had already approached the RBZ, offering to sell fuel in ZiG to finance their local obligations.\n\nOver time, the governor said, the fuel dealers would voluntarily sell the commodity in the domestic currency.\n\nWe do not want to go back to long queues and fuel shortages, he noted, signalling that policy decisions will be made with economic stability in mind.\n\nMushayavanhu also shot down suggestions for preferential treatment to forex access for capital projects.\n\nRBZ Deputy Governor Innocent Matshe said the realistic exchange rate, based on economic fundamentals, should be US$1/ZiG22, a level that authorities expect the market to accept.\n\n",

But Wolves paid just 16 million for Munetsi, and that is already looking like a bargain.\n\nPhysically, hes so powerful and capable of winning battles against his opponents, while his movement and ability to sniff out chances are commendable attributes.\n\nFor most of his Wolves career so far, hes spurned some golden chances, but tonight he showed composure in the box to score and long may it continue.\n\nAlthough Wolves have been reliant on Cunha, its refreshing to see others step up to the plate, as Munetsi is easily someone who could hit double figures for goals in a season.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com has invited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal) to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, this week we want to discuss on the law of civil partnerships, without beating around the bush, is this law crafted to protect small houses?\n\nVM: (laughs)A very direct question but it reflects the general perception of many. The intention and purpose of the law is however far removed from that perspective.\n\nIn Zimbabwe people normally live together as husband and wife under the following marriage regimes, as a couple under a civil marriage, that is a marriage registered under the Marriages Act Chapter 5:11 which was formerly and is still commonly known by many as Chapter 37, a qualified civil marriage which is potentially polygamous and is solemnized by a Minister of religion, normally for the Islamic religion. There is also the registered or unregistered customary marriage, which involves the payment of lobola and is also potentially polygamous.\n\nHowever, there are many couples who live together and have lived together for years as husband and wife and have not formalized their union under any of the categories I stated. Those are ultimately the people the law was put in place to protect.\n\nIt is really a question of equity and justice more than anything else.\n\nReporter: Am not completely convinced, however, please explain to us what a civil partnership is?\n\nVM: In Zimbabwe, firstly, a civil partnership is a relationship between a man and woman , this is important as some countries extend the definition to include people of the same sex in a relationship.\n\nThe man and woman must be above the age of 18, meaning that they are able to contract a marriage in Zimbabwe. They should also have lived together as a couple under a genuine domestic basis. A variety of circumstances are considered here, but in summary, it must be established that they were living together as husband and wife but for the actual formal solemnizing of their relationship under the categories I mentioned earlier.\n\nThe couple cannot be of the same bloodline, that is brother and sister, first or second cousins. There are exceptions in law to first and second cousins, which exceptions include, whether or not the couple knew that they were relatedet ceterabut that is a discussion for another day.\n\nReporter:So how does one prove that they qualify as a civil partnership, what is the criteria?\n\nVM: Well, the law has left this to the courts to interpret what qualifies as a civil partnership for purposes of enjoying the rights that follow. There is no set criteria that states that this or that is what is necessary to prove before it can be considered as a civil partnership. We can say that the law is developing in that area.\n\nEach case is dealt with according to its own circumstances.\n\nThey are however issues the courts will consider in varying circumstances, issues like how long the relationship lasted, the nature and extent of their living in together or common residence, the degree or extent of their financial dependence or interdependence. The couple may have also bought property togetheret cetera. The relationship has to be of a sexual nature off -course.\n\nReporter: So in terms of explanation for qualification, small houses will have marriage rights should that relationship come to an end?\n\nVM: I suppose we have come back to the question we started on.\n\nThe law does recognize that some civil partnerships may include what you are terming as small houses and some rights do follow dissolution of civil partnership.\n\nA court that is ceased with the task of dissolving the civil partnership where there is to be distribution of assets or there are such claims will pay due regard and not ignore the rights of the other spouse who is not party to this dissolution. Long and short, the assets that belong to the spouse, if proved to be the assets of the spouse, will not form a part of civil partnership property if I can loosely call it that.\n\nReporter: So does the claim by a small house dissolving a civil partnership not expose the married person to the crime of bigamy?\n\nVM: I will repeat that the law on civil partnerships is not limited to the issue of small houses. It is for people who live together in a domestic sexual relationship.\n\nTo your question, the dissolution of a civil partnership where one partner has a spouse under a civil marriage, the law has specifically excluded the crime of bigamy, so no, the married person will not be exposed to the crime of bigamy.\n\nReporter: Does this law extend to the question of inheritance for people under civil partnerships when one dies?\n\nVM: The Marriages Act of 2022 does not specifically include the word inheritance and the laws that protect spouses on the death of a spouse do not automatically apply. It goes back to the point that the civil partnership may have to be proved to the satisfaction of the court to qualify for inheritance or a claim on the estate of the deceased.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

            "content": "By Ashfak Mohamed l IOL\n\nWHEN you hear Darrien Landsberg talk, you can understand why he is an all-action figure on the pitch for the Lions.\n\nThe No 5 lock is an energetic presence for the Johannesburg franchise, and has taken his game to the next level this season.\n\nHe was perhaps unlucky to miss out on an invitation to the Springbok alignment camp taking place in Cape Town next week, especially considering the fact that there are injuries to a number of second-rowers at the moment.\n\nAll of Eben Etzebeth, Ruan Nortj and JD Schickerling are on the sidelines, and Landsberg is able to fulfil both lock roles.\n\nBorn in Zimbabwe but raised in Johannesburg, where he attended Northcliff High School, the 26-year-old has yet to feature for his country of his birth.\n\nThat indicates that he is arguably still waiting for a Bok call-up, and looking at his performances over the last few months, he is clearly determined to keep on knocking on Rassie Erasmus door.\n\nSolid in the lineouts and a high work-rate in defence, Landsbergs point of difference is his agility as a ball-carrier. He almost always seems to be up with the play, ready to take a pass or pop from a teammate, and is the stereotype of what a Lions forward is all about.\n\nHe was at it again in last weeks 38-14 United Rugby Championship victory over the Sharks at Ellis Park, and will be eager for a repeat in Saturdays return clash at Kings Park in Durban (2pm start).\n\nLandsberg speaks as quickly as he plays, and he will join Ruben Schoeman in the Lions engine-room in trying to outwit and outlast Sharks lock pair Jason Jenkins and Emile van Heerden.\n\nIve been blessed to get the opportunity, and how I see myself going? It can only be God. None of this is me! Landsberg said with sheer modesty this week.\n\nMy team are motivating me a lot and giving me the opportunity to express myself  and getting the backing from the Boks in the team.\n\nThat almost pushes me to open up my opportunities and eyes to have bigger goals.\n\nWe let ourselves down against the Bulls, so it was definitely a game (against the Sharks last week) that we needed to rectify things.\n\nIn the week, we had set out a plan of action, and we couldnt have asked for a better way to execute it.\n\nSo, big-ups to the boys for that one. But this week coming up is a whole different challenge. Its only a weeks turnaround, so I dont think theres much that can be changed.\n\nThe only thing that can be a point of difference is who wants it more. The effort that goes into the collisions\n\nYou read articles where they felt they were physically dominated, so theyre definitely going to come out and prove a point.\n\nBut that will push us more to up our physicality even more and improve from last week.\n\nLions coach Ivan van Rooyen had to re-jig his loose trio on Friday, due to injuries to Bok flank Ruan Venter and former Blitzboks star JC Pretorius.\n\nThe dynamic Siba Qoma will replace Venter at No 7, and fetcher Jarod Cairns will fill Pretorius boots at openside flank.\n\nVan Rooyen will hope that the absence of Venter and Pretorius wont affect the Lions all-out attacking approach, as they ran the Sharks off their feet last week.\n\nBut with the Durban humidity and an obvious response expected from the home side, it is unlikely to be as easy an encounter this time around.\n\nThe fact that theyre wounded thats a dangerous aspect. I hear its going to be a packed Kings Park, so we must go there with the right mindset to get the W, Landsberg said.\n\nIf we get the win, it moves us to fifth or sixth on the log, and then we have four home games after our tour (to Europe).\n\nIt will definitely be a big confidence-booster, and we are also going up a lot of Boks in the Sharks side, and want to help our guys going to the alignment camp.\n\nIts about building consistency, go through the processes in the week, and the game will take care of itself.\n\nTeams For Durban\n\nLions: 15 Tapiwa Mafura 14 Richard Kriel 13 Manuel Rass 12 Marius Louw 11 Edwill van der Merwe 10 Gianni Lombard 9 Morn van den Berg 8 Francke Horn (captain) 7 Siba Qoma 6 Jarod Cairns 5 Darrien Landsberg 4 Ruben Schoeman 3 Asenathi Ntlabakanye 2 PJ Botha 1 Juan Schoeman.\n\nBench: 16 Franco Marais 17 Morgan Naud 18 Conraad van Vuuren 19 Ruan Delport 20 Izan Esterhuizen 21 Nico Steyn 22 WJ Steenkamp 23 Rynhardt Jonker.\n\nSharks: 15 Henry Immelman 14 Yaw Penxe 13 Jurenzo Julius 12 Francois Venter 11 Ethan Hooker 10 Jordan Hendrikse 9 Grant Williams 8 Siya Kolisi (captain) 7 Lappies Labuschagne 6 Phepsi Buthelezi 5 Emile van Heerden 4 Jason Jenkins 3 Vincent Koch 2 Bongi Mbonambi 1 Ox Nche.\n\nBench: 16 Fez Mbatha 17 Nthuthuko Mchunu 18 Hanro Jacobs 19 Corn Rahl 20 James Venter 21 Nick Hatton 22 Jaden Hendrikse 23 Hakeen Kunene.\n\n",

In my opinion, we were the better side. Unfortunately, we could not put the ball in the net, said Chigowe.\n\nWith this result, Herentals remain unbeaten in the league, having beaten Telone 2-1 last weekend.\n\nHerentals coach Paul Benza expressed satisfaction with the draw.\n\nIt was a very difficult game. Dynamos came at us strongly in the first half. They had a lot of chances but failed to score, and we are very happy because, at the end of the day, we managed a clean sheet and a point, said Benza.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA DECADE after the disappearance of human rights activist and journalist Itai Dzamara, pressure is mounting on the Zanu PF government to provide answers.\n\nCampaigners and activists have condemned the ruling party, with some branding it a terrorist organisation that must be held to account for Dzamaras disappearance.\n\nItai Dzamara\n\nDzamara was last seen on March 9, 2015, when he was allegedly taken from his home in Glenview, Harare, by State security operatives in an unmarked vehicle.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding his disappearance remain shrouded in mystery, prompting renewed calls for a thorough and transparent investigation.\n\nAward-winning human rights lawyer and Principal Managing Partner at Tsunga Bhamu Law International, Arnold Tsunga, has implored the President Emmerson Mnangagwa-led government to make a public announcement explaining why it has failed to bring the perpetrators of Dzamaras disappearance to justice.\n\nThe government has to do all in its powers to make a public and open announcement on why it has not been possible to bring the perpetrators of the abduction of Itai Dzamara to account, he said.\n\nThe failure of any progress, it really affects human rights activists and in particular it affects the family. The family of a disappeared person, they suffer uncertainty, trauma, and they dont have closure, he added.\n\nIts a threat to the rule of law; its a threat to the justice and accountability. It reduces confidence of people in the ability of our law enforcement system to be able to protect the citizens.\n\nFormer Zengeza West MP Job Sikhala stated that the Zanu PF-led government knows the whereabouts of Dzamara and owes the public an explanation as to what happened to him.\n\nThe regime knows what happened to Itai Dzamara, Sikhala said.\n\nIt is the duty of every government to protect its citizens. The security of every person falls in the hands of the State. We still demand with our loud voices to know what happened to Itai. It remains a serious issue of public interest, he added.\n\nHuman rights defender and Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) president Obert Masaraure minced no words for Zanu PF, describing it as a terrorist organisation and warning that the perpetrators of Dzamaras disappearance would eventually face retribution.\n\nThe Dzamara story reminds us that the Zanu PF party is a terrorist organisation. We will not tire to demand the return of Dzamara. Those who abducted him Dzamara will be forced to pay in the coming Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nEfforts to obtain comment from the government were unsuccessful, as both Information Minister Jenfan Muswere and Information Permanent Secretary Nick Mangwana could not be reached on their mobile phones.\n\nHowever, Zanu PF Director of Communication Farai Marapira asserted that human rights defenders and activists carry the burden of proof, as they are the ones making unfounded allegations against his party, which he described as a law-abiding institution.\n\nHe who alleges must prove. It is sad that some people would seek cheap mileage over another familys anguish. We are a law-abiding institution which holds the laws of our land sacrosanct. It is crass madness to then associate us with such a vile accusation, Marapira said.\n\nZimbabwe has neither signed nor ratified the United Nations International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance despite repeated calls to do so by UN Member States. The government, it seems, is dragging its feet on this issue.\n\nThis convention came into being in 2006 and started being implemented in 2010.\n\nLast year, human rights lawyer Obey Shava, represented by renowned lawyer Tendai Biti, took Mnangagwas government to the High Court, arguing that the administration must ratify the United Nations Convention against enforced disappearance treaty.\n\nShava deplored what he described as a systematic pattern of enforced disappearance, abduction, torture, and cruel and degrading treatment. He asserted that numerous individuals, including himself, human rights defenders, opposition political party supporters, legislators, and ordinary citizens, have been subjected to these acts, with some also being injected with unknown substances.\n\n",
