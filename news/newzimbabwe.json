            "content": "BBC\n\nPatrice Motsepe has been re-elected unopposed as Confederation of African Football (Caf) president for a second term in office.\n\nThe 63-year-old South African, who has been Caf president since 2021, had announced his decision to stand again in October 2024.\n\nHis re-election for another four-year reign was confirmed at the Caf extraordinary general assembly in Cairo on Wednesday where Fifa president Gianni Infantino was in attendance.\n\nMotsepe, a mining magnate who also owns South African club Mamelodi Sundowns, had said he was looking tocontinue the good progresshe had made since coming to office four years ago.\n\nAlthough Motsepes re-election was a formality, elections were held for positions on Cafs executive committee with Cameroonian football legend Samuel Etoo winning a seat.\n\nThe continents representatives on the Fifa council were also voted in during Wednesdays executive general assembly.\n\nMotsepes second term in charge of African football was decided before Wednesdays events in Cairo after he became the first and only contender to run for office.\n\nThe lack of challengers could be seen as a vote of confidence in the South Africans presidency so far, having come to Caf at a time of crisis.\n\nIn 2021 he succeeded Ahmad of Madagascar who hadbecome the first Caf president to be banned by Fifa.\n\nSince then, the African football body has grown financially, making a $72m (55.5m) profit from last years Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon)  a sum 18 times bigger than that generated by the previous edition in 2022.\n\nWhen declaring his intent to run for a second term, Motsepe told the BBC progress had been made, but there is still a lot of work to be done.\n\nDuring his speech on Wednesday, he highlighted the issue of national stadiums across Africa as one of his key areas of focus.\n\nIn 2021, there were 36 countries that were not playing football in their countries. The number has come down to 12 but for us, this is still a big number, he said.\n\nAt Caf and Fifa, it is our job to continue supporting the development of sports infrastructure.\n\nThe election of four-time African Footballer of the Year Samuel Etoo on to Cafs decision-making executive committee was among the big talking points from Wednesdays events in Cairo.\n\nEtoo, president of the Cameroon Football Federation (Fecafoot), was elected unopposed as he was the only candidate from the central Africa region.\n\nLast week,the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld an appeal by Etoo,externalwho won the right to be included on the list of candidates after initially being ruled out of the contest by Cafs governance committee in January.\n\nThe 44-year-old former Cameroon striker was suspended last year by both Fifa and Caf for violating disciplinary regulations.\n\nCaf had banned him after an inquiry into purported breaches of its ethical and integrity standards when he took up a role as ambassador for a betting company.\n\nThe ban and a $200,000 finewere later lifted on appeal.\n\nEtoo was greeted warmly by delegates around him when his name was announced along with the five other elected members on Cafs executive committee.\n\nThe former Barcelona and Inter Milan striker has been in charge of Fecafoot since December 2021 but has seen his tenure mired in controversy.\n\nLast September he received asix-match banfrom attending Cameroon games while one former international team-mate described him as adictatorfor his handling of the appointment of Indomitable Lions head coach Marc Brys.\n\nThere was also a vote to decide the six African representatives on the Fifa Council with Hany Abo Rida of Egypt and Fouzi Lekjaa of Morocco retaining their places.\n\nKanizat Ibrahim (Comoros), Hamidou Djibrilla Hima (Niger), Ahmed Yahya (Mauritania) and Souleymane Waberi (Djibouti) were elected for the first time.\n\nOn Cafs executive committee, five others were elected unopposed alongside Samuel Etoo.\n\nMustapha Ishola Raji of Liberia retained his seat for another four years, while Bestine Kazadi Ditabala (Democratic Republic of Congo), Wallace Karia (Tanzania), Kurt Simeon-Okraku (Ghana) and Sadi Walid (Algeria) are new to the committee.\n\nElvis Chetty of the Seychelles lost his place when Feizal Sidat (Mozambique) and Samir Sobha of Mauritius were voted in to represent southern Africa.\n\n",

He stole cash, cellphones, groceries and other valuables. He brutally sexually assaulted his victims with extreme violence, said the National Prosecuting Authority.\n\nIn one of the counts, prosecutors proved that he broke into the house of a woman who stays alone in Mt Darwin.\n\nIt was on January 18 last year.\n\nThe accused, who was armed with a machete, threatened to strike her with a machete if she made any noise.\n\nThe accused person ordered the complainant to remove her night dress and pant, the court heard.\n\nHe then raped her once without protection.\n\nAfter the intercourse, the accused tied both the complainants hands and searched all over the complainants house for cash but found none.\n\nHe raped the woman once again and robbed her of her valuables before disappearing into the dark.\n\nHe again attacked a 25-year-old lady on December 11 2023.\n\nThe complainant was alone at her house preparing supper outside.\n\nMazambani asked for water and the victim went inside to fetch it for him.\n\nHe then followed her inside the house and raped her twice without protection.\n\nThe court heard he forced her to strip naked and force marched her into a nearby bush where he raped again.\n\nHe demanded cash, but the complainant had none.\n\nThe victim ended up giving him gold ore, which was in her house.\n\nMazambani also stole her mobile cellphones\n\nOn the 17th day of December 2023, Mazambani, who was armed with a machete, used a big boulder to forcibly open the door to gain entry into the house of a 25-year-old woman who was asleep with her two minor children.\n\nWhile in the house, the complainant called for help, but the accused person switched off the light which was in the house and remained with his torch which was on his forehead.\n\nThe accused assaulted complainant once on the buttocks using the blunt part of a machete and kicked her once on the chest.\n\nThe accused took an axe handle which was in the complainants house and struck her on the head, the court heard.\n\nHe ransacked the complainants house and took some groceries, which he stashed in a brown bag.\n\nThe accused dragged the complainant into her dining room where he raped her once, the court heard.\n\nHe ordered the victim to take a bath while he watched before raping her again.\n\nHe then ordered the victim to clean him before he disappeared into the darkness.\n\nAll the incidents, some not narrated above, were reported to the police.\n\nMedical affidavits were produced in court as evidence, and all victims positively identified Mazambani and their property, which was found in his possession at the time of his arrest.\n\n",

However, for the first time, during Nadias disappearance, he showed up, taking pictures and posting them on social media in a celebratory mode.\n\nThat is extremely primitive at a time when we are searching for a woman who has invested so much in a national development, Mupambi said.\n\nIn a statement, police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the information is misleading.\n\nThe information is misleading the public on the exact position on the ground and police investigations.\n\nVongai Nadia Mabvirakure is a suspect in a case of contravening Section 113 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9: 23, Theft of trust property.\n\nThe complainant is Tichabaiwa Gwadu, who represents Matiza Foundation.\n\nIn September 2024, the suspect, through her company, Green Rebirth Trust, went into a partnership with Matiza Foundation to construct a greenhouse or shed net at Chomupunga Business Centre, Murewa, Nyathi said.\n\nAccording to ZRP, Mabvirakure was given US$15,200 cash to acquire the required materials based on her quotation.\n\nInstead of paying cash to Brickforce Hardware, Murewa, the suspect converted the money to personal use and went on to acquire the building materials on credit using false pretence under Matiza Foundation.\n\nBrickforce management later contacted Matiza Foundation Company, raising a complaint and demanding payments.\n\nA report was then made at ZRP Murewa, Nyathi said.\n\nNyathi added that a team from CID Murewa checked for the suspect at her known address in Chitungwiza on 05th March 2025.\n\nThey failed to locate her. They were told by her son, Patrick Mabvirakure that his mother was away.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police has since located the suspect. She is currently in hospital under Police Guard, he said.\n\nNyathi said full-scale investigations are currently underway in relation to the Theft of trust property case and her familys allegations.\n\nLinda Masarira, who was part of the Mabvirakures search party, shot back at Nyathi, accusing him of lying.\n\n@PoliceZimbabwe are you not ashamed of lying to the world. I spent the day looking for a safe hospital for Nadia. When police officers came to get her statement, I was there and they couldnt because she is disoriented. Why Mr Nyathi are you not doing due diligence and publishing falsehoods. I am coming to your office tomorrow with journalists so you can go and show us where she is hospitalised under police guard. she wrote on X.\n\nMashura akaboiliswa.@PoliceZimbabweare you not ashamed of lying to the world.
