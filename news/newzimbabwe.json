            "content": "A South African court has halted plans to bury former Zambian President Edgar Lungu at a private ceremony just as it was about to start.\n\nThe news was only announced to mourners in South Africa after a funeral mass had already finished.\n\nThis is the latest twist in a row between the government and Lungus family over his burial, after the family opted for a private ceremony in South Africa, rather than a full state funeral at home.\n\nThe Zambian government had filed an urgent case in the Pretoria High Court seeking to stop the burial planned by his family.\n\nThe court said that the funeral would not go ahead following an agreement between the parties however it appears that any funeral wont happen until August at the earliest.\n\nThe dispute follows a long-standing feud between Lungu and his successor, President Hakainde Hichilema, with Lungus family saying he had indicated that Hichilema should not attend his funeral.\n\nFollowing Lungus death in South Africa aged 68, the family wanted to be in charge of the funeral arrangements, including the repatriation of his body, but the Zambian authorities sought to take control.\n\nThe government and his family later agreed he would have a state funeral before relations broke down over the precise arrangements, prompting the family to opt for a burial in South Africa.\n\nPresident Hichilema has since argued that Lungu, as a former president, belongs to the nation of Zambia and should be buried in the country.\n\nNomsa Maseko / BBC Mourners were only told about the delay after the funeral mass had finished\n\nThe Pretoria court gave Zambian attorney general Mulilo D Kabesha until 4 July to submit his amended notice of motion in support of Lungus repatriation to Zambia. His family has until 11 July to file their opposing papers.\n\nThis matter will be heard as a special motion on the 4th of August 2025, the court said. The costs of the urgent application will be determined then.\n\nThe Zambian government argues that personal wishes should not override the greater public interest, citing the case of founding President Kenneth Kaunda.\n\nIn 2021, Kaundas family said he wanted to be laid to rest next to his wife and not at the site designated by the government.\n\nHowever, the government went ahead and buried Kaunda at Embassy Memorial Park in Lusaka.\n\nThe current row over Lungus burial underscores the tense relationship between him and his successor, which played out in life and continues even in death.\n\nWhen Lungu was president, Hichilema was locked up for over 100 days on treason charges after Hichilemas motorcade allegedly refused to give way for him.\n\n",

The organisation has invested resources towards crafting of the legislation to address gaps in mining communities over the years,\n\nThis is a significant and encouraging step that demonstrates the governments commitment to addressing one of the most pressing challenges facing the nation. We sincerely hope that this time, the Bill will proceed to completion without any setbacks. As a faith-based organisation actively engaged in mining communities, we stand ready to support Parliament and the government in all efforts related to the Bill, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "In the shadows ofZimbabwes collapsing economy, a new form of desperation is thriving  online gambling without limits.\n\nWith regulatory systems stretched thin and staff shortages plaguing the nations gambling authority, unlicensed operators have seized the moment. For many Zimbabweans, the appeal is painfully clear: platforms promising players the chance towin real money through no deposit free spins and bonusesoffer not just entertainment but a fleeting hope for survival. In a country where cash is scarce and opportunity scarcer, gambling without guardrails is no longer just a vice, its a coping mechanism. But behind the flashing promises and digital slot machines lies a crisis of oversight, addiction, and exploitation that no one in power seems ready to confront.\n\nIn a recent submission to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Defence, Home Affairs, Security Services, and War Veterans Affairs, Zimbabwes Lotteries and Gaming Board (LGB) highlighted the explosive growth of unauthorised gambling platforms. According to government sources there are three key drivers fueling this growth, namely rapid technological progress, easy access to online platforms, and the global, borderless nature of the internet  all of which render traditional enforcement nearly obsolete.\n\nThe board also acknowledged its internal shortcomings, particularly staffing shortages, which severely limit its ability to investigate and shut down illegal gambling operations. With limited human resources and no digital infrastructure in place to monitor online activity, enforcement efforts are largely ineffective and reactive.\n\nZimbabwes gambling regulations were never designed to contend with a digital world. TheLotteries and GamingAct, last updated in the early 2000s, lacks the provisions necessary to govern online casinos or sports betting apps. While physical betting venues must navigate a strict licensing process, online operators often bypass regulation entirely, hosting their platforms abroad and targeting Zimbabweans through social media and mobile apps.\n\nThis legal grey area has allowed digital gambling to flourish, with underground betting hubs and flashy, unregulated online casinos proliferating across the country. As legitimate operators adhere to licensing requirements and tax obligations, illegal actors face virtually no oversight  and often, no consequences whatsoever.\n\nIn an effort to bring some control to the chaos, the LGB has capped the number of licensed physical outlets and introduced stricter application procedures. More than 530 licenses were issued in 2024 alone, yet online platforms  often run from outside the country  remain untouched by these regulations.\n\nAlarmingly, authorities have also flagged the use of gambling platforms for illicit financial flows, including money laundering. While steps have been taken to tighten monitoring of financial transactions, these efforts are undermined by outdated tools and a lack of skilled personnel.\n\nThe fallout from illegal gambling in Zimbabwe extends far beyond lost tax revenue. It is leaving a growing trail of social harm in its wake  from rising addiction and spiraling debt to increasing mental health struggles, particularly among those already living on the economic margins. For many, these platforms offer not just a fleeting sense of hope, but a dangerous illusion, often ending in financial ruin.\n\nAddressing this crisis requires more than reactive enforcement. It calls for urgent legislative reform to bring online gambling into the legal fold, as well as serious investment in digital infrastructure capable of real-time monitoring and data-driven oversight. Equally important is the need to strengthen the capacity of regulatory bodies, through improved staffing and training, so they can act with speed and insight the current landscape demands. Zimbabwe must also look beyond its borders and work with international partners to clamp down on offshore platforms exploiting local vulnerabilities.\n\nUntil these critical steps are taken, the nations gambling sector will continue to split into two unequal halves  one that plays by the rules and another that flourishes in the shadows. Right now, its the lawless side that holds the upper hand, and the longer it goes unchecked, the higher the stakes for Zimbabwes economic and social future.\n\n",
