            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week, we want to discuss labour and employment law in Zimbabwe for foreign or diaspora businesses that want to invest in Zimbabwe. What are the main compliance requirements for companies wanting to employ workers in Zimbabwe?\n\nVM: The question is broad, but I will attempt to summarise in my response. Fundamental to all employment in Zimbabwe are the labour rights guaranteed by our Constitution, being among others, the right to be paid a reasonable and fair wage, right to fair and safe labour practices and right to join a trade union. The employment relationship must guarantee those rights.\n\nThe employer, being a foreign business, is required to register first with the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) as an employer and, if employing some foreign nationals as part of the business, to follow work permit or visa rules and establish contracts for the businesss employees.\n\nThere is also a need to comply with Statutory National Employment Council regulations governing the particular sector, National Social Security Authority (NSSA) requirements, collective bargaining agreements, trade unions and the corresponding remittances.\n\nReporter:How key are employment contracts and what specific provisions must be included in the contracts?\n\nVM: The employment contract is the crux of the employment relationship, whether written or verbal, it must comply with the law and applicable collective bargaining agreements for the sector the business operates. The contract is founded on the old contract principles of offer and acceptance, consideration and capacity to enter into contracts.\n\nAn oral contract that meets all the requirements of a contract is therefore binding on the parties as a legally enforceable employment relationship.\n\nFor diaspora or foreign companies, employment contracts must be in writing detailing whether the employment contract is permanent, fixed term or casual. The contract will be expected to observe and address, among other things, issues relating to fair wages, overtime and leave benefits, termination and dispute resolution processes.\n\nReporter: In what circumstances can an employer terminate a contract?\n\nVM: Termination of employment has to be lawful and is first governed by the employment contract. So, termination can be mutually agreed upon between the employer and employee. It can also be a result of effluxion of time being for instance, expiration of a fixed-term contract or in circumstances where an employee was employed to perform a specific task and the task has been completed.\n\nTermination may also be in terms of the employment code, in its absence, the model code and lastly as part of retrenchment in accordance with the law. What is critical is that the termination is done in terms of the law so that the employer does not suffer a claim for unfair dismissal from the employee.\n\nReporter: In the event of disputes between employer and employee, which may include a claim for unfair dismissal, what methods are provided in law to address these?\n\nVM: Disputes in the workplace are common, and the contracts of employment must prescribe the dispute resolution model. The contract must offer alternative dispute resolution models for addressing the disputes, which may include negotiation, conciliation, mediation and arbitration.\n\nOur law also prescribes forums that address certain disputes arising from the employment contracts, so it is important to know and understand such to avoid procedural irregularities.\n\nThe commonly used alternative dispute resolution model in Zimbabwe is conciliation. This method is intended to resolve disputes through labour officers, whose mandate is to settle the employer/ employee disagreement by encouraging them to explore potential options and solutions by offering new perspectives. In the event that the conciliation process fails, the labour officers will issue a certificate of no settlement, resulting in voluntary or compulsory arbitration.\n\nIt is important to remember that disputes must be referred to the labour officers timely, that is, within 2 years, otherwise the issues under dispute may be affected by prescription, denying the complainant of their right to be heard. The Labour Court is available to review the processes carried on by inferior tribunals or on appeal.\n\nReporter: What specific challenges do you think that foreign companies face when trying to comply with our labour laws?\n\nVM: Our labour laws have undergone changes and foreign companies may fail to keep updated with the amendments. Some of the foreign companies use contract templates that do not meet our legal standards. It is advisable to engage local experts at the commencement of business to ensure that the employment contracts are aligned with our laws.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

fights within the political hotbed of Mashonaland Central province.\n\nZanu PF Mashonaland Central Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) is reportedly behind the plot to obliterate Musarara.NewZimbabwe.com is in possession of a letter directed at Musarara, a Zanu PF district chairperson in the province, demanding that he avails himself for disciplinary hearing at the partys provincial headquarters in Bindura.He stands accused of leaving meetings before their conclusion and failure to supervise cell restructuring.At times and when you manage to attend provincial meetings you sit briefly and quickly sneak out without notifying anyone, even the provincial chairperson, reads letter signed by chairperson of the disciplinary committee Christopher Magomo.NewZimbabwe.com is also in possession of Musararas response wherein he demands clarity on charges and evidence of his departure.Musarara could not confirm receipt of the letter that was delivered to him on May 21 this year.Sources within the province revealed that the charges are well worked, following yet-to-be-confirmed information that President Emmerson Mnangagwa could be considering stepping down as per constitutional dictates.If Mnangagwa decides not to go ahead with plans to stay in office beyond 2028, provincial and district structures within the party will have to prepare and participate in primary elections.Home Affairs Minister Kazembe Kazembe, a well-known, perennial rival of Musarara is said to be behind the charges in an attempt to have him barred from participating in the primaries, which are said to be set for next year.Kazembe, who reportedly ordered police details to trail Musarara, did not answer his mobile phone on Sunday.Most of those within Kazembes camp where banking on the 2030 Agenda and not doing anything be it in their wards or constituencies but now that we hear the President might decide against it, the issue is now about dismissing competition by any means possible, said a source from within the Zanu PF Mashonaland Central PEC.\n\nZanu PF Mashonaland Central Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) is reportedly behind the plot to obliterate

            "content": "By Farai Mutsaka l Associated Press\n\nCHITUNGWIZA, Zimbabwe  Its before sunrise on a Saturday and a small group has gathered at Socialite Bar on the outskirts of Zimbabwes capital. Instead of nursing hangovers, they sit with eyes closed and bodies in meditative poses on the bare floor.Its an unlikely setting for a yoga class. In Zimbabwe, the practice is rare and mostly found in the wealthy suburbs. Yet it is quietly taking root here in a beer tavern in Chitungwiza, a low-income town 30 kilometers (18 miles) outside the capital, Harare.The initiative is led by Actions Winya, a yoga instructor who saw how economic hardship and social pressures were damaging the mental health of people in his hometown.Yoga is expensive  but we also got humans in the ghetto. They need mental wellness, said Winya, who usually teaches in affluent areas, charging between $30 and $100 a month. Thats an impossible cost for most, especially in a country where many survive through informal jobs.Since 2023, Winya has been offering free weekend classes to some of those hardest hit by Zimbabwes economic problems.The sessions have become a source of relief for people navigating relentless challenges.Authorities acknowledge a growing societal crisis worsened by drug abuse, domestic violence and poverty, compounded by a shortage of public health services and therapists.I am a coach, so they bring the stuff that they face within families (to me). This is where we come in and say, Guys, come and try yoga, it can help somehow, Winya said.Yoga, an ancient Indian practice, has become a multibillion-dollar industry and a daily ritual for millions around the world. The United Nations over a decade ago designated June 21 as International Day of Yoga.In Africa, other countries like Kenya and South Africa are introducing yoga to poorer communities, with the Indian government promoting its spread across the continent.Inside the tavern in Zimbabwe, mellow music played as about a dozen participants moved through poses. They had no mats, just a cold brick floor, but plenty of determination for inner peace. One mother tried to stay focused as her toddler dashed around, disrupting her poses.For 47-year-old John Mahwaya, the practice has been transforming. A father of four, he also supports relatives in the countryside, a responsibility he said once weighed heavily on his mental health.My head was always spinning. I thought I was losing my mind, and the stress started causing back pains, he said. Yoga helps me relax and clear my mind. I sleep peacefully these days.He said many Zimbabwean men bottle up their emotions, afraid to show weakness in a highly patriarchal society that prizes toughness.We focus on physical fitness, forgetting the mind, he said. We suffer slowly, but what suffers first is the mind, and from there, it becomes a slow death.Edinah Makosa, 24, joined the class earlier this year and said it gave her hope.I used to be depressed a lot. You know, for people my age, our main stressors are unemployment and relationships, she said.Yoga changed my mindset. I used to think negatively all the time. Now I have started selling beauty products to earn a living. As for romance, well if it works, it works; if it doesnt, it doesnt. I no longer stress about men. I go with the flow.As they practiced, the sounds of township life seeped in. Taxi drivers shouted for passengers. Vendors pushed carts, calling out to potential customers.We need a proper environment and studio. But we are trying, Winya said.For participants like Mahwaya, the location didnt matter nearly as much as the healing.We need to promote yoga in the communities because everyone has a mind. And fitness of the mind is the responsibility of everyone, regardless of where you live, he said.\n\nCHITUNGWIZA, Zimbabwe  Its before sunrise on a Saturday and a small group has gathered at Socialite Bar on the outskirts of Zimbabwes capital.
