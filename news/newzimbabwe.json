            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nCitizens Coalition for Change (CCC)legislators on Wednesday demanded the implementation of electoral reforms, including recommendations made in the 2023 SADC Observer Election Report, before Zimbabwe holds its next general elections.\n\nZimbabwe is scheduled to hold general elections in 2028 when President Emmerson Mnangagwas current constitutional mandate ends. However, Zanu PF has already resolved at its last Conference to push for extending his stay in office until 2030.\n\nDuring a parliamentary Question and Answer session, CCC Harare Central MP Lovemore Jimu pressed government to outline policy measures for implementing electoral reforms ahead of the next polls.\n\nResponding, Acting Leader of Government Business in Parliament Felix Mhona said the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) was solely responsible for administering election matters.\n\nI am very happy that we have one of our institutions, ZEC, which superintends over elections. Our Constitution outlines what must be done prior to an election. If there are any specific concerns, the Honourable Member is free to put them on the Order Paper for the relevant Minister to address, said Mhona.\n\nCCCs Ellen Shiriyedenga reminded the House that ZEC had submitted a 2023 election report with specific recommendations.\n\nWe are in the preparatory stage of the election cycle. This is the time to implement ZECs recommendations from the 2023 elections. What is ZEC currently doing to ensure this happens before 2028? she asked.\n\nMhona responded by urging her to specify which recommendations had not been addressed, adding that the SADC report had not discredited Zimbabwes elections.\n\nThey were deemed to be credible, fair and transparent. It is just like if you are in a vote scenario where you have the minority and the majority. You might raise your concerns under the minority but the obvious majority rules, Mhona said.\n\nWarren Park MP, Shakespeare Hamauswa, also asked about stakeholder dialogue in preventing disputed elections. Mhona stated that President Mnangagwas Political Actors Dialogue (POLAD) platform was still available if the opposition wants to join.\n\nWhen we say we have a listening President, he has invited all political players to engage with him. He has an open-door policy and is amenable to addressing concerns raised, he said.\n\nCCC Mbizo legislator Corban Madzivanyika insisted that the SADC report highlighted serious shortcomings, including issues around voter registration, high nomination fees, state media bias, and election materials.\n\nMinister Mhona maintained that the ruling partys electoral victory reflected the will of the people, urging the opposition to look ahead.\n\nThe fact that Zanu PF is in Parliament with a majority shows that elections were held. Let us now focus on the future and address anomalies as we prepare for the next election, he said.\n\nHowever, MP Ransome Makamure reminded the House that Zimbabwe had recently chaired SADC and could not ignore its own bodys report.\n\nWe must embrace the SADC report, not dismiss it, since we are part of the regional bloc, she said.\n\n",

            "content": "Business Insider Africa\n\nZimbabwean billionaire Strive Masiyiwa has announced plans to build five artificial intelligence (AI) factories across Africa within the next year, as part of a $720 million investment through his company Cassava Technologies.\n\nThe factories are expected to be built in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and Morocco.\n\nMasiyiwa said the goal is to give major African markets access to their own advanced AI infrastructure, reducing reliance on overseas cloud providers.\n\nHe described the plan as part ofCassavas Sovereign AI Cloud strategy, which aims to allow African countries to host and run their own AI systems locally.\n\nOur AI factory provides the infrastructure for innovation to scale, empowering African businesses, start-ups, and researchers with access to cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Now they dont have to look beyond Africa to get it, he said.\n\nMasiyiwa, who isworth about $1.3 billion, is known for building Econet Wireless into one of Africas largest telecom groups.\n\nIn recent years, he has expanded Cassava from telecoms into cloud computing, fintech, cybersecurity andartificial intelligence.\n\nThefirst AI factory is already under developmentin South Africa and will run on 3,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nCassava says much of this computing power has already been reserved by African researchers and developers.\n\nCompany officials said the new facilities will help close a major gap in Africas digital economy.\n\nOnly about 5% of African AI talent currently has access to the high-performance computing power needed to train advanced AI models.\n\nBuilding local infrastructure could allow more African researchers to develop homegrown tools in sectors like finance, education, health and agriculture.\n\nCassava also plans to link the AI factories to its wider digital network, which includes Africa Data Centres, Liquid Intelligent Technologies, and Liquid C2.\n\nThese companies already provide data storage, internet connectivity and cybersecurity services across the continent.\n\nEarlier this year, Cassava launched a dedicated AI business unit and signed partnerships with global tech firms including Microsoft, AWS, Google and Anthropic to support African developers.\n\nAnalysts say the push could helpAfrica compete in the fast-growing global AI industrywhile keeping sensitive data on the continent.\n\nIt could also reduce costs for local startups and governments, who often pay high fees to store and process data overseas.\n\nIf completed on schedule, all five factories are expected to be operational by late 2026, positioning Cassava as one of the biggest builders of AI infrastructure in Africa.\n\n",
