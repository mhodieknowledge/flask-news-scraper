He charged at you and you felt threatened. Your use of a log was, however, disproportionate You were therefore negligent.The court heard that Khumalo is a first offender, left school at Grade 7 due to poverty, and now looks after his sick mother and his late brothers daughter. His mother begged the court for mercy in an emotional plea.The person you killed is your own brother. You will live with this tragic incident for the rest of your life.

            "content": "Glamour ZA\n\nFabric, flair, and fantasy! Global fashion runways ooze elegance as they are a catalyst for taste, inspiring womens wardrobes each season.Fashionis big business, according toBizplanr,the global fashion industry is currently valued at $1.84 trillion in 2025. It accounts for approximately 1.63% of the worlds GDP and is projected to grow at a 4.1% CAGR between 2024 and 2030. This makes fashion weeks integral to the ecosystem, spotlighting emerging and established talent alike. And Zimbabwe is slowly gaining momentum on that frontier.\n\nConnecting the dots at the helm of Zimbabwe Fashion Week is Priscilla Chigariro, model, interior designer, culinary creative, and, most importantly, cultural strategist. As the founder of the Zimbabwe Fashion Week Trust, she has been shaping the countrys fashion narrative since 2009. This October, she is back to orchestrate what she calls a homecoming, but also a reintroduction.\n\nThis year feels like a homecoming, but also a reintroduction. Were not just picking up where we left off, were coming back with a deeper sense ofpurpose, she says. Hosting the event at the iconic Hyatt Regency Harare (The Meikles) adds a sense of gravitas, a setting worthy of her vision. And her vision is ambitious: a fashion week that bridges Zimbabwean talent with the wider African and diaspora conversation.\n\nPriscilla sees fashion as both a business and a cultural movement. She sees a philosophy that influences everything from the lineup of shows to the conversations on sustainability. Fashion isnt just about the clothes. Its an economic driver, a storytelling medium, and a record of who we are, she explains.\n\nAfrican fashion has long battled with fragmented markets, lack of infrastructure, and limited access to international buyers. Too often, local talent gets trapped in a cycle of underfunded production and exposure limited to regional stages. Yet, within these challenges lie opportunities: a continent brimming with artisanal skill, sustainable textile traditions, and untapped consumer markets.\n\nPriscilla is addressing both ends of the equation. Through her PC Group Fashion Futures Program, she invests in emerging designers, offering mentorship, market access, and practical business skills. The Hunhu Council of Fashion, another of her initiatives, safeguards cultural heritage while promoting innovation. Theyre intertwined, she says. Fashion Futures is about long-term development, while the Hunhu Council protects and promotes African fashion heritage. ZFW is where those two worlds meet on stage.\n\nHer multidisciplinary background shapes ZFW into an experience rather than just an event. From music and staging to how guests are welcomed, every detail is curated to tell a story. My modeling background taught me presentation and detail, my design work taught me storytelling through form, and the culinary world taught me the power of hospitality, she notes.\n\nThis years shows will spotlight small-batch, artisan-led labels alongside contemporary fashion houses ready for international retail. For Priscilla, the thrill lies in the range: The excitement this year is in watching new names step onto a global stage with confidence.\n\nWhile sustainability has become a fashion buzzword, Priscilla grounds it in cultural responsibility. Its about honouring the land, the makers, and the cultural lineage behind the garments, she says. Expect slow fashion showcases, natural fibers, and artisanal techniques to be front and center, all while protecting intellectual property and ensuring that cultural narratives remain intact.\n\nForZimbabweto thrive in the global fashion economy, Priscilla believes international collaboration is essential. We cant grow in isolation. International collaboration brings resources and new perspectives, but it also allows us to share our innovations with the world. Its a two-way exchange.
