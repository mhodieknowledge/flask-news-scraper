            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nTHE tragic death of Blessed Believe Juruvenge (30), who recently died in police custody, has left his pregnant wife facing an uncertain future alone.\n\nThe now deceaseds wife Mercy Madenyika, is distraught, hopeless and drained, particularly having to face a daunting task of motherhood as a young widow.\n\nNearly two weeks since the brutal assault allegedly carried out by Constable Prince Ndavambi, the officer who still remains on the run, Madenyika is expecting to give birth to a fatherless baby had it not been of police brutality that claimed the life of a responsible would-be dad.\n\nThe couple, which resided in the Damafalls area of Ruwa, ran a tuckshop, and was preparing for their first child, but now Madenyika is left grappling with both loss of her husband and the daunting reality of motherhood without her partner.\n\nI cant believe my husband is gone before he could even hold our baby. I never thought I would have to face this alone, especially with a child on the way, a teary Madenyika told NewZimbabwe.com, her voice trembling with grief.\n\nHer anguish is compounded by the financial burden of a funeral that is yet to be done.\n\nI dont know how I will manage, she said, her eyes filled with tears.\n\nWe were supposed to build a life together, and now it feels like everything has been taken away from me.\n\nMadenyika hopes that justice will be served with the weight of her loss heavy on her shoulders.\n\nIf the law doesnt take its course, we are pleading to citizens of Zimbabwe to help us find something to haunt the ones who took away his life, said Madenyika.\n\nElipa Jimu, the now deceaseds mother, is at pains to accept reality that her son is no more. Worse still, she cannot imagine the burden of taking care of her widowed daughter-in-law and her unborn child.\n\nI am in pain over my sons death; him and Melisa were the ones taking care of me.\n\nHe left a pregnant wife. I dont even know how I am going to take care of her. The preparation for the baby has not been bought yet. There even is no money for the funeral. I dont know where I am going to even get it. My son was supposed to bury me first, but it is me who is burying him, lamented Jimu\n\nTaurayi Chiedziso, a neighbour and friend, voiced his frustration over the tragedy.\n\nThis matter would have been resolved without even involving the police because we are neighbours, we are a community.\n\nNow, Blessed has died leaving behind his wife who is also pregnant. That child will grow without a father, its so heartbreaking, said Chiedziso.\n\n",

Lungelo Ndhlovu/Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nAround Hwange, last years drought dried up the boreholes and waterholes, threatening wildlife in the park and depriving people in Mabale of drinking water.\n\nAnd although rainfall from December to February this year was normal or above, fallout from the last drought persists.\n\nDespite this years rains, we had to close one of our boreholes, Mudima said, explaining how water table levels were still very low.\n\nBecause there are too many people in my village and not enough boreholes, people walk 5 km to a neighbouring village with a solar borehole, she said, referring to a borehole pumped by solar power.\n\nFaced with these recurrent water crises, people in Hwange have started building rainwater tanks, helped by the Soft Foot Alliance, a community-based trust registered in Zimbabwe.\n\nConstance Ndaba, 75, who lives in Masikili Village 2, said the tank harvesting system saves her walking 2 km to the next village.\n\nFor a family of seven, drinking water from the rainwater tank lasts us up to three months. Im not sure when I last went to fetch water from a borehole.\n\nConstance Ndaba poses next to a giant rainwater harvesting jar at her home in Masikili Village 2. The jar helps her family cope with water shortages when nearby boreholes and rivers run dry. 7 May 2025. Lungelo Ndhlovu/Thomson Reuters Foundation\n\nRainwater is collected in giant jars made by moulding canvas and chicken wire around sand. A thin cement plaster fixes the form, then the inside is plastered. The jars are placed near house walls to collect run-off from the roof.\n\nTheir simplicity makes for an easy upkeep  a key benefit in remote communities.\n\nWe use chicken wire, plain wire, four bags of cement and 24 buckets of river sand which is locally available. To build the jar tank takes four days and it can collect up to five drums of water, which can last up to three months, said Austin Nkomo, one of the builders of jar tanks based in Hwange.\n\nMsungwe Sithole, a creative facilitator at the Soft Foot Alliance, said the project aimed to build resilience to drought and help people live sustainably in a depleted landscape.\n\nErratic rains are not the only reason for water scarcity, said Chipo Mpofu-Zuze, manager for the Environmental Management Agency in the Matabeleland North province.\n\nMpofu-Zuze said deforestation, crop-growing along streams, poor farming methods, alien species invading wetlands and the release of effluent into local waters were also responsible.\n\nSimba Guzha, regional project manager with Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) Zimbabwe, trains farmers to adapt to the increasingly hot and dry conditions.\n\nVSO is working with smallholders in the eastern provinces to improve productivity while safeguarding the environment  helping them stay safe from any shock drops in aid.\n\nMost of the farmers who have been trained on infiltration pits, earth dams, and rooftop water harvesting systems are now using these systems even without any foreign support, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nHARARE waste collection crisis will soon be over as Geo Pomona Waste Sorting Plant, vehicles and equipment were commissioned by President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Harare this Thursday.\n\nAddressing government officials, investors and Zanu PF supporters at the Geo Pomona waste management dump site in Borrowdale, President Mnangagwa warned Zimbabweans to desist from illegal dumping.\n\nAs we roll out the modern waste collection system, I urge all of us Zimbabweans to desist from illegal dumping.\n\nLet us embrace a culture of responsible waste disposal, recycling, and environmental stewardship in order to realise our goal of a clean, safe, and healthy environment, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe said the waste collection crisis, particularly in the capital city of Harare has had dire consequences ranging from environmental degradation to public health risks, among other negative impacts.\n\nWe have seen outbreaks of diseases, a situation that is wholly unacceptable. Such conditions must become a thing of the past. The plant and the trucks we are commissioning today mark a turning point in our quest towards efficiency in wasteanagement.\n\nTherefore, in line with Vision 2030, my government will continue to prioritize the creation of clean, safe and modern urban environments, which are engines of economic growth. I am, therefore, pleased with the acquisition and deployment of 45 refuse trucks and 100 skip bins by Geo Pomona, with more on the way to come.\n\nCongratulations, Pomona. Through the pages of this equipment, we must see the waste management system being capacitated to efficiently and consistently collect waste across all parts of Harare, Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe also urged all the players in all towns and cities to take a leaf from such initiatives towards improving waste management in the country.\n\nReferring to the Geo Pomona waste sorting plant, the President described it as a beacon of nations potential.\n\nThe facility is a beacon of our national potential. It represents how infrastructure, when aligned to a national vision, can transform lives, protect the environment, and drive economic growth. It is important to note that waste is not just waste.\n\nWaste is actually a resource. With this modern sorting facility, recyclable materials can be recovered, repurposed, and reintegrated into the economy, he said.\n\nMnangagwa added that waste sorting plant is a critical enabler of the Waste to Energy Project, which will soon contribute between 16 and 22 megawatts of electricity to the national grid.\n\nThis is a solution that exemplifies innovation and modernisation.\n\nHe acknowledged the management and the staff of Geo- Pomona waste management led by its CEO Delish Nguwaya for their clarity of role, not only towards a greener planet but also advancing the realisation of national development goals.\n\nYour accomplishments thus far are applauded and inspirational to others in our region and continent. However, the responsibility of waste management does not lie with Geo Pomona alone. It is the duty of every Zimbabwean.\n\nThe event coincided with the World Environment Day celebrations Thursday as Zimbabweans joined the rest of the world in celebrating their shared mission of protecting the environment for the present and future generations.\n\nThe Geo Pomona Waste Management, (Private) Limited is a product of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) venture involving the Harare City Council.\n\n",

This verse encapsulates the essence of pursuing a relationship with Jesus Christ, the ultimate source of hope and strength.The story of Zacchaeus in Luke 19:1-10 serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of our efforts to seek Christ. Zacchaeus, a tax collector, was determined to see Jesus, even climbing a sycamore tree to catch a glimpse of Him.Interestingly, despite his efforts, it was not Zacchaeus who found Jesus first; rather, Jesus saw him. This teaches us that even our smallest attempts to seek Christ matter.When Jesus called out to Zacchaeus, saying, Hurry and come down! For I must stay at your house today, He demonstrated that He is always ready to respond to our desires for connection. Jesus sees us before we see Him, and He invites us into a relationship that transforms our lives.Jesus invites us to try me and see if I dont find favour in you. This call to test His goodness is echoed in Malachi 3:10, where we are encouraged to bring our whole selves to Him.When we seek the face of Christ, we open ourselves to the possibility of His grace and favour, enabling us to confront our challenges with renewed strength.As we invite Christ into our lives, He establishes a permanent relationship with us. This relationship empowers us to conquer our difficulties and stand firm against the adversities we face.When we put our minds and faith in Christ, we are reminded that we are not alone. He walks with us, guiding and supporting us through every trial.The call to seek the word of the cross is a call to embrace a relationship with Jesus Christ. Like Zacchaeus, let us not be discouraged by our limitations but instead be encouraged by the knowledge that every effort we make to seek Him is met with His love and grace.As we draw closer to Him, we prepare ourselves to be called children of God when He returns. Let us seek the face of Christ, for in doing so, we find our true strength and purpose.PRAYERHeavenly Father,We come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your presence and the transformative power of the cross.Thank You for the gift of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who invites us to draw near to Him. We acknowledge that in the midst of our challenges, it is easy to lose sight of You, but we desire to seek Your face with all our hearts.Lord, just as Zacchaeus climbed the sycamore tree in his pursuit of You, grant us the courage to climb beyond our fears and doubts. Help us to reach for You, knowing that even our smallest efforts are seen by You. We trust that You are always looking out for us and that Your love is eager to embrace us.As we navigate the trials of life, may we find strength in Your Word and comfort in Your promises. Teach us to rely on You, and let our faith be unwavering. Help us to recognize the influence of darkness around us and empower us to stand firm in Your light.Lord, we ask that You come into our homes and hearts, establishing a deep and lasting relationship with us. May our lives reflect Your love and grace, and may we be filled with the hope of being called Your children when You return.Remove all the tribulations and pains we find ourselves in today. Restore peace and make us rejoin all our families in love and harmony once again.In Jesus name, we pray.AMEN.\n\nIn todays world, filled with challenges and uncertainties, the call to seek the face of Christ has never been more urgent.\n\nLife can feel overwhelming, and the influence of evil spirits and the devil seems to loom larger as we stray from our spiritual foundations.Yet, in the midst of this turmoil, we are reminded of the powerful promise found in Jeremiah 29:13: You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.
