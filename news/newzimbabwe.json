            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer Finance Minister Tendai Biti has launched a stinging attack on controversial business tycoon Kudakwashe Tagwirei, accusing him of looting and collapsing Zimbabwes economy.\n\nBiti insists that Tagwireimust be prevented from ascending to the countrys top job, citing his role in destroying Zimbabwes local currency in 2019 as just one example of his economic sabotage.\n\nThe beleaguered businessman was recently ousted from a Zanu-PF Central Committee meeting after his co-option into the partys key structure was foiled. Party spokesman Christopher Mutsvangwa later vowed to fight Tagwireis rise into the partys most senior and influential ranks.\n\nBiti, echoing Mutsvangwas sentiments that Tagwirei is buying his way up the party structure, was blunt about the need to thwart Tagwireis presidential ambitions.\n\nBiti accused Tagwirei of single-handedly collapsing Zimbabwes local currency in 2019 after being issued treasury bills worth US$360 million.\n\nHe alleges Tagwirei then flooded the market with this cash, causing the RTGS currency to plummet. This, Biti argues, is a prime example of how Tagwirei has undermined the nations financial stability through illicit means.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa had once described the local currency as the strongest in the region, although his government later devalued it and announced the introduction of the ZiG currency last April.\n\nTagwirei, who owns numerous companies, some under his well-known Sakunda Holdings, is also accused of netting millions of dollars through his Fossil company, which constructed the Trabablas Interchange in Harare at US$114 million, more than double the regional market prices.\n\nSpeaking to a local online news publication (263Chat) on Monday, Biti took a swipe at Tagwirei, branding him a criminal and unfit to become Zimbabwes President in future.\n\nIt is crazy to think that this criminal actually has ambitions to be the next President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Biti said.\n\nIt cant happen and should not happen. It should not be allowed to happen, he added.\n\nBiti also challenged Zanu-PF, calling it a laughing stock for allowing its values to be disregarded due to greed for money and top-of-the-range vehicles.\n\nI feel pity for Zanu-PF. Zanu-PF is being reduced to a commodity that can be bought by a few trinkets. A few motor vehicles, a few GD6s, what kind of country have we become? Biti queried.\n\nThis comes after Tagwirei himself doled out some top-of-the-range vehicles to Zanu-PFs Harare Provincial leadership in his bid to be co-opted into the partys Central Committee, a move that has come crashing down like a deck of cards.\n\nBiti said thousands of liberation struggle war heroes are turning in their graves, believing they would not have gone to war had they known the current state of Zanu-PF, which people with money are hijacking.\n\n",

Chakulinga also allegedly said Mubaiwa had told her that she had the facility to get money from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for funding the business, Muchengwa said.\n\nChakulinga allegedly offered assistance with a place to open a business at her premises.\n\nShe was then asked to do proforma invoices in the name of Tanor Investment for the supply of event hosting accessories, tents for R203 308 and the invoices had Mubaiwas Falcon Suppliers FNB bank accounts.\n\nCourt papers show that in December 2018, R203,308 was deposited into the account from CBZ and according to the narration, it was intended for the purchase of tents.\n\nAccording to Chakulinga, upon receipt in her account the funds, Mubaiwa instructed her to divert the funds towards purchase of Range Rover at Menlyn in Pretoria, reads court papers.\n\nChakulinga states that she paid R4 million to Range Rover Menlyn and she was told by Mubaiwa that the motor vehicle was to be taken to Zimbabwe but to her surprise, it was registered in South Africa under Marry Mubaiwa.\n\nIn May, according to Chakulinga, another R2 million was deposited into Bonnette Electrical FNB account and she was called by the bank to confirm the receipt of the funds.\n\nShe did what she had been instructed to do before but this time on the invoices indicated she was to buy electrical prepaid meters.\n\nChakulinga added that after the release of the funds, Mubaiwa ordered her to transfer R4 96 500 to the Martin Potgieter Trust Account at Standard Bank.\n\nAccording to Muchengwa, there was a financial flow from CBZ to FNB that was detected on the accounts.\n\nIt was established that one of the signatories at Mubaiwas East Town Commodities was Jeffery Jenje and he allegedly confirmed this.\n\nJenje also confirmed payments that were made and also that Mubaiwa indeed purchased two vehicles.\n\nProof of vehicle purchase was provided by Jacobus Hercules Du Preez.\n\nDu Preez said Mubaiwa bought two vehicles worth R1,6 million and R1,8 million, respectively.\n\nThe ongoing investigations also revealed that Mubaiwa bought a house by sourcing cash from individual companies to purchase on her behalf.\n\n",

His service weapon was recovered at the scene.\n\nThe matter is under investigation by SANDF authorities in co-operation with environmental and wildlife officials to determine the exact circumstances surrounding the incident. A formal board of inquiry has been initiated, said Tshabalala.\n\nTshabalala said Raynards next of kin, from Kimberley, Northern Cape, have been formally notified, and psychosocial support is being provided to the family and his unit members.\n\nOperation Corona is a national border safeguarding initiative aimed at combating transnational crimes along the countrys borders.\n\nTshabalala said that soldiers deployed in these operations face harsh terrain, isolation and exposure to unpredictable natural conditions.\n\nLauren Liebenberg from the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve said:At this time of year, the crisis with the elephant populations that roam the Limpopo River Valley intensifies.When elephant hunting starts in the dry season they come across the Limpopo River [into SA] in huge numbers, she said, adding that the elephants neededa well-managed migration corridor.\n\nThe problem extends along the whole length of the 200km strip between Mapungubwe and Kruger National Park. We become a massive human-wildlife conflict zone.\n\nLiebenberg said a programme by the US Agency for International Development to manage the problem collapsed after the US administration cancelled it earlier this year.\n\nThrough the programme, they trained elephant herders and provided all sorts of defence interventions.\n\nDeaths still remain rare and at the extreme end of the human wildlife conflict interface, but the elephants do massive damage to crops, to infrastructure  especially fencing and water infrastructure, and to the natural vegetation in the nature reserves, said Liebenberg.\n\n",

Those ranged from attempting to repay its debts using the proceeds of metal sales and recently approaching 10 nations for help to raise $2.6 billion to pay its arrears.\n\nAjay Banga. Image: Bloomberg\n\nTrying to figure it out on your own, youll be doing this for the next five years, Banga said in an interview in Maputo, Mozambiques capital. They need to figure out a way to reach out to the G20 and say, we raise our hand, wed like to be part of this process.\n\nZimbabwe first defaulted on repayments to the World Bank in 2000. Its debts to a host of multilateral institutions and bilateral lenders mounted amid a failed land-reform program and a quarter century of economic turmoil, shutting it out of international debt markets and limiting its ability to borrow even during the global pandemic and a recent devastating drought.\n\nThe government has asked the African Development Bank to advise on clearing its debt with the institutions outgoing president, Akinwumi Adesina, and former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano asked to negotiate with creditors. It also hired Global Sovereign Advisory, a Paris-based consultancy, to help. The fact that Zimbabwean officials, including President Emmerson Mnangagwa, have been sanctioned by the US has complicated the process.\n\nWhile Belarus, Syria and Eritrea are also in arrears to the World Bank, Zimbabwes default is by far the longest. South Africa, which currently holds the G-20 presidency, last month said it has been approached by Zimbabwe to try and garner the groups support for a debt workout.\n\nZambia, Ghana and Ethiopia are among nations that have employed the G20s Common Framework, which was created in 2020 to help poor nations bring together a diverse set of creditors to restructure debts. While they have made progress in reaching deals, the process has been criticized for being too slow.\n\nZimbabwe isnt technically poor enough to be eligible to utilise the framework, yet Sri Lanka  a nation in a similar situation  approached the group in 2023 for help with dealing with its creditors.\n\nStart talking to the G20 and the Paris Club and whoever else has given them money and we can help, Banga said. We try and bring an understanding of what write down you need to take. It takes a while.\n\nZimbabwes Treasury didnt respond to a request for comment.\n\n",

The gunmen then demanded a ransom of one million naira ($655; 485) per captive, media in Nigeria report.\n\nLocal government chairman Manniru Haidara Kaura said that most of those killed were young people who were slaughtered like rams.\n\nWhat happened was that the bandits demanded ransom money, and after some back-and-forth, they were given what they asked for. They then released 18 people, including 17 women and one young boy, on Saturday, Haidara added.\n\nOnly they [the gunmen] know why they killed them. They are senseless and heartless people. They forget that they are killing their own brothers, and we will all meet before Allah.\n\nSixteen of those released on Saturday are in the hospital receiving treatment, while the bodies of the 38 killed by the bandits are unlikely to be returned as in these cases corpses are rarely released.\n\nIn an attempt to curb the spiralling and lucrative kidnapping industry, a law was enacted in 2022 making it a crime to make ransom payments. It carries a jail sentence of at least 15 years, however no-one has ever been arrested on those charges.\n\nIt also made abduction punishable by death in cases where victims die.\n\nBut families often feel forced to pay to save their loved ones, citing the governments inability to ensure their safety.\n\n",
