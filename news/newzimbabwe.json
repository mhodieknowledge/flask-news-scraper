            "content": "BBC\n\nA court in Zambia has sentenced two men to two years in prison for attempting to use witchcraft to kill President Hakainde Hichilema.\n\nZambian Leonard Phiri and Mozambican Jasten Mabulesse Candunde were convicted under the Witchcraft Act after being arrested in December with charms in their possession, including a live chameleon.\n\nIt is my considered view that the convicts were not only the enemy of the head of state but were also enemies of all Zambians, magistrate Fine Mayambu said in his ruling.\n\nThe case has been closely followed in Zambia, as this was the first time anyone was put on trial for attempting to use witchcraft against a president.\n\nThe prosecution alleged that Phiri and Candunde were hired by a fugitive former MP to bewitch Hichilema.\n\nDespite their insistence that they were bona fide traditional healers, the court found them guilty on two counts under the Witchcraft Act.\n\nThe two accepted ownership of the charms. Phiri further demonstrated that the chameleons tail, once pricked and used in the ritual, would cause death to occur within five days, Magistrate Mayambu said.\n\nThe lawyer for the two men, Agrippa Malando, said his clients pleaded for leniency as they were first-time offenders.\n\nHe urged the court to fine them, but the request was rejected.\n\nMagistrate Mayambu noted that many people in Zambia, like in other African countries, believed in witchcraft, even though it was not scientifically proven.\n\nThe law was designed to protect society from fear and harm caused by those claiming to have the power to carry out acts of witchcraft, he said.\n\nThe question is not whether the accused are wizards or actually possess supernatural powers. It is whether they represented themselves as such, and the evidence clearly shows they did, Magistrate Mayambu said.\n\nIn addition to the two-year sentence they were given for professing witchcraft, the men were sentenced to six months in prison for possessing charms.\n\nAs the sentences will run concurrently, they will serve only two years in prison, effective from the date of their arrest in December 2024.\n\nHichilema has previously said he does not believe in witchcraft. He has not commented on the case.\n\nLawyer Dickson Jere told the BBC that the Witchcraft Act was passed during colonial rule in 1914.\n\nHe said people were very rarely prosecuted for practising witchcraft, but it helped protect elderly women who faced mob justice in villages after being accused of bewitching someone and causing their death.\n\nWitchcraft has also featured prominently in conversations over the protracted dispute between the government and the family of the late President Edgar Lungu over his funeral.\n\nSome people believe that the governments insistence that he should be buried in Zambia, contrary to his familys wishes, may be for occult reasons.\n\nThe government has denied the accusation.\n\nLungu died in South Africa in June, and his body is still in a morgue there because of the failure to reach agreement over his burial.\n\n",

We further call for urgent consultations with the Mbari clan and spirit mediums to begin the process of resuscitating the Harare chieftaincy.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nA CHINESE national, presented as an investor within the gold mining sector, has been convicted for stealing over US$875,000 worth of the precious metal from a local small-scale miner and illegally operating in Mashonaland Easts Makaha area.\n\nDocuments from the Mines Ministry, sourced by NewZimbabwe.com, and a Mutoko Regional Magistrates Court ruling have all exposed a well-coordinated syndicate comprising Zheng Zhangxian, the Chinese investor and a mines official, amongst others.\n\nZheng, who was convicted and had his questionably registered company, Reajin Enterprises, receive a restitution order of US$875,667.67, is reported to have been encroaching on a claim belonging to Emmanuel Ndemeras Koodoo 83 claim for the past four years.\n\nReajin Enterprises had been operating as Takura Mining Syndicate, which held a Special Grant, in some form of partnership with a Zimbabwean partner, Vengai Kurarama.\n\nTakura Mining Syndicates claim was next to Ndemeras, from which they knowingly stole his gold ore.\n\nZheng, up until this year, had been mining 75 metres below the surface of Ndemeras claim where he is said to have stolen over 5,000 tonnes of gold ore.\n\nDocuments in NewZimbabwe.coms possession reveal successful investigations into Zhengs operations and payment of a US$350 bribe to Mines Ministry Inspector Anthony Singende, who has since been dismissed.\n\nSingende, who was part of the ministrys investigating team that provided evidence of blasting and Zhengs ore theft on Ndemeras claim, was not only paid to curtail investigations but went as far as sanctioning continued blasting on the property against ministry guidelines. His criminal case is being pursued at the Marondera Magistrates Court.\n\nThe traverse survey clearly indicates encroachment of a haulage in Adit No. 5 along strike with stoping (active extraction of ore) done above the distance of approximately 75 metres.\n\nWe recommend that Takura Mining Syndicate cease mining operations within the boundary of Ndemera and construct a containment wall 6m inside their own boundary, read a report that followed investigations.\n\nThe 6m is mandated by Statutory Instrument (SI) 109 of 1990 (Mine Management and Safety Regulations).\n\nThe ore was processed at the Chinese-owned Zhangveng Milling Plant according to a letter sent to Ndemera by Provincial Mining Director Tendai Kashiri. The milling plant, together with Zhengs own partnership, was last month exposed to have been operating illegally in the country.\n\nWhereas foreign investors are supposed to be cleared by the Zimbabwe Investments Development Agency (ZIDA), legally bound to form and register companies, the two formed mining syndicates with locals against policies meant to govern foreign investments.\n\nReajin Enterprises was convicted on September 8, this year, of contravening Section 113(1)(a) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act as read with Section 379 of the Mines and Minerals Act (theft of gold ore).\n\nA fine of US$3,000 was imposed, restitution of US$875,667.67 ordered and the entire ore dump was to be returned to Ndemera.\n\n",

The privatisation of water aligns with neo-liberal policy frameworks that emphasise profit at the expense of equity and accountability.\n\nThe government is trusting market forces over human rights and it is likely a reflection of governments challenge to protect its people and defend equal access to a basic public good. This directly contravenes Section 77 of Zimbabwes Constitution, which guarantees every citizen the right to safe, clean, and potable water, said Jura.\n\nAs of last month, the government indicated that 15,000 households had been fitted with smart meters as part of the pilot project.\n\nHarare City Council has been struggling to provide water, with some areas receiving it only two days a week.\n\nEJWP is lobbying Parliament to stop the privatisation of water and introduce a Water Justice Bill which they say will ensure equal access to communities.\n\nToday, EJWP and representatives of its members are submitting a petition to parliament and a policy brief to respective critical stakeholders in this regard demanding that:\n\nParliament halts water privatisation and passes a Water Justice Bill to enshrine public ownership.\n\nGovernment invests in public and community-managed water systems instead of outsourcing to profit-driven private companies.\n\nA gendered human rights impact assessment is conducted before any water sector reforms are rolled out.\n\nCommunities, especially women and marginalised groups, are meaningfully consulted and included in water governance, said Jura.\n\n",
