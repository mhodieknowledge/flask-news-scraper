We have the strategy, we have the evidence, and we have the dedicated workforce. What we need now is the collective will to convert our commitments into concrete action. We must find the missing cases, secure the necessary resources and embrace the innovations that will allow us to end TB in Zimbabwe, Mugurungi said.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, Zimbabwean Health and Child Care Minister Douglas Mombeshora commended Zimbabwe for progress in the fight against the infectious disease.\n\nOur TB response has made real progress. But as we celebrate progress, we must also be honest about the road ahead. TB remains a serious public health challenge and the shifting landscape of global health financing is creating uncertainty for critical programs, he added.\n\n",

He did not say when the restrictions will be lifted.\n\nDar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Alfred Chalamila had earlier warned that the government would take strong action against those disrupting peace in the city.\n\nDemonstrations were also reported in the south-western city of Mbeya and the border town of Tunduma.\n\nWe are tired We want an independent electoral commission so that every Tanzanian can choose the leader they want, a protester told the BBC.\n\nAlong with the unrest of the streets, internet connectivity across the country has been severely disrupted. Global internet monitor NetBlocks described the interruption a nationwide digital blackout.\n\nReports say that voter turnout in Dar es Salaam was low when polls opened on Wednesday, with many hesitant to show up amid safety concerns.\n\nA police spokesperson had assured the public there was no threat to their safety, saying people should come out and vote, according to a message posted on social media.\n\nMore than 37 million registered voters are eligible to cast their ballots in the presidential and parliamentary election.\n\nSixteen fringe parties, none of whom have historically had significant public support, have been cleared to contest against President Samia, who is seeking a second term.\n\nThe only other serious contender, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo party, was disqualified on legal technicalities.\n\nSamias ruling party, CCM, has dominated the countrys politics and has never lost an election since independence.\n\nAhead of the election, rights groups condemned government repression, with Amnesty International citing a wave of terror involving enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of opposition figures.\n\nThe government rejected the claims, and officials said the election would be free and fair.\n\nSamia came into office in 2021 as Tanzanias first female president following the death of President John Magufuli.\n\nShe was initially praised for easing political repression under her predecessor, but the political space has since narrowed, with her government accused of targeting critics through arrests and a wave of abductions.\n\nThe electoral body is expected to announce results in three days after voting ends.\n\n",

Zimbabweans do not panic, we are going to announce the next course of action after this, said Sikhala.\n\nThe recently adopted resolution by the ruling party at its just-ended conference in Mutare, to set legal wheels in motion for President Mnangagwa to stay beyond 2028, has ignited political tensions.\n\nWithin ZANU-PF, a clique backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga is opposing the move to amend the constitution, rooting for the former army general to succeed Mnangagwa.\n\nWorld Council of Churches (WCC) programmes director, Kenneth Mtata, said the move to extend Mnangagwas term will have ripple effects on the countrys position in the global community.\n\nThe proposal to extend the presidential term will hurt Zimbabwe at many levels. Here are five main reasons\n\nFirst, it will undermine all the hard work of international re-engagement pursued since 2017. It will signal to global partners that Zimbabwe cannot be trusted to honour its own constitutional and democratic commitments.\n\nSecond, it will jeopardise the ongoing debt restructuring efforts. Third, this extension will discourage investment. Recently, Forbes magazine is said to have identified Zimbabwe as one of the most attractive tourist destinations. Investors would be wary of systems that change rules to suit political convenience. Policy inconsistency and instability will scare away the very capital needed for national economic recovery.\n\nFourth, the term extension will shatter the fragile social trust that had begun to form after years of political violence. Coercive force and intimidation would likely return to our national life in order to enforce such an unpopular measure. This will reopen old wounds and further divide communities once again.\n\nFifth, this decision will remove any chances of the President leaving a positive legacy. He will be classified with all those leaders remembered for clinging to power, rather than those honoured for serving with integrity and stepping aside with dignity, said Mtata.\n\n",

This marks a 511% increase from 2019 levels, a remarkable turnaround in just six years.\n\nThe expansion aligns with Zimbabwes broader strategy to reduce dependence on imports, especially following the global grain price spikes triggered by theRussiaUkraineconflict.\n\nWheatis the countrys second most important cereal after maize, and domestic self-sufficiency is seen as critical to stabilising food prices and strengthening food security.\n\nFocus on export opportunities and market stability\n\nWith domestic needs fully met, Zimbabwe is now seeking export opportunities within the region, particularly in neighboring countries that continue to face wheat shortages.\n\nHowever, Masuka emphasized that local supply remains secure and that the government has taken measures to stabilise pricing and ensure smooth distribution.\n\nThe government has released 6,518 metric tonnes to millers in recent weeks to stabilise supply and pricing levels of wheat products, he said, noting that the Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) continues to coordinate marketing and distribution to maintain market balance.\n\nDespite the surplus, Zimbabwe will continue importing limited volumes of high-gluten wheat, which is preferred by some millers for specific bread formulations.\n\nCertain millers have indicated that their mills and bread styles require high gluten content wheat not achievable in locally produced wheat, Masuka explained.\n\nAccording to him, as per current policy, such wheat will continue to be imported under existing arrangements, without any additional costs.\n\nThe government is urging registered millers and industry players to collaborate closely with authorities under the AMA framework to ensure a consistent balance between production, demand, and market stability.\n\nZimbabwes wheat success story reflects years of deliberate investment in irrigation infrastructure, farmer training, and private-sector partnerships.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), sub-SaharanAfricastill imports over 80% of its wheat consumption, underscoring Zimbabwes rare achievement in the region.\n\n",
