General Emmanuel Matatu as the new Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) Commander following the retirement of General Philip Valerio Sibanda.\n\nMatatu, who was appointed Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) Commander in March this year, will be replaced by former Deputy Director General of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Asher Walter Tapfumaneyi.\n\nTapfumaneyi had been named ZNA Chief of Staff in May.\n\nHis Excellency, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe and Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, Cde Dr Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, acting in terms of section 216(2 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe as read with sections 7(1) and 8(2 of the Defence Act [Chapter 11:02], promoted Lieutenant Genera Emmanuel Matatu to the rank of General and appointed him Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces with effect from 21 November 2025.\n\nThe appointment follows the retirement of outgoing Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, General Philip Valerio Sibanda, Rushwaya said\n\nSibanda is expected to take up a role in the ruling Zanu PF politburo.\n\nIn 2023, Mnangagwa briefly appointed him to the partys politburo before reversing the decision following a backlash from civil society. His appointment was scheduled for review at the end of his army tenure.\n\nWith tensions reportedly deepening over Mnangagwas succession, analysts view the elevation of his close allies to key military positions as a move to consolidate and secure his political interests.\n\nThe military played a pivotal role in the 2017 coup that propelled Mnangagwa to power, making control of the security sector crucial in maintaining his hold on the state.\n\nTapfumaneyi was placed under US sanctions in 2024 for his alleged role in disrupting the 2023 general elections through the Forever Association of Zimbabwe (FAZ), which was accused of intimidating voters at polling stations.\n\n",

That contrasts with the ZSE  long a haven for investors during bouts of high inflation  which is slightly lower.\n\nThe VFEX has been the standout performer, with market capitalisation rising over 40% year to date, the Harare-based brokerage said in its latest equity report, attributing the strong performance to gold-linked and consumer-facing stocks.\n\nLiquidity on the VFEX has also improved significantly, the brokerage added. With average daily turnover up 197% from the prior year, reflecting deepening participation by both institutional and retail investors.\n\nThe main exchange in Harare has borne the brunt of a yearlong liquidity squeeze thats been in place since the 43% devaluation of the ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, last September.\n\nTrading on the ZSE has slumped, and IH Securities expects the slowdown will continue to suppress stock market activity.\n\n",

However, it still has a long way to go before it becomes the sole legal tender for Zimbabwe, says Lyle Begbie, an economist at Oxford Economics Africa.\n\nZimbabwes history of hyperinflation and failed monetary experiments means itremainshighly dollarized. The U.S.dollar is the main medium of exchange, while the share ofZiGin monetary aggregates is small at around 17%. Prices are rarely quoted inZiG, and salaries and goods and services transactions are typically either fully or partially paid in U.S.dollars.\n\nWhile stabilizing inflation is undoubtedly positive, the landlocked nationwill need to remain steadfastregardingother challenges,before unlocking national sovereignty. Zimbabwes public debt, which reached $23.2 billion in 2024 (72.9% of GDP),per the World Bank,remainsa discouraging barrier to foreign investment.\n\nZimbabwes debt arrearssubstantially weighon its economic growth outlook, Begbie explains, before adding, Due to these arrears, the country cannot access concessional funding from multilateralorganizations, andis excluded from obtaining any sort of debt relief.\n\nThe World Bank has placed Zimbabwe in non-accrual status since 2000.

The arrival of the passengers raised alarms within government circles, as it has since emerged that the refugees did not know where they were being taken.\n\nA source in the NEC said during discussions, members were shocked that the intelligence services failed to detect this situation.\n\nKeep in mind that this is not the first time something like this has happened; there is another plane that has arrived before, and there have been people coming from Palestine and, we understand, others from Ukraine. However, the intelligence service was unaware; how can that be? We now want them to be investigated, stated the source.\n\nThe NEC members said that both the domestic and foreign intelligence arms should take responsibility for this security breach.\n\nA plane filled with people just landed in our country and they know nothing about it. We wanted answers because this means this could happen again and again.\n\nThe source said the issue was not about the Palestinian refugees but the fact that such a security breach was allowed to happen. The party also wants a profile of everyone that is in the country.\n\nWe are concerned that some of the people that have arrived stated that they paid about R30 000 to be taken here, and we wanted to confirm if that is indeed the case.\n\nThe NEC member also said the party would want to put more stringent visa regimes in place going forward, pointing out that Palestinians and Israelis could get into the country with visas, and that could be beefed up going forward. We have to know who is in the country.\n\nSeveral attempts to get comment from the ANC yesterday were unsuccessful.\n\nPolitical analyst Thabani Khumalo said the situation has left many questions for the ruling party to answer.\n\nIn South Africa, you do not know whether this is a country or what; the manner in which this unfolded has left many people feeling unsafe. We do not feel safe, and the visitors to the G20 will feel unsafe as well.\n\nHow many people are roaming the streets that are unknown? There have been reports of people operating training camps, and even the defence members are complaining, indicating that many things are not going well.\n\nInternational Relations Minister Ronald Lamola said the flight was part of a clear agenda to cleanse Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank.\n\n[This] is a clearly orchestrated operation because they are not only being sent to South Africa. There are other countries where such flights have been sent, he said.\n\nIt was reported that the Palestinian embassy in South Africa stated that the group left Israels Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, without any prior notice or co-ordination.\n\nThe embassy added that an unregistered and misleading organisation had exploited the plight of the Gaza citizens, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner.\n\n",

He forced them to write letters. Vice President can not be using the church to amass wealth for himself and George Charamba, said Mliswa.\n\nThe outspoken politician further called on the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) to investigate the City Council over the controversial eviction notices.\n\nHere comes the institutions that fight corruption, ZRP, ZACC, you need to investigate Harare City Council. Why they then wrote letters to displace those people when they are the owners of the land? They gave them the land. Everything was paid for. Over US$2 million was paid for that land, then suddenly you think people must just leave because somebody in a higher office, who is a Vice President says something, said Mliswa.\n\nHarare City Council acting Town Clerk Phakamile Mabena Moyo recently issued a three-month notice for the occupants to vacate the land, citing violation of Section 24 of the Regional, Town and Country Planning Act (Chapter 29:12).\n\nMliswas latest remarks come shortly after he accused Chiwengas wife, Minoyothabo Baloyi, of allegedly running a parallel structure in the Zimbabwe National Army.\n\nCity Council, I am going to report you to ZACC for overturning such decisions.
