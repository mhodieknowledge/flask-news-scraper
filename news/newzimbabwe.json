Does SZA think shes more successful than me? Lol yall catch me up pls. SZA, if every song youve ever done vanished right now, the music business wouldnt even miss you.\n\nIn this lengthy tweet, the Trinidadian-born rapper went on to claim that other countries that she has been to have no clue who SZA is and the singer has not even headlined a concert that consists of 80 000 attendees.\n\nShe added: Boo, Im an icon. Youre not.\n\nWhile you would think that it was the end, you are wrong because Minaj followed up with a series of tweets calling SZA a weirdo after Minajs fanbase shared screenshots of SZA bashing other women in the music industry, including Rihanna, Beyonce and even the rapper herself.\n\nLike do you know the level of inside HATE for yourself you had to have had to be this much of a cunt for no reason to the women you later worked with? Now you wanna act like a mthfckn tarot card, b***t quit. What an odd little weirdo, she wrote.\n\nWhile Nicki did not stop there, SZA, on the other hand, subtly replied to Minajs rants by wishing everyone a blessed night.\n\nLmao lemme go back to being calm, shy and meek. Yall have a blessed night! See you tomorrow for night 2 Paris!!\n\nSZA is not the only artist who has experienced the wrath of Minajs X rants.\n\nJust last week, Minaj sparked a feud with the Carters, as she claimed that Jay Z cheated her out of a multi-million dollar deal with streaming service, TIDAL.\n\nWhile on her infamous rants, Beyoncs fanbase, Beyhive, quickly defended their idol, who is currently on tour.\n\nCardi Bis also known to be one of the people that has beef with Minaj. Even though their feud dates back to 2018, to date, the rappers continue to throw jabs at each other on social media.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe US has deported five people who it described as criminal illegal aliens to the southern African kingdom of Eswatini.\n\nOn board the flight were five deportees from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba and Yemen who have been convicted of crimes ranging from child rape to murder, US Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlinsaid in an online post.\n\nThis flight took individuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back, McLaughlin wrote on X.\n\nEswatini, the last absolute monarchy in Africa, said it acknowledged widespread concern within the country regarding the deportations.\n\nFive inmates are currently housed in our correctional facilities in isolated units, where similar offenders are kept. The nation is assured that these inmates pose no threat to the country or its citizens, government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli said in a statement.\n\nEswatini and the US will work with the United Nations immigration agency to facilitate the transit of the deportees to their country of origin, Mdluli added.\n\nEarlier this month, the USsent eight migrants from several countries to South Sudanafter a court lifted restrictions on sending people to countries where they have no ties.\n\nIn a series of posts on the X social media platform, McLaughlin listed the crimes the five deported to Eswatini had been convicted of, describing them as depraved monsters who had been terrorizing American communities.\n\nA safe third country deportation flight to Eswatini in Southern Africa has landed, she said, adding: They are off of American soil.\n\nThe Eswatini government declined to say whether any payments were made as part of the arrangement.\n\nThe US is the fourth largest market for the countrys biggest export, sugar. Analysts suggest that Eswatini may be trying to safeguard this trade and avoid the imposition of tariffs.\n\nA pro-democracy group, the Swazi Solidarity Network, has condemned the deal as deplorable.\n\nSpokesperson Lucky Lukhele told the BBC that Eswatini must not become a dumping ground for criminals, and that citizens needed protection.\n\nThe news has sparked public concern over whether local prisons are equipped to securely house such inmates.\n\nPreviously known as Swaziland, Eswatini is a small, landlocked country that is surrounded by South Africa and Mozambique. It has been led by King Mswati III since 1986.\n\nLast month, the US Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own.\n\nRwanda has confirmed discussions have taken place, while Benin, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Moldova have also been named in media reports as potential recipient countries.\n\nTrumps administration has already deported people to El Salvadorand Costa Rica.\n\nSouth Sudan recently agreed to hold eight men deported from the US and said they were not in handcuffs and appeared to be in good condition.\n\nThe war-torn country said the deportees were kept in a civilian facility in the capital Juba, under the watch of police and the national security service. Only one of them is from South Sudan.\n\nIn April, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked all visas for South Sudanese passport holders blaming the country for failing to accept the return of its repatriated citizens in a timely manner.\n\nIt is not clear if that has now changed.\n\nLast week, Nigeria said it would not bow to pressure from the Trump administration to accept Venezuelan deportees or third-country prisoners from the US.\n\nPresident Donald Trumps pledge to conduct mass deportations was a centrepiece of his election campaign and an issue on which he drew widespread support, including many Hispanic voters.\n\nHe said he wanted to deport people living in the US illegally but White House efforts have been much broader in scope  taking aim at people in the US on student visas, suspending admissions of refugees except white South Africans, and moving to revoke temporary work permits and other protections that had been granted to immigrants by previous presidents.\n\nTo crack down on immigrants, Trumps administration has resumed raids at workplaces, a tactic that had been suspended under his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nPermanant Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Child Care Dr Aspect Maunganidze says the United States withdrawal of funding for Zimbabwes healthcare sector, coupled with general donor fatigue, has disrupted the countrys HIV financing and programming.\n\nThe Trump administration withdrew funding by at least 85% worldwide earlier this year, severely affecting several poor countries, including Zimbabwe.\n\nGiving oral evidence to the Joint Portfolio Committee on Health and Child Care and the Thematic Committee on HIV and AIDS on HIV financing this Tuesday, Maunganidze said the reduced financing due to donor withdrawal had forced the ministry to re-strategise its funding mechanisms.\n\nHe told the committees that the ministry had written to Treasury seeking a supplementary budget to close the funding gap created by the US withdrawal and donor fatigue, in order to strengthen the national HIV response.\n\nThe main challenges in HIV and AIDS funding have always included some funding gaps, regardless of donor support or otherwise. Even ensuring that our strategic plan is truly a national HIV strategic plan that is sustainable, particularly in HIV prevention and related initiatives, has been difficult.\n\nHowever, the major threat right now is the withdrawal of donor funding.\n\nWhat we have observed globally is a general fatigue in donor funding. Whether it comes through the UN, the Global Fund, or other partners, this fatigue is concerning. There are now many competing global health and humanitarian challenges that have emerged in recent years, not just HIV and AIDS.\n\nThis has unfortunately been compounded by the abrupt withdrawal of funding from one of our key donorsthe US government, Maunganidze said.\n\nHe explained that the US had been supporting HIV funding through PEPFAR (Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) and by contributing significantly to the Global Fund.\n\nThe US government contributes 30% of the Global Fund, which supports HIV, TB, and malaria interventions.\n\nThrough PEPFAR and US implementing agencies like the CDC and the Presidents Malaria Initiative, this sudden funding withdrawal has had significant consequences for our healthcare services, he said.\n\nMaunganidze also outlined Zimbabwes domestic and international HIV financing models.\n\nDomestically, we rely on the national budget allocation and the Health Levy (a 5% tax on mobile data and airtime), which supports various programs, including HIV.\n\nWeve also introduced specific taxes through the main budgetlike the recently implemented Health Sugar Levyto help strengthen our HIV response, he said.\n\nOn the international front, Maunganidzecited continued support from the Global Fund, the Health Development Fund, and donors such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHe added that the ministry also works with the United Nations and follows UNAIDS Fast-Track commitments for 2020 and 2026, which aim to strengthen HIV responses in the country.\n\nIn general, partners contribute between 50% and 65% of funding for our HIV response.\n\nWhen looking at the overall health budget, development partners have contributed between 35% and 45%, and in some years, even beyond 50%, he noted.\n\nFollowing the US funding withdrawal announced on January 20, 2025, the government responded by announcing on May 15, 2025, intensified efforts to mobilise more domestic resources and laid out a roadmap to strategically boost local HIV drug production.\n\nI must say we are okay on HIV funding until at least January 20, 2026. The same applies to TB and malaria medicines.\n\nHowever, we must continue ensuring that our local revenue streams support a sustained HIV response so that we maintain our gains, particularly on the 95-95-95 UN targets, which we have already achieved.\n\nSince January, over 5,000 HIV-related deaths have been recorded, raising serious concerns about the governments need to increase investment in HIV financing and programming.\n\n",

This is a way to capacitate us to bring power from Mozambique, like from EDM, through Mutare, via that corridor, to Orange Grove, then to Triangle.\n\nWe are already on the site and we are having supplies coming from another route, like from Mwangi, via Tokwe, to Triangle, because that line exists.\n\nThe installation will increase the capacity within the low-field areas where we have a lot of farmers in desperate need of electricity, Gurupira said\n\nGurupira highlighted that ZETDC was working closely with wheat, tobacco and sugarcane farmers to make sure load shedding is minimised on their farms.\n\nWe are working together with the winter wheat farming clusters, where we ensure that there is no load-shedding during the farming season.\n\nWe are saying the same thing for the sugar industry. As long as the clusters are organised and they are irrigating, then we also ensure we ring fence so that there is no load-shedding for them, said Gurupira.\n\nThe companys Commercial Services manager John Chikeya bemoaned infrastructure vandalism, saying ZETDC was working towards the resuscitation of the vandalised and dilapidated infrastructure.\n\nThis initiative seeks to enhance electricity reliability for sugarcane farmers and producers in Chiredzi.\n\nAs ZETDC we are advancing a smart grid initiative which includes ithe nstallation of smart water reclosers and smart metres.\n\nThe initiative also seeks to enhance electricity reliability for sugar millers and irrigators and ensure prioritised power supply during outages, Chikeya said.\n\nSmart metres and MCCBs, which are motorised circuit breakers, enable segregation of the power supply.\n\nThis means ZETDC can select who will have power and who will not, and what quantum of power they will have during periods of suppressed generation.\n\nThe lowveld had been one of the most needy areas, identified for the solar initiatives.\n\nZETDC is envisaged to have a private sector setting up commercial and industrial solar plants to benefit the farming community who have good credit ratings.\n\nAmongst other initiatives, ZETDC is also undertaking network rehabilitation and reinforcement and expansion to upgrade the old and aged infrastructure that was prone to a high rate of falls.\n\nThe substations were being reviewed and inspected and aligned to the poor demand of the low-yield.\n\nThere is a 132 kv transmission line from Orange Grove to the low-yield that will be supporting the growth of the sugarcane value chain.\n\nThere is also a scheduled upgrade for Chiredzi Town substation transformer 1 from 5 MVA to 10 MVA, which is a 100% increase in capacity. Then the resuscitation of Buffalo Range capacitor banks and resuscitation of Chiredzi Town L18 substation, said Chikeya.\n\nZaka South MP, Clemence Chiduwa chaired the Committee, which was receiving oral evidence on challenges that are affecting the sugar industry value chain in the country, among them, overpricing.\n\n",
