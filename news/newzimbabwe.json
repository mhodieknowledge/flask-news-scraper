            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZIMBABWES government has jumped to endorse the disputed elections held in Tanzania last week, with President Emmerson Mnangagwa congratulating President Samia Suluhu Hassan on her victory, which sparked nationwide protests that left several dead.\n\nAmid a tilted political playing field which saw the disqualification and incarceration of an opposition leader and subsequently a contested electoral outcome, Tanzanias Independent National Electoral Commission on Saturday declared Hassan the winner with an unassailable 31,91 million votes, representing 97,66 percent of the vote.Hassan is expected to be sworn in this Monday, November 3, 2025.In a statement Sunday, Mnangagwa congratulated Hassan, now derogatorily known on social media as Madam Dictator.On behalf of the Government and people of Zimbabwe, the ruling party Zanu PF and indeed, on my own behalf, I wish to extend my sincere congratulations on your victory in the just concluded presidential elections.Your victory testifies to the trust and confidence that the people of the United Republic of Tanzania have in your visionary leadership and in the policies of the party you lead, Chama Cha Mapinduzi.I would like to reaffirm my commitment to work closely with you, Your Excellency, to further strengthen and deepen the strong bonds of friendship and solidarity between our two countries and peoples.Mnangagwa, now 83 and reportedly plotting a third presidential term, said he hopes to continue working with Hassan at the regional, continental and multilateral level on matters of mutual interest and concern.Let me take this opportunity to wish you, Your Excellency, good health and success in leading your great country to prosperity.Please accept, Your Excellency and dear sister, the assurances of my highest consideration, he said.Hassan served as Vice President under the late President John Pombe Magufuli and became Tanzanias first female President following Magufulis death in 2021.In a speech aimed at pacifying protestors over the weekend, Hassan said her overwhelming victory was a sign that voters had confidence in her leadership.The 2025 election is now done. It is now time to stand together as a nation, she said amid praise for the electoral commission for staging a free, open and fair poll.She described protestors as uncouth before threatening a clampdown on dissent.What happened in Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Mwanza and Songwe were neither civil nor patriotic. A patriot builds the country, not to tear down what was built by the energy and the sweat of the citizens.The government utterly condemns those happenings.

            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nTHE upcoming China International Import Expo (CIIE) offers a gateway for Zimbabwean horticultural products to enter the Chinese market, enabling local businesses to directly connect with Chinese buyers and partners, a Zimbabwean exporter has said.\n\nIn a recent interview with Xinhua, Tatenda Mukazi, marketing director of Procitru Investments, a Zimbabwean private company that contracts the growing of fresh produce and other horticultural crops mainly for export, said the CIIE is expected to open new avenues and unlock more growth opportunities for Zimbabwean exports to China.The expo will be held in Shanghai from November 5 to 10. According to Chinas Ministry of Commerce, this years event will feature an expanded special zone for African products, with the number of participating African enterprises increasing by 80 percent year on year.We are going to exhibit blueberries, avocados, avocado oil and macadamia nuts, said Mukazi, who will attend the CIIE for the first time.Zimbabwes blueberries are set to enter the Chinese market following the signing of an export deal during Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwas visit to China in September. A trade protocol on Zimbabwean avocado exports was also signed last September, a move that has excited local farmers eager to access the Chinese market.For this trip, we are going to look for markets, meet buyers and explore machines that can process blueberries into juice for export. We are also looking for partners to do business with, Mukazi said.The expo will also allow him to better understand Chinese market dynamics and systems.I am going to visit their supermarkets and facilities to see how they operate, how they run their systems, and their payment methods, so that we move on the same page, he added.One of Mukazis key goals is to secure direct export agreements with Chinese businesses.I am aiming to meet real buyers so that we can cut off all the middlemen. This is why I am pushing for this trip to be successful, he said.With years of experience in exporting fresh produce, Mukazi works closely with Zimbabwean farmers to identify markets and facilitate exports. He said that the Chinese market represents a significant opportunity for local exporters and that the CIIE serves as a vital bridge connecting Zimbabwean farmers with one of the worlds largest consumer markets.The expo, he added, allows Zimbabwean exporters to showcase a broader range of products beyond the countrys traditional exports such as minerals.Now we are venturing into horticulture, citrus, avocados and berries. For us, it is a great opportunity. We need to show the Chinese market that we are not only buyers; we also have value to offer back home. We can be customers to them, and they can be customers to us, said Mukazi.For us, it is a challenge. We need to up our game and be ready for big deals. It is a new adventure, a new market, and great exposure for us, he added.Beyond opening new export markets, Mukazi sees the CIIE as a platform to deepen partnerships with Chinese companies. As trade with China expands, he said, there is a growing need to work with Chinese partners to increase value addition for local produce such as avocados and blueberries.Already, we have local companies processing avocado oil. On this trip, we are going to bring some samples to market and see how the Chinese market responds, Mukazi said.\n\nIn a recent interview with Xinhua, Tatenda Mukazi, marketing director of Procitru Investments, a Zimbabwean private company that contracts the growing of fresh produce and other horticultural crops mainly for export, said the CIIE is expected to open new avenues and unlock more growth opportunities for Zimbabwean exports to China.\n\nThe expo will be held in Shanghai from November 5 to 10.

He said that the Chinese market represents a significant opportunity for local exporters and that the CIIE serves as a vital bridge connecting Zimbabwean farmers with one of the worlds largest consumer markets.The expo, he added, allows Zimbabwean exporters to showcase a broader range of products beyond the countrys traditional exports such as minerals.Now we are venturing into horticulture, citrus, avocados and berries. For us, it is a great opportunity. We need to show the Chinese market that we are not only buyers; we also have value to offer back home. We can be customers to them, and they can be customers to us, said Mukazi.For us, it is a challenge. We need to up our game and be ready for big deals. It is a new adventure, a new market, and great exposure for us, he added.Beyond opening new export markets, Mukazi sees the CIIE as a platform to deepen partnerships with Chinese companies. As trade with China expands, he said, there is a growing need to work with Chinese partners to increase value addition for local produce such as avocados and blueberries.Already, we have local companies processing avocado oil. On this trip, we are going to bring some samples to market and see how the Chinese market responds, Mukazi said.\n\nThe expo will be held in Shanghai from November 5 to 10. According to Chinas Ministry of Commerce, this years event will feature an expanded special zone for African products, with the number of participating African enterprises increasing by 80 percent year on year.\n\nWe are going to exhibit blueberries, avocados, avocado oil and macadamia nuts, said Mukazi, who will attend the CIIE for the first time.Zimbabwes blueberries are set to enter the Chinese market following the signing of an export deal during Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwas visit to China in September. A trade protocol on Zimbabwean avocado exports was also signed last September, a move that has excited local farmers eager to access the Chinese market.For this trip, we are going to look for markets, meet buyers and explore machines that can process blueberries into juice for export.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Government of Zimbabwe has consolidated 11 different local authority licences into a single unitary business licence to improve the ease of doing business.\n\nThe reduction in fees is expected to stimulate entrepreneurship, encourage the formalisation of entities and create free funds for investment in growth and job creation.\n\nThe review came in the wake of representations from industry and commerce stakeholders, who raised concern over the multiplicity and steep licences needed to operate businesses lawfully.\n\nThe new policy consolidates 11 different local authority licences into a single, unified shop licence.\n\nThe reprieve, which has been met with optimism from various stakeholders, extends across various sectors, including retail, tourism, food and confectionery, liquor trading and butcheries.\n\nPreviously, a food factory licence alone could set a business back as much as US$2,300. Now, that entire cost, along with 10 others, is swept away into one simple licence, said Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube in a statement at the weekend.\n\nBottle stores operating within a licensed retail shop will no longer require a separate licence, while businesses dealing in both wholesale and retail will need only a single permit.\n\nIntegrated factories and retail outlets on the same premises will be covered by one licence, cutting multiple regulatory costs.\n\nFurther, supermarkets are exempted from Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) licence requirements, unless they operate in designated tourist jurisdictions.\n\nTo cushion small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the government has directed that councils set a sliding scale for licence fees, with a maximum limit of US$500.\n\nThis measure is designed to ensure that the cost of doing business remains proportionate to the size of the enterprise, providing significant relief to emerging operators.\n\nThese measures are meant to aid in the creation of a conducive economic environment where jobs will be created, productivity improved across all sectors of the economy, achieving high growth rates through improving the ease of doing business, said Ncube.\n\nGovernment remains committed to improving the business environment to encourage domestic and foreign investment in which Zimbabwe can become an upper middle-income society by 2030.\n\nThe retail sector is one of the fastest growing sectors in Zimbabwe, and to further strengthen it, Government has moved to remove the fragmentation of licences, added Ncube.\n\nThe Medical Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ) has also removed the permit for the sale of veterinary products, as its functions overlap with those of the Department of Veterinary Services.\n\nTourism businesses, including hotels and lodges, have seen their licence fees reduced by 50 percent, also pegged at a maximum US$500.\n\nChange of property use fee has been capped at US$1,000, down from highs of US$3,500 thereby dealing a huge blow to local authorities which were amassing revenue from the transactions.\n\nLiquor licensing has been simplified, with the Liquor Licensing Board compressing all permits into one, regardless of location.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Financial Services Licence for local businesses has been cut to US$20, down from US$186, while the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) will now issue a single licence across business categories at a cost of between US$50 and US$120, applicable to all branches of a company.\n\n",
