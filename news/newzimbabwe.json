See why its urgent? she said.\n\nShe noted that petitioning Parliament was inspired by the realisation that they are the lawmakers with the mandate to propose, draft or vote for laws with authority to summon hearings, investigate issues and monitor the full implementation of laws and the respective financing of such.\n\nMutsamvi said parliamentary officials, who received the petition on behalf of the Clerk of Parliament said we would get a response on the matter in three weeks.\n\nIn the meantime, we are having a parallel online campaign, building awareness amongst other women groups on why the gender policy is key in our everyday work in empowering women and towards gender justice.\n\nAs we celebrate the Womens Month, at every opportunity we get, we highlight why the gender policy is critical at the moment and the opportunity costs. We primarily seek to engage all relevant stakeholders through any means to push for this urgent request, added Mutsamvi.\n\n",

However, the US chose not to follow that process.\n\nTheyve gone through another process rather than just declaring our Ambassador PNG [persona non grata]. So thats the route that they have chosen, and we will have to respect the decision as a sovereign state, said Phiri.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking to the SABC on Saturday, Lamola said the expulsion of Rasool was an unprecedented, regrettable decision by the US as it was not done via normal diplomatic relations.\n\nIt is also regrettable because he was at a very advanced stage to prepare for the special envoys, to reset the relations and so forth. But we are now where we are we have to work with what we have, and that is what we will continue to do because we believe the relationship between the two countries is mutually beneficial, it is strategic, and it has to be maintained.\n\nLamola added: We need to find time to engage with each other behind closed doors, where the US can raise their concerns with us, and we can also raise our concerns with them because it is not helpful to engage in megaphone and Twitter diplomacy. But we have to engage each other face-to-face on various issues of mutual concern.\n\nHe said South Africa would continue to engage and open the lines of diplomatic engagements with the US.\n\nLamola said it was unfortunate the Trump administration had taken the route of engaging in tweets, adding that this was not helpful in mending the relationship.\n\n",

He remains in custody at Harare Remand Prison.\n\n",

            "content": "By The New York Times\n\nA DRAFT circulating inside the administration lists three tiers of countries whose citizens may face restrictions on entering the United States.\n\nThe most stringent restriction level would flatly bar citizens from 11 countries from entering the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration is considering targeting the citizens of as many as 43 countries as part of a new ban on travel to the United States that would be broader than the restrictions imposed during President Trumps first term, according to officials familiar with the matter.\n\nA draft list of recommendations developed by diplomatic and security officials suggests a red list of 11 countries whose citizens would be flatly barred from entering the United States. They are Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen, the officials said.\n\nDraft List of Proposed Travel Ban Countries\n\nAn internal Trump administration proposal lists the following countries whose citizens could face restrictions on entering the U.S. Some countries may change in any final order.\n\nRed\n\nAll travel banned\n\nOrange\n\nVisas sharply restricted\n\nYellow\n\n60 days to address concerns\n\nThe officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive internal deliberations, cautioned that the list had been developed by the State Department several weeks ago, and that changes were likely by the time it reached the White House.\n\nOfficials at embassies and in regional bureaus at the State Department, and security specialists at other departments and intelligence agencies, have been reviewing the draft. They are providing comment about whether descriptions of deficiencies in particular countries are accurate or whether there are policy reasons  like not risking disruption to cooperation on some other priority  to reconsider including some.\n\nThe draft proposal also included an orange list of 10 countries for which travel would be restricted but not cut off. In those cases, affluent business travelers might be allowed to enter, but not people traveling on immigrant or tourist visas.\n\nCitizens on that list would also be subjected to mandatory in-person interviews in order to receive a visa. It included Belarus, Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar, Pakistan, Russia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Turkmenistan.\n\nWhen he took office on Jan. 20, Mr. Trump issued an executive order requiring the State Department to identify countries for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries.\n\nHe gave the department 60 days to finish a report for the White House with that list, meaning it is due next week. The State Departments Bureau of Consular Affairs has taken the lead, and the order said the Justice and Homeland Security Departments and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence were to assist with the effort.\n\nSpokespeople at several agencies declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment. But the State Department previously said it was following Mr. Trumps order and was committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process, while declining to specifically discuss internal deliberations.\n\nThe Times and other news outlets reported this month that Afghanistan, which was not part of Mr. Trumps first-term travel bans but fell to the Taliban when the U.S. withdrew its forces in 2021, was likely to be part of the second-term ban. But the other countries under consideration had been unclear.\n\nIt is also not clear whether people with existing visas would be exempted from the ban, or if their visas would be canceled. Nor is it clear whether the administration intends to exempt existing green card holders, who are already approved for lawful permanent residency.\n\nThe Trump administration this past week said it had canceled the green card of a Syrian-born former Columbia University graduate student of Palestinian descent, Mahmoud Khalil, because he had led high-profile campus protests against Israels war in Gaza that the government says were antisemitic, setting off a court fight over the legality of that move.\n\nSome of the countries on the draft red and orange lists were sanctioned by Mr. Trump in his first-term travel bans, but many are new. Some share characteristics with the earlier lists  they are generally Muslim-majority or otherwise nonwhite, poor and have governments that are considered weak or corrupt.\n\nBut the reason several others were included was not immediately clear. Bhutan, for example, was proposed for an absolute ban on entry. The small Buddhist and Hindu country is sandwiched between China and India, neither of which were on any of the draft lists.\n\nThe proposal to sharply restrict, if not outright ban, visitors from Russia raises a different issue. While the Russian government has a reputation for corruption, Mr. Trump has been trying to reorient U.S. foreign policy in a more Russia-friendly direction.\n\nA decision to include Venezuela could also disrupt a nascent thaw in relations that has been useful to Mr. Trumps separate efforts to deport undocumented migrants.\n\nThe proposal also includes a draft yellow list of 22 countries that would be given 60 days to clear up perceived deficiencies, with the threat of being moved onto one of the other lists if they did not comply.\n\nSuch issues could include failing to share with the United States information about incoming travelers, purportedly inadequate security practices for issuing passports, or the selling of citizenship to people from banned countries, which could serve as a loophole around the restrictions.\n\nThat list, the officials said, included Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, So Tom and Prncipe, Vanuatu and Zimbabwe.\n\nDuring Mr. Trumps first term, courts blocked the government from enforcing the first two versions of his travel ban, but the Supreme Court eventually permitted a rewritten ban  one that banned citizens from eight nations, six of them predominantly Muslim  to take effect. The list later evolved.\n\nSoon after he became president in January 2021, Joseph R. Biden Jr. issued a proclamation revoking Mr. Trumps travel bans, calling them a stain on our national conscience and inconsistent with our long history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all.\n\nMr. Trumps executive order in January said he would revive the bans in order to protect American citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\n\n",
