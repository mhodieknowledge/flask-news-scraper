How much loving care illuminates the rooms, the corridors, the clinics, the places where the humblest services are performed! he said.\n\nFrancis is being cared for on the 10th floor of the hospital, home to a special papal suite including a chapel.\n\nAt the entrance of the hospital Sunday morning, dozens of children from a Catholic scout group called out Pope Francis, Pope Francis, as they held yellow and white balloons.\n\nI know that many children are praying for me; some of them came here today to Gemelli as a sign of closeness, Francis wrote in his message.\n\nThank you, dearest children! The pope loves you and is always waiting to meet you.\n\n",

GCVSA further claims the former Presidential Advisor is a double agent.\n\nThe GCVSA is aware of a recent military intelligence dossier linking Mutsvangwa to espionage activities involving hostile foreign powers, reads the statement signed by the organisations Secretary General Ntokozo Msipha.\n\nThis intelligence confirms what many have long suspectedMutsvangwa is not merely a loudmouth but an active saboteur working to weaken Zimbabwe from within.\n\nHis attacks on General Chiwenga are not personal but part of a broader scheme dictated by those who seek to install puppets in positions of power while eliminating true patriots.\n\nHis masters have sent him on a mission: to undermine the military, to spread falsehoods about national heroes, and to confuse the people with propaganda so that the 2030 succession project can be smoothly implemented.\n\nWe say to him and his handlers: we see you, we know your plans, and you will not succeed.\n\nAn audio recording of Mutsvangwa describing Chiwenga as unelectable, cruel and illiterate was published in an investigation by United Kingdom-based Dug Up, last week.\n\nMutsvangwa highlighted the plight of Chiwengas ex-wife Marry as one of the reasons the former general should not be anywhere near power, a position that falls in line with Mnangagwas 2030 agenda.\n\nCertain sections within Zanu PF want Mnangagwa to hold onto power beyond his 2028 mandate.\n\nSurprisingly, Mutsvangwa, who is now in the cross hairs of the Chiwenga faction, played a central role in the coup that toppled late President Robert Mugabe and installed both Mnangagwa and Chiwenga.\n\nThe people of Zimbabwe are not blind. They see through your deception, Chris Mutsvangwa. You are not a kingmaker. You are not a revolutionary. You are a political scavenger, feeding on the scraps left behind by real leaders.\n\nYour name will be remembered not among the liberators but among the traitors who sold their souls for thirty pieces of silver.\n\nWe issue this final warning: Zimbabwe will not be destabilised by cowards, mercenaries, and political prostitutes masquerading as nationalists. The revolution will not be hijacked.\n\n",

The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. We understand you will be part of the team that will be presenting at theZim Diaspora Property Showcase USA-Canadain Dallas, United States of America, on legal issues affecting diasporansin America and Canada when investing in Zimbabwe. What are we to expect?\n\nVM: Firstly, allow me to thank Seeff Zimbabwe for coming up with the idea of this event and executing it. The exchange of ideas at such events is invaluable.\n\nOur experience in Birmingham, United Kingdom, at the Zim Diaspora Property Showcase UK in July last year taught us that the diaspora property market is hungry for one-on-one interactions with the potential Zimbabwe service provider, specifically those in the real estate sector where most of their investments are housed. This allows for a better understanding of each others operating models.\n\nI am sure my colleagues in the real estate sector of Zimbabwe are preparing something special for the USA and Canada markets at this particular showcase. The attendees will be able to access special deals prepared specifically for the showcase, including structured payment options that the diaspora market normally fails to get access to.\n\nReporter:Are you suggesting that they will be specific deals prepared only for the USA-Canada diaspora market?\n\nVM: Yes.The property showcase is not just to showcase our real estate to the diaspora, it is also to expose the diaspora market to our Zimbabwean businesses. It will be negligent as a business person to use a one size fits all approach in all dealings with the local and various markets in the diaspora.\n\nThe attendees from Zimbabwe will also be using it as a fact  finding conference, to understand the market from that part of the world, their interests, considerations and concerns when investing with the aim to tailor make products that are attractive to that market, taking into consideration their specific needs for a mutually beneficial relationship going forward.\n\nMy understanding is that the organizers of the event will also be intentionally exposing the Zimbabwean real estate businesses to the Dallas real estate sector. It is anticipated that sufficient synergies and networks will be created from that exchange.\n\nREAD MORE: The Premier Zimbabwe Diaspora Property Showcase is coming to the USA!\n\nReporter: What can we expect from your presentation on legal issues affecting property investments?\n\nVM: My mandate at the conference is to educate potential investors on the Zimbabwean legal framework, specifically when it comes to investing in the real estate sector. My presentation will cover a variety of issues, example, the property titles that are in Zimbabwe, how to conduct a due diligence on the various property titles, other legal issues that affect your investment in Zimbabwe, if a member of the diaspora, issues to do with Zimbabwe registered marriages, death et cetera.\n\nIf the investors are foreign, we will also discuss the property investment regulatory framework with the aim of ensuring that the investments are safe and protected and also that the investor is able to repatriate capital and profits on disinvestment.\n\nReporter: Will that include how to avoid being duped when investing in property from the diaspora?\n\nVM: That will be one of the topics in the presentation. The overarching aim of the presentation is to safeguard potential buyers against fraudsters. Our economy is in transition, with a lot of real estate developments mushrooming across our cities. There are notable and significant gains in value on existing real estate as a result of this real estate development boom. This creates a lot of opportunities for investors and also fraudsters.\n\nOur local property developers have also been creative in their fundraising initiatives to complete developments when access to mainstream finance is limited. This, however, motivates for thorough due diligence by professionals to ensure that the development financial and legal structures are sound and also that the investor is sufficiently protected.\n\nReporter: How do you engage a lawyer from the diaspora and track your property transaction?\n\nVM: Most of our lawyers across Zimbabwe can be found online if the investor cannot get a lawyer by reference. If in doubt of the lawyers track record, our Law Society of Zimbabwe is available to assist people with various enquiries on the legal practitioners in Zimbabwe.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have to end here because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\nFor those looking to attend the Zim Diaspora Property Showcase USA-Canada, please sign up by connecting with the event organizers atwww.zimpropertyshowcaseusa.com.\n\n",

If I must live without him, then I need answers, I need to know where he is.\n\nLife has not been the same since Itai was abducted. The last 10 years have been hard. I am reminded of him every time I look at my kids because both look like their dad.\n\nIt hurts not to have Itai in my life and to see my kids missing him and growing up without a father who loved them so dearly. I do not have any answers, but I feel blessed to have my two kids. When I look at them l feel Gods grace, she said.\n\nSheffra also said the police never investigated Dzamaras disappearance or provided any updates, ignoring even a High Court of Zimbabwe order to take action.\n\nShe also accused the government of ignoring the familys requests for answers, dismissing demands from friends, activists, and the international community.\n\nThe police never came back to give any update. As far as I know, they never even investigated the case. They were not interested in finding Itai. Even the High Court of Zimbabwe order could not get the police to find my husband or tell us what happened to him.\n\nAs a family we did everything to get answers.
