This will take the current Parliament to 2030.\n\nThe amendments include repealing Section 328 of the Constitution to allow Mnangagwa to benefit from the changes.\n\nThey are also planning to use their two-thirds majority to approve the amendments and illegally avoid a referendum.\n\nThey are planning to submit the proposals to the Cabinet next week for approval. The proposed amendments will then be sent to Parliament for approval using the Zanu PF two-thirds majority. Public consultations will be conducted and even if they are resisted, amendments will be adopted by Parliament again, said Geza\n\nGeza also alleged that the trio has bribed judges to flush out anyones court application in trying to defend the Constitution.\n\nThe amendments will be adopted without conducting a referendum. We are aware of this shenanigans.\n\nApart from looting billions, they are also planning to loot the Constitution by criminally mutilating the Constitution to extend their plunder.\n\nZiyambi Ziyambi, Mudenda and Mabiza we are watching you and your time will come, Hokoyo (beware) we will not give you the chance to butcher our Constitution, we know you have met judges and ordered them to throw away any applications by anyone who will approach the court seeking a relief to save the Constitution, said Geza\n\n",

            "content": "By AFP\n\nPOPE Francis, an energetic reformer who inspired widespread devotion from Catholics but riled traditionalists, died on Monday aged 88.\n\nThe Argentine pontiff, leader of the Catholic Church since March 2013, spent 38 days being treated for double pneumonia at Romes Gemelli hospital before seeming to recover and leaving the facility on March 23.\n\nHis death came just a day after he delighted the crowds of worshippers at the Vatican on Easter Sunday with an appearance on the balcony at Saint Peters Basilica.\n\nDearest brothers and sisters, it is with deep sorrow that I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis, said Cardinal Kevin Farrell in the statement published by the Vatican on its Telegram channel.\n\nThis morning at 7:35 am (0535 GMT) the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father.\n\nHis entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and His church.\n\nHis death sets in motion centuries-old traditions that will culminate in the gathering of a conclave of cardinals to choose a successor.\n\nIn the meantime, the day-to-day running of the tiny Vatican City state will be handled by the camerlengo, a senior cardinal, currently Dublin-born Kevin Farrell.\n\nHumble pastor\n\nFrancis, whose real name was Jorge Bergoglio, was the first Jesuit to lead the worlds almost 1.4 billion Catholics and the first from the Americas.\n\nHe took over after Benedict XVI became the first pontiff since the Middle Ages to step down  and cut a sharply different figure from the German theologian.\n\nA football-loving former archbishop of Buenos Aires who was often happiest among his flock, Francis sought to forge a more open and compassionate church.\n\nHe strongly defended social justice, the rights of migrants and the environment, while also pushing through governance reforms and tackling the scourge of clerical sex abuse of children.\n\nBut critics accused him of creating doctrinal confusion and failing to defend traditional Catholic beliefs on key issues such as abortion and divorce.\n\nFranciss desire to chart a different path was evident right to the end, with his decision to be buried not in St Peters Basilica but in Romes Santa Maria Maggiore basilica.\n\nHe will become the first pope in more than 100 years to be laid to rest outside the Vatican.\n\nFrancis also rejected the tradition of popes having three coffins, instead choosing to buried in just one, made of wood and zinc, to reflect his role as a humble pastor.\n\nHealth issues\n\nFrancis had left open the possibility of stepping down if he felt unable to do his job, following the example of Benedict, who quit citing his ailing health.\n\nBut he insisted for years that time had not yet come, and maintained a busy schedule, right up to hosting the prime minister of Slovakia shortly before his hospital admission.\n\nFrancis, who had part of his lung removed as a young man, was visibly breathless in the days before going to the Gemelli, delegating aides to read his homilies at public audiences.\n\nQuestions will now be asked whether the pontiff, known for being stubborn and refusing to take rest, should have been admitted to hospital earlier.\n\nEven after he was released from hospital and ordered to rest for two months, Francis did not wait long before making public appearances.\n\nHe had been hospitalised with a respiratory infection in March 2023. That same year he also underwent surgery for a hernia, and in 2021 he had colon surgery.\n\nHe suffered knee pain that required him to use a wheelchair, and had fallen twice in recent months.\n\nYet he never took a day off and made frequent trips abroad, including a four-nation Asia-Pacific tour only last September.\n\nHuge crowds gathered wherever he went, a testament to his popularity and human touch, which saw him finish his Sunday Angelus prayer each week urging followers to pray for him and to have a good lunch.\n\nWho am I to judge?\n\nWhen Francis took over, the Catholic Church was mired in infighting and beset by a global scandal over clerical sex abuse of children and decades of cover-ups.\n\nHe promised an end to impunity and changed Vatican law to help tackle abuse, though victims said he could have gone further.\n\nMore widely, he initiated a major shake-up of the Vaticans powerful governing body, including improving financial responsibility and allowing lay Catholics to lead Vatican offices.\n\nThroughout his papacy, Francis championed the poor and vulnerable and emphasised love over doctrine.\n\nIf someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him? he said at the start of his papacy.\n\nHowever, his detractors accused him of failing to uphold established Church doctrine, and his final months were marked by increasingly outspoken attacks by senior cardinals.\n\nTensions with conservative Catholics marked the Synod congress that met at the Vatican at the end of 2023, part of a years-long global consultation on the future of the church  that Francis now leaves unfinished.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature, and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back, Mr. Madzima. This week, we want to discuss the recent enactment of the Private Voluntary Organisations Amendment Act 2025, which came into effect on 11 April 2025. Who is affected by the amendments, and what was the motivation for the amendments?\n\nVM: The amendments introduced will significantly affect how private voluntary organisations operate going forward. By private voluntary organisations, I am referring mainly to non-governmental organisations and charities, whether they are local, grassroots organisations or they are international organisations with a local presence. As long as these organisations receive donor funding or contributions, they are likely to fall within the purview or ambit of the Act.\n\nThe amendments were motivated mainly by the requirement to curb terrorist financing and money laundering through non-governmental organisations and charities. This has also seen the inclusion of words like financing the production of weapons of mass destruction being included in the amendment Act. These amendments, in an attempt to curb this, have introduced significant restrictive changes to how PVOs are regulated and increased government oversight.\n\nReporter:What are the significant measures introduced by the amendments?\n\nVM: The private voluntary organisations are now subject to anti-money laundering and counter terrorism risk assessments from the Financial Action Taskforce. Being subject to the Financial Action Task Force requires, among other things, that the organisation declare its beneficial owners. For purposes of clarity, beneficial owners include persons or organisations that have a major interest in the PVO and or have directly or indirectly significant sway in the operations of the PVO.\n\nThe new law requires Private Voluntary Organisations to be transparent about donors and donations. The money donated to it is to be used for the stated purposes in the PVOs objectives. This may assist in curbing the misuse of funding.\n\nThe amendments also ban PVOs from being involved in politics, they cannot support or be affiliated with political parties or candidates, nor fund them. Limitations and directions for non-partisan assistance have been included in the amendments.\n\nFurther, the amendments have banned discrimination against potential beneficiaries on the basis of political affiliation or to make the benefit to the potential beneficiary contingent upon political affiliation.\n\nTo achieve all this, the Registrar for private voluntary organisations has been empowered to impose civil penalties in addition to the criminal penalties imposed by the Act where there is contravention of the Act.\n\nReporter: So does this law only apply to new registrations of Private Voluntary Organisations?\n\nVM: The amendments require that existing charities or charitable entities that fall within the purview of the Act to re-register as Private Voluntary organisations within 90 days of the coming into law of the Amendment Act. Among the general information normally required with the registration of such entities, there is a further requirement to submit the beneficial ownership of the organisation.\n\nReporter: Have the amendments affected the general registration processes for PVOs?\n\nVM: Qualifying organisations are required to register as Private Voluntary Organisations within 30 days of commencing operations. The amendments have empowered the Registrar for private voluntary organisations to consider such applications, be it for registration, cancellation or amendment. Long and short, the granting of the application rests solely with the Registrar.\n\nOrganisations or persons that collect contributions or funding from the public and are not registered may be subject to imprisonment or a fine. The Registrar has been empowered to issue a written 30-day notice to an existing trust to register as a PVO should the Registrar believe that the operations of the trust are in contravention of the law in that they fall within the scope of the Act.\n\nReporter: It appears the powers of the Registrar have been extended. Is there an appeal process available for the PVOs?\n\nVM: Yes, there is an appeal process. First, the decision of the board is considered by the Minister on appeal. The Minister will consider, among other things, whether there was bias or gross misconduct in the decision-making process. Should the appealing party remain aggrieved following the Ministers determination on appeal, then the aggrieved party may further appeal to the Administrative Court.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima. We have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

It amounted to little more than a stay-away, punctuated by a few isolated flash demonstrations in the capital.\n\nIn a press briefing yesterday, Muswere implored Zimbabweans to remain united and pay no heed to Gezas shutdown appeals.\n\nWe must remain united against cyber terrorism and enemies of progress. We have a responsibility to build our country. Zimbabweans should utilise the internet for development.\n\nWe should continue to ignore calls from unproductive charlatans and merchants of falsehoods who seek to reverse the gains of the liberation struggle through demonisation of Zimbabwes image, its people and leadership through misinformation and malice, he said.\n\nIn his Saturday night address, delivered from an undisclosed location, Geza, who was wearing military garb, called on Zimbabweans to stay at home in protest against Mnangagwas misrule.\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, the 22nd and 23rd of April 2025, everyone must stay home. We must shut down Zimbabwe completely. This is to send a strong message to Mnangagwa and his zvigananda.\n\nShops and industries will not open and kombis will be parked. The police will not tear gas you, but if they ever come to you, you have the right to defend yourselves, Geza said.\n\nThe ex-combatant, who has been on the police wanted list since early February, also assured the 95 protesters arrested March 31 in Harare, and Heart and Soul Television and Radio (HSTV) journalist Blessed Mhlanga, that they will be released from prison soon.\n\nGeza told Zimbabweans that the writing is on the wall, claiming that Mnangagwa will soon be out of office.\n\nAddressing delegates at the 45th Independence celebration in Gokwe last Friday, Mnangagwa, without naming Geza directly, urged Zimbabweans to ignore instigators on social media, which Geza has been using to communicate with the public.\n\n",

We value this, said a tourist after arriving in Victoria Falls.\n\nAlthough no fatalities were recorded, eight people, seven of them foreigners, were admitted in Gwanda and Bulawayo.\n\nAbsence of the train, whose repair was said to be on course, meant tourists had to continue using other means to Victoria Falls, with the road being governments initial plan.\n\nTourism Minister Barbara Rwodzi and Bulawayo Minister of State Judith Ncube both rushed to visit the injured tourists at Roman Catholic run private hospital Mater Dei in Bulawayo and Gwanda.\n\nThe two also toured the accident scene.\n\nGovernment, which has constantly been accused of ignoring the road, has reportedly engaged eight contractors to work on the 435km highway.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHIGH Court judge Justice Esther Muremba has finally released her detailed judgement in the case of a Chinese national jailed 30 years for killing a miner in Zhombe and also for attempted murder and assault.\n\nCai Yulong was slapped with a 20-year jail term in September last year, but the judge issued an extempore ruling.\n\nYulong, the owner of Stone Steel Mine also known as Blue Mine in Zhombe, fatally shot Goni Goni after accusing him and his colleagues of encroaching into his mine on May 24 last year.\n\nHe also attempted to kill John Muchawaya Bera by shooting him once on the right knee and once on the left thigh, before he unlawfully struck Lovemore Mapfanya with a clenched fist.\n\nHe was convicted on all counts.\n\nYulong, who was in the country on a Temporary Work Permit, had pleaded not guilty to all the charges.\n\nIn his defence, the accused did not dispute shooting the deceased in the murder charge and the complainant in the attempted murder charge.\n\nHe claimed that his actions were in self-defence and in defence of his property.\n\nRegarding the assault charge, the accused stated that it was fabricated.\n\nHowever, the court ruled that his defence was weak.\n\nThe court heard that on the fateful day, the deceased, the complainant and their colleagues who were employed by Blackhand 10 Mine were working underground erecting the barricade.\n\nIt was heard the accused entered his mine using his shaft and proceeded to the intersection between the two mines. A confrontation ensued between the accused and the Blackhand 10 Mine workers, during which the accused shot at them.\n\nIn her ruling, Muremba said there was no justification for what Yulong did.\n\nIn this case, the offence of murder is further aggravated by the fact that the accused shot the deceased and his colleagues as they were fleeing for their lives.\n\nEven if it were accepted that the deceased and his colleagues were illegally panning for gold in the accuseds mine, the accused had no right to shoot them while they were running away.\n\nThe sanctity of human life must be upheld, and the accuseds actions demonstrate a cold-blooded killing.\n\nThe accused intentionally killed the deceased, and the deceaseds father provided a victim impact statement indicating the profound trauma caused by his sons death.\n\nThe father, who had expected his 23-year-old son to marry and provide him with grandchildren, was devastated by the unnatural and violent nature of his death, she said.\n\nThe judge also said the deceased was also the breadwinner for his family, and his loss has left them facing significant financial and emotional challenges.\n\nThe father had expressed a desire for the death penalty to be imposed, while the State has prayed for a sentence of 40 years imprisonment.\n\nIn relation to the charge of attempted murder, the accused used a firearm to shoot the complainant twice in both legs, causing serious injuries.\n\nWhen he was shooting the complainant, he was actually holding his legs to make sure that he would not escape.\n\nWhilst the doctors report states that there will not be permanent injury, we noted that the complainant was still walking with the aid of crutches when he came to court to testify, the judge said.\n\nDuring trial his right leg was still in plaster.\n\nThe complainant was shot while running away, and the victim impact statement reveals the profound pain and trauma he has endured.\n\nHe lost a workmate during the shooting and remains deeply affected by the incident. He is still nursing his injuries and is unable to provide for his family as the breadwinner.\n\nThe complainant has no hope of returning to the mining industry due to his inability to perform heavy duties, the judge noted.\n\nThe judge said the statutory penalty for attempted murder committed in aggravating circumstances is 20 years imprisonment up to death.\n\nShe said the presumptive penalty for attempted murder committed under such circumstances is five years imprisonment, but given the severity of the offence, a higher penalty is warranted.\n\nThe accused exhibited a high degree of cruelty by holding the complainant with one hand while shooting him in the back of his legs, completely disabling him from walking.\n\nThe court agrees with the States submission for a sentence of 10 years imprisonment.\n\nHowever, to avoid an excessive overall sentence, five years of this sentence will be suspended for five years on the condition that the accused does not commit an offence involving violence on the person of another during this period, she said.\n\nShe said the effective sentence for attempted murder will be five years imprisonment, which we will order to run concurrently with the sentence for murder.\n\nFor the first count Yulong was jailed 30 years.\n\nFor count two, he was jailed 10 years imprisonment of which five years imprisonment was suspended for 5 years on condition the accused does not within that period commit an offence involving violence on the person of another and for which upon conviction he is sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine.\n\nHe effectively sentenced to five years for the count.\n\nThis effective sentence of five years imprisonment will run concurrently with the sentence for murder.\n\nFor assault, Yulomg was fined US$100 in default of payment he will serve one month imprisonment.\n\n",
