            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court on Monday reserved its ruling after Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) journalist Blessed Mhlanga appealed against a lower courts decision to deny him bail in a case he is accused of transmitting messages inciting public violence.\n\nMhlanga was arrested three weeks ago with the State alleging that he published videos recorded at a press conference held by war veteran Blessed Geza who is opposing an extension of President Mnangagwas tenure.\n\nHe was denied bail by Harare magistrate Farai Gwitima who ruled that he was likely to interfere with witnesses if granted bail.\n\nAggrieved, he took the matter up to the High Court arguing that the lower court erred in denying him bail.\n\nThe accused has given a sensible or plausible defence. At this stage, the accused is entitled to be heard in respect of allegations against him and the defence he deposed, his lawyer Chris Mhike told High Court Judge Gibson Mandaza.\n\nHe was not present at that press conference and has nothing to do with what was said at that press conference.\n\nSecondly he did not transmit what was uttered at that less conference because he is not HSTV.\n\nHe also admits that on YouTube, the ownership of the video was attributed to HSTV. He makes it clear that he is not HSTV. Therefore with these common cause factors, it is difficult to comprehend why the state would in the first place arrest the accused and thereafter allege it has a strong case.\n\nThis case is based on a lie. The lie that my client is HSTV. HSTV is the owner of the content and broadcasts the content.\n\nThe State suggests that the transmission of that relevant video is an uncontroverted fact.\n\nBut the question is who transmitted the videos. It would be unfair to conclude that because the videos were concluded, it was the appellant who transmitted the videos.\n\nIt is not even alleged by the state that the video recordings show the appellant broadcasting or transmitting the videos, Mhike said.\n\nMhike added that the state did not say that Mhlanga was seen sitting on a computer transmitting the video.\n\nThere is no evidence for this and therefore, the state did not give compelling reasons to deny the appellant bail.\n\nMhike also said the words which were quoted as the broadcasted messages were not uttered by Mhlanga but Geza.\n\nIt cannot be a compelling reason to say he is the one who transmitted the words. There is no logical link between my client and the words quoted by the State saying it was words which are inciting violence.\n\nMhike said his client was being punished for something he did not do.\n\nThe onus to prove a strong case is on the state.\n\nThe record of proceedings in the court aquo makes it clear that the video does not pin his presence at the press conference or that he broadcast the press conference. It is clear the arrest was baseless, Mhike said.\n\nMhike said Mhlanga did not challenge remand as it would have prejudiced him by staying in jail for over two weeks.\n\nSo he reluctantly subjected himself to bail proceedings, Mhike said.\n\nThe vast of accused persons are on bail while on remand, why is my client being denied the same when thousands of suspects are on bail?\n\nPlacement on remand is not a conviction. This offence is not scheduled as a serious offence. It is a finable offence.\n\nWhere a fine can be imposed the court should lean in favour of granting bail, Mhike said.\n\nThe magistrate erred by ignoring that the witnesses were not named. How can one interfere with an unknown witness?\n\nThere was no evidence that if the appellant continues to work, he will threaten the security of this nation.\n\nThere is no basis for asserting that the appellant before you would undermine public order or peace and security, he added.\n\nThe offence under review is not a scheduled offence so the magistrate erred in denying the appellant bail on rounds that his release will threaten peace and security in the country.\n\nThe magistrate also made other errors which constitute unfairness in his determination.\n\nThere was no evaluation of other factors such as the appellants cooperation with the police, the act that he presented himself to the police, he flew in from Lusaka specifically to deal with reports that the police wanted to interview him. The magistrate totally ignored that.\n\nFungai Nyahunzvi representing the state said the prosecution abides by its written submissions.\n\nHe said Mhlanga transmitted the messages.\n\nWe did not say he generated the message. For example, if one forwards nude images he will be committing an offence of transmission.\n\nWe are not saying he authored the uttered messages. We are saying he transmitted the messages.\n\nWe are told that challenging placement on remand would have prejudiced the appellant but we dont why this is being said. Thats why courts sit, he said.\n\nWhen you look at the reasons why the accused was denied bail you will see that his case is different from other accused persons. The issue is not that he is a flight risk, we are saying he will interfere with witnesses.\n\nNyahunzvi also said it cannot be contested that Mhlanga is not a senior journalist at HSTV.\n\nThe prosecutor said because of his seniority he was likely to interfere with witnesses who are his subordinates.\n\nBecause he is a presidential correspondent. You cannot have a junior coming from college being assigned as a presidential reporter.\n\nWe still abide by submissions we forwarded to the court, Nyahunzvi added.\n\nThe presiding judge said he will need time to go through the submissions.\n\nQuite a lot of submissions have been made. As soon as Im ready I will put a notice on IECMS, I might put a date and advise parties when to come. It will just be a few days.\n\n",

            "content": "By Nqoba M Sibenke\n\nOne of the most beautiful yet challenging seasons of life is pregnancy. There are so many mental health challenges that come with the pre and post-natal seasons. In this article, we explore Postnatal Depression. The DSM-V identifies this disorder as a major depressive disorder with peripartum onset. It falls under depressive disorders and is commonly referred to as Postpartum Disorder (PPD).\n\nThere are many risks associated with PPD, including demographic risk factors, obstetric and medical risk factors, psychological and social risk factors, hormonal and neurobiological risk factors and other risk factors.\n\nWomen under 20 or over 35 years old are highly likely to experience PPD. This is due to age-related constraints in pregnancy and childbirth. It is also likely that women from low-income societies or those with limited education may suffer from PPD. Marital status during the pregnancy also contributes to PPD.\n\nObstetric and Medical Risk Factors also have an influence. If one has a history of depression or anxiety, they might suffer from PPD. Previous traumatic birth experience or complicated delivery also creates risk. Psychological and social risk factors include a lack of social support from family, friends, or a partner. Stressful life events such as moving, job change, or loss of a loved one contribute to PPD.\n\nPrevious traumatic experiences, such as abuse or neglect, can pre-expose women to PPD. Some personality traits, for example, perfectionistic or high-achieving personality traits, are also more inclined towards PPD.\n\nThere are also hormonal and neurobiological risk factors. These include significant hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy and postpartum, Thyroid dysfunction and Neurotransmitter imbalance. Other risk factors include previous substance abuse or addiction, women who have experienced PPD in a previous pregnancy and women with a family history of depression or anxiety.\n\nEmotional symptoms include persistent feelings of sadness, mood swings, apathy, guilt or shame, and anxiety. Physical symptoms are fatigue, change in appetite increase or decrease in eating, sleep disturbances, digestive issues, and pain eg headaches, joint aches, etc.\n\nPPD can be treated through medication, psychotherapy and social interventions. Psychological interventions include Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which helps women identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. Psychodynamic therapy explores the emotional and psychological factors contributing to PPD. These can be administered by qualified psychologists. Medications such as antidepressants and mood stabilizers can be prescribed by psychiatrists.\n\nSocial Support Interventions like Peer Support Groups connect women with others who have experienced PPD. Partner support educates partners on how to support their loved ones. Family Therapy Involves the entire family in the healing process.\n\nRemember to take care of your loved ones as they experience this life-changing season. Womens health affects the health of their children and families. It is critical to safeguard them.\n\nNqoba Sibenke is registered with AHPCZ as an intern Counselling Psychologist and can be reached atnqoba.sibenke@icloud.com\n\n",

How much loving care illuminates the rooms, the corridors, the clinics, the places where the humblest services are performed! he said.\n\nFrancis is being cared for on the 10th floor of the hospital, home to a special papal suite including a chapel.\n\nAt the entrance of the hospital Sunday morning, dozens of children from a Catholic scout group called out Pope Francis, Pope Francis, as they held yellow and white balloons.\n\nI know that many children are praying for me; some of them came here today to Gemelli as a sign of closeness, Francis wrote in his message.\n\nThank you, dearest children!

GCVSA further claims the former Presidential Advisor is a double agent.\n\nThe GCVSA is aware of a recent military intelligence dossier linking Mutsvangwa to espionage activities involving hostile foreign powers, reads the statement signed by the organisations Secretary General Ntokozo Msipha.\n\nThis intelligence confirms what many have long suspectedMutsvangwa is not merely a loudmouth but an active saboteur working to weaken Zimbabwe from within.\n\nHis attacks on General Chiwenga are not personal but part of a broader scheme dictated by those who seek to install puppets in positions of power while eliminating true patriots.\n\nHis masters have sent him on a mission: to undermine the military, to spread falsehoods about national heroes, and to confuse the people with propaganda so that the 2030 succession project can be smoothly implemented.\n\nWe say to him and his handlers: we see you, we know your plans, and you will not succeed.\n\nAn audio recording of Mutsvangwa describing Chiwenga as unelectable, cruel and illiterate was published in an investigation by United Kingdom-based Dug Up, last week.\n\nMutsvangwa highlighted the plight of Chiwengas ex-wife Marry as one of the reasons the former general should not be anywhere near power, a position that falls in line with Mnangagwas 2030 agenda.\n\nCertain sections within Zanu PF want Mnangagwa to hold onto power beyond his 2028 mandate.\n\nSurprisingly, Mutsvangwa, who is now in the cross hairs of the Chiwenga faction, played a central role in the coup that toppled late President Robert Mugabe and installed both Mnangagwa and Chiwenga.\n\nThe people of Zimbabwe are not blind. They see through your deception, Chris Mutsvangwa. You are not a kingmaker. You are not a revolutionary. You are a political scavenger, feeding on the scraps left behind by real leaders.\n\nYour name will be remembered not among the liberators but among the traitors who sold their souls for thirty pieces of silver.\n\nWe issue this final warning: Zimbabwe will not be destabilised by cowards, mercenaries, and political prostitutes masquerading as nationalists. The revolution will not be hijacked.\n\n",

The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. We understand you will be part of the team that will be presenting at theZim Diaspora Property Showcase USA-Canadain Dallas, United States of America, on legal issues affecting diasporansin America and Canada when investing in Zimbabwe. What are we to expect?\n\nVM: Firstly, allow me to thank Seeff Zimbabwe for coming up with the idea of this event and executing it. The exchange of ideas at such events is invaluable.\n\nOur experience in Birmingham, United Kingdom, at the Zim Diaspora Property Showcase UK in July last year taught us that the diaspora property market is hungry for one-on-one interactions with the potential Zimbabwe service provider, specifically those in the real estate sector where most of their investments are housed. This allows for a better understanding of each others operating models.\n\nI am sure my colleagues in the real estate sector of Zimbabwe are preparing something special for the USA and Canada markets at this particular showcase. The attendees will be able to access special deals prepared specifically for the showcase, including structured payment options that the diaspora market normally fails to get access to.\n\nReporter:Are you suggesting that they will be specific deals prepared only for the USA-Canada diaspora market?\n\nVM: Yes.The property showcase is not just to showcase our real estate to the diaspora, it is also to expose the diaspora market to our Zimbabwean businesses. It will be negligent as a business person to use a one size fits all approach in all dealings with the local and various markets in the diaspora.\n\nThe attendees from Zimbabwe will also be using it as a fact  finding conference, to understand the market from that part of the world, their interests, considerations and concerns when investing with the aim to tailor make products that are attractive to that market, taking into consideration their specific needs for a mutually beneficial relationship going forward.\n\nMy understanding is that the organizers of the event will also be intentionally exposing the Zimbabwean real estate businesses to the Dallas real estate sector. It is anticipated that sufficient synergies and networks will be created from that exchange.\n\nREAD MORE: The Premier Zimbabwe Diaspora Property Showcase is coming to the USA!\n\nReporter: What can we expect from your presentation on legal issues affecting property investments?\n\nVM: My mandate at the conference is to educate potential investors on the Zimbabwean legal framework, specifically when it comes to investing in the real estate sector. My presentation will cover a variety of issues, example, the property titles that are in Zimbabwe, how to conduct a due diligence on the various property titles, other legal issues that affect your investment in Zimbabwe, if a member of the diaspora, issues to do with Zimbabwe registered marriages, death et cetera.\n\nIf the investors are foreign, we will also discuss the property investment regulatory framework with the aim of ensuring that the investments are safe and protected and also that the investor is able to repatriate capital and profits on disinvestment.\n\nReporter: Will that include how to avoid being duped when investing in property from the diaspora?\n\nVM: That will be one of the topics in the presentation. The overarching aim of the presentation is to safeguard potential buyers against fraudsters. Our economy is in transition, with a lot of real estate developments mushrooming across our cities. There are notable and significant gains in value on existing real estate as a result of this real estate development boom. This creates a lot of opportunities for investors and also fraudsters.\n\nOur local property developers have also been creative in their fundraising initiatives to complete developments when access to mainstream finance is limited. This, however, motivates for thorough due diligence by professionals to ensure that the development financial and legal structures are sound and also that the investor is sufficiently protected.\n\nReporter: How do you engage a lawyer from the diaspora and track your property transaction?\n\nVM: Most of our lawyers across Zimbabwe can be found online if the investor cannot get a lawyer by reference. If in doubt of the lawyers track record, our Law Society of Zimbabwe is available to assist people with various enquiries on the legal practitioners in Zimbabwe.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have to end here because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\nFor those looking to attend the Zim Diaspora Property Showcase USA-Canada, please sign up by connecting with the event organizers atwww.zimpropertyshowcaseusa.com.\n\n",

We are exercising our right to hold the government accountable for the economic meltdown, which has deprived citizens of economic freedom, reads the letter.\n\nThe letter was signed by the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA) chairman Ethan Matibela.\n\nRecently, the war veterans held a press conference calling for President Mnangagwa to step down immediately, accusing him of failure.\n\nThis followed recent demands by expelled Zanu PF Central Committee member Blessed Geza, a vocal critic of Mnangagwa, who insisted that the President must step aside due to his poor leadership.\n\nGeza is currently in hiding after police launched a manhunt for him over four criminal charges, including undermining the authority of the President and inciting public violence.\n\n",

            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nZIMBABWE has recorded 124 confirmed cases of cholera since the latest outbreak started in November last year, Minister of Health and Child Care Douglas Mombeshora said on Friday.\n\nAddressing a press conference in the national capital of Harare, Mombeshora said Zimbabwe has registered 15 confirmed deaths, 608 suspected cases, and 566 recoveries.\n\nSix out of the countrys 10 provinces have been affected, with the bulk of recent cases reported in Mashonaland Central Province, the minister noted.\n\nAccording to Mombeshora, most cases were identified among artisanal miners along the Mazowe River and the small farming town of Glendale in Mashonaland Central Province.\n\nArtisanal miners move from place to place and as they move, they also spread cholera. As a result, we have seen the persistence of cases coming up from Mashonaland Central Province, especially along the Mazowe River where a lot of gold panning is taking place, he said.\n\nWe are looking at the possibility of getting more vaccines because our stocks have run out. We now have about 4,000 doses only left, which are not enough to deal with the affected areas, the health minister added.\n\nMombeshora also revealed that recurring cholera outbreaks continued to hit Zimbabwe, primarily driven by a lack of sustainable water and sanitation infrastructure.\n\n",
