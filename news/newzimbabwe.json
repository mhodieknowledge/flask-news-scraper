            "content": "By IOL\n\nIT was a dream return home for South Africas world champion Nkosi Ndebele.\n\nOn Saturday night, at the Grand Arena in Goodwood, Cape Town, the former BRAVE CF Bantamweight champion competed in Mzansi for the first time in seven years  and delivered the ultimate homecoming performance.Ndebele featured on the historic PFL Africa card at GrandWest Casino and Entertainment World, where passionate South African MMA fans were treated to a world-class night of action.Fighting in the inaugural PFL Africa tournament, Ndebele (9-3) wasted no time advancing to the semi-finals of the bantamweight knockout competition. He stopped Egyptian opponent Mahmoud Atef (5-3) via TKO (strikes) with just 10 seconds remaining in the opening round.Im feeling great  what an experience to fight in front of my home crowd, my people, friends and family after all these years, said Ndebele, who last fought on South African soil at BRAVE CF 19 in 2018 before forging an international career with the Bahrain-based promotion.I know a lot of people didnt know who Nkosi is. Im just glad they got to see a glimpse of it today. This is only the beginning. That crowd reaction was something else. These are the moments I dream of.When I was backstage, I told my corner, Let me enjoy this moment. I visualise things like this  a huge crowd, and me being happy, and going crazy.To experience that and connect with the fans I just wanted to connect with them more. This is the first time Ive ever experienced such a crowd, a packed arena, a sold-out venue.Ndebele looked composed from the first bell, controlling every aspect of the fight inside the PFL SmartCage. Atef lacked the firepower to trouble the South African and became increasingly hesitant as the strikes piled up.Even when the Egyptian attempted to grapple, Ndebele stayed composed, expertly managing the exchanges with calculated movement, breath control, and positional dominance.Eventually, Ndebele dragged Atef to the canvas and unleashed a flurry of strikes to the body and head. The referee was left with no choice but to wave it off with 10 seconds left in the first round, triggering wild celebrations as chants of Nkosi rang out across the arena.This is only the beginning. More spectacular victories are coming! said a jubilant Ndebele. I am meant for greatness, and this journey with PFL Africa is the path to that greatness.The PFLs African tournament will span four events across the continent in 2024. The new PFL Africa franchise forms part of the organisations global expansion and features 32 fighters from 15 African nations, all competing across four divisions for the inaugural PFL Africa title and a shot at greater opportunities within the PFL system.Saturdays show also included the PFL Champions Series: Road to Dubai card, featuring some of the worlds top MMA talent. Global stars AJ McKee, Corey Anderson, Dakota Ditcheva, Johnny Eblen, Takeshi Izumi, Akhmed Magomedov, and Costello van Steenis all featured under the Grand Arenas bright lights.Following the nights results, the semi-final matchups in the bantamweight division will see Ndebele face Zimbabwes unbeaten Simbarashe Hokonya (6-0), while Boule Godogo (4-0) takes on Karim Henniene (5-0).Saturdays event also hosted the opening round of the heavyweight bracket.

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nZIMBABWES largest referral hospital, Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, is operating with just a single Intensive Care Unit (ICU) catering for patients from various wards at institution.\n\nThis is happening at a time when around 4,500 children are born yearly with congenital heart defects that require open heart surgery while the nation has a waiting list of up to 600 adults suffering from rheumatic heart disease, who also need to undergo the same procedure.In addition, the hospital, which handles critical medical cases from across the country, lacks a dedicated cardiothoracic ICU, severely limiting its capacity to perform life saving surgeries on a regular basis.Besides patients requiring open heart surgeries, all other life-threatening illnesses are dealt with in the same single ICU.Speaking to NewZimbabwe.com, specialist cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon Dr. Simukayi Machawira bemoaned lack of trained personnel and resources saying they were limiting the rate at which the life-saving surgeries must be done.At the moment at Parirenyatwa we just have one ICU that addresses the whole hospital, not just cardiothoracic.Ideally, we should have an independent cardiothoracic ICU with 10 beds, then that way we can operate everyday without any impediment.So, this is what we are working towards, we want a fully functional unit, Machawira said.The situation is further worsened by a dire shortage of specialised staff, with the hospital currently relying on only one trained perfusionist, a critical member of the surgical team responsible for operating heart-lung machines during open-heart procedures.We still have one perfusionist, I am happy to say we have secured training for two perfusionists in Tanzania, hopefully we will get a training opportunity for another one in Kenya. Once we have five or six we will be able to embark on a larger programme and also train our own perfusionists locally, Machawira said.From June 2023 to date, Parirenyatwa Hospital has performed around 55 open heart surgeries.The situation at the referral hospital reflects the state of all public health institutions in Zimbabwe, if not worse and these are the hospitals on which poor people rely.President Emmerson Mnangagwas government has long neglected general hospitals, which now face crumbling infrastructure, shortages of equipment and medicines, and a critical staff shortage due to brain drain occasioned by meagre salaries and poor working conditions.\n\nThis is happening at a time when around 4,500 children are born yearly with congenital heart defects that require open heart surgery while the nation has a waiting list of up to 600 adults suffering from rheumatic heart disease, who also need to undergo the same procedure.\n\nIn addition, the hospital, which handles critical medical cases from across the country, lacks a dedicated cardiothoracic ICU, severely limiting its capacity to perform life saving surgeries on a regular basis.Besides patients requiring open heart surgeries, all other life-threatening illnesses are dealt with in the same single ICU.Speaking to NewZimbabwe.com, specialist cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon Dr. Simukayi Machawira bemoaned lack of trained personnel and resources saying they were limiting the rate at which the life-saving surgeries must be done.At the moment at Parirenyatwa we just have one ICU that addresses the whole hospital, not just cardiothoracic.Ideally, we should have an independent cardiothoracic ICU with 10 beds, then that way we can operate everyday without any impediment.So, this is what we are working towards, we want a fully functional unit, Machawira said.The situation is further worsened by a dire shortage of specialised staff, with the hospital currently relying on only one trained perfusionist, a critical member of the surgical team responsible for operating heart-lung machines during open-heart procedures.We still have one perfusionist, I am happy to say we have secured training for two perfusionists in Tanzania, hopefully we will get a training opportunity for another one in Kenya.
