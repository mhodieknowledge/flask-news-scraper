            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nTHE United States of America (USA) has introduced a Bill that seeks to repeal a sanctions law that has been blamed for Zimbabwes almost three-decade-long economic meltdown.\n\nZimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZIDERA), passed in 2001, not only imposed restrictions on Americas support for Zimbabwe but also ceased further financing from International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank which at that time were owed billions.\n\nThe State Policy Provisions Bill, introduced by Brian Mast in the House of Representatives, will unlock funding from the IMF and other global financiers on condition Zimbabwe clears its yesteryear arrears within a year.\n\nIn General- the (ZEDERA Act), as amended, Public Law 107-99 (115 Statute 962) is hereby repealed, reads Section 303 of the Bill.\n\nA number of senior Zanu PF members, including Ignatius Chombo and former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor Gideon Gono, who were on Americas sanctions list were removed in the past five years as a lead-up to the suggested repeal of ZDERA.\n\nLast year March, then US President Joe Biden terminated the Zimbabwe sanctions programme and unblocked more individuals and entities that had been barred by America.\n\nAccording to the African Mining Indaba, the USA is recalibrating its relationship with Africa in light of increased Chinese influence on the continent.\n\nGrowing anti-West sentiments and the race for rare earth minerals, abundant in Africa, and necessary to drive the ongoing technological revolution, has, according to the review paper, forced America to rethink its punitive approach of dealing with rogue states such as Zimbabwe.\n\nAfricas critical minerals are at the heart of an economic and strategic battle between the US. and China, reads a report by African Mining Indaba.\n\nWhile China maintains a dominant position through infrastructure investments, refining capabilities, and long-standing agreements, the US. is making efforts to provide alternative investment approaches.\n\nThe outcome of this competition will shape global supply chains, the clean energy transition, and Africas economic future. Ultimately, how African nations navigate this geopolitical rivalry will determine the long-term benefits they derive from their mineral wealth.\n\nZIDERAs enactment was used by Zanu PF as an excuse for poor administration, sharp rise in corruption within top government offices and general decline of standards.\n\nAmerica was blamed for everything, from a shortage of drugs in hospital to basic failures that were not affected by travel or trade restrictions imposed on individuals within the party or companies reported to have been supporting the disregard of human rights in Zimbabwe such as the Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI).\n\nVice President Constantino Chiwenga, last year claimed that Zimbabwe had lost over $150 billion because of sanctions imposed by the European Union (EU) and America.\n\nIts repeal will, hence, be taken as a win by the ruling party which has been campaigning for its repeal for over 15 years. President Emmerson Mnangagwa went as far as declaring October 25, a holiday, reserving the day for calls to repeal ZIDERA.\n\nSome party members have even been staying in plastic tents outside Americas Embassy in Harare, in protest to the sanctions.\n\n",

            "content": "UAB News\n\nPeople are running. Running to exercise. Running to socialize. Running to achieve personal goals with every mile completed.\n\nWhen all one needs is a good pair of shoes, running seems like an easy activity to start. However, running requires preparation and training, both physically and mentally.\n\nAn avid runner herself, Camille Worthington, Ph.D., assistant professor and registered dietitian in theUniversity of Alabama at BirminghamDivision of General Internal Medicine and Population Science,discusses an important aspect to ones running success  how to fuel the body.\n\nWhen fueling your body, it is easy to fall behind and hard to catch up, Worthington said. However, proper fueling before, during and after a run is essential to hitting your goals while keeping your body safe and healthy.\n\nProper fueling before, during and after running is essential to hitting goals and keeping your body safe and healthy.\n\nKnow your fuels\n\nComplex carbohydrates have slow digestion and absorption rates. They are a good source for sustained energy, which is needed for longer runs. Complex carbs include whole wheat breads, whole grain crackers and vegetables.\n\nSimple carbs are quickly digested and absorbed. They are sources of quick but short-term energy, which is beneficial during runs when one needs an energy boost. Simple carbs include pasta, white bread, chips, cookies and candy.\n\nProtein offers many benefits for the body. For runners, it plays a crucial role in muscle recovery and helps reduce hunger. Proteins include lean meats, dairy products, eggs, yogurt and nuts.\n\nElectrolytes, such as sodium,help maintain fluid and hydration levels in the body. Electrolytes are lost through sweat during exercise. Low levels can lead to muscle cramps, dehydration and dizziness. Electrolytes are naturally found in such foods as leafy greens, avocados, pickles, nuts and bananas.\n\nProducts such as gels, gummies, water, electrolyte packets, bars and salt tabs are popular fuel sources for runners. They often contain higher concentrations of carbs and electrolytes, such as sodium.\n\nTime it out\n\nProperly timing the intake of the fuels is as important as knowing what fuels to consume, Worthington says.\n\nFuel recommendations prior to a run depend on when one wants to eat. If you eat several hours before, focus on a mix of complex and simple carbs to increase different types of energy within the body. If you prefer eating closer to the run, prioritize simple carbs the body can quickly digest.\n\nStay hydrated with water before the run. For runs longer than an hour or in hot weather, preload with electrolytes.\n\nDuring a run, focus on simple carbs for bursts of energy. Complex carbs during a run can lead to sluggishness and gastrointestinal issues due to their slow digestion rate. Maintaining hydration levels with water, electrolytes and sodium is also a priority.\n\nStay hydrated with water before the run.\n\nFor runs longer than an hour or in hot weather, preload with electrolytes.After a run, mix complex carbs with protein. The carbs restore glucose stores in your liver and muscles that were used during your run. Protein helps with muscle recovery and can satiate hunger. Replenish hydration levels with electrolytes and water.\n\nWorthington suggests post-run snacks such as:\n\nUltimately, the perfect fuel routine comes down to the runners preference. When experimenting, Worthington suggests changing only one fuel source at a time to understand what specific foods and products work best with ones body.\n\nIt is a lot of trial and error. Worry less about the specific product, and more about the fuel source and ingredients, Worthington said. Find what you like, what makes sense for your body and training, and what works best for your budget.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTanganda Tea Company Limited has reported a 65% surge in revenue for the third quarter ended June 30, 2025, though the company continues to grapple with lower export volumes, adverse weather conditions, and exchange rate disparities.\n\nRevenue for the quarter stood at US$5.6 million, up from US$3.4 million recorded during the same period last year. However, cumulative earnings for the nine months to June 2025 fell 6% to US$13.7 million, compared to US$14.5 million in 2024.\n\nThe company attributed the quarterly growth to improved pricing but warned that inconsistent rainfall patterns and persistent currency volatility remain a drag on overall performance.\n\nDuring the period, bulk tea production fell 6% to 6,826 tonnes, down from 7,293 tonnes last year, largely due to late rains. Export volumes declined by 19% to 3,646 tonnes. In contrast, packed tea and coffee sales volumes rose 11% during the quarter, although they were 8% lower than last years total of 1,310 tonnes.\n\nAvocado output dropped 47% to 2,121 tonnes from 3,976 tonnes, following a November 2024 hailstorm and the biennial bearing effect. Macadamia nut harvests also decreased 43% to 849 tonnes due to extreme heat during the nut-set period, though exports of 520 tonnes were 5% higher than the previous year.\n\nThe company said the operating environment remained relatively stable, supported by exchange rate liberalisation, but noted ongoing challenges including weak demand in the formal retail sector, tight liquidity, and intermittent power supply.\n\nManagement confirmed plans to raise US$8 million through a Rights offer to support operations. Future performance, it added, will depend on exchange rate stability, policy coordination, and cost management.\n\n",

            "content": "AFP\n\nThis was the work station for the women, who say their trade turned perilous after US President Donald Trump abruptly cut foreign health aid earlier this year.\n\nOne of them, Sharon Mukakanhanga, reached into her bag and pulled out a pair of baby socks she used when there was nothing else between her and risk.\n\nThese little socks served as condoms when I became so desperate after the American government withdrew its support from my all-time go-to safe haven, the 43-year-old told AFP, referring to her preferred clinic.\n\nMukakanhanga is among thousands of sex workers in Zimbabwe who have struggled to access HIV prevention tools since the US cuts gutted centres that once provided free condoms, antiretrovirals and basic care.\n\nFor nearly two decades, the US programmes including PEPFAR, the worlds largest HIV initiative, formed a critical safety net for Zimbabwes fragile health system.\n\nThe first half of 2025 has seen 5,932 AIDS-related deaths, a rise from 5,712 in the same period last year, according to official government figures.\n\nThe impact of the withdrawals was immediate, said 47-year-old HIV-positive sex worker Cecilia Ruzvidzo.\n\nIt was a very difficult period. I literally lost my mind, said the mother of four who has been in the trade for nearly two decades.\n\nShe recalled leaving her most recent visit to the clinic with only 10 days worth of antiretrovirals.\n\nI could not get condoms, which are a necessity for my work. I was at risk of contracting more infections. My clients were also exposed, she said quickly.\n\nWith US-funded facilities shuttered or empty, the few remaining providers say they are buckling under the pressure.\n\nMedical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which operates independently of US government funding, said its clinics in Harare suburbs like Epworth and Mbare were stretched thin.\n\nThey dont know where to go. They dont know where to seek services, said project lead Charlotte Pignon, referring to patients and especially sex workers.\n\nWhile she did not directly link the rising deaths to the funding cuts, she said the impact of the withdrawal could not be ignored.\n\nIt is difficult to know all the factors that are impacting those numbers but its impossible to say that its not impacted by the US cuts either, she said.\n\nThe scale of the fallout was still coming into focus, said Wonder Mufunda, chief executive of the Harare-headquartered think-tank Centre for Humanitarian Analytics (CHA).\n\nMufunda said US support had previously amounted to about $522 million, with roughly $90 million directed to HIV programmes.\n\nYou wake up and you have lost such funding, there were serious disruptions, he said, warning that deaths could rise.\n\nIts quite a big blow we are talking about, he told AFP.\n\nBeyond overstretched clinics, Zimbabwes economic freefall is pushing more people into sex work with an estimated 40,500 women already engaged in sex work nationwide, according to CHA.\n\nCompetition had eroded the power to insist on safer sex, said 20-year-old Cleopatra Katsande. Some workers were charging as little as 50 US cents per client, far less than the cost of a box of condoms, she said.\n\nFor veteran Ruzvidzo, there was no real choice.\n\nWe knew it wasnt safe, she said of using baby socks as condoms. But I had to feed my children.\n\nThe clients did not seem to mind, she said. When it comes to this moment, men dont think straight.\n\n",

The privatisation of water aligns with neo-liberal policy frameworks that emphasise profit at the expense of equity and accountability.\n\nThe government is trusting market forces over human rights and it is likely a reflection of governments challenge to protect its people and defend equal access to a basic public good. This directly contravenes Section 77 of Zimbabwes Constitution, which guarantees every citizen the right to safe, clean, and potable water, said Jura.\n\nAs of last month, the government indicated that 15,000 households had been fitted with smart meters as part of the pilot project.\n\nHarare City Council has been struggling to provide water, with some areas receiving it only two days a week.\n\nEJWP is lobbying Parliament to stop the privatisation of water and introduce a Water Justice Bill which they say will ensure equal access to communities.\n\nToday, EJWP and representatives of its members are submitting a petition to parliament and a policy brief to respective critical stakeholders in this regard demanding that:\n\nParliament halts water privatisation and passes a Water Justice Bill to enshrine public ownership.\n\nGovernment invests in public and community-managed water systems instead of outsourcing to profit-driven private companies.\n\nA gendered human rights impact assessment is conducted before any water sector reforms are rolled out.\n\nCommunities, especially women and marginalised groups, are meaningfully consulted and included in water governance, said Jura.\n\n",
