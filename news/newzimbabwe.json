            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFORMER Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) president Nelson Chamisa has refuted claims circulating on social media that he has abandoned politics to pursue his education.\n\nChamisa dismissed the social media reports linking him to studies in the United States as sideshows and lies.\n\nWriting on his WhatsApp news channel, The Chamisa News Channel, on Sunday, Chamisa asserted that he is fully aware of the responsibility on his shoulders and that he represents the hope of millions of Zimbabweans who are still yearning for a better-functioning country with opportunities.\n\nFellow Citizens, ignore the sideshows, lies and falsehoods being circulated by our opposition. Stay focused. Im fully aware of the huge responsibility and heavy burden upon my shoulders. And I will never let you down or fall short, Chamisa said.\n\nThe veteran politician-turned-advocate blamed his unnamed political foes, whom he accuses of attempting to arm-twist him into divulging information about his political strategy, almost two years after resigning from the CCC party presidency.\n\nBear in mind that not all strategic decisions are shared openly or with the opposite team. Information is a strategic resource never to be shared recklessly. As for you who believe and support; worry not, fear not, doubt not and more importantly, be confused not.\n\nIn his characteristic style, Chamisa reassured Zimbabweans that better days for the country lie ahead.\n\nBe clear and of good cheer. You will soon appreciate the wisdom of my ways. Victory and success never come cheap. Every action I take, every decision I make, is focused on achieving our great and glorious future for Zimbabwe.\n\nHe insisted that his focus remains on building Zimbabwe.\n\nMy hands are on the deck, my eyes on the vision and mission. The struggle continues, and I remain steadfast, fully committed to the work that cannot pause for idle distractions.\n\nIt is understood that Chamisa is working on a new and soon-to-be-launched political movement, a new vehicle for the 2028 elections, nearly two years after stepping down as CCC party President.\n\nThe opposition activist is also reportedly steering clear of commenting on Zanu-PFs internal succession battles.\n\nHe has been accused on social media of inaction as a politician and a leader that people expect to lead Zimbabwe.\n\nCritics have pointed to what they view as the clerics obsession with scripture, which they claim is the biggest weakness of the former Kuwadzana East MP as a leader.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTreasury has delayed the release of US$27.5 million earmarked for the purchase of cancer machines, leaving Zimbabwes two largest referral hospitals, Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in Harare and Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo, without life-saving equipment for over three years.\n\nHealth and Child Care Minister Douglas Mombeshora told Parliament this week that despite the Health Ministry having completed procurement paperwork and signed contracts with suppliers, Treasury has yet to pay the required deposit.\n\nAs the Health Ministry, we have awarded tenders to two companies for Parirenyatwa and Mpilo hospitals. All in all, we spent US$27.5 million. We submitted to Treasury papers for them to pay the 30% deposit as per the agreement and in accordance with the suppliers instructions. Contracts have since been signed.\n\nIt is now more than two months since we signed the agreements. Therefore, it is now up to the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion to pay for the machines so that they can be installed, said Mombeshora.\n\nHe added that suppliers had promised to install the equipment within 36 weeks, raising hopes that the machines would be operational before the end of the year.\n\nZimbabwe has recorded over 3,000 annual cancer deaths since 2014, according to the National Cancer Registry, with cases of colorectal cancer particularly on the rise. Zaka South MP Clemence Chiduwa raised concern over the lack of facilities for diagnosis.\n\nCancer cases are on the increase and one such cancer is colorectal cancer, which affects people who are mainly above the age of 45. What is the government policy on the prevention and early detection of colon cancer? Do we have any public facilities where we can get colonoscopy services (check-up service for diagnosis)? Chiduwa asked.\n\nMombeshora admitted the health system is under strain. Colon cancer is one of the top cancers in the country, maybe in the top four cancers that are affecting our population, he said.\n\nHe also cited shortages of specialists and diagnostic equipment in district hospitals, noting that government has turned to the Sugar Tax for funding.\n\nAs you may be aware, a Sugar Tax has been introduced to help fund cancer-treating and diagnostic equipment. In Phase 1, we have done tenders for the procurement of treatment equipment and in Phase 2, we are now going to procure diagnostic equipment. Every hospital should have a CT scan, an MRI and an ultrasound scan, Mombeshora said.\n\nOpposition MP for Chiredzi Central, Blessing Ropafadzo Makumire, criticised the delays despite government already collecting the Sugar Tax.\n\nThe Sugar Tax which is supposed to be used for the procurement of cancer machines, started being collected last year in January, yet to date, we have not received any machines that have been procured, which suggests that the government lacks urgency in solving this problem. How long will it take for the government to procure this equipment? What is preventing and causing the delay? Makumire said.\n\nMombeshora responded that US$30.3 million was available as of December 2024 and that procurement would begin with Parirenyatwa and Mpilo, where machines have been down for the past three years.\n\n",
