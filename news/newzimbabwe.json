            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nGOVERNMENT says it is in the process of privatising the provision of public services, including clean potable water, after realising the failure by councils to fulfill their mandates.\n\nAddressing journalists in Harare Monday during a Media Meets Cabinet Ministers interface, Local Government Minister Daniel Garwe said modalities were already underway to regularise the privatisation process.\n\nLast week Friday, we were given the green light to privatise water services. We are now in the process of inviting private sector players, both local and international, to bring proposals, expressions of interest. These are going to be unsolicited bids.\n\nWe want somebody with the capacity to engineer, to procure, to construct and manage the finance. Thats the model that we are working on. Engineering, procurement, construction, management and finance.\n\nThese are unsolicited bids. So, as we speak, weve already received about five expressions of interest from local players and three from international players. So, its work in progress, Garwe said.\n\nHe was hoping that by the end of next week, his ministry would have identified and interviewed all interested players.\n\nBy end of next week, we would have identified the most suitable people that have applied and appointed them, at least signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), and then a Memorandum of Agreement.\n\nWe want by the end of this month to have dealt with the issue of water in Harare, added Garwe.\n\nHe said a lot of purified water was being lost through leakages.\n\nBy the time it reaches a resident, its just a fraction of what has been purified. We are looking at an investor who comes and covers the whole value chain, from purification to distribution to billing and metering.\n\nWe want to move away from the old metre system to digital metre systems, the smart water metering systems. Thats what we are doing, he stated.\n\nGarwe promised that by the end of this month or early February, there will be movement in this regard not in Harare alone but in all urban councils countrywide.\n\nWe are looking at all our cities. We have started, but the invitations are not focused on Harare, they are focused on all the urban cities.\n\nPriority areas are Harare, Bulawayo and Victoria Falls.\n\nBesides the privatisation of water services, government will also privatise all other services such as solid and liquid waste management systems to make sure cases of burst pipes are dealt with once and for all.\n\nChitungwiza and most of Harares suburbs have gone for years with raw sewage flowing in residential areas.\n\nGarwe urged journalists to wait for the Commission of Inquiry to complete its investigations on Harare City regarding some allegations.\n\nLet the Commission do its work and then we can find a way forward, said Garwe.\n\nThe minister also explained that the privatisation of public services in urban councils was not coming at a premium to residents.\n\nTechnology is cheaper. Many people think it is expensive to privatise services, cautioned Garwe.\n\n",

This decision is flawed for two reasons:\n\nExpired Term: A term that has already expired cannot be extended. Thats why there are no oxygen canisters at the cemetery.\n\nRetirement Age: General Sibanda has reached the mandatory retirement age of 70. He cannot be retired and in active service at the same time. It is one thing to recycle dead wood, it is quite another to plant a dead log, said Mpofu.\n\nThe latest development, viewed as a power consolidation strategy as Mnangagwa reportedly seeks a third presidential term, is in Mpofus opinion a troubling trend.\n\nWhat a way to start a year! And for Mnangagwa, what a way to perpetuate a disgraceful legacy anchored on absurdities and illegalities, said Mpofu.\n\nSibanda has served as the Commander of the ZDF since 2017, succeeding the current Vice President, Constantino Chiwenga, who previously held the position.\n\n",

This approach underlines the importance of rehabilitation over retribution in Zimbabwes justice system.\n\nThe ZHRC highly commends the unity of purpose demonstrated by the political leadership across the political divide, notably, Honourable Edwin Mushoriwa who introduced the Private Members Bill in November 2023, Honourable Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi who facilitated the passage, Members of Parliament as a whole, and His Excellency Dr. E. D. Mnangagwa who signed the Bill into law, ZHRC said.\n\nGovernment was further called on to ratify outstanding international treaties such as the UN Convention Against Torture.\n\nThis milestone achievement symbolises Zimbabwes commitment to upholding constitutional, regional and international human rights standards. In that vein the ZHRC therefore urges the Government of Zimbabwe to maintain the momentum and ratify outstanding treaties, particularly the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and the UN Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CED), ZHRC said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE low water levels at the iconic Lake Kariba are reportedly on the rise, a development that is good news for Zimbabwe and Zambia that rely on the reservoir for hydroelectricity generation.\n\nAccording to the latest hydrological survey report by the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA) issued this Monday, steady water inflows from the dams catchment area are contributing to the improved levels.The Lake level is steadily increasing due to sustained rainfall on the reservoir and immediate catchment, closing the period under review at 475.87m (2.61% usable storage) on 6th January 2025, compared to 477.28m (12.32% usable storage) recorded on the same date last year, said the water authority.The lake is designed to operate between levels 475.50m and 488.50m (with 0.70m freeboard) for hydropower generation.As of January 6, 2025, the dam was 12.32% full from 11.38% recorded on December 28,2024.Owing to the El Nino-induced weather phenomenon which resulted in low rainfall, on November 28, 2022, Zimbabwe stopped generating electricity at the Kariba South Power Station situated on the mighty Zambezi River.Why did Kariba South shut down?Historically low rainfall led to a glaring imbalance between the water intake level at Lake Karibathe worlds biggest dam reservoirand water consumption by the Zimbabwean Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) at Kariba South.As a result, ZRA, which maintains and operates the Kariba Dam, issued guidance to suspend electricity generation.At the time of the suspension, ZRA, jointly owned by Zimbabwe and Zambia, believed the decision would allow most of the remaining water left in Lake Kariba to be used by Zambia, which at that time rationed its water consumption more carefully than Zimbabwe, which has become more hydropower dependent as it battled outages and soaring fuel prices owing to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Why is the Kariba Dam so important?The significance of the Kariba Dam, with an installed capacity of 1,626 megawatt, stems both from its contributions to regional economies and what it symbolizes in Southern Africa and beyond.The dam was controversially built in the late-colonial period to accelerate economic growth in settler colonies under white-minority control but ended up becoming central to newly independent African states.
