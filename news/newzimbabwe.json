            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOUTSPOKEN evangelist, Apostle Talent Chiwenga has blasted Zimbabweans working as caregivers in the United Kingdom and other developed countries, saying they have been relegated to taking care of unwanted, mentally challenged former sex workers all because of money.\n\nChiwenga was speaking during a sermon at Jesus Revelation Ministries, a denomination he founded with controversial and strict doctrines such as the absence of wives consent within a marriage.\n\nHis comments on caregivers come at a time when Zimbabweans are leaving the country enmasse to eke out a living in greener pastures due to lack of employment opportunities locally, a faltering economy and maladministration.\n\nOver 4,500 Zimbabwean trained nurses and doctors are employed by the UKs National Health Service (NHS), thousands more went there as nurse aides while countries such as Australia, USA and New Zealand have taken in more.\n\nIt is an error for us the sons of God to be used to toiling day and night doing filthy work so that other sinners may enjoy their lives, said the charismatic preacher.\n\nYou are the one taking care of the mother suffering from dementia as they go on vacation. You will be busy taking pictures of yourself and sending them back home saying life is good.\n\nYou have never washed your mothers clothes, have never bathed her or your grandmother but you are doing it all because of money.\n\nSome of these women were commercial sex workers who were abandoned by their children and are now being taken care of by the State. Those are the people you are taking care of in England.\n\nZimbabwean caregivers in the UK form a considerable chunk of the countrys diaspora community that contributed 25% of its total foreign currency earnings last year.\n\nChiwenga, however, said that kind of work should not be tolerated as it also causes mental fatigue.\n\nHe added: When you come back from work after finishing your shift, when you have spent the day bearing their spits on your face, what kind of love would you give to your spouse.\n\nDo you know that taking care of a mental patient causes mental fatigue itself because you are spending the day with them? Their relatives looked for you to do it because they did not want to do it themselves.\n\n",

Flames engulfed homes and bulldozers cleared abandoned vehicles from roads so emergency vehicles could pass, television images showed.\n\nAs the sun set over Los Angeles, towering orange flames illuminated the hills leading to Topanga Canyon.\n\nThe fire singed some trees on the grounds of the Getty Villa, a museum loaded with priceless works of art, but the collection remained safe largely because of preventive efforts to trim brush surrounding the buildings, the museum said.\n\nWith only one major road leading from the canyon to the coast, and only one coastal highway leading to safety, traffic crawled to a halt, leading people to flee on foot.\n\nCindy Festa, a Pacific Palisades resident, said that as she evacuated out of the canyon, fires were this close to the cars, demonstrating with her thumb and forefinger.\n\nPeople left their cars on Palisades Drive. Burning up the hillside. The palm trees  everything is going, Festa said from her car.\n\nBefore the fire started, the National Weather Service had issued its highest alert for extreme fire conditions for much of Los Angeles County from Tuesday through Thursday, predicting wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph (80 to 130 kph).\n\nWith low humidity and dry vegetation due to a lack of rain, the conditions were about as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather, the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service said on X.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom, who declared a state of emergency, said the state positioned personnel, firetrucks and aircraft elsewhere in Southern California because of the fire danger to the wider region, he added.\n\nHopefully, were wrong, but were anticipating other fires happening concurrently, Newsom told the press conference.\n\nA second blaze dubbed the Eaton Fire later broke out some 30 miles (50 km) inland in the foothills above Pasadena, consuming 200 acres (80 hectares), Cal Fire said.\n\nThe powerful winds changed President Joe Bidens travel plans, grounding Air Force One in Los Angeles. He had planned to make a short flight inland to the Coachella Valley for a ceremony to create two new national monuments in California but the event was rescheduled for a later date at the White House.\n\nI have offered any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire, Biden said in statement. A federal grant had already been approved to help reimburse the state of California for its fire response, Biden said.\n\nPacific Palisades is home to several Hollywood stars. Actor James Woods said on X he was able to evacuate but added, I do not know at this moment if our home is still standing.\n\nActor Steve Guttenberg told KTLA television that friends of his were impeded from evacuating because others had abandoned their cars in the road.\n\nIts really important for everybody to band together and dont worry about your personal property. Just get out, Guttenberg said. Get your loved ones and get out.\n\n",

So, all modalities have been put in place with a steering committee that I chair to ensure that we can accelerate the ZimDigital project, said Muswere.\n\nHe expects the project will be completed within the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWe are pretty sure that before April, we will be in a position to invite the President to officially launch the ZimDigital project.\n\nThe same applies with the media and communication policy, which will now go through other government processes for refinement and approval. The same also applies with regards to the tax holidays that we have offered to the media fraternity in order to support the growth and robustness of the sector.\n\nHe said among other strategies, the ministry adopted the heritage-based broadcasting, because our language, culture, values as a people define.who we are, and we have 16 official languages, which also includes Kalanga, Chindawu, and many other local languages.\n\nSo, the primary focus is for us to be able to participate even on the digital highway, even on digital platforms, as you collect, as you gather news and content across the country, let us also support our languages as the modernisation of Montrose Studios is taking place, and this will become the center of heritage-based broadcasting.\n\nWe want broadcasters, media practitioners, to be able to contribute to the digital world in our own local languages, so that each and every Zimbabwean is not left behind. The ZBC restructuring is also taking place,\n\nMuswere said there are no enemies anymore and media houses should find each other and work towards putting Zimbabwe first regardless of differences.\n\nZimbabwe comes first, that it is the responsibility of each and every Zimbabwean, and for the media fraternity, let us always ensure that we protect, advance, and defend the interests and rights of Zimbabwe, that whatever differences.\n\nSaid the minister: I am also happy to indicate that the members of the Fourth Estate have responded appropriately in order to support nation building. We all know that genocide, wars, instabilities in other countries, its the social media, its members of the Fourth Estate.\n\nIm happy to announce that weve had a number of sessions together with the Zimbabwe Media Commission (ZMC), which commission, in terms of the ZMC Act amendments, we are strengthening the legislation in order to manage the conduct of journalism as a profession.\n\nWe need to protect members of the Fourth Estate, because what we want is diversity, what we want is pluralism, what we want is to ensure that with all those different views, we remain united to defend the media sovereignty of our country, Muswere said.\n\n",

Poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to education create conditions where individuals resort to illegal activities for survival.\n\nThe prevalence and types of crimes vary widely across African countries. It was also noted that crime is a universal issue, reflective of societal disparities and struggles, but its manifestations vary across regions.\n\nIn urban centres, particularly in informal settlements, these challenges are acute. Many African cities are grappling with rapid urbanisation, leaving governments struggling to provide adequate housing, sanitation, and security services. This neglect fosters environments where petty theft, burglary, and violent crime thrive, noted Numbero Crime Index.\n\nSouth Africa, the most dangerous country to be on the continent and fifth globally, faces pervasive violent crimes such as homicides, robberies, and assaults, exacerbated by unemployment and inadequate law enforcement. Despite efforts to curb crime, such as community policing initiatives and social programmes, many South Africans report feeling unsafe.\n\nNigeria ranked 11th globally with a crime index score of 66.6, confronts widespread security issues, including organised crime, armed robberies, and kidnappings.\n\nAngola follows closely, ranked 13th globally with a score of 66.3, where both violent and property crimes remain prevalent, particularly in urban areas.\n\nBelow are the top 10 African countries with the highest crime index at the start of 2025, according to Numbero Crime Index.\n\n1.

How do we start it? It starts with you and me.\n\nPlease stop buying land from land barons. That is the first call on regularisation.\n\nWe now have structures put in place to ensure that you can come to the Minister of Local Government, you can go to any local authority and be able to get information of the availability of a stand in the area of choice if they are there. So, stop buying land from criminals. Thats the first step of regularisation, Garwe said.\n\nFor already existing informal settlements such as Caledonia and Harare South, a budget is now in place to ensure that government engages developers to do servicing and put water, sewer and roads infrastructure.\n\nWe want residents to participate. How do they participate? If they are desirous of having a title deed, they pay for the land first.\n\nGarwe reiterated land belongs to the State and the public should be made aware that land barons were stealing government property and parceling it out to unsuspecting homeseekers.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nPARTS of the Midlands provinces city of Gweru that once endured water rationing, sometimes going days without a drop, have seen improved water supply owing to increasing levels at various dams.\n\nCurrently pumping capacity is at 62 megalitres per day up from 35 megalitres, according to Gweru Mayor, Martin Chivoko.\n\nThe mayor announced the latest development while presenting the citys 2024 achievements.\n\nIn the statement, Chivoko said the upgrade was made possible through the procurement of low-lift pumps for the Amapongokwe Dam, which has boosted the raw water production for the Gwenoro Water Treatment Plant.\n\nOne of the most notable achievements of the City of Gweru in 2024 was the improvement in its water supply.\n\nThe procurement of low-lift pumps for Amapongokwe Dam enabled the city to increase its raw water production for the Gwenoro Water Treatment Plant.\n\nAs a result, the city was able to increase its treated water pumping capacity from 35 megalitres to 62 megalitres.\n\nThis significant increase in water supply has eased water rationing, with some areas now receiving water for 5 to 6 days a week.\n\nThe improvement in the citys water supply has had a positive impact on the lives of its residents, said the premier.\n\nFurthermore, the City of Gweru is pushing its 2025 plans to increase the water supply system to high-lying areas that do not receive water.\n\nAs we look to 2025, the City of Gweru has outlined several exciting plans.\n\nOne of the citys top priorities is to increase the pumping capacity of Whitewaters Dam. This will enable the city to supply water to high-lying areas such as Ridgemont, Northgate, Hertfordshire, Harben Park, and Athlone.\n\nThe city has budgeted for this project and is expected to commence work soon, he said.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Chivoko confirmed that the water that is being supplied to its residents is treated using several chemicals and it is safe for human consumption.\n\nYes, our water is treated. We use standard water treatment chemicals, including chlorine and alum, to ensure the water is safe for consumption.\n\nOur treatment process involves coagulation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. We treat the water from our dams regularly, following strict safety protocols, the mayor explained.\n\nWith a more reliable water supply, residents are now able to access clean water for drinking, cooking, and other domestic uses.\n\nThis has improved the overall health and well-being of the citys residents, particularly children and the elderly, who are most vulnerable to water-borne diseases.\n\n",
