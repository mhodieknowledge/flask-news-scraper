            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo l IOL\n\nAFRIFORUM CEO Kallie Kriel says his organisation is being unfairly blamed for the diplomatic fallout between South Africa and the United States.\n\nKriel has denied that his organisation is responsible for the deterioration in relations between the United States and South Africa, saying the civil-rights group is being used as a scapegoat amid increasingly public exchanges.IOL reported on Saturday that US President Donald Trump announced a total boycott of the G20 Summit taking place in South Africa later this month. The move and subsequent comments from US politicians have put AfriForum at the eye of the diplomatic storm.Kriel: We never used that terminologySpeaking to broadcaster Newzroom Afrika on Saturday, Kriel insisted AfriForum had never described the situation in South Africa as a genocide targeting Afrikaners.That is another lie spread by the ANC. The fact is, those media institutions that accused us of spreading the white genocide narrative, we took them to the Press Ombud and already five of those institutions had to apologise to us. We never used that terminology.Our stance is quite clear, the Kill the Boer, Kill the farmer chant, calling for the killing of Afrikaners on an ethnic basis, is a genocidal call. But we never said there is genocide. All we are asking from the government and the president is  condemn this call, acknowledge the fact that we are seeing tortures that accompany these murders, and declare it a priority crime, he said.Kriel said when his organisation visited the United States, AfriForum understood the consequences of concerns which had been raised repeatedly in Washington about the situation in South Africa.We knew exactly what the consequences would be if those issues were not addressed. That is why we went to the US after that post (by Trump) and made a plea to the US administration not to punish the country for the irresponsible behaviour of the ANC. The fact is, and people are falling for this, they dont want to take responsibility for the consequences of their own negative behaviour. They now need a scapegoat, he said.If you go and have a look, long before we went to the US, in the House of Representatives, a Bill was asking for the review of the relationship with South Africa. The stuff mentioned there was former minister Naledi Pandor visiting Iran and a number of other issues. We did not go to Iran, we did not sign the Expropriation Act, we are not the ones refusing to condemn the kill the Boerchant.It is the irresponsible behaviour of ANC leaders.Kriel said the denialism by the ANC has failed and everyone is now reaping the bitter fruits.Political fallout grows ahead of G20The political dispute between Pretoria and Washington has taken on a diplomatic dimension after public comments by US political figures and the decision by Washington to withhold official representation at the G20.Observers say the episode has amplified domestic polarisation, with civil-society groups, opposition parties and government figures trading accusations about motives and responsibility.Earlier on Saturday, IOL reported that South Africas International Relations and Cooperation Minister Ronald Lamola has publicly challenged claims by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Afrikaners are being racially persecuted, describing the allegations as politically motivated and unsupported by formal data.The exchange on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) comes in the wake of Trumps announcement that no American officials would attend next weeks G20 summit in South Africa. IOL reported on Saturday that Trump insisted that his administration would not send officials to the G20 in Joburg.Trump claimed that Afrikaners are being slaughtered, accusing Pretoria of turning a blind eye to violence against white farmers.

            "content": "By Kerena Cobbina l BBC\n\nTAWANA Musvaburis 33,000 Instagram followers may feel like they know all about her life  but most dont know what her partner looks like.\n\nThere might be subtle signs she has a boyfriend, like the back of a head, or two clinking wine glasses at dinner, but the 24-year-old says she has no intention of posting his face.Im just girl-coded, Tawana says.As a woman, you want to come across strong, like, Ive got my stuff together.The influencer has curated a brand that doesnt include a boyfriend.You dont want any part to feel like its been helped by a man. It brings me more pleasure to say, I did this myself.And her stance isnt changing any time soon  even if she and her boyfriend take things to the next stage she says, a rings still not enough for me to post my relationship.Tawana works full-time as an influencer.That Vogue articleTawana is one of many women reluctant to hard-launch their relationship online and social media users are picking up on it.So much so that last month, British Vogue published an article titled Is Having a Boyfriend Embarrassing Now?, which inspired TikTok and Instagram posts asking the same question.In the viral article, writer Chante Joseph suggests there has been a shift in how heterosexual women present their relationships online, writing that women want to reap the social benefits of having a partner, without appearing boyfriend-obsessed.Posting your partner frequently can come across as cringe and culturally loser-ish, Joseph writes.On a more serious note, she says having a boyfriend is no longer considered an achievement, and isnt seen to make you anymore  or less  of a woman in the way it might once have done.She believes women are hesitating to post their partners because of the patriarchy we live under, and how oppressive it is to women.A lot of women have been saying, its cool to have a fiance. Its cool to have a husband, Joseph told BBC Radio 4s Womans Hour on Wednesday.Its not.

Mvududu had argued that his termination was unlawful because it was effected without a disciplinary hearing and that the parastatal had no authority to dismiss him.\n\nMy termination was executed without following the established procedures, which violates not just my employment rights, but fundamental rights that should be protected under our Constitution, he submitted in his appeal.\n\nDelivering the judgment, Justice Susan Mavangira said the matter had already been conclusively determined.\n\nThe applicants legal maneuvers appear aimed at rehashing a matter that has been thoroughly adjudicated upon.The Supreme Court has already ruled on the basis of his employment relationship, and his attempts to reassert his claims lack merit.Mvududus latest application for condonation and an extension of time to file further appeals was dismissed on the grounds that it lacked legal merit. The court ruled that the arguments advanced were a clear attempt to sidestep the Supreme Courts definitive judgments, which have laid to rest the issues in question.Mvududu maintained that only the Minister of Agriculture, not ARDA, had authority over his employment.It is the Minister, not ARDA, that governs these employment issues.However, the court said earlier rulings, including one by Justice Bharat Patel had settled the dispute, finding no basis for reopening the matter.The judgment marks the conclusion of a legal fight spanning more than a decade.\n\nThe applicants legal maneuvers appear aimed at rehashing a matter that has been thoroughly adjudicated upon.\n\nThe Supreme Court has already ruled on the basis of his employment relationship, and his attempts to reassert his claims lack merit.\n\nMvududus latest application for condonation and an extension of time to file further appeals was dismissed on the grounds that it lacked legal merit.
