As locals we were able to engage the mining companies in our community following training on advocacy and engagement we received from Silveira House. Despite the delays, we are now able to access quality health care within our communities, said Maybe Mashamba from Nyamuganhu village.\n\nShe said community members also played a part through brick laying and providing labour while the companies assisted through injection of finances and expertise for other necessities.\n\nPrior to the completion of this clinic we used to travel for 18 kilometers to Katsukunye Clinic and such long distances forced many villagers to give up on accessing health care. It was even worse for conditions like HIV/AIDS since many could not access testing services and treatment, she said.\n\nMashamba added the clinic has also assisted pregnant women with safe deliveries close to home.\n\nAnother villager, Tichatonga Nyangu of Mutoko Centre described the development as a dream come true, which has spurred health and safety for the workers employed at mining companies in the area.\n\nCommenting on the development, Silveira House projects manager, Zandile Mvududu said while the project completion is welcome, there is need to treat CSR projects with urgency.\n\nIt is indeed a very positive step but there is a need to find ways to make sure that such CSR projects are implemented well within the time frames. In this case it has taken over 15 years for Gurure Clinic to be completed, she said.\n\n",
