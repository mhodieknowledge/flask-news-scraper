The approach involves maintaining a high bank policy rate, currently at 35%,to curb speculative borrowing, which has been a major driver of excess liquidity and illicit parallel market activity.\n\nTo this end, the exchange rate premium has remained stable for a period in excess of one year, which has seen annual inflation receding by more than 50% to 32,7%.\n\nSpeaking to parliamentarians in Bulawayo Wednesday, Ncube said the local unit is poised to strengthen further as the year comes to an end.\n\nFourth quarter taxes are expected to increase demand for ZiG, and the appreciation of the exchange rate. In the outlook, exchange rate stability is envisaged, underpinned by the broad acceptance of the ZiG and the continued implementation of prudent fiscal and monetary policies by the Government, Ncube said.\n\nHe attributed the obtaining stability, which has seen the exchange rate maintaining a premium of US$1: ZWG 26.68 to the aggressive policies employed to ring fence the currency.\n\nThe parallel market exchange rate premium has remained stable, falling to below 25% in August 2025, aligning with other countries, including Kenya and Zambia, he said.\n\nNcube said the strategy for accelerated building of foreign currency reserves is bearing fruit following the introduction of the ZiG, which has seen total foreign currency reserves increasing from below US$300 million in April 2024 to over US$900 million by September 2025, targeting US$1 billion by December 2025.\n\nZimbabwe is accumulating both gold and USD reserves which are expected to fully cover both ZiG reserve money and deposits.\n\nAdded Ncube, Inflation is projected to average 61.3% in 2025, end the year at 22.8%, and decline to single-digit levels by 2027, supported by continued exchange rate stability and prudent fiscal and monetary policies.\n\n",

The council cited illegal occupation under municipal by-laws.\n\nThe borehole, drilled in 2019 under the Presidential Borehole Scheme, remains the communitys main source of clean water in an area already suffering from severe shortages. No alternative water source has been proposed to replace it.\n\nIn a petition signed by 280 residents and submitted to the mayor on Wednesday, the community urged council to form a special committee to investigate the land allocations and assess how many boreholes would be affected by the planned housing development.\n\nThe Petitioner beseeches the Harare City Council to establish a Special Committee pursuant to Section 100 of the Urban Councils Act (Chapter 29:15), conduct an investigation into the allocation of infill residential stands in Glen View, determine the number of boreholes that will be affected, and provide recommendations to mitigate the water supply issues that may arise from the removal of the boreholes, the petition reads in part.\n\nResidents warned that demolishing the borehole without providing an alternative water source would violate their constitutional right to water and risk triggering another public health crisis in the cholera-prone suburb.\n\nThey also questioned how stands approved in 2024 could overlap with a borehole installed in 2018 and upgraded in 2025, describing the sequence as evidence of poor planning and possible corruption.\n\nAdding to their frustration, residents said individuals allocated the contested stands have already begun bringing building materials to the site, despite the ongoing dispute.\n\nThe petitioners further demanded that the City of Harare convene a public meeting to release documents showing whether the land was properly allocated before the borehole was drilled.\n\n",
