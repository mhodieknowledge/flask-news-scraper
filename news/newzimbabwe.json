The Statutory Instrument introduced stiffer penalties for offenders and allows for the seizure of minerals, machinery, equipment and vehicles. To date, a total of 344 arrests have been made across the country, he said.\n\nFollowing the directive by Cabinet on 20 August 2024, to ban riverbed mining, an Inter-Ministerial Committee, under the chairmanship of the Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development was set up to spearhead the enforcement of the afore-stated directive and to carry out a survey on the status of the river ecosystems and recommend more deterrent penalties for breach of the law.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nZimbabwe is planning to hold 26% of new mining projects on a free-carry basis, and will also negotiate with existing operators to acquire a similar stake.\n\nWe need to move to a level where we reach 26% shareholding in most of the big projects, Zimbabwes Secretary for Mines Pfungwa Kunaka told Bloomberg in an interview. A lot of these things would take negotiations with the investors that are on the ground.\n\nKunaka declined to say how the government would finance acquiring stakes in established mining projects.\n\nResource nationalism is strengthening across Africa as countries seek a greater share of the profits from their commodities while addressing historical imbalances in the wealth flows from mining. Zimbabwe mines a number of metals, such as gold, platinum, lithium and chrome, with operators including Zimplats, Anglo American Platinums Unki mine and RioZim.\n\nObviously when you have decisions which were made some years back and decisions were made on the basis of a certain framework, you cannot just willy-nilly go and change that, Kunaka said. It takes negotiations.\n\nKunaka did not disclose the minimum value of mining assets in which the government would want a shareholding, saying that details will be released later. The policy would be introduced from next year, he said.\n\nZimbabwe has a 15% free carry shareholding in platinum miner, Karo Resources, according to its website.\n\n",
