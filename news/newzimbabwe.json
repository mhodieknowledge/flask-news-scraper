Two of the four suspects are foreign nationals.\n\nAccording to police, the gun battle erupted after detectives tracked down a motorised robbery syndicate that had reportedly crossed into Zimbabwe from South Africa to carry out a series of armed robberies in Bulawayo, Harare, and Kwekwe.\n\nAs the detectives were following, the suspects fired at them resulting in a serious exchange of fire near Norton Tollgate, along HarareBulawayo Road, said Nyathi.\n\nFollowing the shootout, detectives recovered the gangs getaway vehicle, a Toyota Axio, and a cache of weapons including a Girsan 9mm Parabellum pistol with two rounds, another 9mm Parabellum pistol with one round, as well as clothing items believed to have been used during recent robberies.\n\nOne of the suspects was captured on CCTV wearing the recovered shoes and jacket during an armed robbery incident which occurred on 30th September 2025 at a local hospital in Harare, where US$1,833 cash and airtime recharge cards worth US$140 were stolen, the police statement revealed.\n\nInvestigations show the slain gang was linked to at least five armed robberies committed in Harare and Bulawayo between 25th June and 3rd October 2025, including a case in Njube, Bulawayo, where robbers made off with US$8,000 and an iPhone.\n\nNyathi said police would continue to act decisively against armed criminal networks operating in Zimbabwe.\n\nZRP reiterates that there is no going back in the fight against armed robbery cases in the country, he said. All syndicates, whether locally or foreign-based, will be decisively dealt with in line with the countrys laws.\n\nHe urged the public to assist law enforcement efforts by reporting any suspicious criminal activity.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nFORMER Energy minister Fortune Chasi has called on Zimbabweans to stop blaming Chinese for environmental degradation, arguing that local corruption and weak governance are at the heart of the countrys mining-related ecological damage.\n\nChasi was responding to growing outrage over the ongoing destruction of Christmas Pass Mountain in Mutare, where the Chinese reportedly working in collusion with political elites are accused of tearing apart the landmark for mineral extraction.\n\nThere have been various videos on social media showing the destruction going on in the Christmas Pass Mountain with locals accusing the Chinese of damaging the scenic environment.\n\nThis comes at a time when mountains, monuments and escarpments are being destroyed countrywide by Chinese companies in the mining sector with examples being Boterekwa in Shurugwi, Muvaradonha Wilderness in Muzarabani and now Christmas Pass.\n\nResponding to one of the debates on X, Chasi said while Chinese investors are often vilified for destructive mining practices, the real problem lies with local officials who enable such activities for personal gain.\n\nFor years, we have blamed the Chinese for destroying our environment through mining, but the truth is harder to face, the real culprits are locals.\n\nLocal officials sign the licences, local elites pocket the facilitation fees. Local silence allows rivers to turn into sludge. The Chinese did not corrupt our system, they found it already for sale, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe former energy minister argued that environmental destruction in Zimbabwe reflects a broader governance crisis rather than foreign exploitation alone.\n\nThis isnt a Chinese problem. It is a governance problem. If rules can be bought, someones selling, he added.\n\nEvery destroyed riverbed tells a local story, a signature, a bribe, a blind eye. Foreign miners only exploit the vacuum we created.\n\nBlaming outsiders has become a fashionable, convenient self-deception. Environmental destruction thrives because enforcement is selective and oversight compromised, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe reform we need is not about nationality; it is about integrity.\n\nUntil our institutions stop trading ecological integrity for quick cash, nothing will change. The Chinese did not destroy our mountains and rivers. Our signatures did, he added.\n\n",

There is no rule of evidence that excludes it, he held.He further clarified that while the testimony might cast Mbondiya in a bad light, it was allowed under Section 33(a) of the Civil Evidence Act [Chapter 8:01], which permits character evidence in damages claims where reputation is directly at issue.This is not an issue of admissibility but of weight, Justice Dube-Banda said.
