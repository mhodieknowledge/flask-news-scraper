            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHIGH Court judge, Justice Munamato Mutevedzi has expressed concern over some cases judges preside over further noting that crimes that are being committed around Zimbabwe may suggest that the world is coming to an end.\n\nThe judge also said court officials would require psychological support for them to cope with things they hear in court everyday.\n\nMutevedzi said this while handing down sentence against one Tapiwa Mereka (19) at the Gweru High Court.\n\nMereka was found guilty of the gruesome murder of his mothers sister Mary Mereka on January 27, 2023, and also raping her lifeless body.\n\nMutevedzi said Mereka deserved capital sentence adding that he is fortunate that death penalty had been scrapped.\n\nIf it is true that on some day God will destroy the world, then that time is nigh. Some of the crimes that we preside over suggest that Armageddon is imminent.\n\nTapiwa Mereka (the offender) has a head but it is doubtful that he has a brain inside it. If he does, then his mind is so perverted and depraved that he should not be living amongst human beings.\n\nThe crime that he committed is unconscionable and would possibly win an Oscar award for horror movies.\n\nEvery one of us who took part in the trial would be thinking about this for a long time to come.\n\nIt lays bare, the oft-repeated myth that judges are inanimate.\n\nThe reality is that judicial officers and other court officials who work in the criminal courts and hear these horrific stories almost on a daily basis may suffer what is called vicarious trauma.\n\nThey all may end up requiring therapy in one form or another, Mutevedzi said.\n\nThe court heard Mereka had plotted to rape and kill his aunt for a long time.\n\nIn his warned and cautioned statement accused person admitted that he always admired her and wanted to sleep with her.\n\nHe was biding his time and waiting for an opportune moment to strike.\n\nHe said the idea became maddening some three days before the murder andcould not shake off the desire and lust to have sexual intercourse with his aunt.\n\nHe convinced himself to carry out the satanic idea on the fateful morning.\n\nI do admit to the allegations levelled against me. The deceased was my aunt but I had quite some time admiring her and I wished that I have some time to rape her.\n\nI also had the intention to kill her. I had no valid reason but I just felt that I have to kill her.\n\nSo, when I was with her in the field weeding together with her I then got the chance and took an axe which was in the field and struck her three times on the head whilst she was not expecting it.\n\nAfter striking her she fell down. I removed her pant and had sexual intercourse with her.\n\nAfter I finished I dressed her and took the axe and threw it outside the field and went to Sebakwe River with the intention to stay there, Mereka admitted.\n\nThe teenager said at the time the time of the sex, the deceased was still alive although in a vegetative state.\n\nMutevedzi said even imagining that his victim was dead by the time he committed the abomination, his actions would have amounted to the crime of violating a dead body in contravention of section 111 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act.\n\nHe said in other jurisdictions, it would have been the crime of necrophilia, which criminalises any sexual attraction to a dead person.\n\nThe judge said this aggravates Merekas situation.\n\nHaving found that the murder is aggravated there cannot be escaping the severest punishment.\n\nBefore the abolition of the penalty of death from our statute books this was a case that would have undoubtedly attracted capital punishment.\n\nNeedless to state, that option is no longer available. The only two choices which the court has are sentencing the offender either to life imprisonment or to a determinate term of not less than 20 years.\n\nWhat is worse is that he said he was prepared to kill for no reason. He is, therefore, a dangerous individual whom the court cannot risk letting back into society.\n\nHe may kill again for nothing else other than his enjoyment.\n\nHe appears worse than a robber who kills for financial gain because it is possible to resist that more than a desire that one cannot explain.\n\nIt is like the offender gets possessed by some irresistible spirit.Given the above, our hands are, therefore, tied. It is difficult to empathise with the offender.\n\nIf he could be so sadistic as to easily kill his own mother and still find sexual gratification from her in that state of helplessness, we shudder to think what he could possibly do to a stranger or to children.\n\nHe is someone whose soul must be left to God to correct. As a court, we can do no more than administer justice.\n\nWe will permanently remove him from society and confine him to the secure walls of a prison.\n\nAccordingly, the offender is sentenced to life imprisonment, the judge ruled.\n\n",

            "content": "By Linda Mujuru and Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  Eliza Mandove was a child when her brother was killed during Zimbabwes war for independence. She was beaten during the same attack and sustained injuries to her hands and legs. Now 46, Mandove has no motor function in her left hand and struggles to walk and carry heavy loads. She suffers from chronic headaches. She cant work in the fields. Her husband once farmed, but years of drought and erratic rainfall have led to diminishing yields.\n\nAid from the United States was crucial. It kept Mandoves family of seven fed.\n\nIn January, that food aid abruptly stopped. On his first day in office, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that ended nearly all foreign aid. Mandove and her family  and many others  were left with very little.\n\nThe end of US foreign aid was abrupt. In Zimbabwe, the sudden suspension put many at immediate risk ofhunger. In Uganda, health workers told patients to collect their antiretroviral drugs before clinicsshut down. In Bangladesh, tuberculosis specialists were immediatelylaid off, leaving people with that illness without care.\n\nStories like this emerged around the world.\n\nThe sudden pullout has left a crisis behind. The aid had been a lifeline for millions since the United States Agency for International Development, the US foreign aid agency, was formed in 1961. At the same time, it failed to transform the economies and governance of low-income countries. In the worst cases, it enabled corruption.\n\nIn Zimbabwe alone, nearly US$7 billion in US aid poured in between 1980 and 2025. But in the four decades since its independence from colonial rule, the countrys per capita gross domestic product hasfallen by almost10%. It is poorer today than it was then.\n\nForeign aid, in most cases, feeds people and offers them medical aid one day at a time.\n\nInvestment from China, on the other hand, continues to sweep across the continent. Overall, that investment is creating stable jobs and infrastructure that has the potential to upend decades of reliance on that aid. The question now in Zimbabwe, as in other African countries, is whether this new era will be the one that, at last, brings economic transformation.\n\nTurning that corner wont be easy, says Persistence Gwanyanya, a member of the monetary policy committee of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. Reliance on aid led to the countrys leadership being a bit relaxed when it comes to economic responsibility.\n\nDonors were coming in to fill the gap, he says.\n\nNow, he adds, is the time for change.\n\nWe just have to live within our budget, he says. We need to be more accountable.\n\nZimbabwe was one of the last African countries to gain its independence from European colonial occupation. In 1980, following a bitter civil war, a revolutionary movement led by Robert Mugabe succeeded in overthrowing a white minority government that had itself seceded from the British empire in 1965. The country benefited from infrastructure built under the white-controlled government that, for a while, sustained society.\n\nOur parents could take care of us with ease, says Tellmore Mutize, 63, a dressmaker from Harare who reached adulthood just as the country gained independence.\n\nThere were jobs, she says. Groceries were cheap, and schools were free. When she gave birth to her first child in a public hospital in 1980, she paid nothing and received top-quality care. When she had twins five years later, the experience was much the same.\n\nColonialism left many parts of Africa in shambles and with an impossible task: emerge from decades of oppressive foreign control to effectively manage natural resources, maintain infrastructure and meet peoples health care, humanitarian and economic needs.\n\nDuring the Cold War, a decadeslong showdown between the US and Russia, the US wielded soft power and won global influence with USAID. Since 1946, the US has budgeted over US$1.1 trillion in foreign assistance to Africa, for everything from emergency food aid to HIV/AIDS relief, from early childhood education programs to civil society development.\n\nDeep corruption was beginning to take root, and human rights abuses were a real threat. Poverty remained a problem. But for many black Zimbabweans, life was easier than it had been for generations.\n\nAbundant rainfall boosted agriculture, reinforcing Zimbabwes reputation as Africas breadbasket. The economy grew in bursts, and the health care systemdrew medical touristsfrom across Africa.\n\nThen came disaster. The regions worst drought set in in 1992, leading to a widespread food shortage. The price of groceries skyrocketed. The droughts effects rippled through many sectors, including health care, where hospitals struggled to maintain adequate services.\n\nAs crops dried up, so did public spending. The World Bank began to require countries receiving funding to agree to market reforms, often characterized by privatizing state-owned industries, ending food subsidies and enacting user fees at hospitals.\n\nMaize flour and cooking oil began to flow in from donors like the Red Cross and Save the Children.\n\nWhen they came, we were happy because in 1992, there was no food, Mutize says.\n\nEight years later, Mugabe began expropriating thousands of large, white-owned farms dating from the countrys colonialism era.\n\nFarm workers, villagers and veterans of Zimbabwes war for independence invaded those white-owned farms, leading to 40 deaths (34 black Zimbabweans and six white farmers) and countless assaults. Eventually, those large farms were converted into about 170,000 smaller properties. Much of the land was snatched up by powerful political players; other parcels went to ordinary people who reveled in owning land after generations of oppression.\n\nThe chaotic, rushed and violent nature of the land reforms led to a massive withdrawal of international investment. Zimbabwes central bank began recklessly printing cash. Hyperinflation took root. Corruption ballooned. Public services collapsed.\n\nBy the time Mutize was ready to give birth to her last child in 2003, public hospitals had deteriorated. She paid out of pocket to give birth at a private hospital.\n\nTwo-thirds of the population required food aid in 2002 and 2003. US aidquickly grew, from US$42 million in 2002 to US$120 million in 2007 and US$260 million in 2009. Even so, between 1999 and 2008, Zimbabwes GDP dropped by 49%  the most severe economic downturn in a country not at war, according to a2019 report from the African Development Bank.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2024, PEPFAR, a giant US health program aimed at treating and containing the spread of HIV/AIDS, supplied on average 18% of Zimbabwes national health budget. In 2019, amid chaotic inflation and massive cuts to the health budget, donor contributions to the health budget were 4.5 times larger than Zimbabwes contribution to its own health ministrys budget.\n\nTotal US aid to Zimbabwe peaked at US$340 million in 2022. In 2024, the last full year before the US slashed foreign aid, it totaled US$290 million.\n\nNevertheless, over a third of Zimbabweans continue to live in poverty: Around 35% of Zimbabwes close to 17 million people live on just US$2.15 per day.\n\nEconomists in Africa and throughout the world have struggled to understand why so much aid hasnt brought about structural transformation. Though health aid has had some big successes  new HIV infections in Zimbabwe, for example,declined more than tenfoldfrom a high in the early 1990s  the Zimbabwean economy is chronically unstable.\n\nIn February, Elon Musk, the unelected man who was tasked with dramatically downsizing the US government, claimed that USAID was corrupt. But theres scant evidence of widespread corruption in USAID projects in Zimbabwe. In 58 audits of USAID projects in Zimbabwe, commissioned by the USAID Office of Inspector General between 2017 and 2024, three projects were flagged for having unsupported costs totaling US$660,000. In at least two of those examples, the corruption was at the local level, not within USAID.\n\nThe real corruption is in Zimbabwes halls of power. In 2024, the US sanctioned President Emmerson Mnangagwa and 10 other Zimbabwean leaders for corruption and human rights abuses. The announcement from the US Department of Treasury, which implements such sanctions, noted that Mnangagwa, his wife and senior government leaders are engaged in corruption related to gold and diamond smuggling networks, as well as a host of other illicit financial schemes and human rights abuses.\n\nAnd thats just a small sampling of the known corruption.\n\nWe need to deal with some nefarious activities that have been resulting in the leakages of the revenue from the fiscus, says Gwanyanya. We need to be more efficient as a government. We need to be more efficient in terms of operations  but also in terms of dealing with the wastages and leakages.\n\nThat corruption ripples down into daily life. Bribery is rife. New mothers have to bribe nurses to getofficial birth cards for their infants. Ruling political party leadersgive away land to their supporters. The black market is now thebackbone of the local economy.\n\nEverything happening in Zimbabwe now is a part of the economic crisis that began in the 1990s, says Eldred Masunungure, a retired University of Zimbabwe political scientist.\n\nWe are still in that crisis, he says.\n\nFragility, he says, has become the countrys defining feature: fragile politics, fragile economy and a fragile social order. When corruption is so routine, he says, How do you uproot that?\n\nPeople are desperate, and those who can leave, do so. Masunungures children live in Canada.\n\nDecades of brain drainhave left the country with far fewer skilled people than it needs to fill the void left by aid agencies. Some African countries wont be able to fill the gap, and even with the resources, they might struggle to manage services that were previously run by donors, says Ken Opalo, an associate professor at the Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. That, he says, is my biggest worry.\n\nEconomic transformation is possible  and China could make it happen, Opalo says.\n\nMore than any other donor, China has been willing to partner with countries of programs and projects that have the potential to deliver structural economic transformation, he says.\n\nMore than 70% of US funding focuses on health and saving lives, while more than 70% of Chinas investment goes toward infrastructure projects like electricity, roads and bridges to drive economic growth, says Deborah Brutigam, director of the China-Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University. Chinas influence in Zimbabwe includes mining claims worth billions of US dollars in the diamond, platinum, coal, chrome and lithium sectors.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2023, China loaned about US$182 billion throughout Africa  ranging from US$3 billion to Zimbabwe to US$46 billion to oil-rich Angola  according to the Boston University Global Development Policy Center. Most of these loans were for either energy or transportation projects  in line with Chinas US$1 trillion Belt and Road Initiative  and have an average interest rate of 3%, higher than World Bank rates but lower than private lender rates of 67%.\n\nChinas approach is often called debt trap diplomacy, meaning that the intent is to overwhelm low-income countries with debt they cant repay. But theres no evidence that these Chinese loans are somehow predatory, Brutigam says. So far, there are no examples of China deliberately entangling another country in debt, then using that debt to extract an unfair or strategic advantage, she adds.\n\nChina has also been keen to make symbolic donations. In 2022, China built Zimbabwe a parliament building at an estimated cost of US$120million. Its one of 15 African parliament buildings that China has either built or refurbished, though its the biggest and most expensive to date.\n\nMore investment from China isnt necessarily a good thing, says Sabiti Makara, a professor in the Department of Governance at Kabale University in Uganda.\n\nSeeing that America is withdrawing its influence, the Chinese might set new terms that may render Africa dependent on them, Makara says.\n\nOn the ground, Chinese investment brings jobs. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in March at a press conference that China has created more than 1.1 million jobs in Africa over the past three years.\n\nBut Zimbabweans say those jobs arent necessarily good ones.\n\nNathan Chiwundo worked for a Chinese brick molding company in Harare. There were poor labor conditions and frequent regulation violations, he says. There were no days off  he worked weekends and public holidays.\n\nBut jobs are rare, Chiwundo says, so people will continue to fill them if China provides them.\n\nFor regular people, he says, more investment from China will be meaningless if employees are not well taken care of.\n\nZimbabwean leaders say theyve been able to respond to the countrys most urgent needs, despite the lack of aid.\n\nThere are enough antiretroviral drugs for all who need them, Dr. Douglas Mombeshora, minister of health and child care, told journalists at a media workshop in April. Spending has also been reprioritized to care for people who have tuberculosis and provide malaria treatment, and US$12 million has been earmarked to import medication.\n\nThere is no need to panic, he said.\n\nGwanyanya, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe committee member, says hes confident that everything will work out. We just need to adjust to the new reality, he says. Otherwise, we cant survive.\n\nMandove, the woman injured during the war for independence, isnt so sure.\n\nUS aid helped ensure that countless Zimbabweans  and people across the world  had enough to eat. China might invest in roads and factories, but USAID kept food on tables.\n\nNow, Mandove says, her family eats just two meals a day, usually wheat with wild okra. Its cheaper than maize, the countrys staple food. Her youngest son, just 10 years old, herds cattle for neighbors to earn money. But the family doesnt have what it needs.\n\nThe food is not enough, she says. I am usually hungry.\n\nApophia Agiresaasi, GPJ, contributed reporting to this story.\n\nGamuchirai Masiyiwais a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.

So my argument is, in Malbereign and around Harare, we are selling at US$20 per square metre, whilst on the other side, it is going for US$5 per square metre.\n\nWe cannot transfer land whose value we do not know. We are not transferring tomatoes; this is land we are talking about, said Ngadziore.\n\nThe proposed compensation has angered residents, with associations labelling the move as unconstitutional and tantamount to government interference in the affairs of the local authority.\n\nAs a result, residents are calling for the compensation to Pinnacle Holdings to be halted.\n\nSeveral stands have been earmarked for compensation, subject to the Councils approval. However, anomalies have been raised regarding some of the stands.\n\nAdonia Shoko raised a red flag over stands in Kuwadzana, stating that some individuals already hold offer letters for the land.\n\nKudzai Kadzombe also raised a similar concern regarding land identified as part of the compensation to Pinnacle Holdings.\n\nI have a personal interest because, as Councillor of Ward 41, we have already raised this issue. We have a piece of land in Bluffhill which is on that list, but residents had already submitted a petition and begun mobilising to build a council school, said Kadzombe.\n\nThe HCC Finance Committee is set to deliberate on Garwes directive and conduct due diligence on the anomalies raised in the meeting.\n\nHowever, Mafume bluntly told the Council that those aggrieved should consider mounting a legal challenge.\n\nAnyone who feels aggrieved or has their property rights affected by the letter is advised to make a beeline to their lawyers, said Mafume.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nUNITED Kingdoms (UK) Minister for Africa, Lord Ray Collins, the first British cabinet member to visit in seven years, has confirmed their softened stance towards Zimbabwe and talked of a new approach towards the continent and former colony.\n\nCollins, who visited President Emmerson Mnangagwa at State House on Wednesday, said Prime Minister Keir Starmers government had crafted a new approach that emphasised on listening rather than talking, on Africas agenda and not only theirs.\n\nHis watered-down comments come barely a month after the UK struck off former Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) boss Isaac Moyo, former police Commissioner General Godwin Matanga, ministers Anselem Sanyatwe, Owen Ncube and the Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI) from its sanctions list.\n\nSanyatwe gained infamy for testifying, during an August 1, 2018, Commission of Inquiry in defence of soldiers, who gunned down innocent lives in Harare. Moyo and Matanga formed part of Mnangagwas brutal security apparatus, specifically targeted at dissenting political and human rights activists.\n\nWe are absolutely committed to building a partnership based on equality and respect but on a simple mission of economic growth, growth that can support both our people (and) creating a win-win situation, said Collins.\n\nI am extremely pleased and looking forward to returning to Zimbabwe.\n\nThe new government in the UK is about developing a new approach to the continent of Africa, where we actually launched a consultation last year, a consultation on our approach, which was about listening and not talking, focusing on the continents agenda and not only ours.\n\nThe dramatic shift in policy comes at a time Mnangagwa had unsuccessfully been battling to re-engage with Western countries such as America, the UK, Australia and Canada, who have always pointed out his human rights record as a red flag.\n\nIn December 2024, Collins spoke against readmitting Zimbabwe into the Commonwealth, a union of mainly former British colonies. Speaking in the UK Parliaments House of Lords, he said his Africa office did not support Zimbabwes readmission after an assessment by the Commonwealth Secretariat. He proposed further steps on democracy, government and respect for human rights.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after meeting Mnangagwa on Wednesday, Collins said their approach was not a one size fits all.\n\nHe added: That win-win situation is something that I think we all want to ensure future prosperity for Zimbabwe and future prosperity for the UK.\n\nAs we move forward, what we are absolutely clear, our approach is not one size fits all, it is about strengthening our bilateral relations. I said to His Excellency that I am very determined to return to Zimbabwe to ensure that we actually deliver what we promise.\n\n",

The company had to send products via Namibia into Zambia as routes through Mozambique were disturbed by the unrest, impacting working capital and profits negatively.\n\nWith strong performance from Agriculture RSA and mining segment, Omnias revenues for the year to the end of March grew 2.7% to R22.82 billion. Mining has emerged as Omnias strongest business from an outdoor projective.\n\nThere is still a strong demand for metals, you know, the metals that drive that transition to cleaner energy, you know, the battery metals, uranium. So, we are positively disposed to the mining market, and we are winning new customers, renewing new customers, explained Gobalsamy.\n\nHeadline earnings per share increased by 1% to 704 cents, while operating profit remained unchanged at R1.7bn despite the inclusion of the Chemicals restructuring costs, along with the impact of severe drought conditions and currency depreciation in Agriculture Rest of Africa.\n\nThe Mining segment delivered an improved operating margin of 12.4% from 12.1%, supported by strong performance from Mining RSA and Mining International, as well as higher throughput and efficiencies.\n\nIn the mining sector, sustained demand for critical minerals supporting the global energy transition, underpinned exploration activity and supported positive fundamentals for the explosives market.\n\nHowever, geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainty presented ongoing risks.\n\nThe group had a net cash balance of R1.77bn was down from R2.3bn.\n\nThe board declared a total dividend of 675 cents per share for the year. This comprises an increased ordinary dividend of 400 cents, from 375 cents the prior year, and a special dividend of 275 cents per share, returning R1.1bn to shareholders.\n\nDespite persistent macroeconomic headwinds, Omnia delivered sustained profitability and continued to create long-term value for shareholders. This performance reflects the strength, quality, and growing diversity of our portfolio, underpinned by a sharpened focus on manufacturing efficiency, supply chain resilience, and customer-driven innovation, Gobalsamy said\n\nThe increased ordinary dividend payout, and special dividend declared is a clear signal of our confidence in the sustainability of our earnings and the successful execution of our growth and diversification strategy.\n\nLooking ahead, Omnia said the outlook for its Agriculture segment remained positive, driven by expected improvements in agronomic conditions across key regions such as the proprietary Nutriology model.\n\nOmnia said 2026 will be a significant transition year in which non-core assets and business lines will be sold, capital released and returns improved.\n\n",

It is widely considered a critical juncture for Zimbabwes reform agenda.\n\nWhile the Staff Monitored Programme (SMP) does not provide funding, its successful implementation is a prerequisite for future access to concessional financing, potential debt restructuring, and the restoration of confidence among international creditors and investorsall of which Zimbabwe desperately needs.The southern African nation is burdened with a burgeoning public debt that has now exceeded US$21 billion, including more than US$12.3 billion owed to external creditors.Following the visit, IMF Mission Chief Maliszewski said the IMF would like to see a fully functioning local ZiG currency and fiscal discipline with a balance between expenditure and revenue.He also addressed the issue of corruption and stressed the need for a genuine currency exchange market, as well as a credible debt restructuring process.In an attempt to put a positive spin on this, Mangwana posted on his X account his own interpretation of the IMFs comments.The IMF sees macroeconomic stability in Zimbabwe we see it too. They want to see the ZIG becoming fully our national currency  we want that too. They see the ZIG stability we are witnesses.However, Mahere, who is also a constitutional lawyer, strongly disagreed with Mangwanas sentiments.Did you listen carefully to what the IMF representative is actually saying? These are the key takeaways: This Govt has no fiscal discipline. Fiscal discipline is urgently required. The public financial management system is worrisome. Read theres too much corruption.The people need reassurance that the so-called reforms introduced will stay. Read theres no trust or public confidence in what the Govt says about the state of the economy.The ZIG is not yet a national currency. While it may look stable, it is not widely used. The official exchange rate is artificial as demonstrated by the existence of a parallel market rate. The fact that the two dont converge is problematic. You can rig an election but you cannot rig the economy, Mahere wrote on her X account in response to Mangwana.Fourteen months after its introduction, the ZiG currency is still failing to facilitate payments for essential services such as passport issuance, fuel, and other necessities, indicating its shortcomings.The private sector, particularly Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), does not accept ZiG as a form of payment in its daily transactions, leaving many, especially civil servants, searching for US dollars on the parallel market, where the exchange rate is US$1: 40 ZiG, even though the Treasury has set the official exchange rate at US$1: 27 ZiG.\n\nWhile the Staff Monitored Programme (SMP) does not provide funding, its successful implementation is a prerequisite for future access to concessional financing, potential debt restructuring, and the restoration of confidence among international creditors and investorsall of which Zimbabwe desperately needs.\n\nThe southern African nation is burdened with a burgeoning public debt that has now exceeded US$21 billion, including more than US$12.3 billion owed to external creditors.\n\nFollowing the visit, IMF Mission Chief Maliszewski said the IMF would like to see a fully functioning local ZiG currency and fiscal discipline with a balance between expenditure and revenue.\n\nHe also addressed the issue of corruption and stressed the need for a genuine currency exchange market, as well as a credible debt restructuring process.\n\nIn an attempt to put a positive spin on this, Mangwana posted on his X account his own interpretation of the IMFs comments.\n\nThe IMF sees macroeconomic stability in Zimbabwe we see it too.
