            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nWAR veteran Blessed Runesu Geza, known is his circles as Bombshell, has called for a national shutdown this week in a bid to force President Emmerson Mnangagwa to step down.\n\nThe call comes barely a month after Geza mobilised for the March 31 countrywide protests against Mnangagwas leadership.\n\nThe March 31 protests largely turned into a stay-away, as members of the public remained at home with almost every business closed in all towns.\n\nThe outspoken war veteran, who is currently in hiding, urged all Zimbabweans to stay at home on Tuesday and Wednesday, whose dates fall on April 22 and 23, in protest against what he described as Mnangagwas corrupt and failing government.\n\nBarely hours after Mnangagwa, during his Independence Day address, appealed against using social media for incitement, Geza took to social media to urge Zimbabweans to express disapproval of the 82-year-old Zanu PF leaders rule through the shutdown.\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, the 22nd and 23rd of April 2025, everyone must stay home. We must shut down Zimbabwe completely.\n\nThis is to send a strong message to Mnangagwa and his zvigananda. Shops and industries will not open, and kombis will be parked.\n\nThe police will not teargas you, but if they ever come to you, you have the right to defend yourselves, Geza said.\n\nGeza also said Mnangagwas control over State institutions and the ban on demonstrations has made staying at home a powerful form of resistance.\n\nMnangagwa has taken control of the judiciary and shuts down Parliament at his own discretion.\n\nZimbabwe stands out as the only country where public demonstrations are effectively banned, so we have discovered that staying at home is one of the few powerful tools we still have to make our voices heard.\n\nI am pleading with you to stay home, I know it is hard considering we are leaving from hand to mouth. So fellow Zimbabweans we are staying away to force Mnangagwa to step down, added Geza.\n\nLast month, a total 98 suspects were arrested for allegedly participating in the flash March 31 protests in Harare, which were violently dispersed by police and only three have been released on bail.\n\n",

            "content": "By Chris Lau l CNN\n\nIF the idea of robots taking on humans in a road race conjures dystopian images of android athletic supremacy, then fear not, for now at least.\n\nMore than 20 two-legged robots competed in the worlds first humanoid half-marathon in China on Saturday, and  though technologically impressive  they were far from outrunning their human masters over the long distance.\n\nTeams from several companies and universities took part in the race, a showcase of Chinas advances on humanoid technology as it plays catch-up with the US, which still boasts the more sophisticated models.\n\nAnd the chief of the winning team said their robot  though bested by the humans in this particular race  was a match for similar models from the West, at a time when the race to perfect humanoid technology is hotting up.\n\nComing in a variety of shapes and sizes, the robots jogged through Beijings southeastern Yizhuang district, home to many of the capitals tech firms.\n\nOver the past few months, videos of Chinas humanoid robots performing bike rides, roundhouse kicks and side flips have blown up the internet, often amplified by state media as a key potential driver of economic growth.\n\nIn a 2023 policy document, Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology identified the humanoid robotics industry as a new frontier in technological competition, setting a 2025 target for mass production and secure supply chains for core components.\n\nFears have mounted in recent years about how artificial intelligence  and robots  may one day outsmart humans.\n\nAnd while AI models are fast gaining ground, sparking concern for everything from security to the future of work, Saturdays race suggested that humans still at least have the upper hand when it comes to running.\n\nThe robots were pitted against 12,000 human contestants, running side by side with them in a fenced-off lane.\n\nAfter setting off from a country park, participating robots had to overcome slight slopes and a winding 21-kilometer (13-mile) circuit before they could reach the finish line, according to state-run outlet Beijing Daily.\n\nJust as human runners needed to replenish themselves with water, robot contestants were allowed to get new batteries during the race. Companies were also allowed to swap their androids with substitutes when they could no longer compete, though each substitution came with a 10-minute penalty.\n\nThe first robot across the finish line, Tiangong Ultra  created by the Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center  finished the route in two hours and 40 minutes. Thats nearly two hours short of the human world record of 56:42, held by Ugandan runner Jacob Kiplimo. The winner of the mens race on Saturday finished in 1 hour and 2 minutes.\n\nTang Jian, chief technology officer for the robotics innovation center, said Tiangong Ultras performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon.\n\nI dont want to boast but I think no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangongs sporting achievements, Tang said, according to the Reuters news agency, adding that the robot switched batteries just three times during the race.\n\nThe 1.8-meter robot came across a few challenges during the race, which involved the multiple battery changes. It also needed a helper to run alongside it with his hands hovering around his back, in case of a fall.\n\nMost of the robots required this kind of support, with a few tied to a leash. Some were led by a remote control.\n\nAmateur human contestants running in the other lane had no difficulty keeping up, with the curious among them taking out their phones to capture the robotic encounters as they raced along.\n\n",

For that reason, this Court has no basis to interfere with it, said Justice Mathonsi, who was sitting with Susan Mavangira and Joseph Musakwa.\n\nThe bench also noted that the court analysed the circumstances under which the offences were committed and noted that the appellants had engaged in a spree of criminal activities by moving around Gweru draining transformer oil and selling it to different individuals.\n\nThe court took note of the fact that the appellants had disadvantaged the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) by stealing a total of 11 530 litres of oil and causing damage to transformers amounting to $96 750.\n\nThe court further noted that the appellants were an organized criminal gang which operated under the cover of darkness and meticulously planned the execution of the crimes.\n\nAlso, their criminal escapades resulted in communities and industries suffering due to non-availability of electricity.\n\nAfter analysing the totality of the above considerations, the court found that a sentence based on purely the mandatory sentence of ten years would be draconian, abnormal and excessive to the extreme and induce an extreme sense of shock.\n\nThe court then exercised its discretion and arrived at a calculation of three years per count with some counts running concurrently.\n\nThis was done in the exercise of sentencing discretion which, as already stated, was improper but cannot be upset because, firstly it was favorable to the appellants and, secondly, none of the parties has challenged it, said the judges before dismissing the appeal.\n\nThe Chibunhes were charged along with two other individuals in the Provincial Magistrates Court in Gweru on 18 counts of violating section 60 A(3) of the Electricity Act [Chapter 13:19], as referenced with section 2 (3)(b) of the Electricity Amendment Act, enacted via Statutory Instrument No. 12 of 2007.\n\nAll counts involved vandalizing, cutting, damaging, destroying, or interfering with equipment used for transmitting, distributing, or supplying electricity.\n\nThe State established that from 11 February to 29 June 2013, the appellants, alongside two accomplices, orchestrated a coordinated criminal operation throughout Gweru that entailed the theft of transformer oil totaling 11,530 liters.\n\nThey caused widespread power outages and significant financial losses to the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), the national electricity supplier, the state asserted.\n\nJacob pleaded not guilty to all charges, while Masimba admitted guilt to just one count but denied the others.\n\nEvidence demonstrated that the two, in collaboration with accomplices James Mahachi and Francis Madziva, used a red Honda Fit with registration number ACW 7466 to commit their crimes in Gweru.\n\nThe State argued that over a span of five months, primarily between 8:00 pm and 8:00 am, the Chibunhes specifically targeted at least 18 transformers, siphoning off a total of 11,530 liters of oil and causing damages estimated at no less than $96,750.\n\nThe stolen oil was then sold to omnibus operators with whom they had established connections.\n\n",
