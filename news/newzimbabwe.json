            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOpposition leader Tendai Biti has launched a scathing attack on President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration, accusing it of being driven by greed and transforming Zimbabwe into a rag-tag corrupt extractive entity over the past eight years, dashing the hopes of improved governance that many held when they backed the 2017 military coup that removed the late former President Robert Mugabe.\n\nThis November marks eight years since the military coup dubbed Operation Restore Legacy, which ushered in a new administration under Mnangagwa.\n\nBiti argues that the countrys social and economic conditions have deteriorated further under Mnangagwa and that it has now become clear Zimbabweans regret taking to the streets in support of the coup.\n\nFormer cabinet minister Tendai Biti\n\nIn 8 years they have watched their dreams being butchered by a ruthless cantankerous regime that has no limits nor elasticity. The Frankenstein that Mugabe was has been replaced by a ghoulish vampire sobriquet driven by greed, corruption, voyeurism and bohemianism. There are no more rules. There are no more standards. There is no longer ideology, principle or any higher norm. A pack of hungry ravenous hyenas are on steroids consuming everything and anything in their way, Biti wrote on X on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the Prosecutor General, Zimbabwe is losing at least US$2 billion annually to corruption and ranks149th on the International Corruption Index. Biti says the scale of graft reflects a government driven by greed.\n\nAdded Biti: Zimbabwes mines, its gold, its lithium, its chrome are on the guillotine, being looted with a ferocity that would make Cecil John Rhodes wince in embarrassment.\n\nThe countrys State Enterprises have been privatised and captured under a shady web called the Mutapa Fund. A ghost caricature that operates outside the reach of Parliament and line Ministries.\n\nBiti further accused Treasury of abandoning basic oversight principlesand operatinglike a tuck shop, with funds reportedly disbursed to tenderpreneurs willing to pay kickbacks.\n\nFormer Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Budget and Finance chairperson Energy Mutodi told Parliament in October that the Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Finance, George Guvamatanga, was demanding kickbacks from ministries and government contractors of between 5% and 10%, reportedly reaching as much as US$200,000 per disbursement.\n\nThe National Purse, once jealously protected by years of British tradition of checks and balance, is now a little tuck shop that makes disbursements to anyone prepared to pay the proverbial ten percent to a coterie of Bandits clad in Savile Row suits, Biti added.\n\nThe former Finance Minister also criticised Mnangagwas handling of major tenders, saying controversial businessmen such as Kudakwashe Tagwirei and Wicknell Chivayo had become major beneficiaries of opaque procurement processes.\n\nTenderpreneurs who have cut their teeth in Command Agriculture and fuel are the new High Priests of a decadent dystopian reality created by 18 November. The party of Tekere and Herbert Chitepo, a pan African moment is now the embarrassed harem of Rolls-Royce-riding buffoons in oversized pajamas. It is now a parallel entity flanked by engineered affiliates united only by greed and vacuousness, he added.\n\nVice President Constantino Chiwenga has publicly labelled the controversial tenderpreneurs as a corrupt business mafia deserving imprisonment, while Mnangagwa has described them as philanthropists, insisting he cannot dictate how they spend their money.\n\nA few months ago, Chiwenga reportedly tabled a corruption dossier in a Zanu PF Politburo meeting, implicating Chivayo, Tagwirei, Delish Nguwaya, Pedzai Sakupwanya and Paul Tungwarara, questioning why no arrests had been made.\n\n",

The hosts, under recently appointed manager Romanian Marian Marinica, who replaced Michael Nees a few weeks ago, fell behind when Mohamed Gouda scored on just nine minutes.\n\nHowever, Munashe Garananga equalised midway through the first half, with Belgian Pro League club Mechelen winger Bill Antonio grabbing a winner on 74 minutes to seal a long-awaited triumph. Writing on Instagram, then looking ahead to the Africa Cup of Nations which sees Zimbabwe take on Angola, Egypt and South Africa in Group B, the competition starting on December 21, with the first game against Egypt on Saturday, December 22, Nakamba believes the victory was a huge momentum going into the tournament.\n\nHe said: A BIG THANK YOU to all Zimbabweans who were rallying behind us back from home, all over the world and those in Qatar, Saudi Arabia who came out in numbers to support us during the international friendly matches. Without you, we feel incomplete. Thank you to the ZIFA leadership, led by the Zifa president Nqobile Magwizi for organising such kind of international friendlies matches. Thank you to the Minister of Tourism, Honourable Barbara Rwodzi, who took time to visit the team in camp and to watch us play against Algeria in Saudi Arabia on Thursday, even though we disappointingly lost that match 3-1.\n\nLastly, I want to thank the corporate world and all football stakeholders, we dearly need your support in everything we do, kindly chip in, help and support us. The victory against Qatar brings confidence and renewed zeal within the squad, especially with just a few weeks left before the prestigious AFCON tournament. As players, we always play with our hearts out, I believe with your support and if we all pull in one direction, we will get it right. This is the moment we need your support the most. Thank you, Zimbabweans.\n\n",

This is affecting peoples livelihoods. You would find that people are just relocated without improving their livelihoods.\n\nWhat is the government policy in terms of people who are being displaced by mining activities, where you find, them being relocated to areas which are not conducive? he said.\n\nHis concerns come just two months after President Emmerson Mnangagwa directed Parliament to expedite the long-overdue Mines and Minerals Bill to address ongoing disputes between miners, farmers, and communities.\n\nResponding to the issue, Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister responsible for Oil and Gas Research and other Strategic Minerals Exploration, Caleb Makwiranzou, acknowledged the challenges.\n\nThe Deputy Minister said, Before giving permission to miners, we require a report, which is called the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is a report, which looks at the community which is going to be affected, and where they are going to be relocated. If they going to receive houses where they are going to be relocated, then after getting that report, that is where we allow mining companies to go ahead.\n\nMakwiranzou also highlighted provisions in the new law.\n\nI want to inform this House that the new law [H. B. 1, 2025] allows that if someone has their field or their farm and there is a need for mining to be done in that field, that person is given the first option. The person is asked whether they allow the miners, and then they can discuss with whoever wants to mine if there is an allocation of shares. The person can then be given shares.\n\nOn the other hand, if that person is to be relocated, it should be consensual. They must give consent because the previous law was causing disputes where there was conflict between the Minerals Act and the Agricultural Act, said Makwiranzou.\n\nHowever, Chief Chikwaka argued that, in reality, no environmental impact assessments were being conducted before mining begins.\n\nThere is no Environmental Impact Assessment, which is being done. You would find that miners are just coming into the community. They start drilling in peoples fields. They start mining and excavating in peoples fields and leave such fields open.\n\nThey do not cover the pits and the original farmer cannot farm on his land because there are pits. There is a need for consultation with stakeholders, Chief Chikwaka said.\n\nMakwiranzou stressed that operating without an EIA is illegal, adding that government would send inspectors to the affected communities and block the mining activities.\n\n",
