In a stark revelation, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Police Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, claimed a powerful criminal syndicate has infiltrated South Africas law enforcement and judicial systems.\n\nMkhwanazi went one step further, accusing Mchunu of meddling in sensitive cases and colluding with a businessman accused of murder, aiming to dismantle the task force investigating a spate of political killings in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nIn light of these explosive allegations, President Ramaphosa has taken decisive action, placing Mchunu on special leave while also initiating a judicial commission of inquiry to be led by Acting Deputy Chief Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga.\n\nThe commission is tasked with investigating claims of interference in investigations, complicity among government officials, and the suppression of crucial law enforcement activities.\n\nMchunu, embroiled in controversy over the past week, has been accused by Mkhwanazi of being entwined with drug cartels and influential business concerns.\n\nAmong the allegations presented was an assertion that Lieutenant-General Shadrack Sibiya, deputy national commissioner for crime detection, colluded with Mchunu and a known information dealer, Brown Mogotsi, in a plot to disband the KwaZulu-Natal political killings task team.\n\nPolice Commissioner Masemola announced that Sibiya would also be requesting a leave of absence while investigations unfold, indicating a stern approach to restoring integrity within the police service.\n\n",

Stability measures crime levels, civil unrest, and the threat of conflict.\n\nHealthcare assesses the quality and availability of public and private services. Culture and environment consider factors like climate, recreational options, and personal freedoms.\n\nEducation is judged by access to quality public and private schooling, while infrastructure focuses on roads, transport, housing, and global connectivity. These combined metrics provide a snapshot of how liveable a city is for its residents.\n\nMost African nations are grappling with persistent economic pressures, insecurity, and strained public services.\n\nIn many of these cities, ongoing political unrest, insecurity, limited access to quality healthcare, and under-resourced education systems contribute topoor livability scores.\n\nIn Nigeria, cities like Lagos and Port Harcourt continue to suffer from overcrowding, inadequate healthcare systems, and rising crime rates, while Zimbabwes capital, Harare, remains burdened by hyperinflation, aging infrastructure, and limited access to essential services.\n\nAlgeria and Libya have also been named among the worldsmost difficult placesto live, joining Nigeria and Zimbabwe in a ranking that highlights the pressures facing several African cities.\n\nFor example, Tripoli in Libya continues to struggle with the effects of prolonged conflict and weakened institutions, while Algiers faces structural economic challenges and restrictions on civil liberties.\n\nThese issues are compounded byinadequate infrastructureand housing conditions that fall short of global standards.\n\nThe table below presents the ten most challenging cities to live in globally.\n\nCities at the bottom of the liveability rankings are predominantly located in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting persistent instability, limited infrastructure, and constrained access to quality services.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe trial in which two Chinese nationals, Zhao Jiatong and William Chui are facing fraud charges after they allegedly conned hundreds of people in a pyramid scheme has commenced before Harare Magistrate Francis Mapfumo, with the two denying the allegations.\n\nThe court heard two socialites, Tyra Chikocho, better known as Madam Boss and Admire Mushambi aka Mama Vee, will testify in court.\n\nJiatong is still locked up in jail.\n\nJiatong and Chui denied conning people, telling the court that their arrest came as a surprise.\n\nThe accused (Jiatong) will tell the court that he is not good in the English language, such that he never communicated with any of the state witnesses at any given time, his lawyer submitted.\n\nJiatong said he had never benefited from the alleged fraud and never attempted to run away because he knew nothing regarding the scheme.\n\nHe was surprised when he was arrested in connection with this case and nothing incriminating was found upon his person or in his phone or anywhere else.\n\nHe will thereof put the state to the strict proof thereof, read his defence outline.\n\nChui echoed the same sentiments telling court that he never had any communication with the complainants.\n\nHe also said no complainant named him in their statements.\n\nAllegations against Jiaotong are that in January 2023, he hatched a plan to defraud unsuspecting Zimbabweans through an online investment Ponzi scheme.\n\nIt is alleged that on 7 February, Jiaotong and his alleged accomplices registered a company with the Zimbabwean Registrar of Companies, styled E-Creator Electronic Commerce [Private] Limited under company registration number 2853/23, with its office situated at room number 15 and 16, 10th Floor Joina City Building, Harare.\n\nThey went on to launch the company as an online e-commerce operator with the global internet as its core.\n\nIt is alleged that from February to July 2023, they misrepresented to unsuspecting Zimbabweans that if they invested with the company, they were going to enjoy huge monthly profits proportional to the amounts invested.\n\nAs such, many Zimbabweans joined and invested up to US$1 million in total through various Ecocash subscriber lines supplied on the platform by the suspect.\n\nIt is further alleged that to make the company more attractive and appealing to unsuspecting clients, Jiaotong used the media, including the national television broadcaster Zimbabwean Television (ZTV), social media and socialites Madam Boss, and Mama Vee to advertise the business on their social media platforms.\n\nThey also employed various agents in major towns and cities throughout the country in order to market the business.\n\nOn July 3, some of the complaints encountered challenges in accessing their funds and approached the company for clarification, prosecutors said.\n\nOne of the accused assured these complainants that it was a system upgrade that was affecting their access to their funds.\n\nHe further advised them that the situation would normalise in due course.\n\nHowever, on 5 July 2023, the state says, complainants were shocked to realise that E-Creator Electronic Commerce [Private] Limited had sent a notice on their website that they were no longer operating, and they posted the passport photo of accused Jiaotong as the one who had taken their investments and absconded to China.\n\nClients are said to have visited the investors offices to find directors having vacated the premises with nothing to suggest they were still continuing with operations.\n\nIt is also alleged that clients were informed that Jiaotong had withdrawn their investments and fled.\n\nAs a result of his actions, prosecutors allege, clients suffered an actual prejudice of US$1 million, and nothing was recovered.\n\n",
