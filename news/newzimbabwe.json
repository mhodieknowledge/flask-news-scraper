            "content": "By IOL\n\nIT was a dream return home for South Africas world champion Nkosi Ndebele.\n\nOn Saturday night, at the Grand Arena in Goodwood, Cape Town, the former BRAVE CF Bantamweight champion competed in Mzansi for the first time in seven years  and delivered the ultimate homecoming performance.Ndebele featured on the historic PFL Africa card at GrandWest Casino and Entertainment World, where passionate South African MMA fans were treated to a world-class night of action.Fighting in the inaugural PFL Africa tournament, Ndebele (9-3) wasted no time advancing to the semi-finals of the bantamweight knockout competition. He stopped Egyptian opponent Mahmoud Atef (5-3) via TKO (strikes) with just 10 seconds remaining in the opening round.Im feeling great  what an experience to fight in front of my home crowd, my people, friends and family after all these years, said Ndebele, who last fought on South African soil at BRAVE CF 19 in 2018 before forging an international career with the Bahrain-based promotion.I know a lot of people didnt know who Nkosi is. Im just glad they got to see a glimpse of it today. This is only the beginning. That crowd reaction was something else. These are the moments I dream of.When I was backstage, I told my corner, Let me enjoy this moment. I visualise things like this  a huge crowd, and me being happy, and going crazy.To experience that and connect with the fans I just wanted to connect with them more. This is the first time Ive ever experienced such a crowd, a packed arena, a sold-out venue.Ndebele looked composed from the first bell, controlling every aspect of the fight inside the PFL SmartCage. Atef lacked the firepower to trouble the South African and became increasingly hesitant as the strikes piled up.Even when the Egyptian attempted to grapple, Ndebele stayed composed, expertly managing the exchanges with calculated movement, breath control, and positional dominance.Eventually, Ndebele dragged Atef to the canvas and unleashed a flurry of strikes to the body and head. The referee was left with no choice but to wave it off with 10 seconds left in the first round, triggering wild celebrations as chants of Nkosi rang out across the arena.This is only the beginning. More spectacular victories are coming! said a jubilant Ndebele. I am meant for greatness, and this journey with PFL Africa is the path to that greatness.The PFLs African tournament will span four events across the continent in 2024. The new PFL Africa franchise forms part of the organisations global expansion and features 32 fighters from 15 African nations, all competing across four divisions for the inaugural PFL Africa title and a shot at greater opportunities within the PFL system.Saturdays show also included the PFL Champions Series: Road to Dubai card, featuring some of the worlds top MMA talent. Global stars AJ McKee, Corey Anderson, Dakota Ditcheva, Johnny Eblen, Takeshi Izumi, Akhmed Magomedov, and Costello van Steenis all featured under the Grand Arenas bright lights.Following the nights results, the semi-final matchups in the bantamweight division will see Ndebele face Zimbabwes unbeaten Simbarashe Hokonya (6-0), while Boule Godogo (4-0) takes on Karim Henniene (5-0).Saturdays event also hosted the opening round of the heavyweight bracket.

And the number increases as time goes on.\n\nSo we are saying 1,300 plus more each year, which means a large number of children are dying, said Machawira.\n\nHe also noted that for many children born with heart problems, receiving treatment after the age of two has limited impact, as they would have already been debilitated by the illness.\n\nOutside of the two camps with Egyptian specialists, Machawira said Parirenyatwa Hospital has performed around 55 open heart surgeries from June 2023 to date.\n\nZimbabwe has limited capacity to offer open heart surgeries due to a lack of resources and personnel while most patients with heart-related ailments cannot afford treatment abroad, where costs can be as high as US$15,000.\n\n",

            "content": "By Daily Maverick\n\nRECENT demonstrations against foreign nationals at public healthcare facilities have intensified arguments that taxpayer-funded institutions, already overstretched, are being unfairly used.Though these concerns are not entirely unfounded, as South Africa provides constitutionally protected healthcare to all inside its borders, the demonstrations reveal a deeper systemic issue in our public healthcare system.South Africas relative stability positions it as a migration destination for the citizens of many neighbouring countries, having a significant impact on border healthcare facilities. Combined with the legacy of apartheid-era health infrastructure, the attention given to foreign nationals often becomes a distraction from deeper systemic issues.The reality is that healthcare infrastructure has persistently lagged behind demand and population growth, irrespective of nationality. Many border-area hospitals face heightened pressure, not primarily from migration, but rather from longstanding underinvestment in capacity and resources.South Africas healthcare expenditureAbout 8% of South Africas GDP is dedicated to healthcare, translating to about R10,000 per person annually. This expenditure includes both public and private healthcare sectors.Its about one-tenth that of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, but similar to regional neighbours such as Namibia, which spends about R8,000 per person.However, raw spending figures mean little without outcome comparisons using metrics such as life expectancy, which in South Africa is slightly higher than in Namibia or Botswana.But Professor Alex van den Heever, chair in the field of social security systems administration and management studies at Wits University, says life expectancy is too broad as a metric.Look at maternal mortality, he suggested.Maternal mortality statistics highlight healthcare governance and management shortcomings, suggesting that the primary issue is not hospitals being overrun by foreign nationals.Despite having a substantial public healthcare system, South Africa has one of the highest rates of private medical insurance globally, covering about 16% of the population, according to the Council for Medical Schemes. This starkly underscores disparities in healthcare access and spending in the country.An average patient-day equivalent in a public hospital costs about R3,700 to R4,000, according to the National Treasurys 2023 Budget Review. This figure represents the total cost of providing care for one patient for one full day, encompassing all associated expenses such as staffing, medication and supplies. Notably, 64% of this cost goes to wages.Van den Heever emphasises that despite significant wage increases since 2007, staffing levels have remained largely static, highlighting inefficiencies in resource allocation. Specific treatment costs underline this: a Caesarean section ranges from R18,000 to R22,000; tuberculosis treatment costs between R6,000 and R8,000; and antiretroviral treatment averages between R3,000 and R4,000 annually per patient.The numbers paint a bleak picture of what is being spent per person annually, and they fail to demonstrate the human cost and distress caused to those denied access to care.Janet*, a Zimbabwean who has been living in South Africa for more than a decade with a valid Zimbabwean Exemption Permit, described the challenges she faced.They [the hospital staff] said, Why are you here? Because youre a foreigner you must pay a certain amount  if you dont pay, they wont treat you.The interaction occurred when Janet was seven months pregnant and went to Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital in Johannesburg for a routine checkup.They insulted me. They said I must pay because Im a foreigner. They didnt want to check my ID or see my papers. They just said if I dont pay, I must go home, Janet said, noting that many other people in her community  legally in South Africa from Zimbabwe  have faced similar challenges.She stopped going to her appointments in the run-up to giving birth.They told me to pay R470 every week. I couldnt afford it, so I just stopped going.She only returned when it was time to give birth.A 2023 Health Ombud investigative report found that 40% of patients admitted at the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital were foreign nationals (although the investigation did not stipulate whether they were documented or undocumented).Despite these significant numbers, there remains no mechanism for cross-border billing. The existing Southern African Development Community protocol addresses disease outbreaks, but it excludes routine healthcare services.No data system exists to raise an account [] The issue has drifted for 50 years, Van den Heever confirmed.Fixing the systemDespite severe criticism and resistance from some quarters, including over its costs and funding, the government is pressing ahead with the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme.The Department of Healths spokesperson, Foster Mohale, confirms that NHI implementation is in its initial phase, focused on foundational, institutional and organisational arrangements.The NHI implementation is going well with phase 1 (20232026) under way, establishing foundational structures including the NHI Fund, Mohale said.Phase 1 provides for ministerial advisory committees focusing on healthcare benefits and health technology assessment, which should be complete by July 2025.Mohale said the department has also rolled out a supply chain management and payment checklist, pre- and post-audits, and a CFO forum to tighten procurement controls and reduce irregular spending.The NHI alone might not bring the redress needed, but foreign nationals using South Africas healthcare system is not the core challenge either. Hospital beds were already underfunded and overstretched long before border crossings increased.The Auditor-General flagged about R1.8-billion as fruitless expenditure in the 2022/23 financial year, a sum significantly greater than any healthcare costs directly attributable to foreign nationals.Van den Heever noted: Its cyclical  foreign nationals are the bogeyman every election.Structural inefficiencies mean longer wait times and diminished healthcare quality for the average South African patient. They wait longer for beds, or forever  but its not because those beds are being occupied by others. The core issues lie in systemic inefficiencies, inadequate infrastructure investment and weak governance.Effectively fixing South Africas healthcare system means fixing its management and money first. Migration and foreign nationals are an easy target, especially during election season, but theyre not the real reason people lie waiting for treatment in hospital corridors. Without real improvements in governance, finance and basic infrastructure, the promise stays a promise.Surname has been withheld.\n\nRECENT demonstrations against foreign nationals at public healthcare facilities have intensified arguments that taxpayer-funded institutions, already overstretched, are being unfairly used.\n\nThough these concerns are not entirely unfounded, as South Africa provides constitutionally protected healthcare to all inside its borders, the demonstrations reveal a deeper systemic issue in our public healthcare system.South Africas relative stability positions it as a migration destination for the citizens of many neighbouring countries, having a significant impact on border healthcare facilities.

Specific treatment costs underline this: a Caesarean section ranges from R18,000 to R22,000; tuberculosis treatment costs between R6,000 and R8,000; and antiretroviral treatment averages between R3,000 and R4,000 annually per patient.The numbers paint a bleak picture of what is being spent per person annually, and they fail to demonstrate the human cost and distress caused to those denied access to care.Janet*, a Zimbabwean who has been living in South Africa for more than a decade with a valid Zimbabwean Exemption Permit, described the challenges she faced.They [the hospital staff] said, Why are you here? Because youre a foreigner you must pay a certain amount  if you dont pay, they wont treat you.The interaction occurred when Janet was seven months pregnant and went to Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital in Johannesburg for a routine checkup.They insulted me. They said I must pay because Im a foreigner. They didnt want to check my ID or see my papers. They just said if I dont pay, I must go home, Janet said, noting that many other people in her community  legally in South Africa from Zimbabwe  have faced similar challenges.She stopped going to her appointments in the run-up to giving birth.They told me to pay R470 every week. I couldnt afford it, so I just stopped going.She only returned when it was time to give birth.A 2023 Health Ombud investigative report found that 40% of patients admitted at the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital were foreign nationals (although the investigation did not stipulate whether they were documented or undocumented).Despite these significant numbers, there remains no mechanism for cross-border billing. The existing Southern African Development Community protocol addresses disease outbreaks, but it excludes routine healthcare services.No data system exists to raise an account [] The issue has drifted for 50 years, Van den Heever confirmed.Fixing the systemDespite severe criticism and resistance from some quarters, including over its costs and funding, the government is pressing ahead with the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme.The Department of Healths spokesperson, Foster Mohale, confirms that NHI implementation is in its initial phase, focused on foundational, institutional and organisational arrangements.The NHI implementation is going well with phase 1 (20232026) under way, establishing foundational structures including the NHI Fund, Mohale said.Phase 1 provides for ministerial advisory committees focusing on healthcare benefits and health technology assessment, which should be complete by July 2025.Mohale said the department has also rolled out a supply chain management and payment checklist, pre- and post-audits, and a CFO forum to tighten procurement controls and reduce irregular spending.The NHI alone might not bring the redress needed, but foreign nationals using South Africas healthcare system is not the core challenge either. Hospital beds were already underfunded and overstretched long before border crossings increased.The Auditor-General flagged about R1.8-billion as fruitless expenditure in the 2022/23 financial year, a sum significantly greater than any healthcare costs directly attributable to foreign nationals.Van den Heever noted: Its cyclical  foreign nationals are the bogeyman every election.Structural inefficiencies mean longer wait times and diminished healthcare quality for the average South African patient. They wait longer for beds, or forever  but its not because those beds are being occupied by others. The core issues lie in systemic inefficiencies, inadequate infrastructure investment and weak governance.Effectively fixing South Africas healthcare system means fixing its management and money first. Migration and foreign nationals are an easy target, especially during election season, but theyre not the real reason people lie waiting for treatment in hospital corridors. Without real improvements in governance, finance and basic infrastructure, the promise stays a promise.Surname has been withheld.\n\nSouth Africas healthcare expenditure\n\nAbout 8% of South Africas GDP is dedicated to healthcare, translating to about R10,000 per person annually. This expenditure includes both public and private healthcare sectors.\n\nIts about one-tenth that of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, but similar to regional neighbours such as Namibia, which spends about R8,000 per person.However, raw spending figures mean little without outcome comparisons using metrics such as life expectancy, which in South Africa is slightly higher than in Namibia or Botswana.But Professor Alex van den Heever, chair in the field of social security systems administration and management studies at Wits University, says life expectancy is too broad as a metric.Look at maternal mortality, he suggested.Maternal mortality statistics highlight healthcare governance and management shortcomings, suggesting that the primary issue is not hospitals being overrun by foreign nationals.Despite having a substantial public healthcare system, South Africa has one of the highest rates of private medical insurance globally, covering about 16% of the population, according to the Council for Medical Schemes. This starkly underscores disparities in healthcare access and spending in the country.An average patient-day equivalent in a public hospital costs about R3,700 to R4,000, according to the National Treasurys 2023 Budget Review.

This figure represents the total cost of providing care for one patient for one full day, encompassing all associated expenses such as staffing, medication and supplies. Notably, 64% of this cost goes to wages.\n\nVan den Heever emphasises that despite significant wage increases since 2007, staffing levels have remained largely static, highlighting inefficiencies in resource allocation. Specific treatment costs underline this: a Caesarean section ranges from R18,000 to R22,000; tuberculosis treatment costs between R6,000 and R8,000; and antiretroviral treatment averages between R3,000 and R4,000 annually per patient.The numbers paint a bleak picture of what is being spent per person annually, and they fail to demonstrate the human cost and distress caused to those denied access to care.Janet*, a Zimbabwean who has been living in South Africa for more than a decade with a valid Zimbabwean Exemption Permit, described the challenges she faced.They [the hospital staff] said, Why are you here?
