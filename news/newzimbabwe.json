            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal) to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, we understand that theZimDiaspora Property Showcase is backinthe UK and will be held in Birmingham, UK on 12thJuly, 2025. What can the diaspora market expect?\n\nVM: Yes, I am glad that the Zim Diaspora Property Showcase is back in the UK and will be held in Birmingham on Saturday, 12thJuly, 2025 at the Hilton Metropole between 10am to 5pm.\n\nThanks again to its organisers, Seeff Zimbabwe, this showcase is unique in that it allows real estate and complementary businesses operating in Zimbabwe to engage and discuss with the market in the Diaspora. What is key to latch on to is that these businesses were already offering services to the diaspora market.\n\nThe difference now is that the Zimbabwe-based businesses and the diaspora market can operate from a position of mutual understanding and benefit. The aim is to create a symbiotic and not parasitic relationship between the businesses and their markets.\n\nThe event will showcase businesses in the Zimbabwe real estate industry, including complementary businesses like construction companies, money transfer agents, building equipment suppliers and mortgage providers to engage with their market, tinkering with their payment options to suit specific markets.\n\nReporter:What can the UK community expect from the event?\n\nVM: The community in the United Kingdom can expect that the 15 or more companies attending the event from Zimbabwe will showcase exciting deals and real estate products for the UK market.\n\nOur first showcase in July last year in Birmingham opened the business attendees eyes to the unique needs of this particular market. The diaspora property showcase in Texas, USA assisted the Zimbabwe businesses to understand the general needs of the diaspora community in their quest to invest and have properties in Zimbabwe.\n\nI say this so that the attendees understand that the participants this year have a more developed idea of how to tailor their products for this unique market to allow for more people to own properties, while also considering their unique economic and social obligations in their host countries. A commercialquid pro quo.\n\nReporter: What can we expect from your presentation on legal issues affecting property investments?\n\nVM: I suppose I represent one of the complementary businesses, as no property transaction in Zimbabwe can be done without the assistance of a lawyer and if somehow it is done without one, in more cases than not, a lawyer will get involved at a later stage to mitigate the mess.\n\nMy presentation at the conference will be aimed at clarifying or simplifying to the UK diaspora community the Zimbabwe legal and regulatory framework for real estate investment. My presentation will cover the investment process, including other ancillary social and commercial issues that may affect such investment.\n\nThe overarching objective is to ensure that potential investors at the conference are able to invest safely and wisely in Zimbabwe. To the foreign investors, my presentation will include issues related to the repatriation of capital and profits on disinvestment.\n\nReporter: The main concern for the diaspora is that they are not duped of their hard-earned money, will your presentation also look at what to do not to be duped?\n\nVM: That will be the crux of my presentation to mitigate that possibility so that attendees do not fall victim to fraudsters.\n\nOur property development sector is growing and the natural thing in any growing industry is that unscrupulous people view it as an opportunity for quick gains. The carrot normally being unrealistic deals that offer quick and commercially ridiculous gains.\n\nIt has been my experience that real estate investments should be made with a sober mindset having completed the necessary due diligence required. It is your classic aphorism, all that glitters is not gold.\n\nReporter: Are there any other presenters?\n\nVM: Yes, we have heads of banks and banking departments presenting at the conference offering mortgages and other financial products, Real Estate directors and agents, property developers, alternative energy players and many more attending and presenting at the conference.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima. We have to end here due to time constraints.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

The hostels are characterised by raw sewage and a lack of water, amid a ballooning number of residents.\n\nCHRA said the situation is likely to worsen, with HCC failing to take responsibility for renovating the flats.\n\nThe court had ruled that the city must take immediate action to restore dignity and protect public health by upgrading the dilapidated and unsanitary Mbare hostels, which have long suffered from broken sewer systems, water shortages, and unsafe living conditions.\n\nNow, instead of complying with the judgment, the City of Harare is fighting to reverse the ruling, raising alarm bells among housing rights advocates and public health experts. This move threatens to deepen the housing and hygiene crisis already faced by thousands of Mbare residents, many of whom live in overcrowded, hazardous environments, said CHRA.\n\n",

We owe it to Job Sikhala. I was the secretary general of the last united CCC and we betrayed him. We didnt offer the solidarity that was expected by our ordinary members. And today I stand here to apologise, he said.\n\nChalton Hwende\n\nHwende also stated that Sikhalas prolonged stay in prison was due to the democratic movement not pushing hard enough for his release.\n\nIf the united democratic movement had offered the same solidarity that was expected by our ordinary members, this man would not have stayed in prison for over 500 days, Hwende said, to applause from the audience, including Sikhala himself and Bulawayo Mayor David Coltart, among others.\n\nHwende, who appears to be warming up to rejoining his former party boss, Nelson Chamisa, in the political project Chamisa is building, has been engaging in spats with staunch Chamisa supporters on X, who are vowing that Hwende should not be allowed anywhere near Chamisa and the new democratic project he is developing.\n\n",

As per leading retailers, a key impediment to viability has been S.I 81A of 2024, an exchange control act that mandated the selling of goods and services at the official exchange rate, noted the report.\n\nIt further though stated that Zimbabwesoperating environment for companiesremained challenging overall, citing key issues such as elevated production costs as well as sporadic operating liquidity squeezes in light of the tightening of monetary conditions.\n\nIt mentioned emerging cost pressures including the governments recent increase of 19.1% to the diesel levy as further worsening costs for companies.\n\nHeadwinds in Zimbabwe had already affected Hippo Valley, which has had to rightsize its workforce with 1 000 workers expected to be let go by August.\n\nOK Zimbabwe, another prominent retailer battling headwinds, is now undertaking a $30m rights issue to stabilize the company. The retailer has also announced further closures of stores, pointing to a 2025 year that remains volatile and fragile, but with a possibility of better performances by consumer companies.\n\n",
