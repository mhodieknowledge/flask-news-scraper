The Hills Luxury Golf Estate is rewriting the rules of real estate, sport, and lifestyle in Zimbabwe.\n\nWhat was once called a project of impossibilities is now the countrys most iconic urban development. The lead developer Ken Sharpe, CEO of Westprop Holdings is upbeat with progress so far.\n\nHe feels the project has all the ingredients of luxury, modernity and the future. Last week he hosted an elite gathering of customers to serenade them with progress so far. The customers felt the vibe and committed to the project.\n\nCritics had scoffed at the idea of a baobab forest thriving in Harare West. They doubted that global attention could be drawn to this corner of the capital. Today, those doubts have been silenced by a living, breathing masterpiece  where ancient trees meet modern luxury, and every detail is curated for excellence.\n\nAt the heart of this transformation is a golf course designed by none other than Peter Matkovich, the current world number one golf architect. His signature blends natural beauty with championship precision, creating a course that is both a sanctuary and a stage for greatness.\n\nThe Hills is not just a place to live  itnis a place to belong. Exclusive features include:\n\nBranded Residences: Architecturally stunning homes with direct access to the golf course.\n\nSpeaking at a recent customer familiarization tour of the project Simukai Whande WestProp Digital Marketing Manager had this to say: This is a rare moment in time. Early investors will benefit from pre-launch pricing, securing premium assets at unmatched value. Once the ceremonial first tee is struck, prices will rise by an average of 40%, reflecting the true worth of this landmark estate.\n\nThe Hills is proof that vision, courage, and excellence can defy geography and expectation. Its a celebration of Zimbabwean pride, global standards, and the power of belief. What was once deemed impossible is now inevitable, and those who act early will own a piece of history.\n\n",

Under PSLs proposal, eight teams that were facing relegation this season would survive, while the four regional division champions would be promoted to the topflight, bringing the league to 22 clubs.\n\nThe meetingwas convened after ZIFA had earlier recommended a 20-team league structure.\n\nIn a statement, ZIFA, however, trashed the PSLs resolution,\n\nThe Association wishes to make it unequivocally clear that this proposal cannot be implemented. Promotion and relegation are fundamental components of football competition and are essential to maintaining the integrity, fairness, and sporting merit of the league system.\n\nZIFA confirmed that four clubs will be relegated at the conclusion of the 2025 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season, which officially ends on 23 November 2025.\n\nThe association also reminded the PSL to follow proper procedure when proposing structural changes in the future.\n\nShould the Premier Soccer League or any other member wish to propose an adjustment to the number of participating teams or propose any other resolution, such a request must be formally submitted to the Association. In accordance with ZIFA statutes, the proposal will then be tabled for consideration at the next ZIFA Congress, reads the statement.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nLawyers representing Prophetic Healing and Deliverance Ministries founder Walter Magaya and his wife on Tuesday accused the State of conducting investigations through social media, insisting their clients are ready to proceed to trial.\n\nMagaya and his wife face 13 fraud charges, while the cleric is also charged separately with rape. Their companies, Planet Africa and Yadah Connect, are jointly charged.\n\nThe accused persons are ready and the State should investigate the matter in a manner which is not prejudicial to the accused persons, said lead counsel Admire Rubaya.\n\nThe couple appeared before Harare magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa for routine remand, and the matter was postponed to December 9 as investigations continue.\n\nProsecutors requested the postponement, arguing that inquiries were still underway. However, Rubaya, together with lawyer Malvern Mapako, countered that the State should proceed to trial instead of issuing statements on social media.\n\nThis follows several police statements, one calling for victims to come forward and another alleging a US$200,000 scheme to bribe the justice system, remarks which Magaya says are prejudicial.\n\nThe State should bring the accused to trial. They have been investigating the matter since 2022. They should take a leaf from the police homicide department which investigates and bring people to court and not statements.\n\nThey are busy issuing statements as if matters are won on social media. Recently, the accused complained that the police issued a statement alleging there is a fund of 200 thousand to bribe judges, magistrates and instead of arresting the people they are putting out statements.\n\nThere is no need for megaphone investigations. They have been investigating this case and should not develop jelly legs.\n\nThis matter should not just be a statistic that in 2025 there was a case involving Magaya, Rubaya said.\n\nProsecutors allege the couple misrepresented to congregants and followers that they had secured large tracts of land for residential developments in Chishawasha, Norton, Westgate, Fern Valley (Mutare), Bulawayo, Kwekwe, Arcturus, Ruwa, Manyame, and Nyatsime. The companies allegedly collected about US$50,000 and R190,000 from prospective homeowners for stands that never materialised.\n\nIn his bail application, Magaya addressed the rape allegations, dismissing them as fabrications at the instance of the Zimbabwe Gender Commission, which he said has misused its powers to force these two complainants into concocting all manner of allegations against him.\n\n",

It is the first and most critical stage of mining, involving mapping, surveys and exploratory drilling to identify potential ore bodies before mining decisions are made.\n\nSpeaking toNewZimbabwe.comon the sidelines of the inaugural Zimbabwe Gold Investment Conference on Monday, Ernst & Young Associate Partner Dr Godknows Njowasaid Zimbabwes exploration spending remains far too low.\n\nErnst & Young Associate Partner Dr Godknows Njowa\n\nIn terms of exploration, Zimbabwe spends only 0.2% of annual global exploration expenditure, and within Africa, we contribute just 2%. Yet Africas total share is around 9%, he said.\n\nSo this shows that in Zimbabwe, we are not spending enough money on exploration. During my presentation, I gave the example of Canada, which is the highest spender in the world at about 20% of the annual global exploration budget.\n\nNjowa warned that Zimbabwe continues to lose opportunities, saying the country has the potential to double its current gold outputif it adequately explores and develops new deposits.\n\nFor decision makers,both government and private sector,more money must be allocated to exploration. Gold mining companies globally are making super profits because prices are at levels not seen in the past 30 or 40 years.\n\nSo some of that money should be reinvested into exploration. You need to spend between US$50 and US$80 per ounceof what you produce on exploration, he added.\n\n",

            "content": "The Globe and Mail\n\nThe documentaryMbira Talks, about a Zimbabwean-Canadian musicians relationship with an instrument once banned during colonisation, took a long time to make. We know this because Moyo Rainos Mutamba is shown plucking his mbira on a Toronto street, with the glittering Honest Eds department store in the background.\n\nThe lights went out in that building in 2016, and it was torn down a year later. Director Adrienne Amato originally planned to make a film about Stella Chiweshe, the pioneering rebel queen of the instrument, often referred to as a thumb piano because of the metal tines affixed to a wooden board that are struck by the first digits of the human hand.\n\nLogistics sabotaged the film on Chiweshe, who died in 2023 at age 76. Amato, who is white and was born in Zimbabwe when it was still under British rule as Rhodesia, immigrated to Toronto in 1977. After Chiweshes death, she shifted her focus to Mutamba. Still, the documentary, which premieres online and at the South African Film Festival in Toronto on Monday, took years to make, mostly because of money.\n\nIts very specific what gets funding these days, said the filmmaker, who joined Mutamba on a video call. Unless you have a celebrity in your doc or its a whodunnit crime thing, its a difficult landscape for making documentaries these days.\n\nAmato did not have a celebrity in her film, but she and Mutamba did have one on their side. Canadian indie-pop star Leslie Feist donated her frequent-flier miles for the trip to Africa by Amato, Mutamba and cinematographer Tess Girard. She also helped pay for the digging of a well at the Ubuntu Learning Village, the educational and community hub Mutamba co-founded in rural Zimbabwe.\n\nMutamba came to Canada more than 20 years ago to study economics at Trent University in Peterborough, Ont. The self-described village human finds Toronto too loud and crowded. In 2007, longing for a connection with his homeland, he took up the mbira, a ceremonial instrument tied to traditions of the Shona culture.\n\nThe late Chiweshe called the mbira a telephone to the spirits of people, water, trees and birds. Deeming it subversive, Rhodesias white authorities and Christian missionaries banned the instrument. The mbira is part of Mutambas educational mission involving food sovereignty, arts and cultural reclamation.\n\nIm intrigued by the power of community, he said. People are searching for it. Were all searching for village.\n\nFormer Toronto landmark Honest Eds can be seen across the street from Mutamba in a still from the documentary.Supplied\n\nMutamba is both a facilitator and a searcher himself. He longs for home, but Toronto is where he earns a living as co-director of Bloom Consulting, specializing in strategic planning, conflict mediation and psychotherapy. Canadas wealthy biggest city is his hunting place, where money is made to be used in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe mbira is more popular in Western Canada than in its eastern counterpart  Vancouver Island is the hotbed. Though the instrument is foreign to Canada, Mutamba believes its effect is universal.\n\nIt provokes certain emotions, he said. It is in the body. Its beyond the otherness. It is a sound that is human.\n\n",
