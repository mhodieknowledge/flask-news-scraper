            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nSpeaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda has directed Parliamentary Portfolio Committees to stop undertaking unnecessary trips that have left the National Assembly nearly empty during sittings, depriving constituents of representation.\n\nMudenda expressed displeasure after noticing numerous empty seats on both the left and right benches, as many legislators were away on committee trips.\n\nI notice on both sides, on my right and on my left, there are a few members of Parliament. What is going on? Can I have an explanation from the Whips? Mudenda asked.\n\nZanu PF Chief Whip Pupurai Togarepi informed the Speaker that three committees were away.\n\nAs per your directive in this House, there should not be more than two Committees at a moment a week, but sometimes they just go without even advising the Whips. I am supposed to concur with those who arrange these outreaches. When I came in, I realised there were a few members only to be told that these committees would have gone out without my knowledge. We need to sit down with the administration to ensure that we protect attendance.\n\nResponding, Mudenda emphasised that parliamentary attendance must take precedence.\n\nWhile the public hearings are critical, and I do not know why they should arise after we have had public hearings on the Pre-Budget. There is no excuse why these committees should be out. Absolutely no excuse. The priority is for members to be here in the House as representatives of the people. You are the voice of the people who are not able to be in this august House.\n\nNow, if you are not there, how is their voice going to be heard? So, this must stop forthwith from next week. No committees should go out unless absolutely necessary.\n\nIn recent weeks, MPs have been making what observers describe as outrageous demands, claiming that their allowances are insufficient to meet their personal needs. Lawmakers earn extra money when travelling through additional allowances.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nCBZ Holdings, Zimbabwes largest financial services group by assets and deposits, has posted a 10% increase in profit after tax for the nine months ending 30 September 2025, reaching ZWG1.11 billion, up from ZWG1.01 billion in the same period last year.\n\nPresenting a trading update for the nine months ended 30 September 2025, CBZ Group Chief Legal Advisor and Governance, Rumbidzayi Jakanani, said the growth recorded comes as the countrys macroeconomic environment stabilises, with the ZWG holding steady against the US dollar and inflation easing into single digits.\n\nCBZ Group Chief Legal Advisor and Governance, Rumbidzayi Jakanani\n\nThe Group recorded a profit after tax of ZWG 1.11 billion, representing a 10% increase from ZWG1.01 billion recorded in the same period of the previous year. Total income amounted to ZWG4.23 billion, 58% above the ZWG 2.68 billion reported in the prior year, reflecting stable performance, she said.\n\nWhile the increase in profits may seem modest, it reflects CBZHs strong cost control and strategic diversification, as the bank navigates a period of monetary tightening and stable gold-backed reserves. This stability has allowed CBZH to focus on organic growth rather than hedge against extreme inflation volatility.\n\nTotal income surged 58% to ZWG 4.23 billion, up from ZWG 2.68 billion in 2024, with non-funded income contributing a significant 65% (ZWG 2.75 billion), reflecting a 54% increase year-on-year. This jump in non-interest income underscores CBZHs advantage in transactional banking, supported by its leading deposit base and robust digital channels, which have thrived amid growing electronic payment adoption and a stable exchange rate.\n\nFunded income also grew 66%, reaching ZWG 1.46 billion, as the bank selectively lent into higher-yielding sectors while maintaining strong asset quality, unlike some competitors who have struggled in volatile periods.\n\nThe balance sheet expanded 13% to ZWG 38.93 billion, with deposits rising by 25% to ZWG 27.09 billion. This strong growth in customer deposits has enabled CBZH to maintain a healthy loan-to-deposit ratio while maintaining high liquidity levels. The banks focus on stable, low-cost retail and corporate deposits has helped shield it from risks associated with short-term interbank funding.\n\nCapital adequacy remains strong, with all divisions meeting regulatory requirements. The bank is also planning fresh capital injections for its growth subsidiaries, positioning it for future opportunities in a fragmented market.\n\nLooking ahead, the global economy is expected to record moderate growth on the back of easing inflation, improving financial conditions, and technological productivity gains. The local economy is set to continue on the positive growth trajectory, supported by expected better rainfall season, higher prices for gold, improved energy supply, coupled with the ongoing fiscal reforms that will enhance the ease of doing business, added Jakanani.\n\n",

Mpofu applied for the post and submitted all required documentation, including a fraudulent permanent residence permit. He was appointed on May 1 2021 and later promoted to CFO on June 1 2023.\n\nInvestigations revealed that the permit submitted by Mpofu had never been issued by the department of home affairs, Gunya said.\n\nDuring the trial, Mpofu pleaded guilty to both counts.\n\nIn aggravation of sentence, state advocate Nkhetheni Mudau argued that fraud remains a serious and prevalent offence. Mudau said the accused failed to disclose how he obtained the fraudulent document and had benefited financially, earning more than R3m during his tenure at the entity.\n\nThese sentences underscore the NPAs commitment to combating and prosecuting commercial crimes that undermine public trust and institutional integrity, North West director of public prosecutions Rachel Makhari said.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe Nigerian government has announced it is cancelling a controversial policy that mandated the use of indigenous languages for teaching in the earliest years of schooling instead of English.\n\nEducation Minister Tunji Alausa said the programme, introduced just three years ago, had failed to deliver and was being scrapped with immediate effect.\n\nInstead, English will be reinstated as the medium of instruction from pre-primary levels through to university.\n\nThe now-defunct programme was launched by former Education Minister Adamu Adamu, who had argued that children learnt more effectively in their mother tongue.\n\nAt the time, Adamu argued that pupils grasped concepts more readily when taught in their own mother tongue  a view supported by numerous UN studies on early childhood education.\n\nNigerias education system is facing serious problems, such as poor-quality teaching, inadequate materials, low pay for teachers and numerous strikes.\n\nAlthough 85% of children go to primary school, less than half complete their secondary education.\n\nSome 10 million children are out of school in Nigeria, more than in any other country, according to the UN.\n\nAnnouncing the reversal of the language policy in the capital, Abuja, Dr Alausa pointed to poor academic results from those areas which had adopted mother-tongue teaching.\n\nHe cited data from the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), the National Examinations Council (Neco), and the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (Jamb).\n\nWe have seen a mass failure rate in WAEC, Neco, and Jamb in certain geo-political zones of the country, and those are the ones that adopted this mother tongue in an over-subscribed manner, the minister stated.\n\nThe abrupt cancellation of the policy has drawn a mixed response from education specialists, analysts and parents.\n\nSome have hailed the governments decision, agreeing that the implementation was problematic and contributed to falling standards.\n\nOthers, however, believe the policy was abandoned prematurely. They argue that such a significant shift requires substantial investment in teacher training, the development of textbooks and learning materials, and a longer timeframe before it can be fairly judged and begin to bear fruit.\n\nEducation expert Dr Aliyu Tilde praised the reversal, saying Nigeria isnt ready for such a move.\n\nDoes Nigeria have trained teachers to teach in the dozens of indigenous languages in the country? The answer is no. Also the major exams like WAEC, Jamb are all in English and not in those mother tongue languages.\n\nI think whats needed to improve the quality of our schools is bringing in qualified teachers, he told the BBC.\n\nA mother who has two children in early education schools, Hajara Musa, said she supported the reversal as it would help young children to learn English at an early age.\n\nEnglish is a global language that is used everywhere and I feel its better these kids start using it from the start of their schooling instead of waiting for when they are older, she told the BBC.\n\nHowever, social affairs analyst Habu Dauda disagreed.\n\nI think it was scrapped prematurely instead of giving it more time. Three years is too little to judge a big shift such as this  the government ought to have added more investment, he said.\n\nThe debate highlights the ongoing challenge in Nigeria of balancing the promotion of its rich linguistic heritage with the practical demands of a national curriculum and a globalised economy where English proficiency is dominant.\n\n",
