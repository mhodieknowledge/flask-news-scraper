General Emmanuel Matatu as the new Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) Commander following the retirement of General Philip Valerio Sibanda.\n\nMatatu, who was appointed Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) Commander in March this year, will be replaced by former Deputy Director General of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Asher Walter Tapfumaneyi.\n\nTapfumaneyi had been named ZNA Chief of Staff in May.\n\nHis Excellency, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe and Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, Cde Dr Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, acting in terms of section 216(2 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe as read with sections 7(1) and 8(2 of the Defence Act [Chapter 11:02], promoted Lieutenant Genera Emmanuel Matatu to the rank of General and appointed him Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces with effect from 21 November 2025.\n\nThe appointment follows the retirement of outgoing Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, General Philip Valerio Sibanda, Rushwaya said\n\nSibanda is expected to take up a role in the ruling Zanu PF politburo.\n\nIn 2023, Mnangagwa briefly appointed him to the partys politburo before reversing the decision following a backlash from civil society. His appointment was scheduled for review at the end of his army tenure.\n\nWith tensions reportedly deepening over Mnangagwas succession, analysts view the elevation of his close allies to key military positions as a move to consolidate and secure his political interests.\n\nThe military played a pivotal role in the 2017 coup that propelled Mnangagwa to power, making control of the security sector crucial in maintaining his hold on the state.\n\nTapfumaneyi was placed under US sanctions in 2024 for his alleged role in disrupting the 2023 general elections through the Forever Association of Zimbabwe (FAZ), which was accused of intimidating voters at polling stations.\n\n",

That contrasts with the ZSE  long a haven for investors during bouts of high inflation  which is slightly lower.\n\nThe VFEX has been the standout performer, with market capitalisation rising over 40% year to date, the Harare-based brokerage said in its latest equity report, attributing the strong performance to gold-linked and consumer-facing stocks.\n\nLiquidity on the VFEX has also improved significantly, the brokerage added. With average daily turnover up 197% from the prior year, reflecting deepening participation by both institutional and retail investors.\n\nThe main exchange in Harare has borne the brunt of a yearlong liquidity squeeze thats been in place since the 43% devaluation of the ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, last September.\n\nTrading on the ZSE has slumped, and IH Securities expects the slowdown will continue to suppress stock market activity.\n\n",

He forced them to write letters. Vice President can not be using the church to amass wealth for himself and George Charamba, said Mliswa.\n\nThe outspoken politician further called on the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) to investigate the City Council over the controversial eviction notices.\n\nHere comes the institutions that fight corruption, ZRP, ZACC, you need to investigate Harare City Council. Why they then wrote letters to displace those people when they are the owners of the land? They gave them the land. Everything was paid for. Over US$2 million was paid for that land, then suddenly you think people must just leave because somebody in a higher office, who is a Vice President says something, said Mliswa.\n\nHarare City Council acting Town Clerk Phakamile Mabena Moyo recently issued a three-month notice for the occupants to vacate the land, citing violation of Section 24 of the Regional, Town and Country Planning Act (Chapter 29:12).\n\nMliswas latest remarks come shortly after he accused Chiwengas wife, Minoyothabo Baloyi, of allegedly running a parallel structure in the Zimbabwe National Army.\n\nCity Council, I am going to report you to ZACC for overturning such decisions. That is fraud. If you have overturn decisions of such nature because of certain powers, you will go to jail like a joke, added Mliswa.\n\n",

The Fund derives income primarily through dividends and investment returns, and may selectively pursue third-party funding while maintaining conservative leverage under strict risk and governance frameworks.\n\nAddressing delegates at the Zimbabwe Gold Investment Conference 2025, MIF Deputy Chief Investment Officer Ernest Denhere said the strong performance was driven by investee companies within the mining cluster.\n\nThe Fund has strong presence in the gold space through Kuvimba Mining House (KMH) and Defold Mine, delivering 29% of Large Scale Miners gold to Fidelity between January and September, at 2.4 tons. The Fund recognises that gold currently presents a unique opportunity for value creation and growth in export receipts, he said.\n\nMIF officials noted that precious metals, especially gold, have surged in 2025 as investors seek safe-haven assets amid geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Gold has gained 56% year-to-date, while Zimbabwes gold exports have grown by 71% for the nine months to September 2025.\n\nDenhere said the value of gold exported by September stood at US$3.2 billion, with artisanal and small-scale miners contributing 74% of total gold output.\n\nWith a funding pipeline of at least US$500 million across several gold projects, the Fund is open to exploring different strategies to support the sector and bolster the gold value chain. MIF is a long-term, non-speculative investor focused on providing patient capital to its investors.\n\nThe Funds strategy also includes establishing an exploration fund. With gold as a safe-haven asset with long-term upside, there is strong upside for new discoveries, added Denhere.\n\n",

The lead developer Ken Sharpe, CEO of Westprop Holdings is upbeat with progress so far.\n\nHe feels the project has all the ingredients of luxury, modernity and the future. Last week he hosted an elite gathering of customers to serenade them with progress so far. The customers felt the vibe and committed to the project.\n\nCritics had scoffed at the idea of a baobab forest thriving in Harare West. They doubted that global attention could be drawn to this corner of the capital. Today, those doubts have been silenced by a living, breathing masterpiece  where ancient trees meet modern luxury, and every detail is curated for excellence.\n\nAt the heart of this transformation is a golf course designed by none other than Peter Matkovich, the current world number one golf architect. His signature blends natural beauty with championship precision, creating a course that is both a sanctuary and a stage for greatness.\n\nThe Hills is not just a place to live  itnis a place to belong. Exclusive features include:\n\nBranded Residences: Architecturally stunning homes with direct access to the golf course.\n\nSpeaking at a recent customer familiarization tour of the project Simukai Whande WestProp Digital Marketing Manager had this to say: This is a rare moment in time. Early investors will benefit from pre-launch pricing, securing premium assets at unmatched value. Once the ceremonial first tee is struck, prices will rise by an average of 40%, reflecting the true worth of this landmark estate.\n\nThe Hills is proof that vision, courage, and excellence can defy geography and expectation. Its a celebration of Zimbabwean pride, global standards, and the power of belief. What was once deemed impossible is now inevitable, and those who act early will own a piece of history.\n\n",
