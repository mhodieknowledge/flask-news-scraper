Stay with them in their successes, hold their hands and render them support, in their time of need. The collective good of our people and the nation as a whole, is top priority.Vaudzei kuti Zanu PF yakasimba. Zanu PF inzou irikufamba- Zanu PF is alive, vibrant and strong; Zanu PF is the only organised, tried and tested custodian of our revolution and remains focused on bettering the peoples quality of life. Hatidzokeri shure. Ticharamba tichizadzisa zvatinovimbisa, President Mnangagwa said.His remarks concurred with his deputy Constantino Chiwenga who has been preaching about equitable distribution of resources amongst Zimbabweans and not to benefit a few individuals.To all party structures, the President said these should ensure there are clearly laid out strategies and benchmarks towards realising the economic priorities set out until the next gathering, and beyond.As we transition to the National Development Strategy (II) through the whole of party, government and society approach, I expect stakeholders, including ministries, departments and agencies to improve collaboration and synergies.Be assured that the party will continue to exercise overall leadership to all sectors of the economy, added the President commending conference delegates for the in-depth, pragmatic and comprehensive manner of their deliberations, as well as the iron clad discipline, respect and focus towards party business.He also described ZANU PF as indeed, a democratic, mature and organised party which had stayed true to the enduring ideals of the colossal mass party, bequeathed to the people by its Founding Fathers and forebearers.Zanu PF has demonstrated that we are a mammoth, revolutionary mass movement which is transformative, modernising and ensuring that, as the people of this great country, we continue to be masters of our own destiny.I applaud the 22nd National Peoples Conference for engaging in discussions that were robust, candid and factual as well as forward looking and inclusive, said President MnangagwaHe applauded the resolutions of the meeting, further demonstrating that Zanu PF was a well-oiled machine ready to leap forward industrialisation and modernisation as it meets the growing needs of its peoples, for a better quality of life.We boldly discussed the ideas of the future for our party. Together Delegates, guaranteed that the resolutions of the historic Conference remain representative of the aspirations of grassroots communities and the necessary course of action.Further, the emphasis was put on the need to enforce the supremacy of the constitution, which he described as timely.Accordingly, each individual party member must subject themselves to the Constitution; the minority to the majority, lower structures to higher structures, and all members must ultimately, defer to the Central Committee, National Peoples Conference and finally the National Peoples Congress.The rank and file of the party must reinforce this order across every level, across all Leagues of the party, he stated.He warned some members and those outside the party to stop dictating to the party.We are running our own race and no-one, including outsiders, should dictate anything to us. Gwendo gwedu tisu tinoziva mafambirwo arwo. Ngati shandei ndima dzedu dzatakapiwa nemusangano wedu.

            "content": "By Central News\n\nTHE Department of Transport has pinpointed speeding as a major factor in the horrific bus crash near Makhado in Limpopo that claimed 43 lives on Sunday, 12 October 2025.\n\nA preliminary report by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) revealed the driver was going too fast for the conditions on the mountain pass, compounded by severe mechanical defects and overloading.\n\nThe bus, travelling from Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape to Zimbabwe, veered off the N1 highway, plunging down a steep embankment and landing upside down.\n\nThe tragedy left 34 people seriously injured and six with minor injuries, with victims including 18 women, 17 men, seven children, and a 10-month-old baby.\n\nMost passengers were Zimbabwean and Malawian nationals heading home, turning a routine journey into a nightmare.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa offered condolences to the affected nations, while Transport Minister Barbara Creecy directed urgent investigations into the bus companys responsibility and possible culpable homicide charges.This incident has reignited concerns over road safety for cross-border buses, with calls for stricter border checks on vehicle roadworthiness.\n\nAs families begin the painful process of identifying loved ones using fingerprints and photos at Tshilidzini Hospital, the focus shifts to preventing such disasters in the future.\n\nInvestigation Reveals Speeding as Primary Cause\n\nThe RTMC probe found the driver lost control while navigating the treacherous Zoutpansberg mountain road, known for its steep descents and hairpin bends.\n\nThe driver of the bus drove at a speed too high for the conditions down the mountain pass, the department stated.The bus tumbled into a ravine, scattering debris and personal belongings across the site.\n\nRescue teams worked through the night to recover bodies and aid survivors, with some passengers self-discharging from hospitals. The crash sites challenging terrain complicated efforts, but authorities confirmed all victims were accounted for by Monday.\n\nJust days later, on 15 October 2025, another tragedy struck nearby when a truck carrying cement plunged off a cliff opposite the bus crash scene, underscoring the roads dangers. No fatalities were reported in the truck incident, but it has prompted questions about the N1s safety for heavy vehicles.\n\nMechanical Failures and Unroadworthy Condition Exposed\n\nA mechanical inspection uncovered alarming defects: only five out of ten brakes on the bus and trailer were working.\n\nDuring the mechanical investigation, it was also established that the bus and trailer only had five out of the 10 brakes in operational condition and that one brake on the bus had no braking ability. It was established that out of five brakes on the bus, one brake was not in an operational condition, the report detailed.\n\nNone of the four brakes on the trailer functioned, and the suspension had been poorly repaired. This left the vehicle with just half its braking power, a defect the driver was likely aware of and had adapted to.\n\nTherefore, the bus and trailer were not in a roadworthy condition by virtue of the defective braking system and the poorly repaired suspension of the trailer. This means that the driver of the bus and trailer was aware of this braking deficiency and had adapted his driving style to accommodate this defect.\n\nBoxes of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and other medications were found in the wreckage, raising further questions about the buss cargo and possible illegal transport. The bus, operated by DNC Coach Services, was foreign-registered, prompting calls for better border inspections.\n\nOverloading Contributed to the Tragedy\n\nThe bus was severely overloaded, carrying 91 occupants despite a capacity of 62.\n\nThe bus was found to have had 91 occupants, even though the bus only had capacity for 62 occupants, the department said. Among them were 11 children aged three to five, and under regulations, two such children count as one adult. Adjusted for this, the vehicle was overloaded by 23 people.\n\nThe trailer was packed with baggage and belongings, adding to the weight and likely contributing to the loss of control. Overloading is a common issue in cross-border buses, often leading to mechanical strain and higher risks in accidents.\n\nRoad Conditions Ruled Out as Factor\n\nThe investigation cleared the road itself, finding the N1 surface before and after the crash in good condition.\n\nThe road surface along the N1 before and after the crash scene was noted as being in good condition and therefore not considered a cause and/or contributory factor to this road crash, officials confirmed.This shifts blame squarely to the driver and vehicle maintenance, rather than infrastructure shortcomings.\n\nRecommendations for Enhanced Road Safety\n\nThe preliminary report urged focused law enforcement on heavy vehicles, especially foreign ones entering South Africa.\n\nLaw enforcement operations be considered to examine and evaluate the roadworthiness of vehicles that enter South African roads, as the bus is a foreign registered vehicle, it recommended. Such checks could have spotted the defects and prevented the crash.\n\nIt also called for the RTMCs National Traffic Police and provincial teams to target vehicles ignoring warning signs and speeding downhill.\n\nConcentrate their attention on heavy vehicles that do not adhere to warning signs and do not reduce speed when driving downhill, as it is evident that the bus and trailer drove at a speed too fast for the road environment and failed to negotiate the hairpin bend.\n\nThe full technical reconstruction report will take 21 weeks, including a look at weighbridge checks where overloading should have been caught.\n\nMinister Creecys Directives for Accountability\n\nTransport Minister Barbara Creecy has taken swift action, directing the RTMC to probe DNC Coachs role in ensuring roadworthiness and consider culpable homicide charges.\n\nThe Minister of Transport, Barbara has directed the RTMC to investigate the bus companys responsibility in ensuring the roadworthiness of the bus and to further consider a culpable homicide complaint against the bus company in terms of the duties of the operator, the department said.\n\nShe requested the buss maintenance schedule and service records, and tasked the Anti-Corruption Unit to check which testing centre issued its roadworthy certificate. Creecy also ordered inspections of the DNC fleet at borders and any depots in South Africa.\n\nThese steps aim to hold the company accountable and prevent similar tragedies. Families have expressed frustration over DNCs lack of communication, with no passenger list provided, leaving them searching hospitals for loved ones.\n\n",
