            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA PROMINENT white commercial farmer, Daniel Brink Bosman, is at the centre of controversy after allegedly piercing the skull of a 12-year-old boy with the front-end of a combine harvester, leading to the childs death in 2022.\n\nThe tragedy occurred at Dandreanum farm in Lions Den, on the outskirts of Chinhoyi, Mashonaland West, when the victim, Suarance Moffat, and two other minors were marvelling and cheering on the farmer as he steered the giant machine across his maize field.\n\nAccording to the now deceased boys parents, the farmer, for unknown reasons, drove the harvester towards the children and started chasing them, striking Suarance with a sharp object from the machine.\n\nThe late Suarance, far right in red T-shirt, with his aunt and siblings.\n\nThe bereaved family is convinced that at the time of the incident, Bosman connived with one of his drivers, Douglas Zhanewo to concoct circumstances surrounding the boys death.\n\nThe victims father, Tichaona Moffat, told NewZimbabwe.com that in 2022, after the tragedy, Bosman then proceeded to Murereka Police Station, where he made a false report stating that his tractor driver, Zhanewo, had run over the child.\n\nThe employee was subsequently arrested and appeared in court on a culpable homicide charge. This is despite our vehement denial that our boy had not been run over by a tractor, which weighs so much it could have flattened his body, said Moffat.\n\nInstead, we noticed that there was a deep cut on his head, which was corroborated by the postmortem results. So, this narrative that he had been run over was a blue lie to cover up for murder deliberately committed by Bosman, who chased the minors before killing my son, he added.\n\nMoffat painted a gory picture, as narrated by his other son who witnessed the tragedy, of Suarences body dangling from the fork on the combine harvester bleeding profusely until he died. Thereafter, Moffat further claimed, Bosman instructed a terrified Zhanewo to remove the body which they later dumped near his homestead.\n\nAt the purported scene of the accident, there was no sign of blood at all. This suggests the incident happened elsewhere and the body was dumped where it was found as a broader plot to conceal the murder. Despite raising all these facts, the police are reluctant to arrest Bosman and l strongly suspect money is exchanging hands, said Moffat.\n\nA postmortem conducted by Dr. Ivene Maponga on May 24, 2022, concluded that the boys death resulted from a deep laceration on the head, causing a perforation of the skull.\n\nAs a result, Zhanewo was discharged in 2024 following the conclusion of the State case under Number CHN/CD/1983/24, which established that the deceased had not been run over by a tractor.\n\nThe slain boys family says it has not known peace ever since the unfortunate 2022 incident, which claimed the life of their second-born child.\n\nIn a desperate bid to seek justice,Moffat recently opened a fresh case against Bosman.\n\nThe victims father Tichaona Moffat and mother\n\nAs is tradition, a memorial service should have been held for our murdered son but until now nothing has been done because our boy Suarances soul is not resting. We demand Bosmans immediate arrest so that he is prosecuted as an accused person, not as an informant, said Moffat.\n\nResultantly, police have since opened a murder case against Bosman under CR Number 45/04/25, as well as a case for filing a false report, CR Number 46/04/25.\n\nHowever, Bosman has not yet been arrested.\n\nZimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) Mashonaland West spokesperson, Inspector Ian Kohwera professed ignorance over the case.\n\nThe family, which suspects corruption which also involves National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) officials, has intensified pressure, through its lawyer Tungamirai Chamutsa of Chamutsa and Partners Legal Practitioners, to have Bosman arrested for murder.\n\nIn a letter to District Public Prosecutor, Herald Matura, officially received on May 15, 2025, the late Suarances father demanded justice to take its course.\n\nOn 11 April 2025 our client reported criminal allegations against the above accused person (Bosman), of murder of his child Suarance Moffat and making a false report as defined in the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act (Chapter 9:23).\n\nStatements were recorded at Murereka Police Station from our client and his son Junior Mephis Moffat (a juvenile) on the same day However, a docket of road traffic culpable homicide was opened wrote the lawyers.\n\nThe same Chinhoyi Traffic police arrested and investigated the wrong person on the same facts under CR28/05/22.\n\nThey arrested and charged Douglas Zhanewo with road traffic culpable homicide despite protestation from our client that his son, Suarance Moffat, was not killed by the tractor which was being driven by Douglas Zhanewo, further argued the lawyers.\n\nOur client reported a case of murder against the accused person, but Chinhoyi Traffic preferred a charge of culpable homicide arising out of a road accident.\n\nFurther, they distilled the original report of the eyewitness Junior Mephis Moffat. Kindly compare the typed statement of the witness dated 9/04/25 and the handwritten statement recorded at Murereka Police Station on 11 April 2025. Key names of participants and vital materials which are in the long-hand statement, are missing in the typed statement.\n\nOur client is baffled by the statement self-recorded by the investigating officer, one Muchihwa Misheck, dated 16 May 2025, a date which we are yet to live and see. In that statement, what is disturbing is the attitude of Mr Muchihwa in which he is discounting the credibility of other witnesses and evidence. This is outside the investigating officers jurisdiction and purview, Chamutsa wrote.\n\nThe lawyers also noted that the wheels of justice are turning slowly.\n\nWe are, therefore, instructed to inform you, as we hereby do, that our client strongly thinks that it is in the interest of justice that the accused Daniel Brink Bosman be charged with the crime of murder as defined in section 47(1) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23\n\nThis is said so because there is reasonable suspicion that he killed our clients child, one Suarance Moffat. A prima facie case for the prosecution can be raised, Chamutsa wrote.\n\nWhen contacted for comment on the matter, Bosman refused to shed light on the tragic incident and subsequent allegations raised against him.\n\nI am not at liberty to comment as this matter is still in the courts, Bosman told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\n",

            "content": "By Franny Rabkin l TimesLive\n\nTHE Supreme Court of Appeal has rejected an appeal by the minister of Home Affairs against the Johannesburg High Court order on Zimbabwe Exemption Permits (ZEPs), which give about 180,000 Zimbabweans a special dispensation to lawfully remain in South Africa.\n\nThe judgment also clears the path for the Zimbabwean Immigration Federation to return to court and argue that it is only Parliament, and not the Home Affairs minister, which can decide whether to extend the ZEP regime.In 2023, the Johannesburg High Court set aside a decision by former minister Aaron Motsoaledi to terminate the ZEP regime and to reconsider his decision, following a fair process.The SCAs judgment on Friday said that counsel for the minister told the court that the order is being implemented, and  the minister is following a fair process.But the federation wants to go back to court to argue that ZEP holders and their children enjoy constitutional rights in South Africa. If these are to be limited, only Parliament may do so  by enacting a law of general application, says the SCAs judgment.The SCA did not give a view on whether that argument was correct, but it rejected an appeal by the minister that would have prevented the federation from ever making it.When the High Court gave its order, the federation was one of the parties in the litigation, along with the Helen Suzman Foundation (HSF). Theirs were two separate cases, which were heard together.While the federation and the HSF both wanted similar orders, at that time, from the High Court, their grounds were different. And while the HSF asked the court for a final order, the federation only sought an interim interdict  it wanted to argue its main case at a later date. The court gave a final order, as sought by the HSF, and also the interim interdict sought by the federation.The minister had already tried, and failed, to appeal against the HSF order.In this case, the minister approached the SCA on appeal, saying the interim interdict was redundant since the court had already granted a final order to the HSF.In Fridays judgment, the SCA disagreed. Judge of Appeal David Unterhalter said the federations case raised distinctive grounds of review, which laid the basis for an argument that was not raised or argued earlier  about the powers of the minister when there were constitutional rights at stake.If the federations argument was to be accepted, it would not permit the minister to terminate the ZEP regime.That is a remedial outcome of a considerably more far-reaching kind because it reaches into the future and is not based on a reconsideration, said Unterhalter.

The court gave a final order, as sought by the HSF, and also the interim interdict sought by the federation.The minister had already tried, and failed, to appeal against the HSF order.In this case, the minister approached the SCA on appeal, saying the interim interdict was redundant since the court had already granted a final order to the HSF.In Fridays judgment, the SCA disagreed. Judge of Appeal David Unterhalter said the federations case raised distinctive grounds of review, which laid the basis for an argument that was not raised or argued earlier  about the powers of the minister when there were constitutional rights at stake.If the federations argument was to be accepted, it would not permit the minister to terminate the ZEP regime.That is a remedial outcome of a considerably more far-reaching kind because it reaches into the future and is not based on a reconsideration, said Unterhalter. The redundancy argument could therefore not hold, he said.\n\nBut the federation wants to go back to court to argue that ZEP holders and their children enjoy constitutional rights in South Africa. If these are to be limited, only Parliament may do so  by enacting a law of general application, says the SCAs judgment.\n\nThe SCA did not give a view on whether that argument was correct, but it rejected an appeal by the minister that would have prevented the federation from ever making it.When the High Court gave its order, the federation was one of the parties in the litigation, along with the Helen Suzman Foundation (HSF).

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ) and the Health Professions Authority (HPA) have cautioned the public against the illegal sale, purchase, and use of Ozempic, a prescription medication known as the skinny jab.\n\nThe Ozempic is originally designed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.In a joint statement, MCAZ Director-General Richard Rukwata said there is a surge in the illicit sale of Ozempic through unauthorised channels.He also noted that the public is now misusing the Ozempic for weight loss, prompting serious health concerns.Recent reports indicate an increase in the illicit use of Ozempic for weight loss purposes. However, its use for weight loss outside of medical supervision is potentially dangerous and could lead to serious harm to the user, said Rukwata.As a prescription medicine, Ozempic can only be accessed upon presentation of a valid prescription and should only be used under the strict supervision of a qualified and registered healthcare professional. Self-medicating with Ozempic for weight loss can have serious and potentially life-threatening consequences.We warn the public against purchasing Ozempic from unauthorized sources, including online marketplaces, social media platforms, unlicensed premises, or unregistered individuals.These sources often lack quality control and may offer substandard and/or falsified medications. The illegal sale and distribution of prescription medications is not only illegal but also poses a significant threat to public health.Illegal traders of Ozempic have been warned that selling the product is a criminal offence that attracts jail time.Selling medicines by unlicensed persons from unlicensed premises contravenes Sections 50 and 52 of the Medicines and Allied Substances Control (General) Regulations, 1991, SI 150 of 1991, as read with Section 106 of the same Regulations.Additionally, the sale of unregistered medicines is in contravention of Section 29(1)(a) of the Medicines and Allied Substances Control Act, as read with Section 29(la) of the same Act.The Health Professions Act (Chapter 27:19) Section 126 prohibits unqualified personnel from performing any act specifically pertaining to a registered profession. Therefore, diagnosis and prescribing should only be conducted by qualified and licensed personnel, reads the statement.Both the MCAZ and HPA urged the public to consult only registered health professionals for medical advice and treatment.Mandated to safeguard the public, HPA and MCAZ urge the public to seek medical advice and treatment only from registered health professionals and institutions. These can be identified by the possession of a valid practising certificate from the practitioners respective Council, an HPA licence for premise registration, and an MCAZ licence for both person and premises.It is an offense for an unlicensed individual to diagnose, treat, and sell medicines to the public, reads the statement.\n\nThe Ozempic is originally designed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn a joint statement, MCAZ Director-General Richard Rukwata said there is a surge in the illicit sale of Ozempic through unauthorised channels.He also noted that the public is now misusing the Ozempic for weight loss, prompting serious health concerns.Recent reports indicate an increase in the illicit use of Ozempic for weight loss purposes.

To set the record straight, ZCATWU confirms the challenges that were indicated by ZBCA to be affecting only a handful of employers. We note that the ZBCA seeks to blanket all players in the construction industry to be facing the same challenges, he said.That such dishonesty has the net effect of disturbing harmony in the industry as it has a huge bearing on collective bargaining.He revealed that for over a year now, the construction sector has been experiencing difficulties in negotiating salary and wages since such unscrupulous employers, including many without any business with government, had resorted to hiding behind the empty lies.Most of the times when we engage for negotiations the response we get is that the government is failing to pay the contractors, but we are aware that we do have some contractors who are not contracted by the government and they are just not paying or increasing wages citing late payments by the government, said Mazarura.ZCATWU contends that the industry has the capacity to pay decent wages and appealed to the contractors representatives to advise some employers, who are not contracted by the government to utilise their Works Council platforms to complement the National Employment Council (NEC) efforts.He castigated the sectors employers for leaving workers to reel under poverty conditions despite having the capacity to pay.We also have foreign companies operating their businesses and are not willing to increase wages based on government contracts.The industry is now riddled with several challenges as employers are now seeking to be exempted from paying gazette wages. They are now abusing Statutory Instrument 45 of 2013, which gives the right to employers and employees to waiver and is also very clear on the requirements of waiver, added Mazarura.\n\nRecently, the Zimbabwe Building Contractors Association (ZBCA) pressed the alarm button over delayed payments from Treasury saying the development is choking operations in the construction sector.\n\nHowever, responding to the problems raised by the contractors, the Zimbabwe Construction and Allied Trades Workers Union (ZCATWU) general secretary, Nicholas Mazarura Tuesday criticized the contractors for amplifying the payment delays to justify underformance in the construction industry.He said surprisingly, even some contractors, who are not involved in business with the government were now taking advantage of the failure to pay by the authorities.We would like to dispel some misconceptions arising from the issues put forward by the ZBCA.

in Morocco Friday evening.\n\nZimbabwes senior mens soccer side struggled to keep position in the first few minutes of the game hence helping Burkina Faso to create several chances.Les Etalons managed to score its first goal of the match in the 23rd minute, thanks to Wydad AC midfieder Stephane Aziz Ki, who fired in a far post shot which Zimbabwe goalkeeper Washington Arubi failed to stop.Eager to respond, the Warriors quickly re-organised and created a clear chance, which saw them winning a free kick on the edge of the box after Burkina Faso broke a promising attack by fouling Tawanda Maswanhise.Despite getting the half chance, Zimbabwes effort from the free kick was a disapointment as it was nowhere near a goal.The Warriors were then quickly punished in the 29th minute by Cyrique Irie,.who gave Burkina Faso a comfortable 2-0 lead.Having gone to the break trailing 2-0 Warriors coach Michael Nees made tactical changes in the 63rd minute as he brought in a trio of Tawanda
