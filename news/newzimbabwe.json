Throughout his tenure, Karombos team pleaded with authorities to address the tough economic environment.\n\nThe new managementnow appears to have come head on with the tough operating environment,recitingpast problems raised by the sacked executive.\n\nThe difficult operating environment has been characterized by: macroeconomic volatility, including pricing issues related to the exchange rate, while informal players operated without this constraint, giving them a competitive advantage.\n\nAdditionally, inflationary pressures have impacted cost structures and pricing strategies; liquidity constraints in the broader economy, affecting consumer spending and the Companys ability to generate sufficient cash flows; and working capital challenges leading to disruptions in supply chain and reduced stock availability, OK Zimbabwe Company Secretary, Margaret Munyuru said.\n\nThe company, Munyuru said has been unable to maintain adequate stock levels as many suppliers can no longer continue providing goods and services due to outstanding unpaid balances directly impacting product availability across the Companys stores, affecting revenue generation and overall business performance, particularly in the last six months where trading levels were not adequate to cover costs.\n\nAs a result of all the above, the company now anticipates making a significant loss for the year ended 31 March 2025.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Board of Directors has resolved to undertake a capital raise in the sum of up to US$30 million to bridge the funding gap and stabilize the Companys financial position. The capital raise will be a combination of a rights issue, private placement and debt instruments.\n\nThe capital-raising initiative is expected to strengthen the companys balance sheet and liquidity position; enhance working capital availability to ensure smooth business operations; and support the Companys strategic turnaround plan, she said.\n\nThe Company plans to publish a circular to shareholders incorporating notice of an Extraordinary General Meeting of Members for the purpose of considering and approving the capital raise.\n\nAccordingly, shareholders and the investing public are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the Companys shares. Further announcements will be made in accordance with regulatory requirements as and when there are material developments, added Munyuru.\n\n",

Mnangagwa is no longer mentally fit to lead the country, he is suffering from vascular dementia; we have got copies of his medical results, said Geza in the video shared Wednesday night.\n\nHis doctors have already told him; his family is aware and the looting mafia is also aware.\n\nUnfortunately, some members of his family and the looting mafia are taking advantage of his memory loss and forgetfulness and making him sign documents they are using in looting the country.\n\nBecause of his vascular dementia Mnangagwa is no longer aware of what is going on around him. It is so serious that on Thursday last week he even forgot who July Moyo was or what ministry he runs.\n\nHe even argues with his aides whether he is at home or the office, at work.\n\nMnangagwa, who was handed the presidential seat post a November 2017 coup that toppled his long-time ally Robert Mugabe, is currently engaged in a long-running factional fight with his deputy Constantino Chiwenga, the man who led Zimbabwes army to seize power for him.\n\nChiwenga is eyeing the countrys presidency with alleged backing of the same army he used to prop up Mnangagwa.\n\nThe former army general is said to be targeting criminals around the presidency, a statement also used to justify Mugabes ouster.\n\nThese criminals, according to Geza, are now taking advantage of Mnangagwas mental state and using him to sign off deals and tenders in their favour\n\nAdded Geza: Vultures are circling around him, they are looting in his name, they are selling state-owned companies in his name, they are even firing and hiring state employees in his name.\n\nDubious characters you did not elect are now exercising presidential powers.\n\nThey follow him to his farm to give out tenders in his name, they take away your farms in his name and even appoint and disappoint army generals on his behalf.\n\nIt is a free-for-all for criminals around him. This has to stop.\n\nThey are now using him to sign anything that they come up with and they have actually devised a way of looting through his weaknesses.\n\nSection 97(1)(d) provides for removal of the President on the grounds that he is no longer able to perform duties as a result of his mental state.\n\nThis is the section cited by Geza in his latest call for impeachment.\n\nThe Senate and National Assembly, by a joint resolution passed by at least one half of their total membership, may resolve that the question whether or not the president or a Vice President should be removed from office for inability to perform the functions of the office because of physical or mental incapacity, should be investigated in terms of this section, reads Section 97(1)(d).\n\nGeza wants Chiwenga to take over. He has insinuated that Chiwenga will be the right tonic to Zimbabwes increasing cases of grand corruption.\n\nChiwenga has yet to comment on any of the issues raised.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/zimbabwes-economy-crashed-so-how-do-citizens-still-cling-to-myths-of-urban-and-economic-success/",
            "content": "The Conversation\n\nIt is common for nations to have myths, or narratives, that form the basis of theirnationalism, or their ideas of themselves as a political community. Such popular narratives are often rooted in a romanticised or idealised view of the past. This is certainly the case in Zimbabwe, where national myths about its urban modernity and economic exceptionalism have stood the test of time in contrast with the reality.\n\nThe idea of urban modernity has its roots in colonial times. At the time of independence in 1980, following a liberation warfrom 1965 to 1979, Zimbabwes economy was looking strong. Urban residents, especially, could think of themselves as modern: they had middle- and working-class lifestyles, social protection, social mobility opportunities and fixed working hours. Urban modernity meant order, steady employment, education.\n\nZimbabwes economy was exceptional in sub-Saharan Africa:diversified and robust.\n\nHowever, rapid socio-economic changes followed in the 1990s and 2000s. Zimbabwe was hit by a series ofeconomic, financial and political crises. This led to the collapse of urban middle- and working-class modernity and the rise of visibleinformal economic activitiesin the urban space. By 2004,over 80% of peoplehad informal livelihoods in Zimbabwe.\n\nMyPhD thesis(2021) examined Harares shift to informality and the impact of this on peoples everyday experiences of citizenship. The respondents in interviews carried out between 2016 and 2018 included vendors, cross-border traders, manufacturers, residents associations, informal sector organisations, local authorities and urban planners.\n\nThese interviews also form the basis of my recentresearch paper. My analysis sought to examine how people deal with the fact that current circumstances dont support their myths of urban nationalism.\n\nTell us here\n\nDuring a crisis, people rethink old ideas and adjust them to fit their new situation. As they do this, their notions of urban modernity and economic exceptionalism change. At the same time, they remember a past when their country was economically successful. This memory shapes how they think about the countrys future  and it also makes them question the government, which hasnt lived up to those past ideals.\n\nSo, what do the myths of urban modernity and economic exceptionalism mean in Zimbabwe today? Some people cling to the early postcolonial notions nurtured by the government. Others reluctantly accept economic informality while seeking to upgrade the idea of the informal sector. But there are others who challenge altogether the view that street vending is not modern and formal enough.\n\nThe prevalent informality was seen as a temporary phenomenon which would end soon. Then the country would return to having a modern urban lifestyle and strong economy.\n\nTo many of the respondents in 2016-2018, working and having a job meant being employed and having regular wages, job security and social protection.\n\nAt the same time, people also reluctantly accepted economic informality and some of the changes it made to their lives, while seeking to upgrade the idea of the informal sector. Some informal sector associations, for example, attempted to teach their members to see their activities as businesses and themselves as business people, as I reported in anotherpaper.\n\nRead more:How informal sector organisations in Zimbabwe shape notions of citizenship\n\nSome respondents drew a line between economic activities that were acceptable in the city centre and those that were not. These were similar to the early postcolonial notions enforced by the government. They suggested, for example, that street vending had no place in the city centre. It should only occur in limited designated spaces, and in residential areas.\n\nSome street vendors, though, defied the notion of street vending not being modern and formal enough. They dressed smartly to emphasise that street vending could also be done in a modern way and be a part of the mainstream economy.\n\nAt the beginning of colonial rule in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the colonisers planned for thecitiestoremain white. Unless Africans lived in their employers facilities, they were required to live indedicated areas.\n\nAt the same time, the colonial administration introduced and enforced the concept of order in Salisbury, now Harare, the capital. It punishedpoor, marginalised and homeless people. The same with economic and social activities it deemed undesirable.\n\nToday,over 32%of Zimbabweans live in urban areas.\n\nThe establishment in the 1930s of theAfrican middle classwas an important part of the urban modernity project. Those who sought to belong to it largely used education as their primary social mobility tool.\n\nRead more:Education in Zimbabwe has lost its value: study asks young people how they feel about that\n\nAfterindependencein 1980, the cities werederacialised. Everyone was free to enter and use the urban space. But the new government stillheld tight controland dictated who had the right to the city.\n\nNumerous operationswere conducted from the 1980s to clear the street of undesirable people and activities.For example, informal settlements were removed. Manywomenwere arrested on the pretext of clearing the city of prostitution. The most notorious clean-up operation was the2005 Operation Murambatsvina. It effectively punished all those considered unproductive and not deserving to be in the city.\n\nRead more:Dogs in the city: on the scent of Zimbabwes urban history\n\nThose high and, frankly, brutal standards of urban modernity have a long history in Zimbabwe and became a part of its urban nationalism.\n\nColonial and early postcolonial Zimbabwe had an exceptional anddiversifiedeconomy with strong mining, agricultural, and industrial sectors. Zimbabwes manufacturing sector contributed25% to GDP by 1974.\n\nDespite the economic decline, it is still a common narrative that Zimbabwes industrial sector wassecond onlyto South Africas in sub-Saharan Africa and that Zimbabwe was the breadbasket ofAfrica.\n\nHowever,manufacturing in colonial Zimbabwebenefited a small number of white industrialists. Black Zimbabweans did not have theopportunities. Theycould not own profitable manufacturing businesses or access finance.\n\nAfter independence, the government madeconsiderable effortsto deracialise the economy and public services.\n\nThe early postcolonial ideas about urban modernity and economic exceptionalism were severely undermined in Zimbabwe. But people try to give new meanings to these ideas in the changed social and economic circumstances. There is ongoing reluctance to accept that informality altered Zimbabwe for good. And many of my respondents wanted to find ways that the myths of modernity and economic exceptionalism could keep their meaning in the changed circumstances.\n\nContinuity and change in the myths of urban nationalism also raise the questions of legitimacy. In this case, it is about legitimacy of informal economic practices and legitimacy of the government that did not uphold the myths.\n\nIdeas can be very powerful in explaining peoples understanding of the political community they belong to. And when such ideals cannot be upheld, people will find new meanings in their material reality that let them hold on to old ideas or reinterpret them.\n\nLeverhulme Early Career Research Fellow, University of Edinburgh\n\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.Read the original articlehere.\n\n",

            "content": "GroundUp\n\nConstruction workers who survived thecollapse of a five-storey apartment blockunder construction in George almost a year ago, are yet to receive compensation from the Department of Labour.\n\nThey, along with the families of the workers who died, are entitled to compensation under the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act (COIDA).\n\nThe five-storey apartment block collapsed on 6 May 2024, killing 34 workers, at least 26 of whom were immigrants, and leaving most of the 28 survivors injured, some with permanent disabilities.\n\nA criminal case is being investigated by the police, and the Department of Human Settlements has said that a preliminary report by the National Home Builders Registration Council (NHBRC) suggests several procedures were not followed and laws not adhered to.\n\nIn terms of COIDA, the Compensation Fund is supposed to cover medical expenses and provide regular payouts to people who have been disabled, or to the family members of those who died. For permanently disabled people this can be a pension for life. The Compensation Fund is not confined to South African citizens; it covers immigrants who have been working in South Africa for more than a year.\n\nWith the help of local volunteers, at least 11 of the George building survivors have lodged claims with the Compensation Fund. The Fund has paid the medical expenses of some of them, but none of the survivors, or families of the deceased, have received any compensation payment.\n\nSome workers have been left with permanent disabilities.Mozambican Ivaldo Macomolost a leg and will likely never be able to work as a bricklayer again. His friend, Virgilio Sitoe, also from Mozambique, had nerve damage to both feet and was unable to work for several months. Although his medical treatment has ended, he is still in pain and struggles to work.\n\nAccording to COIDA, Macomo is entitled to receive a lifelong pension, and Sitoe should be compensated for the period he was unable to work.\n\nIvaldo Macamo lost his leg when a building under construction collapsed in George in May 2024. Archive photo: Daniel Steyn.\n\nMacomo, who lives in Thembalethu township in George, said his doctor told him his claim had been approved, but he has yet to receive any payment. Sitoe, who also lives in Thembalethu, said when he last visited the Department of Labour he was told he looks fine and his compensation claim will not succeed.\n\nShadrack Maine, from Lesotho, lost his right arm and right leg. He has also not yet received any funds.\n\nElelwani Mawela, from Zimbabwe, had her face crushed in the incident, but had to submit a Promotion of Access to Information Application (PAIA) to the Western Cape Premiers office in order to get her medical records from Groote Schuur Hospital where she had several weeks of reconstruction surgery.\n\nObtaining her medical records cost Mawela hundreds of rands in administration fees and printing costs, but when she took these documents to the Department of Labour, she was told she needed to obtain more documents.\n\nThe spouses and children of those who died are also entitled to a pension but It has been an equally difficult battle for the families. Child Kayuni is the husband of Tiwonge Muhango, who was employed as a cleaner at the site and was killed in the building collapse. Kayuni, who has a valid passport and work permit, has still not received any compensation for his wifes death at her workplace.\n\nPublic interest lawyer at Richard Spoor Inc. George Kahn says the challenges the building collapse victims face in getting their compensation are very typical. He says people often give up, even though they have valid claims.\n\nKahn says that labour department officials are usually incompetent with respect to correctly interpreting and timeously implementing the COIDA and that the systems and infrastructure are defective. Employees often have to submit the same documents again and again because officials lose the documents, he says.\n\nKhan saysone of hisclients waited 20 years before getting his compensation.\n\nMany of the immigrants working on the site were not properly documented. Khan says COIDA should cover all workers regardless of immigration status, but that is not always the reality on the ground. Workers who are not registered with the Compensation Fund should also be able to claim, but claims are often rejected in these cases, and this has to be challenged in appeal, says Kahn.\n\nGroundUp hasreportedthat the Compensation Fund has had 12 years of adverse audit opinions, along with findings of fraud. The disarray means medical expense claims take months to be paid out, some legitimate claims are never paid, and sometimes claims are paid twice by accident.\n\nIn response to detailed questions from GroundUp, the Department of Labour stated: The departments processes are still unfolding therefore no comment.\n\n",
