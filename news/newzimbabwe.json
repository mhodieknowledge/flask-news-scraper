It is our strong position that those on duty must be held accountable and prosecuted for their negligence, which resulted in this costly disaster, he said.\n\nNgadziore said looking ahead, the only lasting solution is a comprehensive redevelopment of the Glenview SMEs Complex.\n\nMore than 4,000 traders operate from the precinct confirming the significant economic contribution of SMEs to the local economy.\n\nGoing into the future, the committee said it is advocating for a comprehensive redevelopment of the complex through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) guided by urban planning and fire safety regulations, to replan and modernise the facility.\n\nTo this end development, construction of a new Peoples Market nearby is expected to begin soon.\n\nThis initiative will create over 30 modern kiosks, providing a safer and more dignified environment for traders.\n\n",
