            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTHE countrys alternative to the ruling establishment has reacted angrily over Zanu PFs resolution passed in Mutare to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas tenure by two years to 2030.\n\nThe just ended 22nd Zanu PF Annual Peoples Conference directed that both the party and government put in place the necessary legal, constitutional, and administrative measures to ensure that this resolution is fully implemented and operationalised by the time of the next conference.\n\nMnangagwas term ends in 2028, but he has vowed to abide by the laws of the land, stepping down when his term ends.\n\nInformation secretary Nick Mangwana wrote on X that the Zanu PF conference had directed the Justice ministry to begin legal processes to extend Mnangagwas term by two years to 2030, further directing that this should be done by October next year.\n\nFormer Citizen Coalition for Change (CCC) leader Nelson Chamisa responded to the passed resolution by the ruling party saying it was only binding to Zanu PF members and not the people of Zimbabwe.\n\nZanu PF resolutions bind Zanu PF and her members, not Zimbabwe and her people, Nelson Chamisa said on his X handle.\n\nCCC interim leader Jameson Timba said only a referendum can decide on the constitutional changes.\n\nCCC interim leader Jameson Timba\n\nZanu PFs 2030 resolution of today is silent on how it will be done. If it means changing the Constitution, only a referendum can decide and even then, the sitting President cannot benefit. Zimbabwe is ruled by law, not party resolutions\n\nTendai Biti also gave his thoughts promising a vicious fight to to deal with corrupt cartels and defend the Constitution\n\nOpposition activist and lawyer Tendai Biti\n\nOur mandate is short and brief. We will defend the Constitution against its capture & manipulation to advance a dangerous unconstitutional anti-people agenda.\n\nWe will fight corrupt cartels and syndicates that have systematically looted Zimbabwe and now want to take over the State, Biti said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe 22nd Zanu PF National Peoples Conference delegates affirmed that Mnangagwas visionary leadership, marked by stability, economic recovery, and transformative national development, must continue to guide the nation beyond the current constitutional term limit.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTEN people, including senior citizens aged over 70, appeared in court Saturday accused of attempting to participate in an unsanctioned demonstration dubbed the One Million Man March against President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nThe accused are Rose Chirenje (65) of Sandton, Westgate; Nyarai Chigudu (52) of Glen View 3; Kenesia Jera (62) of Whitecliff; Edward Mandikutse (69) of Sunningdale 3; Dexter Jena (69) of Muredzo Farm, Wedza; and Hazvinei Machingura (69) of Makomo Extension, Epworth.Others are Stephen Chagwiza (48) of Eastview; Jacob Masaraure (75) of Lodia Farm, Chivhu; Mapengo Mapengo (57) of Chizhanda Township, Mutoko; and Joephrey Chigwerewe (70) of Huyuyu, Mutoko.The group appeared before Harare magistrate Caroline Kuhudzayi charged with participating in a gathering with intent to promote public violence, breaches of peace or bigotry in violation of Section 37(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23].Prosecutors allege that on October 17, 2025, the accused, acting on calls by political activist Blessed Runesu Geza, gathered near Africa Unity Square in Harare intending to take part in the planned One Million Man March against Mnangagwas government.According to the State, Geza had earlier urged citizens through Facebook and WhatsApp to demonstrate against the President, accusing him of betraying the people of Zimbabwe and aligning himself with economic saboteurs,. derogatorily referred to as Zviganandas.Police said the group was intercepted at the corner of George Silundika Avenue and Sam Nujoma Street, where they were allegedly singing and dancing to a protest song with the lyrics Zvigananda chera mwena nguva yakwana, chera mwena zvigananda  loosely translated as Economic saboteurs, your time is up.Detectives from CID Law and Order Harare arrested the first six suspects at the scene and later apprehended four others, Chagwiza, Masaraure, Mapengo and Chigwerewe, who were allegedly found hiding in a silver Toyota Probox (AGG 1898) parked at Corner Sixth Street and Kwame Nkrumah Avenue.Investigators claim that stones, boulders and other missiles were found hidden near the protest site.In his sworn affidavit opposing bail, Detective Sergeant Lovemore Chisi of CID Law and Order argued that releasing the accused could threaten national peace and security.The nature of the offence suggests a propensity for inciting or engaging in further public disorder, he said.Releasing the accused could reignite unrest or embolden others.Chisi also warned that the accused might abscond trial given the lengthy custodial sentence they face if convicted.The group was remanded in custody to Monday for their bail application hearing.Police said investigations were ongoing and that several other suspects linked to the planned march remain at large.\n\nThe accused are Rose Chirenje (65) of Sandton, Westgate; Nyarai Chigudu (52) of Glen View 3; Kenesia Jera (62)

            "content": "By Central News\n\nTHE Department of Transport has pinpointed speeding as a major factor in the horrific bus crash near Makhado in Limpopo that claimed 43 lives on Sunday, 12 October 2025.\n\nA preliminary report by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) revealed the driver was going too fast for the conditions on the mountain pass, compounded by severe mechanical defects and overloading.\n\nThe bus, travelling from Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape to Zimbabwe, veered off the N1 highway, plunging down a steep embankment and landing upside down.\n\nThe tragedy left 34 people seriously injured and six with minor injuries, with victims including 18 women, 17 men, seven children, and a 10-month-old baby.\n\nMost passengers were Zimbabwean and Malawian nationals heading home, turning a routine journey into a nightmare.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa offered condolences to the affected nations, while Transport Minister Barbara Creecy directed urgent investigations into the bus companys responsibility and possible culpable homicide charges.This incident has reignited concerns over road safety for cross-border buses, with calls for stricter border checks on vehicle roadworthiness.\n\nAs families begin the painful process of identifying loved ones using fingerprints and photos at Tshilidzini Hospital, the focus shifts to preventing such disasters in the future.\n\nInvestigation Reveals Speeding as Primary Cause\n\nThe RTMC probe found the driver lost control while navigating the treacherous Zoutpansberg mountain road, known for its steep descents and hairpin bends.\n\nThe driver of the bus drove at a speed too high for the conditions down the mountain pass, the department stated.The bus tumbled into a ravine, scattering debris and personal belongings across the site.\n\nRescue teams worked through the night to recover bodies and aid survivors, with some passengers self-discharging from hospitals. The crash sites challenging terrain complicated efforts, but authorities confirmed all victims were accounted for by Monday.\n\nJust days later, on 15 October 2025, another tragedy struck nearby when a truck carrying cement plunged off a cliff opposite the bus crash scene, underscoring the roads dangers. No fatalities were reported in the truck incident, but it has prompted questions about the N1s safety for heavy vehicles.\n\nMechanical Failures and Unroadworthy Condition Exposed\n\nA mechanical inspection uncovered alarming defects: only five out of ten brakes on the bus and trailer were working.\n\nDuring the mechanical investigation, it was also established that the bus and trailer only had five out of the 10 brakes in operational condition and that one brake on the bus had no braking ability. It was established that out of five brakes on the bus, one brake was not in an operational condition, the report detailed.\n\nNone of the four brakes on the trailer functioned, and the suspension had been poorly repaired. This left the vehicle with just half its braking power, a defect the driver was likely aware of and had adapted to.\n\nTherefore, the bus and trailer were not in a roadworthy condition by virtue of the defective braking system and the poorly repaired suspension of the trailer. This means that the driver of the bus and trailer was aware of this braking deficiency and had adapted his driving style to accommodate this defect.\n\nBoxes of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and other medications were found in the wreckage, raising further questions about the buss cargo and possible illegal transport. The bus, operated by DNC Coach Services, was foreign-registered, prompting calls for better border inspections.\n\nOverloading Contributed to the Tragedy\n\nThe bus was severely overloaded, carrying 91 occupants despite a capacity of 62.\n\nThe bus was found to have had 91 occupants, even though the bus only had capacity for 62 occupants, the department said. Among them were 11 children aged three to five, and under regulations, two such children count as one adult. Adjusted for this, the vehicle was overloaded by 23 people.\n\nThe trailer was packed with baggage and belongings, adding to the weight and likely contributing to the loss of control. Overloading is a common issue in cross-border buses, often leading to mechanical strain and higher risks in accidents.\n\nRoad Conditions Ruled Out as Factor\n\nThe investigation cleared the road itself, finding the N1 surface before and after the crash in good condition.\n\nThe road surface along the N1 before and after the crash scene was noted as being in good condition and therefore not considered a cause and/or contributory factor to this road crash, officials confirmed.This shifts blame squarely to the driver and vehicle maintenance, rather than infrastructure shortcomings.\n\nRecommendations for Enhanced Road Safety\n\nThe preliminary report urged focused law enforcement on heavy vehicles, especially foreign ones entering South Africa.\n\nLaw enforcement operations be considered to examine and evaluate the roadworthiness of vehicles that enter South African roads, as the bus is a foreign registered vehicle, it recommended. Such checks could have spotted the defects and prevented the crash.\n\nIt also called for the RTMCs National Traffic Police and provincial teams to target vehicles ignoring warning signs and speeding downhill.\n\nConcentrate their attention on heavy vehicles that do not adhere to warning signs and do not reduce speed when driving downhill, as it is evident that the bus and trailer drove at a speed too fast for the road environment and failed to negotiate the hairpin bend.\n\nThe full technical reconstruction report will take 21 weeks, including a look at weighbridge checks where overloading should have been caught.\n\nMinister Creecys Directives for Accountability\n\nTransport Minister Barbara Creecy has taken swift action, directing the RTMC to probe DNC Coachs role in ensuring roadworthiness and consider culpable homicide charges.\n\nThe Minister of Transport, Barbara has directed the RTMC to investigate the bus companys responsibility in ensuring the roadworthiness of the bus and to further consider a culpable homicide complaint against the bus company in terms of the duties of the operator, the department said.\n\nShe requested the buss maintenance schedule and service records, and tasked the Anti-Corruption Unit to check which testing centre issued its roadworthy certificate. Creecy also ordered inspections of the DNC fleet at borders and any depots in South Africa.\n\nThese steps aim to hold the company accountable and prevent similar tragedies. Families have expressed frustration over DNCs lack of communication, with no passenger list provided, leaving them searching hospitals for loved ones.\n\n",
