I have never worked in Zimbabwe once. Ndakaita garden boy ku Cape Town (handina hangu kubira McMillan family) ndikashanda nesimba mu sport yangu.\n\nNdakashinga kusvika ndaita champion.

I think theyre very excited. Im super excited for the challenge that lies ahead and the guys are amped for it, Sammons said.\n\nTheyre looking forward to testing themselves and showing what theyre capable of. I think they really want to make a statement over the next couple of weeks.\n\nThe home sides preparations has been to focus on building intensity and volume while ensuring all fundamentals are being addressed before shifting to specific tactical planning.\n\nDespite the demanding sessions, Sammons said the players had responded with enthusiasm and purpose.\n\nHe added: Right now, its more about making sure were covering all our bases . . . its more around the volume, and then we get a little bit more specific as we head closer to the Test.\n\nThe attitude is good. Its always good. We can never fault the attitude. Theyre always wanting to get the most out of each other and improve as much as they can, and again, theyve shown that over the last few days.\n\nThe second and final Test of series will also be played at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo from 6 July before the teams move to Harare for a T20I tri-series that will also feature New Zealand.\n\n",

            "content": "The Citizen\n\nA child abuse case has stalled after the alleged perpetrators, the guardians of a Grade 5 learner from Skeen Primary School, reportedly took her to Zimbabwe, leaving police struggling to gather evidence.\n\nThe family violence, child protection, and sexual offenses commander confirmed that the child was taken out of South Africa before critical evidence could be obtained. The learners statement was not yet obtained and she had not been taken to a doctor. The learner must be taken to the doctor to prove the case.\n\nThe investigating officer said he suspects the accused guardians took the child to Zimbabwe to kill the case. This was corroborated by Skeen Primary School deputy principal Masilo Lebeya, who revealed that the guardians took the child away swiftly, in the wake of allegations of abuse, and ahead of her June examinations, without informing the school. We only learned of her whereabouts when a social worker contacted one of the suspects, who admitted taking her to Zimbabwe, Lebeya said, adding that the school subsequently opened a case of abuse at the Sandringham Police Station.\n\nWhen asked if there were early, telltale signs that the victim was being abused, Lebeya said they were only seen at a later stage, and that the process of counselling the victim was only initiated when they confirmed that she had a family problem. Remember, we are dealing with a lot of children here. You might find that, by the time a teacher notices that she needs to intervene, it is a bit late. It shows that the child has been suffering in silence, he noted, further emphasising that the school has a strong support system and they have always encouraged children to share their problems.\n\nMatheba said they are trying to get the accused guardians to co-operate. He stressed that, without it, the police will not be able to build a case. Matheba said if they do not co-operate, the police will have to work with home affairs immigration authorities to verify the victims legal status in South Africa. If she was here illegally, then we would have to involve authorities on that side, to get her a passport so that she can be transported back to South Africa, and that will be a long process.\n\n",
