            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nTHE United States Department of State has released a damning report on Zimbabwes human rights situation, noting how perpetrators have gone unpunished and the increased abuse of journalists by the state.\n\nZimbabwe has, for close to three decades, failed to respect basic human rights, an issue that has put it at loggerheads with world leaders such as America, the United Kingdom (UK) and the rest of Europe.\n\nCases of state-sponsored abductions, violence and targeting of dissenting voices, mainly opposition politicians, human rights defenders and journalists, have dominated its record.\n\nThe report in question focuses on the year 2024.\n\nThere were no significant changes in the human rights situation in Zimbabwe during the year, reads the report.\n\nSignificant human rights issues included credible reports of: torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest and detention; serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, including violence or threats of violence against journalists and censorship; trafficking in persons, including forced labor; significant restrictions on workers freedom of association; and significant presence of the worst forms of child labor.\n\nThe government did not take credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.\n\nAlthough the absence of extrajudicial killings was noted, this can be best explained by the fact that 2024 was not an elective year, as was witnessed in 2023 when the country headed for local authority, parliamentary and presidential elections.\n\nFreedom of speech was, however, heavily inhibited according to the report, which was released just months after journalist Blessed Mhlanga was released from pretrial detention.\n\nAdds the report: Authorities were sensitive to criticism of the government, security officials, the president, and the ruling Zanu PF party.\n\nIn July 2023, the government amended the criminal code to introduce heavy penalties for citizens at home and abroad and permanent residents convicted of willfully injuring the sovereignty and national interest of Zimbabwe.\n\nCivil society organisations and human rights defenders reported the law continued to have a chilling effect on freedom of expression.\n\nZimbabwes poor record has been a major stumbling block for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in his attempts to re-engage with the West.\n\nHe is widely considered tainted, having not just been late President Robert Mugabes right-hand man for decades until his deposition, but having also played a central role in the Gukurahundi genocide that killed more than 20,000 mainly Ndebele-speaking people.\n\nThe government regularly used arbitrary arrest and detention as tools of intimidation and harassment, especially against opposition party members, political activists, civil society members, journalists, attorneys, and ordinary citizens asserting their rights, it reads.\n\nThe government launched a crackdown on government critics in the lead-up to the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Summit on August 17 in Harare. In June, police arrested 80 opposition activists after violently breaking up their meeting at a private residence.\n\nCivil servants poor working conditions were also noted, with failed attempts at dialogue illustrated by arrests of not just Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) leaders but also Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union (ARTUZ) officials.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA bitter showdown has erupted between Bryden Country School in Chegutu and Chinese-owned Shuntai Cement, after the company pushed ahead with building a lime and cement factory just 497 metres from the schools boundary despite a High Court order to stop operations.\n\nThe elite school accuses Shuntai of endangering pupils health with toxic dust, noxious fumes and noise pollution, while cornering the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) for issuing an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) certificate that allegedly ignored glaring health and zoning violations.\n\nIn a letter addressed to parents dated August 16 2025 gleaned by NewZimbabwe.com, it has emerged that on March 25, the High Court ordered Shuntai to suspend any activities at its Eastbourne, Chegutu site.\n\nTheChinesecompany pressed on with construction, including blasting and heavy machinery works, which parents say have already exposed children to hazardous dust and fumes.\n\nFrustrated, Bryden took Shuntai back to court, accusing the company of contempt of court.\n\nAlso, on 25 July, a High Court judge visited the site to determine for himself if Shuntai was in contempt of the first stop order.\n\nHis ruling in the current High Court order confirms this.\n\nThe school has also dragged EMA to court, accusing the regulator of rubber-stamping Shuntais ESIA report despite clear evidence that the project sits in an education zone with multiple institutions nearby, including Springs of Grace, Seventh Day Adventist Secondary School and a university.\n\nIn the letter to parents, Brydens chairperson of governors, A. Noor, said EMA only released the ESIA after a court order, but it was the same flawed report initially rejected.\n\nShuntai managed to wangle an ESIA certificate from EMA, suggesting they had addressed stakeholder concerns, of which they had not, Noor said.\n\nThe school has now appealed to parents to stand firm as the legal battle escalates.\n\nWe are not yet out of the woods as Shuntai is determined to proceed even against the ruling of the High Court of Zimbabwe, Noor warned. Forty-three years ago, parents came together to build this school, and today we are appealing for parents to stand united to defend it.\n\nThe dispute now awaits a decisive hearing before the Administrative Court and the Minister of Environment, but with construction still underway, Bryden says children remain at risk.\n\nIn the meantime, massive building has continued on site, and the school has been experiencing increased dust influx as well as fumes from burning of noxious material, as well as noise of heavy machinery and some blasting mainly experienced on the pool side of the school.\n\nThus, the school was compelled to go back to court to reinforce the first stop order, Noor said.\n\n",

Poverty-induced school dropout continues unabated, and early and forced marriages, often driven by cultural and religious norms, further limit girls life choices.\n\nTo the UN and International Community, support independent civic education and electoral participation programs that equip women and girls with the tools to engage meaningfully in public life and facilitate capacity-building programs for law enforcement, the judiciary, and public officials on gender-sensitive governance and human rights-based approaches, ZimRights added.\n\nZimRights also urged the government of Zimbabwe to enforce stronger institutional accountability, prosecution of political violence against women, improved access to basic services, expanded support for survivors of gender-based violence, and stricter enforcement of child marriage laws to advance womens rights.\n\n",

The two markets, official and parallel, have maintained a close range, hovering between ZWG28, 00 to a high of ZWG34, 00 against the greenback.\n\nBut presenting a trading update for the companys first quarter period, Hippo Valley said the local unit still faces acceptance challenges.\n\nWhile the ZWG currency has shown relative stability since the significant devaluation experienced at the end of September 2024, it faces significant challenges, particularly in gaining widespread acceptance.\n\nThe tight liquidity conditions that prevailed during the quarter and the currency mix dilemma when trading using the ZWG currency resulted in episodes of excess ZWG cash balances for the company and USD working capital challenges, with most suppliers of goods and services, particularly the informal sector, continuing to favor the USD currency due to perceived stability, the company said.\n\nThe sugar producer said that despite the first quarter ending with relatively stable exchange rates, input costs were elevated due to inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions as global trade policies shifted.\n\nIn terms of operations, the first quarter sugar production period ended on a positive note, marked by a 15% increase in cane supply from the companys plantations (miller-cum-planter), attributed to the higher milling crushing season.\n\nAdditionally, cane quality improved from an Estimated Recoverable Crystal of 11,30% to 11,46%.\n\nDespite some minimal mill start-up challenges, the plant had impressive recoveries, after achieving a cane sugar ratio of 8.49 against the prior year of 8.50 and the target of 8.75. Private cane deliveries marginally dropped due to diversions to the Triangle mill after the start-up challenges referred to above, the company added.\n\n",
