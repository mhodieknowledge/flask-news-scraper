            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA planned address by opposition and civic society leaders at the Southern Africa Political Economy Series (SAPES) Trust was abruptly disrupted on Tuesday after Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) anti-riot officers stormed the venue.\n\nOpposition figures Tendai Biti, Job Sikhala, and Jacob Ngarivhume were scheduled to speak on an alleged plot by ZANU PF to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas term beyond 2028.\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday, the SAPES Trust premises were reportedly petrol-bombed and a guard on duty was abducted, in what is believed to be a coordinated attempt to stop the discussion.\n\nSAPES Trust Director Ibbo Mandaza said there appeared to be a clear link between the arson attack and the subsequent police disruption.\n\nIt is not surprising at all. There is a correlation between what happened after midnight,the arson, the abduction of the security guard.\n\nIt was done by people who know the job of fear. They seem to have forgotten that we have endured such harassment for the past two years, said Mandaza.\n\nThe ruling party has endorsed a resolution seeking to extend Mnangagwas presidency to 2030, which would require amending Section 91(2) of the Constitution, which limits a president to two terms, and Section 328(7), which bars incumbents from benefiting from constitutional amendments.\n\nAccording to party insiders, ZANU PF intends to use its parliamentary majority to push through the proposed changes.\n\nSpeaking at the disrupted event, Biti condemned the attacks and reaffirmed the groups commitment to defending the Constitution.\n\nWe are very sorry to Dr. Mandaza over the arson, and to Gilbert Mbwende, whose house was also attacked.\n\nThis is a new initiative by concerned citizens to resist the mutilation of the Constitution. It is not a political effort, but a civic one, to defend the rule of law, Biti said.\n\n",

This cowardly act must be condemned in the strongest terms possible. How can we live in a country that fears words? Mpofu wrote on his X account on Tuesday morning.\n\nWriting on his X account on Tuesday morning, self-exiled former Cabinet Minister, Saviour Kasukuwere, said the bombing of SAPES Trust is a shameful act.\n\nThis is shameful. A leopard cannot change its spots! We have to choose hope over fear.\n\nAlthough Mnangagwa styles himself as a constitutionalist and has declined to plan for running beyond 2028, he has done little to stop those who are canvassing support for him to continue in power until 2030.\n\nThe calls for Mnangagwa to continue beyond 2028 have caused fissures within his ruling party, Zanu PF.\n\nAnalysts have warned that the succession battle in Zanu PF could cause chaos and violence in the country, as they believe that the calls for Mnangagwa to go beyond 2028 are purely a strategy to frustrate his deputy, Rtd Constantino Chiwenga, who is widely expected to take over.\n\n",

They attacked a security guard and the businessmans son before shooting him.\n\nSo far, police have arrested three suspects: Given Mandizadza (34), Phillip Mutasa (38), and Vengesai Jabulani Mutasa, while four other accomplices remain at large.\n\nVengesai Jabulani Mutasa\n\nVengesai initially shot Detective Constable Ngwenya of CID Homicide, who was part of a team trying to apprehend him for Mutangaduras murder, before fleeing arrest.\n\nHe later went to the police station on Sunday, where he found Constable Courage Muchechesi taking a statement from Abraham Mavayo, who was reporting an assault case.\n\nPolice said Vengesai confronted officers at the station, accusing homicide detectives of stealing US$1,000 from his home and demanding to see them.\n\nHe allegedly forced Constable Muchechesi and Mavayo to lie down while demanding money before shooting Muchechesi in the stomach.\n\nMuchechesi staggered out of the building, calling for help, and collapsed near the single quarters where he was later found dead by fellow officers.\n\nHe fled the station and was later arrested by residents from Sanyati, Kadoma, Chakari, and Patchway who had joined forces to track him down.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) says the annual inflation target set by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) remains within reach, citing consistency in the implementation of inflation containment measures.\n\nAccording to the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (Zimstat), the Zimbabwe Gold (ZWG) currency has maintained notable stability against the US dollar since September 2024, when it last experienced a major dip.\n\nZimstat data shows that month-on-month inflation stood at -0.2% in September 2025, down by 0.6 percentage points from 0.4% in August 2025.\n\nIn its latest inflation tracker, CZI expressed optimism that the RBZ will meet its 2025 inflation target by year-end.\n\nIf ZiG month-on-month inflation continues to grow by less than 1% in the next four months to December 2025, annual inflation is projected to be less than 20% in December 2025, CZI said.\n\nThis implies that the 2025 Midterm Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) targets, of keeping annual ZiG inflation below 30% and month-on-month inflation between 1% and 3%, are likely to be achieved.\n\nThe industry body noted that between July and late August 2025, the ZiG appreciated on both the official and parallel markets. Despite this, the parallel market premium remained relatively constant at around 27%, indicating some degree of exchange rate convergence.\n\nCZI added that the still-high annual inflation rate largely reflects the September 2024 devaluation of the ZiG, and that inflation pressures are expected to ease further in October 2025, provided no new shocks emerge.\n\nAfter rising in July 2025, month-on-month inflation eased to 0.4% in August 2025, a development CZI attributed to the effectiveness of the current tight monetary policy stance in stabilising prices, albeit under constrained liquidity conditions.\n\nIn the long term, monetary policy will need to gradually ease liquidity conditions as stability becomes more sustainable, CZI said.\n\nKeeping inflation below 1% enhances price stability and broadens the use of the ZiG beyond a transaction currency. Businesses that previously preferred USD-only transactions are now slowly encouraging ZiG payments to meet some of their monthly obligations.\n\n",
