            "content": "In a decisive move to address escalating concerns within South Africas police ministry, President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed Mineral and Petroleum Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe as the acting Minister of Police, effective immediately as of Tuesday evening,Cape {town} Etcreports.\n\nThis temporary appointment comes as allegations of misconduct and malfeasance involving high-ranking officials cast a shadow over the law enforcement agency.\n\nMantashes role will be short-lived as he is slated to hold the position until Professor Firoz Cachalia steps into the role at the beginning of August.\n\nCachalia, who has spent most of his career in academia, is poised to take the reins following his retirement from the University of the Witwatersrand at the end of this month.\n\nHis appointment was previously announced by Ramaphosa during a televised address on Sunday.\n\nThe political landscape is particularly volatile at present, with serious allegations surfacing against former Police Minister Senzo Mchunu. In a stark revelation, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Police Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, claimed a powerful criminal syndicate has infiltrated South Africas law enforcement and judicial systems.\n\nMkhwanazi went one step further, accusing Mchunu of meddling in sensitive cases and colluding with a businessman accused of murder, aiming to dismantle the task force investigating a spate of political killings in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nIn light of these explosive allegations, President Ramaphosa has taken decisive action, placing Mchunu on special leave while also initiating a judicial commission of inquiry to be led by Acting Deputy Chief Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga.\n\nThe commission is tasked with investigating claims of interference in investigations, complicity among government officials, and the suppression of crucial law enforcement activities.\n\nMchunu, embroiled in controversy over the past week, has been accused by Mkhwanazi of being entwined with drug cartels and influential business concerns.\n\nAmong the allegations presented was an assertion that Lieutenant-General Shadrack Sibiya, deputy national commissioner for crime detection, colluded with Mchunu and a known information dealer, Brown Mogotsi, in a plot to disband the KwaZulu-Natal political killings task team.\n\nPolice Commissioner Masemola announced that Sibiya would also be requesting a leave of absence while investigations unfold, indicating a stern approach to restoring integrity within the police service.\n\n",

Stability measures crime levels, civil unrest, and the threat of conflict.\n\nHealthcare assesses the quality and availability of public and private services. Culture and environment consider factors like climate, recreational options, and personal freedoms.\n\nEducation is judged by access to quality public and private schooling, while infrastructure focuses on roads, transport, housing, and global connectivity. These combined metrics provide a snapshot of how liveable a city is for its residents.\n\nMost African nations are grappling with persistent economic pressures, insecurity, and strained public services.\n\nIn many of these cities, ongoing political unrest, insecurity, limited access to quality healthcare, and under-resourced education systems contribute topoor livability scores.\n\nIn Nigeria, cities like Lagos and Port Harcourt continue to suffer from overcrowding, inadequate healthcare systems, and rising crime rates, while Zimbabwes capital, Harare, remains burdened by hyperinflation, aging infrastructure, and limited access to essential services.\n\nAlgeria and Libya have also been named among the worldsmost difficult placesto live, joining Nigeria and Zimbabwe in a ranking that highlights the pressures facing several African cities.\n\nFor example, Tripoli in Libya continues to struggle with the effects of prolonged conflict and weakened institutions, while Algiers faces structural economic challenges and restrictions on civil liberties.\n\nThese issues are compounded byinadequate infrastructureand housing conditions that fall short of global standards.\n\nThe table below presents the ten most challenging cities to live in globally.\n\nCities at the bottom of the liveability rankings are predominantly located in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting persistent instability, limited infrastructure, and constrained access to quality services.\n\n",
