The aspirations which saw many sons and daughters of this great land wage a protracted liberation struggle are being achieved, sector by sector. Well done, Zimbabwe. Well done, ZANU-PF. We have every reason to be proud.\n\nHowever, looking into the future, a great responsibility lies with us, as the Peoples Party. Our duty is to create an environment that future generations will be proud of. We must enable our communities, the youth, women, SMEs, and others to be ready for the future, said Mnangagwa.\n\n",

            "content": "Channel Africa\n\nZimbabwes attempt to reckon with one of its darkest chapters, the Gukurahundi massacres of the 1980s, is drawing fierce criticism, with questions raised about the legitimacy of the process under President Emmerson Mnangagwas leadership.\n\nThe government says it is moving forward with a judicial and reconciliation programme aimed at addressing long-standing grievances stemming from the mass killings in Matabeleland and the Midlands, which left an estimated 20 000 people dead. But for many survivors and human rights advocates, the effort feels hollow, not least because of who is leading it.\n\nAt the time of the atrocities, Mnangagwa was the Minister of State for National Security, serving under then-President Robert Mugabe. His involvement in the security structures responsible for the crackdown has cast a long shadow over the current initiative.\n\nGeopolitical analyst Aaron Ngambi believes the process is more about optics than accountability.Mnangagwa seems determined to close this chapter, but many view it as an attempt to whitewash the past, Ngambi said in an interview. Its difficult to talk about reconciliation when those accused of complicity are in charge of the process.\n\nThe Gukurahundi killings, carried out by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade, targeted members of the Ndebele ethnic group in the aftermath of Zimbabwes independence. The violence has never been properly investigated, and the state has long resisted calls for justice and recognition.\n\nNow, with the renewed focus on the issue, some observers say the timing may be politically motivated, part of a broader effort by Mnangagwa to shape his legacy and consolidate power in the run-up to future elections.\n\nAny reconciliation process that fails to include survivors, civil society and independent investigators will never be seen as credible, Ngambi warned. This moment demands openness, not control.\n\n",
