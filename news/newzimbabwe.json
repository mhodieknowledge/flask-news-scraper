SADC appreciates the support rendered by international cooperating partners, in response to the critical needs of the displaced populations.\n\nHowever, more must be done to alleviate the situation. The people of the eastern DRC have suffered for far too long, Mnangagwa said.\n\nThe SADC chair also denounced in strongest terms the attacks by the M23 rebels.\n\nFurther, SADC condemns in the strongest terms the attacks by aggressor forces. While we pause to mourn our loss, our resolve to ensure collective security cannot be shaken.\n\nThe importance of dialogue and peace building for the benefit of the people of the Eastern DRC must be boldly pursued.\n\nTo this end, our region stands ready to intensify efforts to protect the SADC citizens from all forms of instability, in line with the SADC Mutual Defence Pact, Mnangagwa added.\n\n",

When he first came to talk to me, I thought he was not properly wired in his head, but I now know that he is well connected, Mnangagwa said.\n\nMnangagwa also claimed that the Americans had offered the Chikumbutso US$3 million to stay in the States and continue his work, but he refused.\n\nThey offered him US$3 million to stay there and told him to let them have their US$3 million, he added.\n\nThe Information Ministry also posted on its X account, lavishing praise on Chikumbutso.\n\nChikumbutso is an inventor, entrepreneur, and founder of Saith Technologies and Saith Motors. He made one of the worlds first cars that need no fuel, no recharging, no input. The Saith FEV is a full self-powering electric vehicle , which is powered entirely by radio waves.\n\nThis post has now been deleted.\n\nNick Mangwana, the Permanent Secretary for Information, who also posted praise for Chikumbutso, has also deleted his posts on X.\n\nIt appears that Chikumbutso has pulled a fast one on Mnangagwa and his government, similar to what Rotina Mavhunga did to Robert Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party, including cabinet ministers.\n\nMavhunga claimed that diesel was oozing from Maningwa Hills in Chinhoyi in 2007. Mavhunga, also known as Nomatter Tagarira, is a traditional healer and spirit medium. Mavhunga, who only had a grade 3 education, was found guilty of fraud and misleading government officials in 2010.\n\nZanu-PF government ministers, even removed their shoes during the visit to the rock in Chinhoyi, believing that ancestral spirits were making the rock produce refined diesel naturally.\n\n",

            "content": "CNN\n\nMigrant workers in Canada have been exposed to shocking abuse and discrimination while working under the countrys Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP), according to a new report by Amnesty International.\n\nIn thereportpublished Thursday, Amnesty criticized the structure of Canadas TFWP, which allows employers to hire migrant workers for primarily low-paid jobs across sectors including agriculture, food processing, construction, and hospitality.\n\nThe human rights organization said laborers were vulnerable to abuse through harmful provisions in the program, including closed work permits that tie workers to a single employer who controls both their migration status and labor conditions.\n\nAmnesty interviewed 44 migrant workers from 14 countries for the report, predominantly from what it termed the Global South, with most workers reporting unpaid wages and excessive hours. Some workers told Amnesty their contracts stipulated zero rest days.\n\nOne woman from Cameroon, Bndicte, told Amnesty she had suffered racist psychological and sexual abuse at the hands of her employer while working on a two-year closed work permit on a farm.\n\nAfter leaving the farm in July 2018, her employer canceled her work permit, leaving Bndicte with an irregular migration status. I did not expect to be a slave here, she told Amnesty.\n\nAnother worker told Amnesty he faced severe forms of control by his employer.\n\nMiguel, a Guatemalan migrant worker with a two-year visa under the TFWP, told Amnesty he was threatened and surveilled. He said his boss confiscated his passport and placed cameras in the container where he lived and the garage where he worked.\n\nThe abuse experienced by migrant workers in Canada is deeply troubling, especially for a country that claims to be a leader when it comes to protecting human rights, Erika Guevara-Rosas, senior director for research, advocacy, policy and campaigns at Amnesty International, said.\n\nAmnesty also said many workers reported living in inadequate housing conditions, with a few saying they did not have drinking water in their accommodation.\n\nAn official at Amnesty International Canada, Ketty Nivyabandi, called on Canadas leaders to implement reforms to bring the program in line with Canadas human rights obligations  and, ultimately, to respect the rights of workers.\n\nThe Canadian government told CNN it was aware of the Amnesty report.\n\nThe government of Canada takes the safety and dignity of temporary foreign workers very seriously and has been taking strong action to protect workers, said Nancy Caron, the spokesperson for Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).\n\nWhile in Canada, temporary foreign workers have the same employment standards, rights, and protections under federal, provincial, and territorial law as do Canadian citizens and permanent residents.\n\nShe added the government was continuously taking steps to strengthen its temporary foreign worker programs, including programs to help workers obtain private health insurance, a tip line to report wrongdoing, and open work permits to allow temporary foreign workers to change employers.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nAs Southern African leaders gather in Harare today to tackle the escalating conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a critical question hangs in the air: is President Emmerson Mnangagwa the right captain to steer the regions response?\n\nMnangagwas leadership is coming under intense scrutiny as his own political party appears to be splitting.\n\nThe fault lines within Mnangagwas party, Zanu-PF, are deepening. Two factions, one staunchly backing him and the other rallying behind Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, are locked in a power struggle, a visible crack in the partys facade.\n\nThis internal strife spilled into the open this week during the burial of a national hero Justin Mupamhanga at the national shrine where factions clashed publicly. Despite Mnangagwas pledge to step down in 2028, his silence on those calling for him to extend his rule has only fueled doubt.\n\nThe DRC conflict itself is a tempest, and Mnangagwa finds himself in the thick of it, his hands seemingly tied by domestic turmoil. Whispers are turning into shouts: some of his own comrades are imploring him to leave office peacefully, failure to which he may go the Robert Mugabe way in November 2017.\n\nThe DRC conflict has already been worsened by public spats between South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Rwandan President Paul Kagame.\n\nRamaphosas accusations of Rwandas support for M23 rebels met with Kagames vehement denial, have created a dangerous rift. South Africas loss of 13 soldiers in DRC has only heightened the tension. Kagame, in a display of fiery defiance, has even threatened to confront South Africa militarily if it chooses confrontation.\n\nRELATED:\n\nObert Masaraure, a human rights defender and president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ), is blunt in his observation.\n\nWhat is happening right now in Zanu PF is a clear testimony of Emmerson Mnangagwas failure to calm storms in his own party. His party is in turmoil as factions are gunning for each others head.\n\nHow then can he manage to lead the regions response to the DRC conflict? He does not have the capacity. Why is he failing to sit down with his comrades whom he went to war with and make peace? queried Masaraure.\n\nMasaraure further painted Mnangagwa as a man who creates problems but cannot solve them.\n\nHe is a man who creates problems but cannot solve the same. He created problems in Mozambique and he has created economic hardships and political conflict in the country. The man has many problems to deal with. The DRC conflict is too much for him. President Ramaphosa is the one who is now acting as if is the SADC chair, he said.\n\nAdvocate Fadzayi Mahere took to X Thursday, demanding that Information Permanent Secretary Nick Mangwana clarify Zimbabwes official stance on the escalating DRC conflict. She pointedly highlighted the divergent positions taken by South Africa, Rwanda, and even Kenya.\n\nWhose side are we on? she questioned, Or are we neutral? Or, worse, are we indifferent?\n\nMangwana did not respond to Mahere.\n\nHowever, Zanu-PF communications director, Farai Marapira, defended Mnangagwa, dismissing his critics as having put wool over their eyes and conveniently forgetting Zimbabwes history of conflict resolution.\n\nThey clearly have chosen to put wool over their eyes because they have conveniently forgotten the role Zimbabwe played in the late 1990s. Under the leadership of President Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe and SADC is more than equal to the task, he said.\n\n",

(@wicknellchivayo)January 25, 2025\n\nMachana and Phiri through their lawyer Method Ndlovu argued that Saturdays polls are null and void as Chivayos vote buying disadvantaged other candidates as delegates knew they stood to benefit if Magwizi won.\n\nPhilemon Machana\n\nTwine Phiri\n\nMagwizi is cited as the first respondent and ZIFA as the second respondent.\n\nA third party, Wicknell Chivayo, who is aprominent businessman in Zimbabwe, issued a statement before the election that he preferred 1st respondent to be electedpresident of 2nd respondent.\n\nThe third party did not stop there. He further stated that he will gift 2nd respondent a sumof USD10 million (ten million United StatesDollars) if 1st respondent was elected itspresident.\n\nThis was a clear influence peddling by a third party, clearly meant to influence the voting delegates to prefer the 1st respondent ahead of each of the claimants.\n\nThis because the third party promised that2nd respondent, i.e. ZIFA will benefit a hugesum of money only if 1st respondent waselected president and that the voting\n\ndelegates stood to personally benefit fromhim as they would be given brand new motor vehicles if they voted 1st respondent as president of ZIFA, read part of the duos appeal to CAS.\n\nAs part of their evidence, the duo further argues that the disqualification of one of the electorates who was caught trying to take a photo of his vote on the ballot paper is enough evidence of how third-party influence played a role in Saturdays polls.\n\nGovernment wields power in a nation when its senior official issues a statement as to who should be voted for and become president of ZIFA; that invariably puts a lot of pressure on the voting delegates.\n\nNo wonder why one voting delegate wascaught taking a photo of his cast ballot while in the voting booth.\n\nThis was meant to show his handlers how he had voted. The probabilities are that he and his fellow voting delegates were underpressure to show third parties how they hadvoted.\n\nThat means they did not exercise their right to vote freely; in other words, they did not vote according to their conscience.\n\nThe election for president of ZIFA was not free and fair, further read their appeal.\n\nSaturdays election saw Magwizi recording the highest victory in a ZIFA presidential election.\n\nNone of the other contesting presidential candidates managed a double figure in their defeat, Phelimon Machana managed six votes while Twine Phiri had four.\n\nMarshall Gore another losing candidate managed only one vote while former football player Makwinji Soma-Phiri had zero.\n\nCommenting on Machana and Phiris appeal to CAS, a renowned football analyst said the applicants do not have solid evidence of how the third party influenced the election.\n\nIt seems to me that the applicants are challenging the integrity of the election, which is very difficult to prove.\n\nThe integrity impact approach entails that the petitioners must prove that irregularities occurred, and they substantially undermined the integrity of the election process, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the new ZIFA executive is set to go through the handover process with the outgoing FIFA-imposed Normalization Committee on Friday in the capital.\n\n",

Manjengwa, who was employed as a nurse by Nottinghamshire Healthcare Foundation Trust (NHFT), was banned from the profession following a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing on Tuesday, January 27.\n\nNottinghamshire Police first investigated Manjengwa in December 2020 over an allegation of rape and sexual assault but decided to take no further action on that occasion. A second allegation of rape, this time in relation to a junior colleague, was made in September 2021 and Manjengwa wascharged with the offence the following March.\n\nAs a result the first allegation was reinvestigated and he was convicted of two counts of rape and sexual assault, as well as trying to pervert the course of justice, at Nottingham Crown Court on September 14, 2023.\n\nThe following month he was sentenced to 16 years in prison and placed on the sex offenders register for life. The NMC hearing was told Manjengwa raped a woman at her home in July 2020, before raping and sexually assaulting a colleague at her home less than two months later. He then got a colleague to provide him a false alibi.\n\nNHFT said he was suspended immediately after the first allegations were made, and was dismissed four months after being charged. Presenting the case, Grace Khaile saidManjengwa had shown a lack of remorse for his actions. You were someone who they trusted as an NHS professional, she said.\n\nYour lack of insight and remorse, and the profound unacceptability of your behaviour, are indicative of deep-seated attitudinal problems.The hearing was told Manjengwa, who is being held at HMP Whatton, disagreed with the conviction and was in the process of trying to lodge an appeal.\n\nFinding in favour of a striking off order, the hearing panel said: Your behaviour has breached fundamental tenets of the nursing profession and therefore brought its reputation into disrepute.\n\n[We] considered that this order was necessary to mark the importance of maintaining public confidence in the profession, and to send to the public and the profession a clear message about the standard of behaviour required of a registered nurse.\n\nDiane Hull, executive director of nursing at NHFT, said: We take any allegations against staff very seriously. As soon as we were made aware of the allegations against this individual, we immediately suspended them pending investigation, informed the police and referred them to the NMC.\n\nWhen we were made aware of a further allegation, we again notified the NMC. I can confirm that we dismissed this person from employment in July 2022.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nHARARE Mayor Jacob Mafume is embroiled in nepotism and authoritarian rule at Town House, a top council official has told the Harare Commission of Inquiry.\n\nThe Commission is probing the operationsof Harare City Council from 2017 till date.\n\nExecutive Assistant Town Clerk, Mathew Marara, told the Commission how rife nepotism is at the City Council, implicating several top officials.\n\nMafume was accused by Marara of appointing Lovemore Chinoputsa to the position of Research and Protocol Officer without adhering to recruitment processes.\n\nMarara described a chaotic and lawless environment at Town House, with Mafume at the centre of the recruitment of council workers without adhering to proper procedures.\n\nSpecifically for the Mayor, when the Mayor occupied his office there was a Mayors driver, who had been there for years but the Mayor was not happy. I do not know the reason with that driver and he brought in a certain youngster to be his driver.\n\nWe were pushed to second him to the Mayors office when the incumbent was still in office. Interestingly the one who came in did not even have the competence to drive a manual vehicle. He was competent in automatic vehicles, said Marara.\n\nRELATED:\n\nMafume is accused of improperly suspending a council official, Samson Madzokere, who despite being absent from the City Council continues to receive a salary.\n\nNo one at the council knows the preference of the Mayor with regards to the ERP that he wants he has called us to many meetings forcing us to take that particular company to do ERP and there are minutes and that is why Samson Madzokere is at home because of ERP not because he answered to a newspaper article, he said.\n\nLast year, Mafume suspended Town Clerk Hosiah Chisango with the lattergetting wind of this through social media and even rocked up at Town House reporting for duty.\n\nMarara said there is bad blood between Chisango and Mafume which has led to numerous problems at the HCC.\n\nThere is a direct interface between the Town Clerk and the Mayor. I talked to both of them, Chisango and the Mayor. I said they needed to sit down because of the disharmony that is between them because there was friction and the disharmony was affecting the Council as a whole.\n\nThe problem is unlike the other Mayors like Mayor Masunda who could come to work once a week, the current one 0800 hours is in office and at the leaves end of the day but he is getting an allowance from government of US$95 as a Mayor. It tells you a big story, said Marara.\n\nWhen he recently made his first appearance before the Commission, Mafume denied interfering in the work of the executive at the Town House.\n\nI meet a lot of people. I meet individual Councillors and committees. Even in the Act, if a Committee is in session and I the Mayor feel that I need to come into that Committee, I am allowed to go into that Committee, said Mafume.\n\n",

A corporate rescue shields the company from liquidation and safeguards stakeholders interests.\n\nIn 2022, Fossil Mine acquired a 76,45% stake in the then Lafarge Cement Zimbabwe Limited from Associated International Cement Limited, a member of the Holcim Group before rebranding the Lafarge Cement Zimbabwe Limited to Khayah.\n\nRELATED:Legal Discussions with Vengai Madzima: Corporate Rescue in Zimbabwe\n\nThe United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) swiftly moved in and designated Fossil Agro, Fossil Contracting and Obey Chimuka and crippled the new shareholders plans, forcing Khaya to re-strategise.\n\nThis week, the corporate rescue practitioner, Bulisa Mbano of Grant Thornton, said during the corporate rescue proceedings no legal proceeding, including enforcement action, against the Company, or in relation to any property belonging to the Company, or lawfully in its possession, may commence or proceeded in any form without the authority of the Corporate Rescue Practitioner.\n\nHe invited all creditors to attend a meeting scheduled to take place later next month and participate in mapping the way forward.\n\nFollowing the Master of High Courts approval to extend the notice period for notifying affected persons to 31stof January 2025, the first meeting of creditors and members of the company will now be held on the 19th of February 2025 at 0900hrs at Chapman Golf Club, 6 Smit Cresent, Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nThis meeting is for proof of claims, an overview of corporate rescue proceedings, a statement by the Master of the High Court about reasonable prospects of rescuing the company, and appointment of a committee of creditors, he said.\n\nThose owed money by the company were required to complete an affidavit for Proof of Claim Form and complete these forms in duplicate, attach all supporting documents, and lodge them with the Master of the High Court, at the Masters office.\n\n",
