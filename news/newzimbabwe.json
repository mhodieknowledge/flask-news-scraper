            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nFormer Zimbabwe Under-18 rugby player Campbell Nyakudya has been dragged to court amid allegations that he drugged, raped and robbed a 25-year-old woman after a night out in Harare.\n\nNyakudya, once celebrated for his explosive pace on the rugby field, appeared before Harare magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa, facing rape and theft charges. He was not asked to plead and was released on US$200 bail pending trial.\n\nAccording to the State, the incident occurred on October 25 when the complainant, a socialite, was having drinks with friends at La Parada Restaurant before they later moved to Karma Night Club in the capital.\n\nProsecutors said while at the club, the complainant went to the bathroom and, on her return, found her friends had left. Nyakudya was reportedly standing at the table with another woman.\n\nShe then picked up her glass and continued drinking while looking for her friends, the State outline reads. From that moment, the complainant could not remember what happened next and only woke up at Chisipite shops covered with a cloth.\n\nAccording to the court papers, bystanders at Chisipite told her she had been dumped by a moving vehicle, but they were unable to capture the cars registration number as it sped away.\n\nShe later realised that her handbag, an iPhone 14 Pro Max, US$1,200 cash, and wig were missing. She filed a police report at ZRP Highlands, leading investigators back to La Parada where they reviewed the clubs CCTV footage.\n\nThe footage showed the accused person adding an unknown substance into the complainants drink, the State said. It also captured him and an unidentified woman escorting the complainant to his vehicle before driving off.\n\nThe prosecution further alleged that Nyakudya later dumped the unconscious complainant at a parking area near Chisipite Shopping Centre.\n\nWhen workers from Karma Night Club took her home, she started to feel some pain in her private parts, prosecutors said.\n\nNyakudya was arrested on October 28, and according to the case outline, he admitted to having sexual intercourse with the complainant once without her consent.\n\nThe State insists the accused acted unlawfully.\n\nThe matter was remanded to a later date pending trial.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nNATIONAL Tyre Services (NTS) has tabled plans to delist from the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) due to insignificant returns prompted by a tough economic environment and the influx of cheaper imports.\n\nIn a Circular to shareholders published this week, NTS said after a comprehensive review of the companys listing requirements, it was agreed that the benefits of maintaining the listing status no longer pay off as was the case in the previous years.\n\nThe company, which has been on the ZSE listing since 1969, is now seeking shareholder approval to green-light the move.\n\nThe operating environment has, however, been characterised by persistent macroeconomic instability over the past decades. The business has been adversely affected by severe exchange rate volatility, liquidity constraints and shortages of foreign currency, all of which have materially hindered the importation of tyres and raw materials, the company said.\n\nThe Zimbabwean tyre industry has, in recent years, experienced heightened competition due to low entry barriers and the influx of imported brands, resulting in a loss of market share for the company said limited access to long-term and affordable capital has also constrained the companys ability to execute its expansion strategy and maintain adequate working capital levels.\n\nDespite numerous efforts to secure funding through the local banking system, borrowing has remained prohibitively expensive. Operationally, NTS continues to face significant challenges, such as power supply deficits have disrupted production at the retreading factory, where capacity utilisation has averaged approximately 30%.\n\nIn conjunction with the proposed delisting, major shareholder Radun Investments (Private) Limited is extending a mandatory offer to acquire all shares held by minority shareholders. The offer is for a cash consideration of US$0.0248 per share. This provides a clear and structured opportunity for minority shareholders to exit their investment at a price deemed fair and reasonable by Independent Financial Advisors, said NTS.\n\nThe total indicative share trading liquidity for National Tyre Services Limited (NTS.zw) in the past 12 months, as of 1st October 2025, is US$1.06million (ZWG28.41million). An average of US$88,170 (ZWG2.37 million) per month.\n\n",

He had travelled to meet with civil society organisations (CSOs) to discuss rights violations and to offer solidarity.\n\nCiZC described Vavas deportation as a barbaric act of repression.\n\nIn a statement, CiZC condemned the treatment of its director, describing it as an attack to human rights.\n\nWe are disturbed by the continued harassment and deportations of human rights defenders and election observers whose work is not criminal but aimed at promoting human rights, good governance and democracy, the statement read.\n\nCiZC criticised President Samia Suluhu Hassan and her regime for trampling on the values of ubuntu and pan-Africanism that the countrys founding president, Julius Nyerere, stood for.\n\nVava reportedly arrived at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam on 28 October as part of a regional solidarity mission to engage with CSOs and social movements. The mission aimed to discuss concerns over the escalating crackdown on dissent under what the coalition called the increasingly authoritarian regime which has also shut down the internet.\n\nUpon arrival, Vavas passport was reportedly confiscated by immigration officials, who subjected him to hours of interrogation and profiling in restricted airport rooms. He was later informed that he was not welcome in Tanzania and labelled a security risk-without any formal explanation.\n\nThe coalition said Vava spent the night detained in a holding cell at the airport without blankets before being deported on 29 October.\n\nTanzanian officials have remained mum on the incident.\n\n",
