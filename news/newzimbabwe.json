A clear message must be sent that crime does not pay, said Rwodzi.\n\nThe accused was handed 15 years for the first two counts and another 15 years for the other two, resulting in an effective 30-year imprisonment.\n\nProsecutor Loveit Muringwa, proved that in April last year, the father returned home at Rainham Farm, Nyabira, Mashonaland West province and found his daughter seated on the floor.\n\nHe accused her of having an affair with her aunts husband while she stayed with them in Masvingo from Grade One to Seven.\n\nAfter shouting at her, he lifted her onto a bed and raped her.\n\nThe court heard that in May, he raped her again, gave her pills, and warned her against speaking out. He repeated the assault in November, again providing morning-after pills to prevent pregnancy.\n\nThe victim confided in her mother the following day, but the mother initially dismissed the claims.\n\nOn March 16, 2025, the girl was raped once more at their home. She later followed her mother to an onion field, where she tearfully recounted the ordeal.\n\nIn a court affidavit, the mother admitted she had not reported the earlier incidents due to her husbands threats.\n\nI was afraid of the threats, so I took no action. But on 16 March, around 4pm my daughter came to me crying that her father had raped her again. Disturbed, I called neighbours, who helped apprehend him.\n\nThe matter was then reported to the police, leading to the fathers arrest and subsequent conviction.\n\n",

The government had revoked its claims, which were previously held by De Beers.\n\nIn 2010, during a legal battle over the rights, Vast had to surrender a large parcel of rough diamonds to RBZ.\n\nFor years, the diamonds sat in RBZs vaults as lawyers fought the case. A breakthrough came in 2023 when the High Court ordered the release of the diamonds. In 2024, the government approved a final settlement, allowing the parcel to be handed back to Vast.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Vast said it has finally received the diamonds. The company says the diamond parcels have not been touched for over 15 years.\n\nThis release of the historical diamond parcel not only represents a landmark success for the company, but underlines that Zimbabwe is truly open for business for companies that wish to comply with due process, Vast says.\n\nAlthough the exact value is not known yet, the company says early inspections have exceeded managements expectations. Once cleaned, the diamonds will be revalued and prepared for sale.\n\nAfter the sale, about 20% of the total value will go towards feessuch as royalties, legal costs, marketing, and payments to the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe.\n\nVast previously owned the Pickstone and Eureka gold mines through Dallaglio, which it sold to Padenga Holdings in 2019 to focus on diamonds. In 2018, it partnered with Red Mercury, a local community trust in Marange-Zimunya, to explore new diamond areas, but legal issues stalled the project and Vast turned its focus elsewhere.\n\nNow, with the dispute behind it, has Vast is looking to re-enter Zimbabwean mining.\n\nCEO Andrew Prelea says: Now that this chapter has closed, the company is reengaging our future investment strategy in Zimbabwe and has commenced discussions for further mining concessions in-country.\n\nVast also has mining interests in Romania and Tajikistan.\n\n",

            "content": "In Zimbabwe, where the local currency often feels like a game of chance itself (due to crazy high inflation), young people turn to a different kind of gamble  one that involves football, phones, and digital coins. Online sports betting, especially on crypto-friendly platforms, is more than just a quick entertainment. For many young Zimbabweans, its a way to stay connected to global sports and experiment with crypto.\n\nOnline betting in Zimbabwe isnt happening behind desktops  its all happening on phones. With more young people owning smartphones and mobile data becoming more accessible, placing a bet is often just a few taps away. In fact, mobile betting made up over70% of all sports wagersin Zimbabwe by 2025.\n\nApps like Betway Zimbabwe and Premier Bet Zimbabwe offer the best mobile experience  users can bet live, cash out early, and follow games right from their screens. That convenience has drawn in the 18 to 35yearold crowd, especially in cities, although rural users are catching up quickly.\n\nZimbabweans dont exactly have the most stable banking system to rely on. So its no surprise that crypto has caught on, especially in places where bank transfers are slow, expensive, or just not happening. Many Zimbabweans started buying cryptocurrencies when their economy struggled, and several waves ofhyperinflation(up to 785%) made the local currency essentially worthless. The economy improved, but the habit of crypto trading remained.\n\nSo, manyonline betting platformsnow accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies, making it easier to deposit and withdraw without a middleman slowing things down.\n\nFor some young people, on the contrary, betting is actually their first experience using crypto. From there, some start using digital money to save, trade, or even shop online. Its not just bettingits an introduction to a different way of handling money.\n\nMoreover, crypto allows Zimbabweans to bet globally on major sports events, such as the FIFA World Cup and the NBA, among others. In fact, the betting industry in Zimbabwe has grown by 8.5% between 2023 and 2024 and continues to rise. Even though theres love for local football, its the big leagues that attract most attention. The English Premier League (EPL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) are among the most popular choices. Its not just about placing betsits about following teams, staying up late for games, and knowing the stats better than the commentators on TV.\n\nBetting adds more excitement, and it also connects Zimbabweans to global sports in real time. WhatsApp groups buzz with predictions, TikTok videos break down weekend fixtures, and when someone wins big, youll hear about it.\n\nAt the end of the day, online betting in Zimbabwe is about more than winning money. Its how young people connect with global culture and experiment with digital tools. Its not a perfect systemthere are risks, and the crypto side of it can be murky. But for a generation raised on mobile tech and global sports, its one of the few spaces where finance, fun, and fandom all come together.\n\n",
