            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said it would like to see the ZiG fully becoming a national currency, as it weighs whether to place Zimbabwe on a staff-monitored program.\n\nThe ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, succeeded the Zimbabwean dollar in April 2024 after multiple crashes. Its the countrys sixth attempt since 2009 to replace the dollar as the southern African nations main transacting currency, but is yet to succeed.\n\nSeveral measures will need to be adopted to boost ZiG usage, including deepening the foreign-exchange market to ensure full price discovery, said Wojciech Maliszewski, the Washington-based lenders mission chief, who is in Zimbabwe to review its request for a new SMP. The nations last program ended abruptly in 2019 after the central bank printed money that fueled the collapse of the local currency.\n\nRight now we see good stability in the official market and we also see a convergence between the parallel and official rate, he told reporters Monday after meeting Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in the capital, Harare. Ideally, we would like to see an elimination of this gap, we would like to see one exchange rate.\n\nStill, the ZiGs 43% devaluation in September to narrow the gap between the official and unofficial rate and its inconvertibility has led citizens to favor dollars.\n\nThe ZiG traded little changed on Tuesday at 26.96 against the dollar and exchanged hands at 32 to 35 on the parallel market.\n\nThe Washington-based lender said it isnt pushing for more exchange rate depreciation but for the two rates to converge supported by government fiscal discipline.\n\nThere is a good chance that these rates will converge, Maliszewski said.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube last month at the annual meetings of the African Development Bank said he expected the SMP to be finalized by the end of June. The program would bring Zimbabwe closer toward revamping its $21 billion debt pile with creditors that want assurances that its authorities are pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nTHE University of Zimbabwe (UZ) has withheld the salaries of striking lecturers as turmoil continues at the institution.\n\nThe lecturers have now reached 58 days of industrial action, demanding a salary increase that aligns with Zimbabwes soaring cost of living.\n\nWhile UZ has remained silent on the strike, it has retaliated by withholding salaries from the defiant lecturers, who are steadfast in their demand for a return to pre-2018 wages of US$2,250 per month for junior staff  up from the current US$230.\n\nObvious Vengeyi, spokesperson for the Association of University Teachers (AUT), condemned the salary deductions as an attempt to force an end to the strike.\n\nOf course, it is an act of trying to force our members to return to work for the US$230 they initially rejected. Its a way of arm-twisting certain members of our community to resume teaching.\n\nMany here who have not been paid have resolved that, whether they receive the US$230 or not, they will not return. The majority of us have not been paid  yes. But we remain committed. Until junior lecturers get US$2,250, we will not go back to class, said Vengeyi.\n\nThe universitys latest move follows its hiring of adjunct lecturers last month to fill gaps left by the striking staff.\n\nHowever, the AUT has dismissed this as futile, claiming most replacements lack the qualifications to teach at a university level.\n\nThere is no teaching happening at the university. No supervision is taking place. A few scabs have been hired to replace sort of  the lecturers on strike, said Vengeyi further.\n\nThe prolonged strike has disrupted examinations, with planned sittings facing further delays, potentially derailing the academic year.\n\nLast month, six students were arrested after staging flash protests demanding the lecturers return, signalling the growing unrest on campus.\n\n",

Never let them lie to you. Its leader McKenzie is now a minister. He has never proposed legislation on the subject, not even a private members bill as an MP. He is just enjoying blue lights.\n\nMcKenzie swiftly responded to Lonzis accusations, asking, Uthini wena Temu Ndlozi? (What are you saying Ndlozi from Temu?). Start by telling us, do you even care?\n\nLonzi, however, was unfazed and accused McKenzie of avoiding parliamentary committee meetings. You must stop running away from parliament committee meetings. I will take you to the cleaners.\n\nThe debate stems from social media users concerns about McKenzies perceived change of attitude towards illegal foreigners.\n\nHowever, McKenzie has always reaffirmed his stance against illegal immigration, saying his partys mission remains unchanged.\n\nI speak up forAbahambe[they must leave] in closed government meetings and PA rallies. I have and will never change my stance regarding the mass deportation of all illegal foreigners but to expect me to only speak about immigration when there is a home affairs minister is wrong.Abahambeis our mission as the PA.
