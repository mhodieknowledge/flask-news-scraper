            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, there was a recent landmark judgment in the Zimbabwe Courts on land acquisition and compensation by the government which may affect some acquired land, what was the case about?\n\nVM: Yes, there was indeed a landmark constitutional judgment delivered on 29thJuly, 2025 in Alistair Michael Fletcher v Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development and others.\n\nWell, I will attempt to summarise the facts. The land in question is in Umguza on the peripheries of Bulawayo City. It was incorporated into the City of Bulawayo through a statutory instrument issued by the President in 1999. Sometime in 2000, the land was subsequently gazetted for acquisition by the State under the land reform program and caveats were placed on the title deeds to perfect the acquisition.\n\nThe main issue for contention was whether or not the land was capable of acquisition under the land reform program which targeted agricultural land, as the land had become urban land by means of the statutory instrument of 1999, I referred to and various correspondence from the Bulawayo City Council which referred to it and adjacent lands as urban territory.\n\nReporter: At face value, it appears simple enough, what where the main areas of contention?\n\nVM: It may appear so, however, there was a conflict in the understanding and application of various constitutional provisions. Main being the interpretation of S16B (2) of the old constitution which limited the rights of individual to challenge the acquisition of land for agricultural purposes after it has been gazetted and conversely, the rights of the courts to adjudicate on such cases where land was acquired under the land reform process. S16B (3) of the same constitution reserved judicial review powers with the courts where expropriation was not in terms of section 16 B(2) as was eventually decided in this case. The other constitutional questions which had to be decided included the right to hold, use and not be deprived of property and the right to equal protection and benefit of the law in situations where the application of s16B(2)a was challenged, which section is now s72 of the new constitution.,\n\nReporter: What was the decision of the court and its reasoning?\n\nVM: The Constitutional Court agreed with the decision of the High Court that the land in question was urban land by virtue of it being classified as such by law and the City of Bulawayo, that being so, the State cannot compulsorily acquire urban land without compensation by using the constitutional provisions reserved for land reform acquisitions.\n\nCompensation in land reform acquisitions is limited to improvements made on land.\n\nIn reaching its decision, the court considered the meaning of agricultural land in terms of the constitution and whether Mr. Fletchers land can be classified as agricultural land. It also considered its own jurisdiction to hear the matter on the basis of whether the land in question was agricultural or urban land.\n\nReporter: What are the key takeaways from this judgment?\n\nVM: Key takeaways are that the land reform constitutional provisions ousting the authority of the courts to hear and determine acquired land refer only to agricultural land.\n\nThe courts still retain the right to hear cases to confirm whether such acquisition was done in terms of the constitutional provisions and for cases referring to compensation of improvements.\n\nThe courts also upheld the constitutional provisions relating to right to property and equal access to the courts for all urban land.\n\nThe other takeaway is not mentioned in the judgment but is necessary as it reasserts the position that our court system still functions; this is a clear case separating the government and judiciary in their interpretation of the law.\n\nReporter: How will this judgment affect owners of tracts of land in periurban areas?\n\nVM: In my view, it brings certainty that once land is classified as urban land, it is not capable of compulsory acquisition under the land reform program or acquisition without compensation. It will assist developers and investors in their planning, knowing there is precedent from the highest court securing property rights\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have to end here because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dr Richard Dune\n\nAs the UK deploys AI to detect healthcare risks in real time, what lessons can be drawn for regulatory compliance and governance worldwide?\n\nOn 30 June 2025, the UK government announced the launch of a world-first AI early warning system for the National Health Service (NHS). The initiative, part of its 10-Year Health Plan, aims to transform patient safety and regulatory inspections by using real-time data to detect early signs of harm, before tragedy occurs.\n\nThis system will empower the Care Quality Commission (CQC), Englands independent health and social care regulator, to carry out rapid response inspections whenever AI algorithms detect anomalies in care, such as a spike in stillbirths, preventable deaths, or critical incidents.\n\nIn the context of mounting regulatory failures in recent years, particularly within NHS maternity and mental health services, this bold shift towards predictive oversight and digital compliance could not be more timely.\n\nBut will it work? And what can healthcare systems in Zimbabwe, across Africa, and in the diaspora learn from this transformative approach?\n\nFrom Mid Staffordshire, where up to 1,200 patients died due to neglect, to the Lucy Letby case, in which a neonatal nurse was convicted of murdering seven babies, failures in the NHS have highlighted one painful truth: the system doesnt catch harm soon enough.\n\nIn 2023, multiple NHS maternity units were under investigation, with affected families saying they were ignored or gaslit when they raised concerns.\n\nThe Dash Review (2024) revealed the scale of the problem: the average wait time for a reinspection of Inadequate providers had increased from 87 to 136 days, while some with Requires Improvement ratings waited up to a year. Hundreds of inspection reports were lost due to IT failures, leaving vulnerable patients at risk.\n\nThe NHS, with its 1.3 million employees, thousands of hospitals and clinics, and a massive volume of patient interactions, still largely relies on:\n\nThis approach is reactive, not preventive, and ill-equipped to keep pace with modern healthcare risks.\n\nRapid Response Inspections, introduced in recent years, are an improvement, but still depend on someone raising the alarm. What if the system could detect risk from within  automatically and in real-time?\n\nThis is the very problem that digital compliance systems, supervision Learning Management Systems (LMS), and Training Management Systems (TMS) are built to solve.\n\nThe new AI system, developed under the Plan for Change, will:\n\nThe first rollout, the Maternity Outcomes Signal System, will go live in November 2025. It will monitor indicators such as neonatal deaths, neurological injuries, and emergency escalations across NHS trusts.\n\nIf successful, the model will expand to cover wider incidents, making England the first country in the world to integrate AI directly into regulatory inspections.\n\nThe table below outlines how the CQC will now operate under a two-track model.\n\nIn support of this, the CQC will also:\n\nThis is no longer just about inspections. Its about embedding digital surveillance into governance frameworks, a move that will resonate with policymakers worldwide grappling with similar healthcare risks.\n\nThis new AI capability is built on the NHS Federated Data Platform (FDP), which brings together:\n\nThis 360 view of compliance risk means that NHS providers, and their leaders, must now be audit-ready every day, not just every few years.\n\nFor health and social care leaders in Zimbabwe and across Africa, the message is clear:\n\nThese are no longer nice-to-haves. They are essential components of a resilient and transparent compliance ecosystem.\n\nThe NHS has long been accused of failing to act on known risks, a problem dubbed the implementation gap.\n\nFor this new AI system to succeed, it must be backed by:\n\nAs Sir Julian Hartley, CEO of the CQC, stated, this approach requires aclearer, simpler assessment framework, but it also demands systems that help providers improve, not just fear failure.\n\nThe UKs plan also pledges to strengthen Freedom to Speak Up protocols, with CQC checking whether Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) and providers support whistleblowers.\n\nIn a world of machine-learning models and automated alerts, the human voice, especially that of frontline workers and their families, must not be drowned out.\n\nAI should amplify, not replace, human insight.\n\nAt The Mandatory Training Group, we believe in embedding compassionate governance into all digital systems, whether thats through supervision pathways, LMS/TMS compliance dashboards, or workforce wellbeing initiatives.\n\nInnovation is exciting, but innovation without people is meaningless.\n\nAs Professor Nicola Ranger, General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, warned:\n\nTechnology has a role, but in todays NHS, one nurse can be caring for 15 patients. Thats drastically unsafe.\n\nDaniel Elkeles, CEO of NHS Providers, echoed this:\n\nTrusts need time and support to improve. Regulation must be collaborative, not combative.\n\nDigital compliance must empower frontline teams, not overwhelm them with automated penalties.\n\nThe NHS AI early warning system presents a template not just for the UK, but for any country looking to modernise healthcare governance.\n\nFor Zimbabwean policymakers and healthcare entrepreneurs, this offers key insights:\n\nWhether youre running a clinic in Bulawayo, managing training systems for diaspora health workers, or building a compliance framework for a public hospital, this model is worth watching.\n\nBehind every scandal is a silent alarm that was missed.\n\nThis AI system promises to change the timeline of regulation, from reactive punishment to proactive prevention. But success depends on more than algorithms.\n\nIt requires:\n\nTo help health and social care providers adapt, Ive led the development ofComplyPlus, an all-in-one regulatory compliance management platform.\n\nDesigned for both UK and international health and social care providers, ComplyPlus supports:\n\nExplore the ComplyPlus suite:\n\nWith AI reshaping regulation, your systems must evolve too.\n\nRELATED:\n\nFor more insights on regulatory reform, AI in healthcare, training systems, and governance tools, follow my weekly columns onNewZimbabwe.comand connect with me on LinkedIn.\n\nDr Richard Dune is the CEO of LearnPac Systems, a leading UK provider of edtech and compliance software solutions for regulated sectors.

Statistics show that the turnout was 33 percent of registered voters.\n\nZimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) presiding officer, Taona Pfunye confirmed the results as posted at the polling station.\n\nBouyed by support from Zanu PF bigwigs, including President Emmerson Mnangagwas advisor, Paul Tungwarara ahead of polls, Biswork promised to champion infrastructural development, including six boreholes to ease water supply crisis in the mining settlement, fixing roads and initiating community business start-ups.\n\nOn the other hand, Zimbiri pursued a quiet election campaign if any, never convened a single rally and was literally off the medias radar.\n\nThe Chinhoyi Ward 14 post became vacant following the jailing of then-councillor and deputy mayor Chipo Mlotshwa of CCC on fraud charges involving double-dipping in the allocation of land. Her sentence was however commuted to community service.\n\nMeanwhile, in Harares Epworth Ward 6, Zanu PF candidate Civilised Bushe won by a huge margin, amassing 3,022 votes trailed by MDC-Ts Alice Nyahunzvi, who managed 120 votes, while independent candidate Peter Nyapetwa got a measly 23 votes.\n\nZEC presiding officer, Chenjerai Chirere confirmed the results.\n\n",
