            "content": "NewZimbabwe.comhas invited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal)to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, we want to continue with our discussion from last week on Immigration Law, our readers were asking for further understanding on foreign Visa applications specifically as they relate to reasons for denials and the appeal processes in various countries\n\nLet me start by asking what are the common reasons for visa being denied?\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nWe touched on the issue briefly in my last interview with you.\n\nEach country has its own benchmark that has to be satisfied with visa applications. Further to the general benchmark set by the country of interest, each visa type, for example, visitors, working or asylum visa, has specific conditions that have to be met and the requirements are likely to be different from other visa types within the same country. It is essential that the applicant is able to discern the must-haves in the application and ensures that all the requirements of the must haves are included with supporting evidence or thoroughly explained.\n\nIn general terms, visa applications are denied because applicants have failed to satisfy the immigration officer reviewing the application that they qualify for the visa under the application. This could be as a result of failing to supply sufficient supporting information for the type of visa or where the country receiving the application utilizes a score point approach, a failure to score enough points for the visa. Incorrect or false information may also disqualify a person from securing a visa.\n\nPast activities like a criminal record or history of overstaying in the host country may hinder or reduce the chances of securing a visa as this portrays an applicant as an undesirable person.\n\nRELATED:Legal Discussions With Vengai Madzima: Foreign Visa Applications\n\nReporter: Can a person be denied a visa or entry into a country because of HIV status?\n\nVM: Each country will have its own requirements on the different visa categories on who can enter the country and can list the reasons and requirements for qualification.\n\nGenerally, international human rights laws discourage discrimination on the basis of HIV status. Countries that are signatories of human rights protocols are under obligation to treat all applicants equally and without discrimination. Should an applicant feel aggrieved by a decision based on their status, subject to the laws that land, I would encourage them to seek a review of that decision.\n\nReporter:In what circumstances should a person consider reapplying for a visa instead of appealing?\n\nVM: After having read and understood the reason for the visa denial and seeing that it will be impossible to gather sufficient information to satisfy the immigration officer in the period afforded to submit an appeal by the particular country, the applicant can opt to reapply as it affords them sufficient time to gather evidence and deal with the areas where the previous application fell short.\n\nThis also applies in situations where the initial application had insufficient supporting evidence. A reapplication affords the applicant the opportunity to submit an improved application with better chances of success. Reapplication however does not necessarily guarantee success, it improves the chances. Most countries have sections within their application forms which allow you to explain why the previous visa was declined.\n\nIn circumstances where a person was banned from reapplication, an appeal process may be the only option available where the country offers appeals against bans.\n\nReporter: In what circumstances will an appeal be the best option to take?\n\nVM: In cases where the applicant has been banned and the country offers an option to appeal the decision. In such a case, the appeal process will be the best option to address the banning where the applicant considers the decision to be unjustified.\n\nFurther, where the Applicant understands or fully comprehends the reasons the visa application was declined and is capable of getting the supporting information within the period afforded to submit an appeal, then an appeal may be the best route. It is important that the Applicant avoids mistakes in the appeal process and addresses all areas of concern,\n\nReporter: Can I appeal again if my visa application was refused on appeal?\n\nVM: Generally, most countries allow for one appeal. However, rules differ per country under application. Unless the visa denial also bans reapplication, the applicant has the option of reapplying and addressing in the fresh application all issues they neglected to address in the initial application and the appeal\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima atvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTRADE promotion agency, ZimTrade has implored local honey farmers to work towards meeting export market standards which has a huge demand for organic products.\n\nThe agency revealed that honey production is increasingly becoming a profitable venture for producers worldwide, driven by rising demand for natural and organic products.\n\nFor Zimbabwean producers, ZimTrade said the honey export market presents an exciting opportunity to tap into global demand with some of the key importers including the United States, Germany, and Japan, where demand for high-quality honey is robust.\n\nFor Zimbabwean producers, this offers a unique opportunity to diversify agricultural exports and leverage the countrys rich biodiversity to produce distinctive honey varieties. To succeed in the international honey market, producers must meet several critical requirements like quality standards such as those set by the Codex Alimentarius.\n\nEnsuring low moisture content, appropriate sucrose levels, and the absence of contaminants is essential for market acceptance, the agency said.\n\nZimTrade also called for securing organic certification can significantly enhance the marketability of Zimbabwean honey, particularly in the European Union and the United States with Fair Trade and other ethical certifications can further add value.\n\nZimTrade said honey intended for export must be packaged in a way that preserves its quality during transit as labels should comply with the regulations of the destination market, including details on nutritional content, country of origin, and certifications.\n\nCompliance with the phytosanitary standards of importing countries is crucial. Zimbabwean producers need to adhere to these regulations to avoid barriers to market entry, the agency said.\n\nHoney production in Zimbabwe is steadily growing, with the country boasting a vibrant beekeeping industry, producingan average of 400,000 kilograms of honey annually, primarily concentrated in the Manicaland province, particularly the Chimanimani, Nyanga, and Chipinge districts.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nOPERATIONS by Chinese miner Chengxi Pvt Ltd, which is in partnership with President Emmerson Mnangagwas son Collins, have left hundreds of houses in Shurugwi Town with cracks with residents living in fear that their homes may collapse, an investigation by NewZimbabwe.com has established.\n\nThe investigation, in partnership with Information for Development Trust (IDT) also established that Chengxis operations have disrupted livelihoods and caused air and water pollution, besides the well-documented environmental damage on the iconic Wolfshall Pass, also known as Boterekwa escarpment.\n\nThe environmental damage has extended to the picturesque Dunraven Falls, which is a tourist attraction, and a place where villagers used to conduct rituals.\n\nChengxi also cut off villagers from their fields, pastures and areas they used to pick mushrooms and wild fruits, by deploying armed guards to protect its claims.\n\nThe investigation established that a villager, Emmanuel Geje (20), was shot and injured by a Chengxi Chinese employee on 4 September 2024. Villagers also say company employees and guards have occasionally set dogs on them for straying onto their claims.\n\nMany villagers say they have silently endured abuse by the company because of its association with the presidents son and senior Zanu PF officials.\n\nLast year, Chengxi constructed the Zanu PF District Party offices in Shurugwi.\n\nMidlandss Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Owen Ncube, who is Mnangagwas close ally, officiated at the commissioning.\n\nChengxi has been carrying out open-cast gold mining in Shurugwi since 2021.\n\nThe entity is a privately owned mining company with a notable presence in Southeast Asia, East Africa, and Central America.\n\nLocally, its ownership details remain somewhat obscure, although it is known that Collins Mnangagwa, serves as the chairman and senior partner of the gold mining company.\n\nSpeaking at the handover ceremony of Zanu PF offices, Chengxi general manager Simon Karimanzira named Collins Mnangagwawho was also presenta senior partner.\n\nThe company is operating heavy machinery including excavators, rigs and dump trucks. It is conducting massive open pit mining which threatens to deplete the area of its natural resources and grazing lands, jeopardising the livelihoods of future generations.\n\nOur investigations have established that heavy machinery and dump trucks disrupt the communitys longtime peace, operating relentlessly from dawn until dusk.\n\nThese heavy-duty trucks have also become common, even in the town centre.\n\nDump trucks and other machinery seen on site at Chengxi mine along Boterekwa pass\n\nBlasting and the fear of houses collapsing\n\nThe investigation established that Chengxi is using high-capacity explosives, whose impact is felt in Shurungwi residents homes. In some cases, ceilings have fallen while windows have broken during blasting.\n\nResidents say the blasting has weakened their houses and other infrastructure, leaving them worried that their homes may collapse. The situation is aggravated by the fact that most houses were built on top of underground mining tunnels.\n\nWindows have broken during blasting.\n\nChengxi is the main culprit because of the magnitude of their operations.\n\nThe impact of their blasting is felt far away from the mine but there are other Chinese and black-owned companies who are also contributing to the damage.\n\nNot houses only are affected. There are water reservoirs at MacKinnon Kopje where mining is taking place. There are also network boosters on this mountain as such they are all under threat, said Pardon Machocho the chairperson of Shurugwi Residents Trust.\n\nWe get complaints of houses cracking and in some cases, windows break and this happens frequently.\n\nHundreds of houses have been affected in Shurugwi urban our pleas have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nMachocho said disaster is looming in Shurugwi due to the combined effects of the blasting and the areas many underground tunnels.\n\nWe have petitioned the local authority and government but we are yet to get a meaningful action, he said.\n\nMachocho listed 17 affected residential areas, including Makusha, Ironsides, Ironkop, Dark City, Feny Creek, MacKinnon Kopje, Tebekwe, Camperdown, and Wanderer.\n\nSlyvia Moyo* (65) of Mambowa, a high-density suburb in Shurugwi said most houses are old having been built during the Smith regime.\n\nThis makes many houses vulnerable to collapsing, she said.\n\nWe live in fear due to the ongoing blasting by Chinese miners. Our houses sit above underground tunnels, and every blast feels like an earthquake. The risk of structural collapse is huge.\n\nOur houses have developed cracks which widen each time they blast. In some cases, ceilings collapse on us.The blasting is so intense that sometimes kitchen utensils such as water glasses get damaged, she said.\n\nThis reporter counted 20 houses around Leilano Lodge and Selukwe Primary School, close to the Central Business District, which had cracks. The owners say the cracks were a direct result of Chengxis blasting operations.\n\nChemicals, Dust and Visibility\n\nThe dust has also become an issue due to Chengxis Mining operations.\n\nResidents say pervasive red dust impacts visibility, making it hazardous for motorists, who often find it necessary to stop their vehicles, especially in the Boterekwa area during blasting operations.\n\nDust engulfs the environs after blasting\n\nBlasting is done randomly and community members say they are seldom informed of blasting schedules. Blasting occurs day and night.\n\nWe now have to damp-clean our houses constantly due to the dust, and children are at risk of being hit by vehicles, as visibility is often poor. But crucially, we wake up every day fearing for our lives, lamented Emilda Moyo*(38) from Feny Creek area.\n\nCommunity members also complained that chemicals are being washed into streams and rivers including the Mutevekwi River which is close to the Boterekwa area.\n\nChipo Mutuke*(40) a villager from Marishongwe said most Shurugwi villagers had resigned to fate because of Chengxis association with politicians.\n\nOur leaders (village heads) say they cant do anything because there are higher-ups involved in this exploitation, Mutuke said.\n\nThere are senior figures involved. This situation is talked about everywhere, yet help seems distant. The company is excavating everywhere. We no longer feel safe in our own homeland. They have desecrated places we hold sacred, dug up graves, and destroyed mountains; nothing remains for us to cherish.\n\nLeaching beds at the mine\n\nDisrupted Lifestyles\n\nVillagers said indigenous trees, including fruit trees, were being buried under Chengxis mine dumps. This reporterwitnessed this in Camperdown.\n\nThe trees such asmuzhanjeprovided a livelihood for the community members who would gather fruits for consumption and sale.\n\nThe company does not even give us a chance to cut the trees for firewood so that we at least benefit something, said Moyo.\n\nWe can no longer gather fruits or mushrooms in the forest, as they prohibit us from getting close to their mines. Grazing land for our livestock has been destroyed because vast stretches of forest have been cleared, which deeply concerns us. Arable land is slowly vanishing. Soon, everything will be lost.\n\nMoyo added: Dunraven Falls was once a sacred site for spiritual rituals, like rainmaking ceremonies. Now, the river is obstructed, and no water flows through the falls anymore.\n\nThis reporter observed armed guards at the Chengxi Peak mining area at the Boterekwa pass. Some guards were stationed at the Peak View tourist site to prevent people from approaching the claim.\n\nA guard room at Chengxi Dunraven claim\n\nThe news crew had to negotiate with some guards to be able to take pictures at the popular site.\n\nGejes Shooting\n\nVillagers revealed that tensions between guards and community members were common, often resulting in company security officials firing in the air or setting dogs on trespassers.\n\nA Shurugwi resident, Emmanuel Geje was shot in the right leg by a Chinese national employed by Chengxi at its Dunraven mining claim on September 4, last year.\n\nGeje told NewZimbabwe.com that he was passing through the area on his way to buy fuel. He said he has not been given an explanation why he was shot.\n\nThe company gave me US$5 000 for medication but I never really got answers regarding why I was shot. It was even difficult to get them to pay for my medication. My relatives had to intervene, he said.\n\nChengxi general manager Simon Karimanzira admitted that the incident happened, but said Geje had trespassed onto the companys premises.\n\nHe is an illegal miner and it is a lie that he was just passing by, Karimanzira said.\n\nIt was a cat and mouse day. They had illegally trespassed. The fact is that they cornered our guy together with his colleagues. It was 10 of them and our guy shot him to protect himself.\n\nShurugwi MP speaks out\n\nShurugwi North legislator Joseph Mpasi, whom villagers allege is close to Chengxi officials and other Chinese miners, said he had not received a formal complaint from Shurugwi residents.\n\nHe dissociated himself from the company although he maintained it was operating above board.\n\nPeople complain that they are destroying their land but they do not understand the mining operations now happening in their land, he said.\n\nHe attributed the villagers concerns over the destruction of the environment to the fact that they had not witnessed large-scale mining before.\n\nGrowing up in this area, we have never seen massive mining taking place, so people are now having concerns, but these are legally pegged claims. They have been there for many years for the purposes of mining chrome and gold, Mpasi said.\n\nI have overheard people talking but officially no one approached me to say we have a challenge. If they come to me and say the Chinese are not obeying the laws of Zimbabwe and are not doing the right thing, they do not have EIA, I will obviously attend to that because it is my duty as an MP. I wont be aware if they dont tell me.\n\nChengxi is doing a lot. They are drilling boreholes and employing our people. They are also helping contractors to mine  But we have got about a quarter of the Chinese that are not even doing anything to the community where they are operating from.\n\nOur operations are above board: Chengxi\n\nKarimanzira confirmed that Chengxi holds claims in Peak Area Boterekwa, Wanderer and Danranven areas of Shurugwi, which many villagers saw as tourist attractions.\n\nHe, however, dismissed concerns that the company was destroying tourist attractions.\n\nIf we look back, how much was realised through tourism from the Boterekwa area? Compare that with what we are getting out of there now. We extract gold and send it to Fidelity for the betterment of our economy, Karimanzira said.\n\nMy company has been operating in Shurugwi since December 2021. My company legally acquired all the mining claims it is operating and its certificates are up to date and on some of the claims we are currently in the process of consolidating our EIAs as we are a company that believes in 100 % compliance with the laws of Zimbabwe.\n\nHe confirmed that Chengxi has been fined for flouting environmental, labour, safety or mining laws and that villagers had raised concerns over the blasting, but insisted nothing was amiss.\n\nIts not a peculiar situation for a big company like ours to receive a few tickets and orders from time to time and because we are a law-abiding company with compliance legal documents we have never been shut down, Karimanzira said.\n\nOn the issue of blasting, we have reviewed our blasting techniques and timetable working closely with the Ministry of Mines and at some point we actually voluntarily suspended our blasting to address the concerns of the community because we want to coexist in harmony with our community and nature.\n\nKaraimanzira said Chengxi was conducting open cast gold mining and dismissed concerns that the companys operations were causing the siltation of rivers.\n\nIn cases where our operations encounter feeder streams or small streams within our mining claims we consult EMA and upper Runde Sub catchment council hydrologists to help us construct certified water diversions which do not harm the ecosystem. Remember we subscribe to the principle of living in harmony with nature, he said.\n\nHe also denied allegations that the company was discharging chemicals into the environment and water bodies.\n\nWe work closely with EMA. They come and conduct periodical testing of water sources within our mining areas and we have not been found wanting of any violations of chemical discharge into the environment, he said.\n\nIn cases where we sought to acquire more land, we worked and continue to work closely with the Lands office and DDCs office to help facilitate win-win compensation agreements with affected community members so it would be a distortion to suggest that we displace community members without any valuable compensation packages.\n\nAn official from the Ministry of Mines acknowledged the environmental degradation but indicated that rehabilitation efforts would only commence once the mineral resources in these areas have been depleted.\n\nThe officials interviewed by our publication were evasive, often deferring questions to one another.\n\nThe Environmental Management Agency (EMA) said commenting on the situation was challenging due to the involvement of multiple sectors in mining.\n\nEMA spokesperson Amkela Sidange directed this reporter to the mines licensing department, although she did not attend to questions about environmental violations.\n\nProvincial Mining Director Khumbulani Mlangeni said a rehabilitation plan was in place for Boterekwa.\n\nWe will be monitoring compliance. The mines hold legal titles, and rehabilitation will only occur after the economic resource is depleted. Many matters relate to EMA compliance, and I believe they have conducted EIAs, he said.\n\nAccording to the Centre for Natural Resources and Governance (CNRG), Chengxis mining activities have far-reaching consequences and are exacerbating climate risks for local inhabitants.\n\nCNRG director Farai Muguwu said that due to slime spillages, the villages surrounding the Boterekwa River can no longer safely use the river water for domestic or agricultural purposes. Community members have also stated that they are losing a major tourist attraction at Boterekwa Falls due to blasting, slime dams, and general deterioration of air quality.\n\nThe hills, which serve as vital aquifers, are being destroyed, disrupting the delicate water table and rendering the local population increasingly vulnerable to droughts, Maguwu said.\n\nThis ecological onslaught not only jeopardises the regions biodiversity but also undermines the livelihoods of local communities, who depend on these natural resources for their survival.\n\nThe long-term effects of this environmental degradation will be catastrophic, perpetuating a cycle of poverty, displacement, and human suffering.\n\n*Names have been changed to avoid victimisation\n\n",

This condition is caused by a sudden loss of blood to the optic nerve and can result in permanent blindness, writes Dr Paul Ian Cross in the MedicalNewsToday, a health information website.\n\nIn the first Danish study, 424 152 patients with diabetes were monitored over five years. The incidence of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (Naion) increased from nine to 23 per 100 000 among patients using Ozempic.\n\nThe study, published in the latest issue of the International Journal of Retina and Vitreous, states:\n\nIn the second study among 62 000 Danes and Norwegians, the incidence of Naion rose to 21 per 100 000.\n\nCross emphasises that the researchers do not suggest diabetic patients stop their treatment with Ozempic, but rather that the incidence of Naion should be monitored. Patients with untreated diabetes can also develop eye complications, but these are usually less severe than Naion.\n\nThis drug works by mimicking a natural hormone that signals the brain that the person is full. It also slows down the digestion process, according to a report from the University of California. The drug was developed for long-term use, with weight loss being one of the side effects experienced by diabetics on the medication.\n\nDr Marius Wasserfall, an internist  a doctor who specialises in internal organs and systems at Mediclinic, also warned last year that serious, although rare, side effects of Ozempic use could include inflammation of the pancreas and gallbladder problems.\n\nAccording to Wasserfall, people could also regain most of the weight they had lost when they stopped using the medication.\n\n",

            "content": "Reuters\n\nDonald Trump told thousands of roaring supporters he would impose severe limits on immigration on his first day in office, vowing to swiftly fulfil the central promise of his presidential campaign at a rally on Sunday inside a packed Washington arena a day before he returns to power.\n\nBy the time the sun sets tomorrow, the invasion of our country will have come to a halt, he said to cheers at a Make America great again victory rally at the Capital One Arena.\n\nTrump repeated his campaign pledge to launch the largest deportation effort in US history which would remove millions of immigrants. An operation of that scale, however, would likely take years and be hugely costly.\n\nThe rally resembled the freewheeling campaign speeches that have been a Trump staple since his first serious White House run in 2016, with the former and future president delivering a mix of boasts, false claims and sweeping promises to the delight of the crowd.\n\nThis is the greatest political movement in American history, and 75 days ago we achieved the most epic political victory our country has ever seen, he said.\n\nStarting tomorrow, I will act with historic speed of strength and fix every single crisis facing our country.\n\nThe event marked his first major address in Washington since his speech on January 6 2021 that preceded the storming of the US Capitol by an angry mob of his supporters. Trump has said he will pardon many of the more than 1,500 people convicted or charged in connection with the attack.\n\nTrumps rally, along with his inaugural address on Monday, could preview the tone he plans to adopt during his second White House term. In recent weeks, Trump has bewildered foreign allies by talking about taking over Greenland and the Panama Canal and turning Canada into a US state.\n\nHe vowed to repeal every radical and foolish executive order of the [President Joe] Biden administration within hours of assuming the presidency..\n\nA source familiar with the planning said Trump will take more than 200 executive actions on Monday.\n\nBorder security will figure prominently in Trumps first executive orders, another source said, including classifying drug cartels as foreign terrorist organisations, declaring an emergency at the US-Mexico border and moving towards reinstatement of the remain in Mexico policy that forces non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their US court dates.\n\nTrumps deportation plans have unsettled immigrants subject to removal, including some who immigrant advocates said are law-abiding, long-term residents with US-citizen spouses and children.\n\nTrump said he would get radical woke ideologies the hell out of our military and order the military to construct a missile defence shield over the US, though he has yet to offer details on how to carry it out.\n\nHe also pledged to release classified documents relating to the assassinations of president John F Kennedy in 1963 and his brother senator Robert Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jnr, both in 1968.\n\nThe indoor hockey and basketball venue will also host some of Mondays inauguration festivities after forecasts of bitter cold prompted officials to move the planned outdoor events inside.\n\nEarlier on Sunday Trump had breakfast with Republican senators at Blair House, the guest quarters across from the White House. John Cornyn, Susan Collins, Ted Cruz, Rick Scott and Tim Scott were among the attendees seen leaving the event.\n\nHe later placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington. Trump saluted the tomb while a military bugler played Taps.\n\nAhead of the event, Trumps fans, many dressed in the campaigns trademark red jackets and Maga hats, waited in cold, driving rain along several downtown Washington blocks, some chanting USA, USA.\n\nVal Tordjman, 58, travelled across the country from Denver with tickets to watch the inauguration. When he heard the ceremony was being moved inside, notably cutting the size of the in-person audience, he said: I felt like crying.\n\nTordjman said he planned to spend the night on the street next to the arena, despite temperatures forecast to plunge to around -7 C. He said he had yet to see Trump in person.\n\nThis is a once in a lifetime opportunity, he said.\n\nLarge swathes of the streets around the US Capitol and White House have been blocked off by steel fences since last week, and police were visible throughout the city.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew planned to attend the rally, hours after the company announced it was restoring its service thanks to Trumps promise to delay a US ban that took effect on Sunday. Chew is also expected to join other tech executives at Trumps inauguration on Monday, including the worlds richest man, Elon Musk, a close Trump confidant who made a brief appearance on stage with Trump.\n\nTrump took credit for bringing TikTok back online and said the US would do a joint venture to save the app alongside bidders to buy the company.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, made his last official trip as president on Sunday to Charleston, South Carolina, to mark Martin Luther King Jnr Day, which is also on Monday. He attended services and spoke about Kings legacy at Royal Missionary Baptist Church, while urging despondent fellow Democrats not to give up hope.\n\nTrump will take the presidential oath of office inside the rotunda of the Capitol building after cold weather prompted organisers to move the ceremony indoors. About 25,000 law enforcement personnel will provide security.\n\n",

            "content": "The South African\n\nZimbabwes Ambassador to South Africa,David Hamadziripi, has described the migration ofZimbabweans to South Africaas part of a broader, global phenomenon.\n\nHe emphasised that migration is neither new nor unique to Zimbabwe, citing examples of people leaving even the most developed nations in search of better opportunities elsewhere.\n\nSince the early 2000s, millions of Zimbabweans have left their homeland, driven primarily by an economic crisis under the ZANU PF-led government. South Africa has become the destination for many, with a large number living and working there, some without legal documentation.\n\nSpeaking on theSABC programmeFace The Nation, Hamadziripi explained that the movement of Zimbabweans to South Africa has historical roots.\n\nMigration from Zimbabwe to South Africa is not a recent phenomenon. It is historical, and we can go back many years to see this pattern. Zimbabwe is not the only country with nationals who come to South Africa. Migration is an individual decision, driven by various factors. Even in countries considered the best to live in, people migrate for better prospects,Hamadziripi said.\n\nWhen asked about theZimbabwean governmentsresponsibility in addressing the economic challenges that force citizens to leave, Hamadziripi noted: The government of Zimbabwe is taking all measures it can to improve the economic situation in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe influx of Zimbabweans into South Africa has sparked controversy over the years, with concerns about the strain on the countrys resources. In August 2022, Limpopos then-Health MEC, Phophi Ramathuba, made headlines for her remarks about Zimbabwean migrants overburdening the provincial healthcare system.\n\nRamathuba told a Zimbabwean patient at a Bela Bela hospital that South Africas healthcare system was not a charity. She added that foreign nationals were not accounted for in the provincial budget.\n\nHer comments drew widespread backlash, with the Zimbabwean embassy expressing dismay and urging diplomatic dialogue to resolve the issue.\n\nHamadziripis comments didnt sit well with many on social media, as they criticised the ambassadors statement.\n\nBaisi Mosoane-Pambo said: But please, not the whole country coming to South Africa, bathong.\n\nTebogo M Ngobeni stated: Passing the buck. That ambassador is passing off their responsibility as a government of Zimbabwe to South Africa. As if South Africa is a babysitter or rich aunty left to take care of Zimbabweans.\n\nKng Kong said: Theyve failed their people; now they want them to feel like they are protecting them here, but they cant improve their economy. He must take his people and go back home. Yaz Zimbabweans act like they are better than anyone. Ncuthu Mazangwa said: He should have just kept quiet because he has said absolutely nothing.\n\nNduza Mpho added: Migration is not a problem; you are our brothers. The problem is those who illegally cross the borders and commit crime knowing very well they wont be caught or sit in prison for long.\n\nElize Van Der Merwe stated: Just remember, charity begins at home.\n\n",
