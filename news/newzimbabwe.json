            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nYouth Empowerment Minister Tinoda Machakaire stirred the pot, Monday with his plea to President Emmerson Mnangagwa to urgently address the collapsing health care system.\n\nMachakaires admission that public hospitals are in desperate need of attention from Mnangagwa drew both praise and criticism.\n\nI visited one of our public health institutions this morning to see a relative and left deeply concerned by the conditions I witnessed. What I saw was deeply movinga clear indication that many of our people are facing serious challenges. The growing public outcry over our healthcare system is not an exaggeration; it reflects the difficult experiences of many citizens, Machakaire posted on his social media pages.\n\nHowever, critics of Mnangagwas government and the Zanu PF party were far from sympathetic.\n\nFormer Mt Pleasant Member of Parliament and renowned lawyer Fadzayi Mahere had harsh words for the cabinet minister, arguing that Mnangagwas entire government should admit failure and resign en masse.\n\nSo, when we will be raising alarm about the dilapidated state of the public health system, do you think we will be lying? Are you only concerned now because it has affected you directly? Do you ever raise these issues with Minister Mombeshora in your cabinet meetings? Do you finally accept that Zanu Patriotic Front has destroyed the public health system?, commented Mahere.\n\nWith respect, anyone who pretends not to have known about the crisis in the public health sector all along arikunyepedzera kuzungaira. Ministers and senior Govt officials know but they dont care.\n\nThey wont act unless they can directly cash in on the crisis with apic.twitter.com/4UkjFUVjhD\n\n Fadzayi Mahere (@advocatemahere)May 5, 2025\n\nMahere added: Would you concede that Mnangagwa has failed to deliver on his promise of quality healthcare for all? You have nobody else but yourselves to blame since you have been in power for 45 years. Mauraya nyika. What a mess! All of you must resign.\n\nHuman rights and democracy activist Freeman Chari also gave Machakaire a piece of his mind, labelling Mnangagwas government officials morons who have invested in propaganda tactics rather than fixing the problems in the health sector.\n\nThese people are morons. For years we have been saying hospitals are deathtraps, and Nick Mangwana would send a cameraman to take a picture of a single bed somewhere and claim things are well. A few weeks ago Pinjisi died begging for Pain Eeze and they posted a shelf with ARVs in Gwanda claiming all is well. People have been arrested for saying this, Chari wrote on his X account on Monday.\n\nThese pple are morons.

A few weeks ago Pinjisi died begging for Pain Eeze & they posted a shelf with ARVs inpic.twitter.com/KCqdjAlUhk\n\n Freeman (@freemanchari)May 5, 2025\n\nHe added: Next, some moron will post potholes in Victoria Falls and say baba Munangagwa road yashata Yet we have been talking about this for ten years and being castigated for it. This is why I say, when the time comes show no mercy! This whole situation felt like a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.\n\nOne X user, MaZwangendaba, said that every time ordinary citizens raise concerns about poor public health services, they are often laughed at and scoffed at by Zanu Patriotic Front and some government officials, as if they are barking up the wrong tree.\n\nKana tichitaura tinonzi tirimadununu and labelled puppets of the west. They tell us its because of sanctions we asked for. I am glad you have seen what we will be talking about. Open the eyes of your comrades, she said.\n\nFormer Cabinet Minister Walter Mzembi, who himself may not be entirely off the hook considering his past role as a government official, echoed this sentiment. He said Machakaires acknowledgement of the dire situation in Zimbabwes public hospitals could be the first step towards tackling the long-standing health problems.\n\nA rare official acknowledgement of the dire situation in our Health Sector, this kind of public honesty is what solves our challenges, he wrote on his X account Monday.\n\nA rare official acknowledgement of the dire situation in our Health Sector , this kind of public  honesty is what solves our challenges@edmnangagwahttps://t.co/qVvj8Nyufc\n\n Dr Walter Mzembi (@waltermzembi)May 5, 2025\n\nFormer Local Government Minister Saviour Kasukuwere, who is also in self-imposed exile, said Machakaire had shown courage and bravery, qualities needed to tackle national problems.\n\nWe commend Minister Machakaire for his bold honesty and compassion. His recent statement highlights what many Zimbabweans already know: our public healthcare system is in crisis, and urgent action is needed. This is not just about politics. Its about people. About dignity. About saving lives, she said.\n\nSome even warned Machakaire that he might be skating on thin ice, potentially facing dismissal from the government for speaking the truth.\n\nI pray and hope you dont get fired for telling the truth about the disaster that is in our hospitals. Its so pathetic that our government has been focusing on things that should not be prioritised and leaving our Healthcare to decay, said one X user who identified as African Academia.\n\nIt appears Mnangagwas government is on an admission of failure overdrive after George Charambas recent admission that University of Zimbabwe lecturers on strike have a genuine grievance, pledging to take the matter up.\n\nThis comes after Machakaires urgent call for Mnangagwa to look into the collapsing health sector, suggesting a potential shift in how the government is handling public concerns.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/can-edtech-transform-a-nation-facing-infrastructure-challenges/",
            "content": "By Dr Richard Dune\n\nAs Zimbabwe marked 45 years of independence on 18 April 2025, the spotlight (as it usually does) turned to politics, economics, and governance. Rightly so. Yet, in this pivotal moment of reflection, we must also ask: What role can education technology (EdTech) play in reshaping the nations future? And more crucially, is Zimbabwe ready for a digital learning revolution?\n\nThese are the questions I address at theZimbabwe @45panel discussion hosted by Professor Winston Mano at the University of Westminster, where Oxford scholar Professor Miles Tendi launched his latest book, The Overthrow of Robert Mugabe. As the discussion navigates Zimbabwes political past and present, I hope to contribute a forward-looking perspective on digital transformation rooted in realism but not devoid of hope.\n\nWith over 60% of Zimbabwes population under the age of 25, we are looking at a digital-first generation. From WhatsApp university groups to YouTube tutorials, Zimbabwean youth already use mobile platforms for informal learning. Whats missing is structured access, consistent, affordable, and tailored to local needs.\n\nEdTech, when done right, can close the gap between potential and opportunity. Mobile-first, low-data platforms are redefining education access in underserved communities across Africa. Zimbabwe has the talent. Whats needed is the infrastructure to scale.\n\nLets be clear: Zimbabwe cannot leap into a digital learning utopia without overcoming two stubborn obstacles: connectivity and electricity.\n\nZimbabwes mobile data is among the most expensive on the continent. A basic online course or a virtual classroom can become financially inaccessible to the average family. Add to that regular power outages, and you have a digital dream constantly interrupted by harsh realities.\n\nAI and advanced computing, now central to EdTech innovation, require stable electricity, reliable broadband, and costly processing power. These are not yet widely available across Zimbabwe. While global discussions rave about Chatgpt and virtual learning environments, much of rural Zimbabwe is still waiting for a stable 3g signal and a working socket.\n\nThis doesnt mean Zimbabwe must wait for perfect infrastructure to embrace EdTech, quite the opposite. Innovation must reflect reality.\n\nOffline-first learning tools, distributed via SD cards or preloaded on devices, can bridge the gap. Solar-powered ICT centres in schools and communities can bypass the national grid altogether. Data-lite mobile learning apps, integrated with SMS and USSD technology, can deliver meaningful learning without the need for broadband.\n\nThis is what frugal innovation looks like: low-cost, high-impact solutions designed for resource-constrained settings. Its not about building the next Silicon Valley in Harare, but about making sure a rural child in Gokwe can access learning on a cloudy day without waiting for the electricity to return.\n\nThe Zimbabwean diaspora is uniquely positioned to bridge the innovation divide. At LearnPac Systems, our work in workforce development and digital learning spans the UK, Africa, Europe, and Asia. Weve seen firsthand how diaspora-led initiatives can pilot scalable models that bring technology and training together, without waiting for government intervention.\n\nWhether its mentorship, funding, or co-creating with local innovators, the diaspora must move from remittances to strategic reinvestment in knowledge systems.\n\nTo unlock EdTechs full potential, we need a national digital education strategy, not just piecemeal projects. This means:\n\nAt 45, Zimbabwe is neither old nor young as a nation. But like any mid-life milestone, its an opportunity to re-evaluate what truly matters.\n\nIf education is the engine of development, then EdTech could take us further, faster. But we must choose the right fuel, matched to the terrain were driving through.\n\nThe question is not whether Zimbabwe can embrace EdTech. The question is whether we are prepared to design EdTech that fits Zimbabwe, not just copy and paste models from the West.\n\nIn the end, its not about tablets in classrooms or flashy AI tools. Its about giving every Zimbabwean, regardless of location or income, the opportunity to learn, grow, and thrive in a connected world.\n\nThats a future worth building.\n\nDr Richard Dune is the CEO of LearnPac Systems, a leading UK provider of edtech and compliance software solutions for regulated sectors.

            "content": "By BBC News\n\nUNITED States President Donald Trump has denied that he is considering a third presidential term, a move which experts agree is banned under the US Constitution.\n\nIll be an eight-year president, Ill be a two-term president. I always thought that was very important, Trump told NBCs Meet the Press with Kristen Welker in an interview that aired on Sunday.Trump, 78, has previously said that he was not joking about wanting to serve a third, or even fourth, term as US president.He later said his statements were meant to troll the fake news media.His company, The Trump Organization, has been selling Trump 2028 hats, fuelling armchair speculation that he may seek to remain in office after his second term ends in January 2029.In the interview, recorded from his residence in Florida on Friday, Trump said that he has had many requests from people asking that he consider seeking to remain in office.So many people want me to do it, Trump said, just days after celebrating his first 100 days of his second term.Its something that, to the best of my knowledge, youre not allowed to do. I dont know if thats constitutional that theyre not allowing you to do it or anything else, Trump said.He added that there are many people selling the 2028 hat.But this is not something Im looking to do, he said, going on to list Republicans who could take his place, including Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.The Constitutions 22nd Amendment says that no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.Changing the Constitution would require a two-thirds approval from both the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as approval from three-quarters of the countrys state-level governments.However, some Trump supporters suggest there is a loophole in the Constitution, which has been untested in court.Asked by NBC whether anyone has approached him with these theories, Trump deflected, answering that in a capacity of being a big supporter, many people have said different things.Tariff transition periodDuring the interview, Trump also rejected criticism of his handling of the economy.Look, yeah. Everythings OK, he said after his tariff plan roiled international economies, leading the US economy to shrink for the first time since 2022.I said, this is a transition period. I think were going to do fantastically, he added.Asked if the US economy may continue to shrink, he responded: Anything can happen. But I think were going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country.He later added that there is a chance that tariffs may be permanent, telling the interviewer: If somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?Trump also denied that Americans will need to prepare to see fewer goods for sale in shops, as the trade war continues.No, Im not saying that. Im just saying they dont need to have 30 dolls. They can have three, he said.They dont need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.Trump was asked about the Fifth Amendment right to due process under the law, which guarantees certain rights to people accused of committing of a crime.Critics have said his deportation plan has violated this process, and that his administration has removed people who have not yet been charged with any crime, and therefore have not had any opportunity to present a legal defence.Dont you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president? asked Welker, suggesting that he could be disregarding the presidential oath of office, which requires him to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.Trump responded: I dont know. I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the White House must work to facilitate the return of a migrant who was accidentally deported to jail in El Salvador. The Trump administration has argued that they lack the authority to force the Central American country to return him to the US.Trump said that he could not rule out using military force to annex Greenland, but suggested that he is not considering a military attack on Canada in order to force the US northern neighbour to become the 51st US state.I dont see it with Canada, Trump said, days after Canadian voters chose Liberal Party leader Mark Carney as their prime minister, in a stunning rejection of the Conservative Party.They think we are going to protect them, and really we are, Trump continued.But the truth is, they dont carry their full share, and its unfair to the United States and our taxpayers.Carney is scheduled to visit Trump at the White House on Tuesday.Defends immigration emergency declarationTrump was also asked about his decision to declare an immigration state of emergency on his first day in office, and whether the border is now secure.We have the most secure border weve ever had, he said, leading Welker to question why the emergency declaration remains in place, after immigration figures showed that illegal crossings have plummeted to the lowest levels in decades.He claimed that the emergency is in the court system, not at the border.The big emergency right now is that we have thousands of people that we want to take out, and we have some judges that want everybody to go to court, he said.Its an overall emergency on immigration, Trump told NBC, adding that he has no plans to lift the order in the near future.\n\nIll be an eight-year president, Ill be a two-term president.

I dont know if thats constitutional that theyre not allowing you to do it or anything else, Trump said.He added that there are many people selling the 2028 hat.But this is not something Im looking to do, he said, going on to list Republicans who could take his place, including Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.The Constitutions 22nd Amendment says that no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.Changing the Constitution would require a two-thirds approval from both the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as approval from three-quarters of the countrys state-level governments.However, some Trump supporters suggest there is a loophole in the Constitution, which has been untested in court.Asked by NBC whether anyone has approached him with these theories, Trump deflected, answering that in a capacity of being a big supporter, many people have said different things.Tariff transition periodDuring the interview, Trump also rejected criticism of his handling of the economy.Look, yeah. Everythings OK, he said after his tariff plan roiled international economies, leading the US economy to shrink for the first time since 2022.I said, this is a transition period. I think were going to do fantastically, he added.Asked if the US economy may continue to shrink, he responded: Anything can happen. But I think were going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country.He later added that there is a chance that tariffs may be permanent, telling the interviewer: If somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?Trump also denied that Americans will need to prepare to see fewer goods for sale in shops, as the trade war continues.No, Im not saying that. Im just saying they dont need to have 30 dolls. They can have three, he said.They dont need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.Trump was asked about the Fifth Amendment right to due process under the law, which guarantees certain rights to people accused of committing of a crime.Critics have said his deportation plan has violated this process, and that his administration has removed people who have not yet been charged with any crime, and therefore have not had any opportunity to present a legal defence.Dont you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president? asked Welker, suggesting that he could be disregarding the presidential oath of office, which requires him to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.Trump responded: I dont know.
