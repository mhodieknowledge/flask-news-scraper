ZLHR further argues that the impugned provisions of the PVO Amendment Act were vague and badly drafted and contained arbitrary powers and over-regulation of PVOs, said ZLHR.\n\nZLHR also said the PVO Amendment Act has the effect of concentrating arbitrary powers in the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare and the Registrars office and contains excessive executive interference in the internal affairs of PVOs.\n\nIt said the impugned provisions of the PVO Amendment Act have the net effect of effectively allowing the Executive to run PVOs and to deregister those that authorities dislike on very nebulous grounds.\n\nTo this end ZLHR is seeking a High Court order of constitutional invalidity, declaring section 4, section 5 as read with section 9(5), section 6, section 13A, section 14, and section 21, of the Private Voluntary Organisations Act (as amended by the PVO Amendment Act) to be ultra vires the Constitution and to be set aside.\n\n",

            "content": "Al Jazeera\n\nFormer United States President Joe Bidens cancer diagnosis has rekindled questions about whether he deceived the public about his health while in office, with his successor, Donald Trump, adding his voice to those suggesting a cover-up.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, President Trump cast doubt on the timing of Bidens advanced cancer diagnosis amid renewed scrutiny of the former presidents physical and mental fitness during his tenure.\n\nIm surprised that the public wasnt notified a long time ago, Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nWhy did it take so long? This takes a long time. It can take years to get this level of danger, Trump added, referring to the advanced nature of Bidens cancer.\n\nSo, look, its a very sad situation, I feel very badly about it. And I think people should try and find out what happened.\n\nTrump also said that doctors who had examined Biden while in office were not telling the facts.\n\nThats a big problem, he said.\n\nBidens office said in a statement on Sunday that the former president was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had spread to his bones.\n\nThe statement said Biden was diagnosed on Friday after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms and that he and his family were reviewing treatment options.\n\nDoctors graded Bidens cancer with a score of 9 under the Gleason classification system  which typically classifies prostate cancer between 6 and 10  according to the statement, indicating it is among the most aggressive kinds.\n\nLate-stage prostate cancer has an average five-year survival rate of 28 percent, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nBiden earlier on Monday expressed gratitude to well-wishers for their words of support and encouragement.\n\nCancer touches us all, Biden wrote on social media.\n\nLike so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support.\n\nThe news of Bidens cancer diagnosis came as the former presidents health was already under renewed scrutiny ahead of the publication of a new book detailing the alleged cover-up of his physical and mental deterioration by his inner circle.\n\nOriginal Sin, written by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson, contains various damning accounts of Bidens alleged decline, including an incident in which the then-president was reportedly unable to recognise Hollywood actor George Clooney at a 2024 fundraiser.\n\nIn his comments on Bidens diagnosis on Monday, Trump drew a link between the former presidents cancer and the alleged concealment of his mental acuity.\n\nIf you take a look, its the same doctor that said Joe was cognitively fine, there was nothing wrong with him, Trump said.\n\nThere are things going on that the public wasnt informed of, and I think somebody is going to have to speak to his doctor, he added.\n\nSome doctors have publicly questioned the account of Bidens cancer diagnosis provided by his office, pointing out that such advanced cancer would have had to progress over a period of years.\n\nFor even with the most aggressive form, it is a 5-7 year journey without treatment before it becomes metastatic, Steven Quay, a pathologist who is the chief executive of biopharmaceuticalcompanyAtossa Therapeutics, said in a post on X.\n\nMeaning, it would be malpractice for this patient to show up and be first diagnosed with metastatic disease in May 2025. It is highly likely he was carrying a diagnosis of prostate cancer throughout his White House tenure and the American people were uninformed.\n\nHoward P Forman, a professor of radiology at Yale University, said it was inconceivable that Bidens cancer was not detected before he left office, as it would have been picked up by a blood test known as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test.\n\nGleason grade 9 would have had an elevated PSA level for some time before this diagnosis. And he must have had a PSA test numerous times before. This is odd, Forman said in a post on X.\n\nHowever, Peter Nelson, an oncologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, said it is possible for prostate cancer to develop and spread rapidly in a short period of time, though it is more common for it to remain localised without detection for years before progressing to other parts of the body.\n\nIt is possible for prostate cancer to develop and then spread in a very short time span  by short, within one to two years, Nelson told Al Jazeera.\n\nSo, yes, it is credible that a man of his age and position could have his cancer develop and progress without detection. This would not be common, but definitely happens, Nelson said.\n\nDaniel W Lin, a prostate cancer expert at UW Medicine in Washington state, said that while Biden has very likely had cancer for years, it is possible he was not given a PSA test.\n\nThere are screening controversies with the use of PSA, and many medical groups do not recommend PSA testing after 70 or 75 years of age, although others recommend based on life expectancy or state of health rather than age cut-points, Lin told Al Jazeera.\n\nLin said it was also possible that Biden has a rarer form of cancer that is not detectable by the test.\n\nThis situation is less common, but not considered overly rare. Additionally, when this situation occurs, it is more common in high-grade cancers, such as former President Bidens case, he said.\n\nPlaying the odds, he does not fall into this category, however, it can definitely occur.\n\nPeter Black, director of the Vancouver Prostate Centre in Canada, said Bidens cancer going undetected in tests would be his best guess for the apparently sudden diagnosis.\n\nMy best guess is that he has had a PSA done every year for a long time because that is what you would expect for a US senator/vice president/president, and that he actually has an age-appropriate PSA that did not raise any alarms, Black told Al Jazeera.\n\nA diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer is usually associated with a very high PSA, but in a small minority of patients, the PSA is actually normal, he said.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/rng-vs-live-dealer-which-experience-feels-more-trustworthy-at-lucky-green-casino/",
            "content": "When it comes toonline pokies, players often find themselves debating between RNG (Random Number Generator) games and live dealer options. For players at Lucky Green Casino, a platform tailored for New Zealand players, this decision is crucial, as both gaming experiences offer different benefits and levels of trustworthiness. Lets explore the differences in these two types of experiences and determine which one feels more reliable at Lucky Green Casino.\n\nRNG games at Lucky Green Casino rely on advanced algorithms to create random outcomes for each spin, card draw, or dice roll. These games dont involve human dealers but instead use mathematical models to ensure fairness and unpredictability. For many players, RNG games are appealing because they offer fast-paced gaming without any human interaction.\n\nWhat makes RNG games trustworthy at Lucky Green Casino is their use of encryption technologies to protect player data. Every game result is generated in real-time, ensuring fairness and integrity. While some may wonder whether these games are rigged, the fact remains that RNG systems are regularly tested and certified by independent auditing companies. Although Lucky Green Casino does not specify which third-party auditors they work with, top casinos in the industry adhere to industry standards for RNG certification.\n\nIn contrast to RNG games, live dealer games bring the thrill of a real casino directly to your screen. These games, powered by live streaming technology, are hosted by professional dealers who interact with players in real time. Whether youre playing blackjack, roulette, or baccarat, live dealer games at Lucky Green Casino are designed to replicate the atmosphere of a brick-and-mortar casino, providing an authentic experience.\n\nThe main advantage of live dealer games is transparency. Players can see the dealer shuffle cards, spin the roulette wheel, or deal the poker hands, which provides a higher level of trust. The results are determined by physical actions, not algorithms, which many players find reassuring. However, its important to note that Lucky Green Casino does not yet offer live dealer games. Players who prefer this type of experience will need to seek out other platforms for now.\n\nIn terms of trustworthiness, both RNG and live dealer games offer different types of assurance.

            "content": "The Guardian\n\nTwenty-two years is a long time, even in a sport that measures its games in days and its history in centuries. The last time England played a Test match against Zimbabwe, in 2003, Rob Key was in the middle order instead of the managing directors job, Jimmy Anderson was a 20-year-old tearaway playing in his very first series, and the England and WalesCricketBoard was just about to launch the worlds very first professional Twenty20 tournament. Zimbabwean cricket has changed, too. Back then the team was in the earliest stages of a transformation that was meant to turn cricket from a minority game, played by the small white population, into a sport that better represented the whole country.\n\nThey have been hard years, riven by player strikes, political interference, maladministration and a miserable drop-off in results. The team temporarily withdrew from Test cricket, suspended their domestic competition and were repeatedly censured by the International Cricket Council. They lost so many players through emigration to England, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, that even now you could build a hell of a good Zimbabwean squad out of people who are making a living overseas. And yet, at the end of it all, the process was, by one important measure, a success. The squad that came on tour in 2003 was majority white, the team that has come this year is majority black.\n\nDespite all the politics, despite all the chaos that weve been through, cricket is now a national game, says David Coltart, supported by an overwhelming majority of Zimbabweans, black and white and other races. Coltart is the elected mayor of Bulawayo, a white man elected in a mostly black city. He has spent his life navigating the bitter, heated, complicated politics of his country. He has been fighting for the Zimbabwe he believes in ever since the 1990s, first as a founding member of the Movement for Democratic Change and a key figure in the opposition to Robert Mugabe, then as minister for education and sport in Morgan Tsvangirais coalition government.\n\nMore than five million people have emigrated from the country in that time. Coltart is one of the ones who stayed. I believe in Zimbabwe with a passion, he says, I believe in its people and its future, and I believe it is a country worth fighting for.\n\nWhen Andy Flower and Henry Olonga made their public protest against the death of democracy in their country in 2003, it was Coltart they asked to help draft their statement. My sadness is that Henry and Andy didnt stay in the country, he says, because they remain hugely influential figures. Its not a criticism. I understand why they felt compelled to leave. But we need figures like them. He mourns Heath Streak, who did stay, butwho died in 2023. Heath provided inspiration to people on both sides of the argument. He was a white man who was fluent in Ndebele, and who attracted a lot of sympathy and affection from a lot of black people, and yet he remained an inspirational people for white farmers whod been dispossessed of their land.\n\nFor Coltart, the Zimbabwean team is emblematic of the society it represents. We punch above our weight. Which is why he believes transformation had to happen.\n\nIt was very necessary, Coltart says. Cricket in Zimbabwe 30 years ago was a minority sport. If you just looked at the crowds they were, relatively speaking, very few black people in them. Even aside from the principle of the matter, that situation was completely unsustainable. He just wishes it had been done differently. He makes a comparison with the redistribution of land, and the violent farm takeovers which were the cause of so much pain, grief and injustice in the 2000s. The land holdings were unjust, he says, But we could have done it without violence. Now, there wasnt violence in cricket, but I think that when you look at the dreadful collapse of cricket in 2004, that could have been avoided.\n\nWhen Zimbabwe stopped playing Test cricket, Coltart helped lead the campaign to restore it. In government he spent a lot of time lobbying the English to start playing fixtures against his country again. The ECB turned its back on the country, even after the end of the Mugabe regime. It was only when Richard Gould took over as the chief executive of the ECB that things finally changed. They disregarded us and while I understand the reasons, Ive never felt that England should not be playing Zimbabwe, Coltart says. Although Im a strident critic of the Zimbabwean regime, Ive always believed in the power of sport to bridge divides.\n\nEven now, he would be against a boycott of Afghan cricket on similar grounds. Because if the players and the board members themselves are trying to do the right thing but are being constrained by the government, then youve got to support them and encourage them, not boycott them. Use the game, the opportunities it provides, to build relations, and to hold them to higher standards.\n\nHe is still trying to do that in his own country now, as mayor. Bulawayo has just won the right to host theStreet Child Cricket World Cup. But Coltart is deeply concerned about the way the sport is being run. Theres still far too much politics involved in Zimbabwe Cricket, in the running of the organisation, and even in the selection policies. I still fear that were not spending the money that we get as best we should. Im a politician, but I dont think politicians should be anywhere near cricket administration. I would rather see people whose primary attribute is a great passion for cricket being involved in the running of the sport. Id like to see our best players from the past dominating the selection panel, black and white.\n\nStill, he beams when he thinks that Zimbabwe are going to play a Test at Trent Bridge this week. Despite the politics, despite the abuse of the rule of law and corruption in the country, all the concerns that I have regarding the government, the vast majority of Zimbabweans are united. Its a wonderful country and you will see that in our cricket, we are a passionately multiracial team, and thats a wonderful projection of our country.\n\n",
