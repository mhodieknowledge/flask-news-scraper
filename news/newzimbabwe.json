            "content": "The Guardian\n\nA new rule introduced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to ensure voters have seen all the films in a category before they cast their ballots has provoked disquiet online, with many expressing surprise it wasnt already a requirement.\n\nA raft of measures were announced by theOscarsgoverning body on Monday, including the stipulation that Academy members must now watch all nominated films in each category to be eligible to vote in the final round for the Oscars.\n\nAbsolutely insane this wasnt already a thing, wrote one person on X, a sentiment echoed by many others, who questioned the validity of previous Academy decisions and theorised about the reasons key titles had been celebrated  or snubbed.\n\nYoure telling me all this time people could just watch one movie and be like yeah that should win all the awards, said another, with one X commentator asking: Were they just voting on vibes?\n\nTHEY WERENT DOING THAT BEFORE?, wrote one user, adding: This explains why movies like The Color Purple, Whats Love Got to Do With It, and Malcolm X were snubbed. These voters were NOT watching black films?\n\nAnonymous Oscar voters have previously admitted to not watching all the contenders in a category before voting in the final round.\n\nIm bummed because I havent seen The Substance or Im Still Here yet, one toldEntertainment Weeklyahead of the most recent ceremony. The first Dune, I couldnt get through; Im not rushing for another three hours of Dune. Theres still time to re-evaluate, but I really struggled.\n\nIn this event, voters are expected to abstain in that category, however there is no enforcement for this, and category error and ignorance can persist.\n\nOther leaked ballots earlier this year suggested a widespread misapprehension among voters that Conclaves Ralph Fiennes had already won an Oscar in 1994 for Schindlers List. In fact he has never won, and this year lost out to Adrien Brody for The Brutalist.\n\nOther changes to the awards included an update to the international feature film category, to include film-makers with refugee or asylum status, and the clarification that the use of generative AI in a film would neither help nor harm their submission.\n\nTwo of this years key nominees  The Brutalist and Emilia Prez  were involved in minor controversies over their use of AI to enhance the voices of their leading actors.\n\nMondays statement also provided further details on how the inaugural casting prize will be decided  the equivalent award was first introduced at theBaftasin 2020.\n\nCompulsory viewing was enforced by the British Academy as part of its radical overhaul of rules and regulations that same year, in response to the #BaftasSoWhite controversy.\n\nStringent regulations are in force to ensure not only that voters view all the films in the categories for which they cast their ballot, but also that they watch 15 randomised movies participating in the first stage of voting. As with the strict gender quotas in force on the director longlist, and the inclusivity criteria necessary for inclusion in a number of key categories such as outstanding British film, this measure is to try to promote a more diverse spread of contenders.\n\nSpeaking to theGuardian in 2018, ahead of her Oscar win for The Favourite,Olivia Colmansaid that she would always abstain from voting should she not have seen all films in consideration.\n\nThe alternative, she said, feels so naughty. I think maybe Im just really square. Colman went on to attribute her response to the fate of Paddy Considines 2011 filmTyrannosaur, in which she starred, and which was ignored by Bafta in its best film nominations: Very few people watched it and it broke my heart a bit.\n\nPreliminary voting for next yearsOscarsbegins in December, with the nominations announcement on 22 January ahead of the 15 March ceremony  an unusually long campaigning period. This years emcee, Conan OBrien, will return as host.\n\n",

The number of people injured went up from 159 to 178, Nyathi said.\n\nHe highlighted the most serious accident, which occurred in Norton on 21 April 2025 which claimed four (4) lives.\n\nOne of the road traffic accidents recorded during the 2025 Easter and Independence Holidays includes the accident which occurred at the 51km peg along Harare Bulawayo Road on the 21st of April at around 1200hrs, where four people were killed, while 14 others were injured when a Toyota Hiace kombi which had 18 passengers on board, veered off the road and overturned.\n\nAs a result, three (3) passengers died on the spot and one (1) died upon admission at Norton Hospital.\n\nNyathi also drew attention to the tragic consequences of hit-and-run accidents, where motorists failed to stop at the scene.\n\nDuring the period, three (3) hit-and-run fatal accidents were recorded in Murewa and Harare. The first accident occurred on the 19th of April 2025, at the 57km peg along the Mutoko Chidye dust road, when an unknown motorcyclist hit a pedestrian and sped off. The victim died upon admission at Mutoko Hospital. The second accident occurred on the 20th of April 2025 along Harare-Bulawayo Road at Tynwald flyover when an unknown male adult was hit by an identified vehicle and died on the spot.\n\nOn the same date, another accident occurred along Harare- Bulawayo Road, near Puma Service Station in Whitehouse, where a 66-year-old man was hit by a Nissan Caravan vehicle. The victim died upon admission at Parirenyatwa Group Hospital, and the driver of the vehicle did not stop after the accident, Nyathi said.\n\n",

Someone telling us to stay awayI find it meaningless. I have to solve my problem by coming to work. I dont even know this Geza, said Mateta.\n\nGeza is banking on the support of citizens frustrated by the ailing economy, which has left the majority on the brink of formal unemployment.\n\nHowever, with most people engaged in informal employment, Gezas proposed strategy has fallen on deaf ears as citizens prioritise making a living over protesting against the government.\n\nRobert Moyo, who operates a grinding mill in Mbare, said that while there is an appetite for change, earning a living takes precedence over anti-Mnangagwa protests.\n\nWe are being squeezed from both sides. The economy is tough, which makes it hard for me to stay at home. I want economic change, but its difficult to choose which side to take. You cant stay at home because I have to put food on the table in the evening, which requires me to be at work during the day, said Moyo.\n\nMoyos sentiments are shared by many Zimbabweans who are frustrated by the countrys economic and political situation.\n\nThe ruling party, ZANU-PF, has been accused of entrenching corruption, with elites benefiting at the expense of the poor, who bear the brunt of the failing economy.\n\nThe countrys opposition is also in disarray, leaving citizens without a strong alternative voice or representation.\n\nDespite boasting military backing, Gezas plan risks fizzling out, with citizens taking it with a pinch of salt.\n\nIn 2017, President Mnangagwawith the armys support and street proteststoppled long-time leader Robert Mugabe, a playbook Geza is attempting to replicate.\n\nPolitical analyst Lazarus Sauti said that while Geza has silenced voices supporting President Mnangagwas term extension, he must reconsider his modus operandi.\n\nGeza is riding on the general consensus of Zimbabweans, especially regarding presidential term limits. Zimbabweans are against that. However, stay-aways in an informal economy like Zimbabwes are not sustainable.\n\nHe should change his tack if he is to silence the ED 2030 discourse. Credit to himGeza has managed to frighten the bootlickers who were singing the 2030 chorus, said Sauti.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA staunch supporter of the opposition, Godfrey Karembera, popularly known as Madzibaba veShanduko, had his home petrol bombed on Monday night by unknown assailants.\n\nKaremberas home is located in the area under Chief Chipuriro in Guruve South and the property was reduced to ashes.\n\nKarembera himself was not at home when the attack took place. However, his 17-year-old son, Laxmore, sustained injuries while rescuing his two younger siblings from the inferno.\n\nLaxmore suffered deep lacerations to his neck and feet before he managed to escape with his siblings into the surrounding fields. He was rushed to Guruve District Hospital by neighbours.\n\nI was not at home when this happened, Karembera recounted. My neighbours, who witnessed everything, told me they heard noises around midnight that sounded like petrol bombs. My son has since confirmed it.\n\nHe told me he went out of his bedroom to investigate when he heard the strange noise. When he got outside, he realised that part of the house was on fire.\n\nHe ran back to his bedroom to wake up his siblings, with whom he shared a room. As they were escaping, another petrol bomb was thrown at them, but thankfully, they managed to get away through the fields.\n\nKarembera told NewZimbabwe.com that his neighbours reported seeing two top-of-the-range vehicles visiting his home before the incident. He suspects those individuals are responsible for the attack.\n\nThey told me that two GD6 Toyota Double cabs arrived at my house before the attack. I suspect those people are responsible for setting my home alight with petrol bombs, Karembera stated.\n\nKarembera has since filed a police report at Guruve District Police Station, and police officers attended the scene around 10 am on Tuesday.\n\nKarembera also described the apparent slowness of healthcare workers in attending to his son despite the urgent need for medical care. He believes this is due to his open support for Chamisa.\n\nLaxmore was taken to Shinje Clinic in Ward 7 by my friends, but the staff there refused to treat him, saying his injuries were too severe. They referred him to Guruve District Hospital, where, again, he was not attended to.\n\nThe healthcare workers appeared completely disinterested. I had to phone friends to help me get him to a private health facility where he is currently receiving treatment. He is in a great deal of pain, he explained.\n\nWe are not safe in our own homes, and yet we claim to be independent. There is no freedom whatsoever. We are being traumatised day and night, he lamented, his voice heavy with despair.\n\nKarembera was arrested in March 2022 and reportedly tortured at Harare Central Police Station. He was charged with disorderly conduct after he allegedly went into Harare Central Business District wearing yellow regalia, which then symbolised support for the Citizens Coalition for Change, just a month after its inception by Chamisa.\n\n",

We would be patrolling blindly, not knowing if we would encounter people, Masiapato said on Monday during a media briefing at Beitbridge Border Post.\n\nHe admitted the BMA has long faced challenges intercepting undocumented migrants, but said the introduction of drones has significantly improved their operations.\n\nWith drones, we can now monitor vulnerable segments along the border and corridors. At Beitbridge, including the river crossing, we can see individuals using makeshift boats to cross. Once detected, we send coordinates to our ground teams, who move in to intercept them, Masiapato said.\n\nHe revealed that more than 1,000 illegal foreigners had been intercepted in the four days over the Easter weekend, due to the assistance of the drones.\n\nThe BMA also plans to implement a targeted approach to intercept facilitators assisting undocumented migrants to cross into South Africa illegally.\n\nHome Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber recently launched four drones and 40 body-worn cameras to strengthen border security.\n\nThe new technologies were deployed for the first time over Easter.\n\nSouth Africa shares borders with Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, Mozambique, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.\n\nHowever, these borders have long been plagued by illegal migration, cross-border crime, smuggling, and human trafficking, issues exacerbated by porous borders, corruption, and poor infrastructure.\n\nIOL News previously reported that Masiapato criticised neighbouring countries such as Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Lesotho for not doing enough to curb illegal migration, saying the problem affects South Africa more directly.\n\nIllegal migration is complicated, and its South Africa that bears the brunt, he said.\n\nOur neighbours do not allocate many resources to it, understandably, because it does not affect them directly. We continue to engage, but the problem persists.\n\nHe said the root causes of illegal immigration  unemployment and socioeconomic issues in neighbouring countries  are political matters that must be addressed at higher levels.\n\nWhile acknowledging that South Africa faces similar challenges, Masiapato said the country remains a pull factor due to its relatively better economic conditions.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Public Service Commission (PSC)has issued a warning to civil servants who abscond from work heeding a call for a national shutdown.\n\nThe warning comes in the wake of calls by war veteran Blessed Bombshell Geza for citizens not to report for duty, but stay home in protest over alleged gross incompetence by President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his government. Geza says the protests should be sustained until Mnangagwa resigns.\n\nIn response to Gezas incitement, the PSC said its workers, who fail to report for duty, would be deemed saboteurs.\n\nThe PSC notes with concern recent incitements circulating in various platforms encouraging public servants and other citizens to stay away from work or abstain from regular activities on 22 and 23 April 2025.\n\nThe Commission is confident that public servants, who are committed, disciplined, and fully aware of their responsibilities, will not be misled by such reckless and disruptive incitements, PSC said in a statement.\n\nPublic servants are reminded that their core mandate is to serve the people of Zimbabwe faithfully, diligently, and without interruption. The work carried out by the Public Service is vital to the delivery of essential services and the advancement of our national development aspirations, as outlined in Vision 2030.\n\nThe government workers were also reminded that participating in the stay-away would be considered an act of insubordination.\n\nParticipation in any stay-away that disrupts service delivery constitutes a dereliction of duty and an act of insubordination. Such actions are unpatriotic, undermine national unity, damage the economy, and hinder the collective progress of the nation. The PSC will not tolerate any conduct that threatens the stability and functionality of public institutions, added the PSC.\n\nAccordingly, the PSC wishes to clarify that Tuesday, 22 April 2025, and Wednesday, 23 April 2025, are normal working days.\n\nSupervisors were urged to mark attendance registers of all government employees and inspectors will collect the registers at all ministries, departments and agencies.\n\nPSC said it expects its workers to be at their workstations and discharge normal duties professionally, thereby displaying their loyalty to the incumbent leadership.\n\nTogether, let us uphold the dignity of the Public Service and contribute meaningfully towards building a prosperous, resilient, and united Zimbabwe, the PSC statement further reads.\n\n",
