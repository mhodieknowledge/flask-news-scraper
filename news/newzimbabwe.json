The sanction has left Broos men under pressure to win their final two qualifiers against Zimbabwe and Rwanda to keep their World Cup hopes alive.\n\nDespite the blow, Broos expressed confidence, dismissing both Zimbabwe and Rwanda as not top teams.\n\nYou start doubting now because of a tricky situation, yet we are facing Zimbabwe and Rwanda, not Nigeria, Cameroon, or Egypt. These are good teams, yes, but not top teams. So why should we doubt? he said.\n\nBafana Bafana go into the clash with an edge, having beaten Zimbabwe 3-1 in the reverse fixture.

Mahlangu.\n\nThe official policy is that urban areas will not receive Presidential input this year. The exception granted last year was due to an extraordinary drought, Masuka said.\n\nThis year, the inputs will be strictly allocated to the three million rural beneficiaries. Anyone residing in an urban area who wishes to benefit must be located in designated agricultural zones, namely, communal lands, A1 resettlement areas, or small-scale farming areas. These are the targeted zones for thePfumvudza/IntwasaProgramme this season.\n\nThe Pfumvudza/Intwasa scheme, a food security programme, has over the years focused on boosting productivity among smallholder and rural farmers through climate-smart agriculture.\n\nMasuka stressed that the programme would not accommodate urban dwellers since it is designed for farming regions.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that agriculture is designated for agricultural zones. Urban areas are primarily residential and do not accommodate farming activities.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, we have established that urban agriculture is not permitted, as farming should take place on land specifically allocated for agricultural purposes, not within urban settlements, Masuka explained.\n\nHe added, I recall that during last years severe drought, the President recognised that rural farmers who typically support urban populations were facing significant challenges. In response, we extended input support to peri-urban farmers to help supplement food production.\n\n",

GG as he is notoriously called has accumulated more thanUS$1 billion becoming the richest civil servant, said Mutodi.\n\nContractors, Ministries and Departments refusing to pay Guvamatanga a kick back of at least 5% after receiving Treasury payments have been denied payments for several months even if the funds are budgeted for.\n\nOver the past six months, Parliament itself has struggled to operate after being denied its budgeted funds by George Guvamatanga. A civil servant earning less than $1000 GG has more than 5000 dairy cattle, dairy equipment and several mansions hence the proposed lifestyle audit.\n\nOnecontractor Bitumen which was contracted to do roads has been asked to pay US$200,000 byGuvamatangafor every $2,000,000 weekly payment he authorises that theyreceive and they have made several complaints tomembers of the Budget Committee at Parliament.\n\nGuvamatanga was earlier this year accused of receiving bribes from shadowy businessman Wicknel Chivayo to approve payments to the controversialRen-Form CC, a South African company that supplied Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) with voting material at highly inflated prices.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa is said to have fired and forgiven him in June this year before he begged for the job he has kept since 2018.\n\nAZanu PF Member of Parliament (MP) for Bikita South, Mutodiclaimed Guvamatanga had made threats to deal with him if the committee was to ever seek a lifestyle audit or engage the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC).\n\nHe added: Guvamatangahas also made threats to senda terror team to deal with the(me)upon hearing that the Committee was considering carrying out a life audit on him as well as asking for a ZACC probe.\n\n",
