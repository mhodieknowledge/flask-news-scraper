We owe it to Job Sikhala. I was the secretary general of the last united CCC and we betrayed him. We didnt offer the solidarity that was expected by our ordinary members. And today I stand here to apologise, he said.\n\nChalton Hwende\n\nHwende also stated that Sikhalas prolonged stay in prison was due to the democratic movement not pushing hard enough for his release.\n\nIf the united democratic movement had offered the same solidarity that was expected by our ordinary members, this man would not have stayed in prison for over 500 days, Hwende said, to applause from the audience, including Sikhala himself and Bulawayo Mayor David Coltart, among others.\n\nHwende, who appears to be warming up to rejoining his former party boss, Nelson Chamisa, in the political project Chamisa is building, has been engaging in spats with staunch Chamisa supporters on X, who are vowing that Hwende should not be allowed anywhere near Chamisa and the new democratic project he is developing.\n\n",

            "content": "By Business Report\n\nAn uplift in volumes has been projected for Zimbabwean consumer companies despite rising cost structures, a volatile policy and monetary environment as well as higher taxation, say analysts at IH Securities.\n\nHippo Valley, Tongaat Huletts Zimbabwe-listed unit, reported a 44% downturn in revenues to $191.59 million this monthalthough the gross profit for the year to end March rose 2% to$66.87m.\n\nAnother Zimbabwean consumer company, Star Africa Corporation that also trades in sugar, however, raised revenues by 22% over the same period.\n\nNonetheless, analysts at IH Securities on Friday said in the securities and advisory firms latest research note on Zimbabwes consumer sector that they anticipate an uplift to volumes for consumer-facing companies this year owing to a likely recovery in consumer spend.\n\nHowever, this was against the backdrop of general cost structures continuing to be on the rise corresponding to a volatile policy environment and the crystallization of costs in United States dollars.\n\nOn the demand side, private consumption growth, which had slowed down from 4.8% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2024, is expected to have a rosier year with household spending rebounding by 6.6% in 2025, said the report.\n\nAfter an improved rainy season and prices for minerals such as gold firming up, Zimbabwean consumer firms are well placed for stronger consumer spending.\n\nCompanies expected to benefit from this include beer and soft drinks manufacturer, Delta Corporation, which has cited stiffer competition in some beverage categories.\n\nZimbabwean consumer discretionary spend however remains subdued, with data from Zimstats recently showing average earnings of 55% of the employed population at less than $100.\n\nMoreover, Zimbabwean companies have to absorb some of the legislation-linked costs of production, such as sugar taxes and fast-food taxes, to support volumes.\n\nIH Securities is thus skewed towards consumer-facing stocks thatexhibit the ability to generate a significant portion of revenue in US dollar, have good management practices, and are also consistent in paying dividends.\n\nCompanies offering defensive staples such as National Foods  in which Tiger Brands has an interest  were displaying volume growth, said the analysts.National Foods maize division recordeda significant volume growth of 58% in May over the comparative nine-month period, largely attributable to the market dynamics.\n\nDairy company, Dairibord, saw consolidated volume growth of 14% for itsfirst quarter ended 31 March 2025.\n\nOn the retail front, the past two years have been challenging for formal operators on account of several issues. As per leading retailers, a key impediment to viability has been S.I 81A of 2024, an exchange control act that mandated the selling of goods and services at the official exchange rate, noted the report.\n\nIt further though stated that Zimbabwesoperating environment for companiesremained challenging overall, citing key issues such as elevated production costs as well as sporadic operating liquidity squeezes in light of the tightening of monetary conditions.\n\nIt mentioned emerging cost pressures including the governments recent increase of 19.1% to the diesel levy as further worsening costs for companies.\n\nHeadwinds in Zimbabwe had already affected Hippo Valley, which has had to rightsize its workforce with 1 000 workers expected to be let go by August.\n\nOK Zimbabwe, another prominent retailer battling headwinds, is now undertaking a $30m rights issue to stabilize the company. The retailer has also announced further closures of stores, pointing to a 2025 year that remains volatile and fragile, but with a possibility of better performances by consumer companies.\n\n",
