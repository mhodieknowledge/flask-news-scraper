We are still trying to find ways to finish off matches. We have played four games.\n\nIt is a worry, it is a concern that we have scored only one goal. But overall, the boys are trying; they are doing their best. The management is also trying and doing their best to support the club, said Luphahla.\n\nPerhaps tellingly, Luphahla has been exposed as a relatively inexperienced coach tasked with steering the defending champions.\n\nHe has never held a head coaching position in the top flight, having been denied the chance to lead TelOne in their maiden season in 2019.\n\nThe Simba Bhora stint is somewhat of a learning curve for the former Zimbabwe national team player.\n\nLuphahla said his team needs ample time to gel to get their season going and possibly mount a serious challenge to retain the league championship.\n\nIt is just a matter of time, but we had said maybe by game number six, that is when we will be at our best, because some of the boys joined us after we returned from South Africa. We are still trying to integrate them with the rest of the squad, he said.\n\n",

He said the introduction of new tax regulations, a restrictive monetary policy framework, and exchange rate volatility choked the smooth flow of operations.\n\nThe introduction of the Zimbabwe Gold currency in April initially stabilized both the exchange rates and inflation. However, by September 2024, rapid depreciation led to substantial devaluation, causing pricing distortions within formal trade that stifled performance, he said.\n\nHe said the introduction of the sugar content surtax fiscal policy adjustments, including the VAT reclassification of milk products, and the increased Intermediated Money Transfer Tax (IMTT) on US$ transactions, resulted in significant cost increases.\n\nThis necessitated price increases, particularly across the beverages portfolio, that negatively impacted competitiveness and consumer demand. Consequently, a price rollback to pre-surtax pr pricing was implemented, leading to margin erosion.\n\nOperational inefficiencies stemming from inconsistent availability of utilities increased production costs and disrupted output while supply chain challenges hindered material procurement, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, during the period, the group achieved a consolidated volume growth of 10% driven by a strong performance in the Liquid Milks and Foods categories, though constrained by a marginal 1% growth in Beverages.\n\nThe liquid milks 20% significant year-over-year growth was due to an increased raw milk supply, with notable market share gains across Chimombe, Steri and Lacto. Food sales volumes rose 47%, led by Yummy yoghurt and ice cream, while improved product availability bolstered Rabroy Tomato Sauce sales.\n\nBeverages realized only 1 % growth, impacted by subdued Pfuko Maheu performance due to pricing challenges from sugar tax and VAT adjustments. US$ sales volume rose to 83% of total volume, up from 79% in the corresponding prior year period.\n\nThe group continues to navigate a complex and volatile environment characterized by evolving regulatory policies and currency fluctuations. High input costs, an onerous tax burden and pricing pressures remain key challenges, added Sachikonye.\n\n",

But few believe him because he has done nothing to cancel, the resolution, Peter Fabricius, a consultant at the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria, wrote in a March 28 note.\n\nFirst Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, who, with Mnangagwa led a military takeover to oust long-time ruler Robert Mugabe in November 2017, is seen as the next in line to become president. Thats nurtured speculation he quietly supports the protest call. The government has denied a rift exists between the two men.\n\n",
