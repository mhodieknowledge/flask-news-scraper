            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nPRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwas decision to reshuffle the Zanu PF Politburo could worsen political conflicts that already exist within the ruling party, political analyst Jealousy Mawarire has said.\n\nMawarire, who was speaking on South African broadcaster eNCA about the redeployment of senior party officials such asSecretary General Obert Mpofu to lowly offices, did not rule out the possibility of a coup.\n\nZanu PF, this week, communicated Mnangagwas decision to remove Mpofu from the powerful secretary general office a few weeks before its congress in Mutare.\n\nMpofu was replaced by Jacob Mudenda, a well-known Mnangagwa ally and took over the watered-down Secretary of ICT portfolio.\n\nPatrick Chinamasa, who had so far unsuccessfully led calls for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to extend his term beyond the constitutionally mandated two terms, was replaced by Ziyambi Ziyambi as the partys Secretary for Legal Affairs and appointed Treasurer General.\n\nThe shuffle was seen as a way of weakening Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, whose relationship with Mpofu was secretly questioned while his bid for presidency in 2028 is fast gaining ground. Chiwengas ambition and growing power in the party had also forced talks of a term extension to 2030 to be shelved.\n\nAsked whether a coup was possible, Mawarire said that although he could not say it with authority, anything was possible.\n\nThere is a possibility of escalating political turmoil, of further collapse of the economy and once it collapses and there is discohesion in the ruling party, anything is possible, said Mawarire.\n\nDespite the recent silence, NewZimbabwe.com is reliably informed that provinces are being whipped into supporting Mnangagwas illegal term extension and in the process shut out Chiwenga.\n\nAdded Mawarire: What I am really sure about is that President Emmerson Mnangagwa is pushing for an unconstitutional third term and that is the source of all of the upheaval and the confusion in the cockpit.\n\nI do not think the conflict is between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga alone. The conflict is between Mnangagwa and the general polity which does not believe in the mutilation of our constitution.\n\nSection 95 of the Zimbabwean constitution sets a two-term limit on the presidency.\n\nMnangagwa is in his second five-year term, having finished off about seven months of late President Robert Mugabes term after deposing him in a coup in November 2017.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nThe government, through the Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF), has injected US$5.3 million to revive Dorowa Mine in a move aimed at boosting local fertiliser production, reducing reliance on imports, and protecting farmers from costly and potentially harmful chemicals.\n\nAn additional US$11 million is expected to be released to ensure the mine reaches full capacity by March 2026, with a target annual output of 150,000 tonnes of phosphate concentrate.\n\nThis was revealed by Tatenda Chimusoro, Head of Investments for Agriculture and Industrials at the Mutapa Investment Fund, during a Tuesday tour of fertiliser companies by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Industry and Commerce.\n\nMIF is working to revive struggling state-owned entities through loans designed to generate profits and strengthen value chains. The Dorowa intervention will allow the mine to reach its full potential, producing enough phosphates to support local fertiliser blending and meet farmers needs, said Chimusoro.\n\nSilinos Mapfumo, a ZimPhos board member, told the committee that the company adds value to phosphates mined from Dorowa by converting them into NPK basal fertilisers applied during planting. This ensures high-quality fertiliser is made available to farmers across the country, he said.\n\nCommittee chairperson Clemence Chiduwa said the visit was crucial to understanding the domestic fertiliser value chain. It is important to see how local production can meet farmers needs while creating jobs and reducing dependence on imports, he noted.\n\nMapfumo added that the fertiliser industry is a top priority under the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1). The objective is to increase domestic production and value addition while cutting back on imports. Government already holds a major stake in the industry through MIF, with ownership managed by the Industrial Development Corporation of Zimbabwe (IDCZ), he said.\n\nCurrently, Zimbabwe imports a significant share of its fertiliser, often at higher costs and with risks of harmful contaminants such as cadmium and lead. The revival of Dorowa Mine is expected to lower prices for farmers, create jobs, and strengthen the agricultural sector.\n\nThe Mutapa Investment Funds intervention is timely, Chimusoro emphasised. With the mine fully operational by March, we can secure a sustainable supply of fertilisers, protect farmers, and reduce dependence on imported products.\n\nDorowa Mine, a subsidiary of the Chemplex Group of Companies, had temporarily halted production to allow for major plant upgrades.\n\n",

            "content": "By Farai Mutsaka, UNICEF\n\nMUTOKO, Zimbabwe  Its a Friday, and classes end at midday. But unlike before, Miriam Kaseke, a teacher at Domborinenhiwi Primary School, is in no rush to find transport home. Instead, she looks forward to hosting family members for the weekend at the school, nestled deep in the rural eastern fringe of Mashonaland East province.\n\nThey are comfortable coming here these days. It feels like home, she said, as she made her way to a new grey house on the school grounds, built with support from the Schools Improvement Grant (SIG), Complementary Funding for teacher accommodation.\n\nThis warmth and comfort sharply contrast with Kasekes arrival at the school in 2019. Back then, the single, dilapidated four-roomed teachers house was already overcrowded, leaving her with no option but to occupy the pantry.\n\nA space originally meant as an indoor toilet was already taken. That tiny pantry became my kitchen, my bedroom, and my living room all in one, she recalled. I couldnt even turn around properly when sleeping. If I tried to roll over, my head would end up in a dish of water and my feet on the plates, she added, painfully remembering how desperate she felt during her first days.\n\nThere was no privacy, and inviting my spouse to visit was out of the question. I wondered to myself, Of all my college classmates, am I the cursed one? she said.\n\nThe houses doors didnt lock properly, and the windows barely stayed in their frames. Reptiles would freely slip through its leaky roof. She laughs nervously as she recalls one teacher fleeing his room in terror after a snake slithered under his blankets.\n\nIt was impossible to get a restful nights sleep. I constantly struggled just to feel safe. I wanted to go home, but being on a year-long probation, I couldnt transfer immediately, she said.\n\nThe poor conditions extended beyond the accommodation to the teaching environment itself.\n\nIt was a disaster, from the teachers lodging to the classrooms. I felt drained every morning walking into school, knowing I would return that evening to a place I was forced to call home, Kaseke said.\n\nOne classroom block was a mud structure, another had lost its roof to the wind, offering little protection for teachers and pupils alike. Without windows or doors, livestock roamed freely inside, destroying books and learning materials. Teachers had to deal with composite classes, turning both learning and teaching into a nightmare.\n\nTeachers would frequently be absent or rarely stay long, forcing the school to rely on untrained community volunteers, mostly recent school leavers, said Melody Mupfudze, the acting school head.\n\nThis challenge reflects a wider regional problem. According to a 2020 UNICEF study titled Time to Teach: Teacher Attendance and Time on Task in Eastern and Southern Africa, teacher absenteeismranging from 15 to 45 per cent in the regionis a major contributor to a learning crisis. In low- and middle-income rural schools, over half of the children finish primary school unable to read or understand simple texts. The report highlights that poor working conditions often drive teacher absence, while stronger parental and community engagement improves attendance and classroom presence.\n\nAt Domborinenhiwi Primary School, the SIG intervention is beginning to address this issue.\n\nWe are working to grow our teaching staff. In 2019, we had seven teachers; now only four remain, although we are getting another one this coming term. We will still need four more. But I am confident the current teachers will stay because the situation on classrooms and teachers accommodation has significantly improved in recent years, said Mupfudze, who recalled marking books while sitting on a water bucket when she first arrived in 2012.\n\nShe praised the SIG Complementary Funding for transforming the schools fortunes. The school has roofed and floored its run-down classroom block, purchased desks, and, with continuing support, constructed a brand-new block specifically for infant pupils.\n\nThat new block is the most beautiful of all. We did everything from foundation to roofing with SIG funds; we had enough resources, said Mupfudze, pointing proudly to a bright yellow classroom building.\n\nUNICEFZimbabwe/2025/Farai Mutsaka.Improved housing and classroom blocks are inspiring teachers at Domborinenhiwi Primary School.\n\nInspired by the ongoing changes, Kaseke opted to stay and become a key part of the schools development effort.\n\nI thought to myself, I can be part of this big picture. I need to get involved. Since then, I have been part of the team working to make this a school other communities will look to for inspiration, she said.\n\nThe experience has also enriched Kaseke with practical knowledge about school building and management. A newcomer in 2019, she quickly became deeply involved in the schools transformation under the SIG intervention, becoming familiar with the whole school approach promoted by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education and UNICEF.\n\nThis approach centres on making communities active partners in school development to foster learning environments that are child-friendly, widely supported, and sustainable.\n\nThe SIG funds gave us a huge boost, but we couldnt have succeeded without community help. We engaged parents, political leaders, and traditional authorities; everyone became part of the team, Kaseke reflected.\n\nThe whole school approach emphasises that successful school transformation requires a participatory, shared ownership model. It involves parents, caregivers, traditional and political leaders, religious influencers, and even the children themselves as key stakeholders in development.\n\nOn a recent day, several men used wheelbarrows and shovels to transport sand, which is essential for construction work.\n\nLets make sure everyone is here, we cant afford to start the rainy season with this block unfinished, said School Development Committee chairperson Knowledge Meki to volunteers gathered to contribute unpaid labour.\n\nWe have completed the other blocks and teachers accommodation, but we still have one block left to finish, he added.\n\nUNICEFZimbabwe/2025/Farai MutsakaA community effort, combined with UNICEF-supported funding, breathes new life into struggling schools in Zimbabwe.\n\nLocal councillor Christopher Machipisa was among those lending a hand. He understands the critical role education plays in an area where artisanal gold mining lures childrenboth boys and girlsinto hazardous mining activities for quick cash.\n\nThe problems at school reflect what happens at home. Children come to school but find no teachers. At home, they see young boys flaunting money from gold mining over education. The girls often marry the miners. But these are short-term gains; the real long-term achievements come from good education, said Machipisa. Thats the challenge we want to overcome, and why creating good conditions for teachers to stay is so important.\n\nKaseke, standing alongside other teachers, smiled as she looked on.\n\nWere not going anywhere as long as you keep this dedication, she said with a laugh.\n\n",
