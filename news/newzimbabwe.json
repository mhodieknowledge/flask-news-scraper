            "content": "BBC\n\nThe Kenyan authorities paid a network of trolls to threaten and intimidate young protesters during recent anti-government demonstrations, Amnesty International has said.\n\nA new report by the human rights organisation said government agencies also employed surveillance and disinformation to target organisers of the mass protests, which swept Kenya across 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe demonstrations were driven largely by Gen Z activists who used social media platforms to mobilise.\n\nIn response to Amnestys report, Kenyas interior minister said the government does not sanction harassment or violence against any citizen.\n\nBut Amnesty said it had uncovered a campaign to silence and suppress the protesters.\n\nYoung women and LGBT+ activists were disproportionately targeted, with misogynistic and homophobic comment, as well as AI-generated pornographic images, the report said.\n\nThe BBC has approached the government for further comment.\n\nOne activist told Amnesty: I had people coming into my inbox and telling me: You will die and leave your kids. We will come and attack you.\n\nI even had to change my childs school. Someone sent me my childs name, the age the school bus number plate. They told me: If you continue doing what youre doing then we will take care of this child for you.\n\nIt has long been believed that the government employs a network of individuals, known as keyboard warriors, to push its online messages.\n\nThe report features a man who said he was part of a team paid between 25,000 and 50,000 Kenyan shillings (about $190-$390; 145-300) per day to amplify government messaging and drown out trending protest hashtags on social media platform X.\n\nAs part of its research, Amnesty spoke to 31 young human rights defenders who had participated in the protests. Nine of these activists said they had received violent threats via X, TikTok, Facebook and WhatsApp.\n\nAs well as digital abuse, the authorities have also been accused of carrying out a brutal crackdown on the protests.\n\nMore than 100 people died, rights groups say, when police clashed with protesters during two waves of demonstrations  one in 2024 and one in 2025.\n\nThe authorities were also accused of arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances and using lethal force against the protesters.\n\nThe government accepted there had been some case of excessive force by police, butalso defended the security forces in other instances.\n\nThe demonstrations railed against issues such as proposed tax rises, increasing femicide and corruption.\n\nAmnesty chief Agns Callamard said the organisations report clearly demonstrates widespread and coordinated tactics on digital platforms to silence and suppress protests by young activists.\n\nOur research also proves that these campaigns are driven by state-sponsored trolls, individuals and networks paid to promote pro-government messages and dominate Kenyas daily trends on X, she added.\n\nKenyas Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said: The government of Kenya does not sanction harassment, or violence against any citizen any officer implicated in unlawful conduct bears individual responsibility and is subject to investigation and sanction.\n\nAmnesty also raised concerns about unlawful state surveillance, including allegations  denied by Kenyas largest telecom provider, Safaricom  that authorities used mobile data to monitor protest leaders.\n\n",

The Bank finalised a US$15 million Agrobond which was privately placed with a European Fund and will go towards supporting the agriculture sector, she said.\n\nDuring the period under review, the Group generated operating income of ZWG1.3 billion for the nine months to September 30, 2025.\n\nIn terms of the Groups core business, net interest income rose by 63% compared to the same period in 2024, driven by increased loans and advances to productive sectors and support for consumer needs. Core income streams remain resilient, supported by strong growth in loans and deposits, while management continues to prioritise revenue diversification and cost optimisation.\n\nThe Group incurred operating expenditure of ZWG1.1 billion, a 70% increase from the prior year. This variance primarily reflects the impact of strategic business reengineering initiatives undertaken during the year, including restructuring and staff rationalisation to align operations with the Groups strategic vision.\n\nTotal assets increased to ZWG9.2 billion, up 27% from ZWG7.3 billion recorded on December 31, 2024. The growth was anchored by an expansion in loans and advances, which stood at ZWG4.2 billion at the end of the quarter.\n\nThe domestic economy is projected to grow by 6.6% in 2025 in line with earlier projections in light of the sustained macroeconomic stability, record-high gold prices, growing remittances and a 12.8% rebound in agriculture following the 2024 El Nino.\n\nIn light of the above, the Group will continue to focus on supporting key sectors of the economy through its core business, Mutandwa added.\n\n",
