Companies may relocate production or services to countries with lower labour costs, leading to job losses and economic hardship in developed nations, he said.\n\nDzimiri said globalisation can lead to a race to the bottom where countries compete to attract investment by lowering labour standards, potentially leading to exploitation of workers.\n\nHe charged labour practitioners in the country to ensure the crafting of trade agreements that promote fair labour standards and enforcing labour laws.\n\nThe ZCTU leader said governments can strengthen labour laws and enforcement mechanisms to protect workers rights, including minimum wages, collective bargaining rights, and workplace safety regulations.\n\nRaising public awareness about the impacts of globalisation on labour rights can help to build support for policies that protect workers, added Dzimiri.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga in Johannesburg\n\nAFRICAN Forum and Network on Debt and Development (AFRODAD) Executive Director Jason Braganza has expressed concern over how challenges arising from debt servicing to international monetary facilities by African countries are going unreported due to lack of information and statistics among other challenges.\n\nBraganza was speaking at the official opening of the 5th edition of the AFRODAD Media Initiative (AFROMedI) held in Sandton, Johannesburg, South Africa recently.\n\nWith half of the continent currently being in debt distress, Braganza said the need to capacitate the media for the benefit of the public and holding authorities accountable.\n\nDespite these very grave economic challenges, the role of media in reporting these challenges and the diversion of much-needed resources to debt servicing is largely going unreported.\n\nLack of information, accompanied by inaccessible debt statistics and public reporting, is undermining the publics ability to interact and play its role in holding government to account.\n\nIn Africa, as of today, more than half of the continent is facing a situation of being in debt distress or at high risk of being in debt distress, he said.\n\nFour countries have already defaulted on their debt: these are Zambia, Chad, Ethiopia, and more recently, Ghana.\n\nAccording to Braganza close to half the continents countries are paying more in debt service interest repayments than on investments in public services such as education, health, water, and sanitation.\n\nThe fifth edition of the AFROMedi was attended by 45 journalists drawn from 31 African countries.\n\nAfrodad is a Pan-African civil society organisation established over 25 years ago with the single objective of advancing African voices on issues of public debts and development finance. We are currently headquartered in Zimbabwe.\n\nThrough this years AFROMedi V, journalists were capacitated to link reparations to global development processes and to prioritise in-depth reporting that advances Africas position on reparative justice with a keen focus on public debt and related issues including taxation, trade, labour, climate finance, and legal elements of debt among others.\n\nAfrodad Executive Director urged journalists to keep in mind how this situation is undermining Africas sovereignty, emancipation from a neo-liberal, private profit-based world order, leaving Africans in a perpetual state of poverty, inequality, and indebtedness.\n\nIt is, therefore, fitting that the African Union theme of 2025 is on reparations and reparative justice for the continent, he said.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, Christian Ayiku, Afrodads Trustee member and Ghanaian economic analyst based in South Africa echoed Braganzas sentiments stating that the current debt crises Africa is facing threatens to reverse years of development gains and historical debt relief efforts.\n\nFrom the African Debt Risk Map, countries like Sudan, Somaliland, Somalia, Ghana, Sao Tome & Principe, Congo Republic, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Cameroon, Angola, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Chad, Eritrea, Djibouti, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Tunisia and Kenya are struggling from a heavy burden of debt.\n\nThe role of the media in this campaign is crucial as they are empowered to set the agenda that works for the people of the continent, he said.\n\nAFRODAD through AFROMedi, and its partners, has been working with the media to set public debt and linked issues on the agenda as a priority.\n\nThis has also played a key role in democratising the debt discourse, thus giving citizens the power to influence debt policy through electoral choices.\n\nThe media plays a crucial role in shaping public discourse, influencing policy decisions and bringing attention to socio-economic issues.\n\nTherefore, empowering journalists to set an agenda that aims at ensuring accountability and keeping people informed on key processes remains crucial.\n\nIt is important to engage journalists in this process to ensure citizens are informed and engaged.\n\nIn a nutshell, AfroMedi will offer increased capacity to report on debt reparative justice, through humanising the issues, focusing on data-driven reporting, offering historical context of injustice and proffering policy solutions from interviews with technical persons in the civil society space.\n\n",

            "content": "By The Guardian\n\nTHE death toll from a huge earthquake that hit Myanmar has reached almost 700, as rescuers dig through the rubble of collapsed buildings in a desperate search for survivors.\n\nThe shallow 7.7-magnitude quake struck northwest of the city of Sagaing in central Myanmar in the early afternoon, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.\n\nThe quake destroyed buildings, downed bridges, and buckled roads across swathes of Myanmar, with severe damage reported in the second biggest city, Mandalay.\n\nAt least 694 people were killed and nearly 1,700 injured in Myanmars Mandalay region  believed to be the worst affected  the ruling junta said in a statement. About 10 more deaths have also been confirmed in Bangkok, the Thai capital, where a high rise building under construction collapsed.\n\nBut with communications badly disrupted, the true scale of the disaster has yet to emerge from the isolated military-ruled state, and the toll is expected to rise significantly.\n\nIt was the biggest quake to hit Myanmar in over a century, according to US geologists, and the tremors were powerful enough to severely damage buildings across Bangkok, hundreds of kilometres (miles) away from the epicentre.\n\nRescuers in the Thai capital laboured through the night searching for workers trapped when a 30-storey skyscraper under construction collapsed, reduced in seconds to a pile of rubble and twisted metal by the force of the shaking.\n\nBangkok governor Chadchart Sittipunt told AFP that about 10 people had been confirmed killed across the city, most in the skyscraper collapse.\n\nBut up to 100 workers were still unaccounted for at the building, close to the Chatuchak weekend market that is a magnet for tourists.\n\nBangkok city authorities said they will deploy more than 100 engineers to inspect buildings for safety after receiving over 2,000 reports of damage.\n\nWhile there was no widespread destruction, the shaking brought some dramatic images of rooftop swimming pools sloshing their contents down the side of many of the citys towering apartment blocks and hotels.\n\nEven hospitals were evacuated, with one woman delivering her baby outdoors after being moved from a hospital building. A surgeon also continued to operate on a patient after evacuating, completing the operation outside, a spokesperson told AFP.\n\nBut the worst of the damage was in Myanmar, where four years of civil war sparked by a military coup have ravaged the healthcare and emergency response systems.\n\nJunta chief Min Aung Hlaing issued an exceptionally rare appeal for international aid, indicating the severity of the calamity. Previous military regimes have shunned foreign assistance even after major natural disasters.\n\nThe country declared a state of emergency across the six worst-affected regions after the quake, and at one major hospital in the capital, Naypyidaw, medics were forced to treat the wounded in the open air.\n\nOne official described it as a mass casualty area.\n\nMandalay, a city of more than 1.7 million people, appeared to have been badly hit. Photos showed dozens of buildings reduced to rubble.\n\nA rescue worker from Amarapura, an ancient city and now a township of Mandalay, said the bodies of 30 people had been recovered from collapsed multistorey apartment blocks.\n\nI have never experienced anything like this before  our town looks like a collapsed city, he said, estimating that about a fifth of the buildings had been destroyed.\n\nA resident reached by phone told AFP that a hospital and a hotel had been destroyed, and said the city was badly lacking in rescue personnel.\n\nAnother witness in Mandalay, who asked not to be named, said eight people had been killed and others were feared to be trapped after a construction building in Pyigyitagon township collapsed.\n\nThe whole of Mandalay city was affected by the earthquake. The rescue teams and hospitals are now overrun. We are managing with the resources we have in the neighbourhood, they said.\n\nImages published by Khit Thit Media, a news agency based in Myanmar, showed piles of bricks and rubble outside a damaged mosque, also in Mandalay. At least 20 people had died there, it reported, though it was not possible to verify this figure.\n\nA huge queue of buses and lorries lined up at a checkpoint to enter Naypyidaw early on Saturday.\n\nOffers of foreign assistance began coming in, with President Donald Trump on Friday pledging US help.\n\nIts terrible, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office about the quake when asked if he would respond to the appeal by Myanmars military rulers.\n\nIts a real bad one, and we will be helping. Weve already spoken with the country.\n\nIndia, France and the European Union offered to provide assistance, while the WHO said it was mobilising to prepare trauma injury supplies. Chinas President Xi Jinping extended condolences, state media reported.\n\n(Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report).\n\n",

He says its time for the bank to expand beyond the countrys bordersstarting this year.\n\nCBZ had planned to grow through mergers and acquisitions, including deals with First Mutual Limited and ZB, but competition regulators blocked the moves. Despite this setback, the bank is still convinced it can go international.\n\nWe cannot remain a Zimbabwean play, our partners are venturing out into the world, and we cannot leave them to go there alone, Nyazema told a meeting of top clients on Wednesday.\n\nCBZ will take its first steps outside Zimbabwe by the end of the year. Its first target is South Africa, which accounts for 70% of Africas insurance revenues. The bank is also looking at Botswana and other markets beyond Africa.\n\nWe like Botswana not as a market where we generate revenue, but we like Botswana because its friendly from a capital perspective, he said. We believe well be able to raise reasonably priced capital either to deploy in Botswana or to deploy elsewhere in the world.\n\nNyazema wants to see CBZ expanding into Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas. Our goal is to be present in seven African countries, one Middle Eastern country, and two South American countries.\n\nZimbabwean companies, especially banks, dont exactly have a stellar record in their attempts to operate in the region. The list of companies that tried and ran back home is long. Nyazema says CBZ will be more cautious, given the size of more experienced operators in the region.\n\nThe company is adopting a measured approach, acknowledging its relative size compared to established players in the target markets, he says. We acknowledge our size; we may be big in Zim, but we are very small elsewhere.\n\nTo scale up, CBZ will explore joint ventures or mergers and acquisitions where it can.\n\nThe bank is also looking to underwrite more business. After raising US$50 million in credit lines from Afreximbank in February, CBZ now plans to raise up to US$500 million this year. With Zimbabwe shut out of international markets, Nyazema sees this as a major achievement.\n\nRaising half a billion dollars is our goal, but it must be under the right conditions. If we achieve this, it will greatly benefit the economy by stimulating trade, supporting business activities across various sectors, and ultimately enhancing overall economic growth, Nyazema said.\n\n",
