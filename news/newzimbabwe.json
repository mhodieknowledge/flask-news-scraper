For almost two decades, it sparked conversations in homes, workplaces and social media spaces, providing entertainment that felt authentically local.\n\nIt gave local actors, writers, directors, and production teams a platform to showcase their talents while telling South African stories.\n\nHelga Palmer, group head of local programming and strategy at eMedia, captured the bittersweet nature of this farewell:We are proud of what Scandal! has achieved, not only as a top-rated television property but also as a vital part of South Africas cultural landscape.\n\nWe thank the entire production team, the cast past and present, and our loyal viewers for making this journey extraordinary.\n\ne.tv has extended heartfelt gratitude to Ochre Media, the production company that brought Scandal! to life throughout its run.\n\nStan Joseph, executive producer at Ochre Moving Pictures, reflected on what the series has meant to everyone involved:Producing Scandal! has been an incredible journey and a true labour of love. For close to twenty years, our writers, directors, actors and crew have poured their hearts into bringing authentic South African stories to life.\n\nJoseph continued: We are deeply grateful to e.tv for their trust and to our audiences for their unwavering support. While it is bittersweet to say goodbye, we are proud of the legacy that Scandal! leaves behind.\n\nScandal! will continue to air until the end of June 2026, giving viewers time to process this goodbye while ensuring the series receives the send-off it deserves.\n\nFor fans, this means they have a few more months to savour every episode, every plot twist, every character moment.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has lifted a two-year asset freeze on properties belonging to businessman Tobias Zangairai, ruling that the Prosecutor-General failed to act on allegations of unexplained wealth despite obtaining an interim order in 2023.\n\nJustice Benjamin Chikowero said it would be unjust to keep the order in place indefinitely without prosecution or civil forfeiture proceedings.\n\nThe order was never meant to remain in force in perpetuity, ruled Justice Chikowero. The Prosecutor-General has not taken advantage of that order by taking positive action. As I write this judgment, no criminal prosecution of the applicant for any serious crime vis--vis some or all of those properties has seen the light of day.\n\nThe case dates back to January 27, 2023, when the court, at the request of the Prosecutor-General, granted an unexplained wealth order and an interim freezing order against Zangairai.\n\nHe was required to explain how he acquired 24 immovable and movable assets, including residential stands across Harare, Bulawayo, Beitbridge, Mutare, and a fleet of vehicles ranging from a Toyota Hilux to a Nissan Civilian bus.\n\nZangairai complied, submitting a sworn statement to the Zimbabwe Republic Polices Asset Forfeiture Unit within the required 30 days.\n\nHowever, since then, the state took no further steps to prosecute him or apply for civil forfeiture.\n\nIn his defence, Zangairai argued that the prolonged freeze violated his constitutional right to use and enjoy his property.\n\nSection 71(2) of Zimbabwes Constitution guarantees every citizen the right to acquire, hold, occupy, use, transfer, hypothecate, lease or dispose of all forms of property.\n\nThe judge criticised the Prosecutor-Generals office for keeping Zangairais assets in limbo for more than two-and-a-half years without justification.\n\nIn these circumstances, it was not surprising that counsel for the first respondent was unable to make any meaningful submissions, Justice Chikowero said.\n\nIt would be unjust not to accede to the application for the setting aside of the interim freezing order.\n\nThe court ruled that Zangairai can now freely deal with his 24 assets, which include prime land in Marlborough, Salisbury Township, Mahatshula in Bulawayo, Chikanga in Mutare, and multiple stands in Beitbridge, along with vehicles such as a Toyota Nadia, Nissan Hardbody, Mazda Capella, and several Toyota Hiace minibuses.\n\nThe High Court formally granted Zangairais application, struck out a related case (HCHACC 130/24), and ordered that each party bear its own legal costs.\n\n",

However, communities living near mining operations tell a different storyone of underpayment, unsafe working conditions, physical assaults, and other inhumane practices.\n\nIn his inaugural statement, newly elected ZCTU Secretary General Tirivanhu Marimo singled out Sino-Bikita Minerals, describing its treatment of workers as emblematic of the abuses in Chinese-run companies across Zimbabwe.\n\nAs labour, we are gravely concerned about the alarming escalation of workers rights violations in Chinese-run mining operations, particularly at Sino-Bikita Lithium Mine. Reports of workers being beaten, intimidated, and subjected to degrading treatment by both foreign managers and their local accomplices are not only barbaric but outrightly unlawful, Marimo said.\n\nZCTU Secretary General, Tirivanhu Marimo\n\nA lawyer by profession, Marimo noted that such conduct flagrantly violates Sections 51, 53, and 65 of the Constitution, which guarantee human dignity, protection from cruel and degrading treatment, and the right to fair and safe labour practices. He added that Section 4A of the Labour Act [Chapter 28:01] also prohibits forced labour and workplace violence, while mandating safe working conditions.\n\nThe ZCTU leader further argued that the violations contravene International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, calling for urgent state intervention.\n\nThe ZCTU calls for the immediate investigation and prosecution of perpetrators under Zimbabwes criminal law, including both foreign nationals and local enablers. Labour inspections must be dispatched and enforced by the Ministry of Labour and NSSA to ensure compliance with safety and dignity standards, he said.\n\nHe also urged authorities to suspend mining licences for companies found guilty of systematic abuse until they comply with labour laws, while demanding full compensation and medical rehabilitation for affected workers.\n\nMarimo called for a tripartite dialogue to address the broader pattern of abuse in the mining sector and to establish enforceable, binding standards.\n\nThe mounting complaints of barbaric conduct at Chinese operations constitute not just a breach of labour rights, but a direct assault on Zimbabwes sovereignty, showing contempt for both human rights and the rule of law.\n\nIf the Governments mantra of Zimbabwe is Open for Business is to carry legitimacy, it cannot serve as a smokescreen for modern-day slavery where foreign investment becomes synonymous with unchecked violence, exploitation, and impunity, he added.\n\n",
