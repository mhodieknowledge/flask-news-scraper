This idea cannot be stopped by anyone or myself. It is coming from the people of Zimbabwe and MPs are representatives of the people in all 10 provinces, Togarepi said.\n\nMnangagwa is currently serving his second and final term which will end in 2028 but there are sections of his supporters pushing for him to stay beyond that. He has however dismissed the notion saying he will abide by the constitution and step down when its time.\n\nHe added, As a democracy, we are allowed to say what we want so this agenda is not for MPs, but the people of Zimbabwe. Who can stop what we have seen here? Look at the development that we see is what people want beyond 2028.\n\nThe truth is that people may trouble themselves on this issue, debarking the wrong tree but the openness that we have witnessed here has made us wiser than before. We have realised that this criticism from the opposition is crucial for us the ruling party to do the right thing. We want that constructive criticism in order to build the nation.\n\n",

In 2024, he explicitly distanced himself from the push for the postponement of elections, stating that he had no interest in extending his term beyond 2028, demonstrating a commitment to democratic norms.\n\nThe proposal to postpone the 2028 elections, primarily supported by certain politicians, raises concerns about setting a dangerous precedent in a region that has generally maintained relative peace. It will also violate SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections, of which Zimbabwe is a signatory.\n\nZESN calls for political will on meaningful and genuine electoral reforms and implementing Election Observer Missions (EOMs) recommendations, said ZESN.\n\n",

            "content": "MoneyWeb\n\nThe Port of Durban is receiving a shipment of imported white maize  the first import of the grain since March 2017, when South Africa was experiencing a severe drought.\n\nThe African Baza, a bulk carrier sailing under the Bahamas flag, is currently offloading 23 700 tons of white maize produced in the US, while another vessel containing 46 000 tonnes of white maize is expected in February, says Dr Andr van der Vyver, executive director of the South African Cereals and Oilseeds Trade Association (Sacota).\n\nThe current imports are necessitated by poor crops and record-high grain exports to Zimbabwe in 2024.\n\nLower production\n\nDuring the 2023/24 production year, grains and oilseeds experienced a bad year, with production declining approximately 22.5% for maize and 33.5% for soybeans from the previous year.\n\nThe Crop Estimates Committee in November 2024 estimated white maize production at just over six million tonnes  down 29.3% from the previous year  and yellow maize at 6.716 million tonnes (down 15.4%).\n\nIn the South African seasonal crop cycle, these products should last until approximately March/April 2025 before the new crop [planted in November and December 2024)] will become available again, Van der Vyver notes.\n\nAs early as February 2024 it became evident that South Africa would have to import yellow maize and possibly white maize and soybeans.\n\nSouth Africa had just enough grains to feed itself, but we also supply grain to countries in the Sacu [Southern African Customs Union] region. We did not fully anticipate that the drought would also affect crop production in these countries, and we saw a strong demand from particularly Zimbabwe for white and yellow maize.\n\nMoneyweb reported earlier thata shipment of Argentinian yellow maizewas offloaded at the Port of Cape Town in April.\n\nYellow maize and soybean meal imports continued throughout the latter part of last year.\n\nTo date, Sacotas multi-national grain trading members have imported approximately 518 000 tonnes of yellow maize, Van der Vyver says.\n\nSteep price increases\n\nJSE-traded maize and soybean prices started increasing steadily last year, and the prices have continued to rise. Yellow maize reached a high of R5 431 per tonne in December 2024  a 43% jump from February 2024. White maize soared 70%, reaching a high of R6 670 per tonne.\n\nVan der Vyver notes that prices have since come down marginally.\n\nHowever, agricultural economist Wandile Sihlobo cautioned on social media platform X that higher white maize prices in South Africa may be a reality in the first quarter of 2025, and relief may only come in the second quarter of the year.\n\nExpectations for 2025\n\nAccording to Van der Vyver, imports should continue until the end of April. Good and continuous rain for the new production season started shortly before Christmas, and most planting has been completed.\n\nAfter last years drought not only farmers, but all of South Africa, is desperately looking for an average crop. This will stabilise old crop price increases and bring lower prices with the new crops.\n\nHe cautions that the verdict is still out on the availability of stock until the new crop is harvested.\n\nSouth Africans consume around 11.7 million tonnes of maize per season. Over the past five years, on average 1.5 million tonnes of maize was exported to other African countries.\n\nLocal demand, cross-border exports, sufficient imports, and early harvesting of the new crop determine whether enough maize is indeed available.\n\nIndications are that the maize industry will end the season with 600 000 to 700 000 tonnes which is barely enough to ensure a continuous supply in the pipeline.\n\nA lower supply will put further pressure on maize prices, which will negatively impact consumers.\n\nWhite maize remains a staple food for many South Africans, while yellow maize and soybeans are the main ingredients for the broiler industry. Government must take note of the impact on staples and be prepared to support them timely, says Van der Vyver.\n\n",

            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nONE of Zimbabwes biggest sugar producers, Triangle Limited will next month retrenchan undisclosed number of workers.\n\nThe company will roll out a three-phased employee retrenchment programme after citing escalating operational costs, currency losses, and competition from low-cost, duty-free imported sugar as key factors driving the unwelcome decision.\n\nThe severance process, which will be done in phases, begins late February 2025 and ends August this year.\n\nIn a recent statement, Triangle Managing Director, Tendai R. Masawi said myriad militating factors had necessitated the job cut.\n\nThe current economic environment in Zimbabwe has presented unprecedented challenges for Triangle Limited over the past three years, Masawi said.\n\nAmong other factors, Masawi said inflationary pressures, rising maintenance costs, and the inability to claim value-added tax (VAT) on inputs after sugar was exempted from VAT, have negatively impacted on the companys operations.\n\nEscalating operational costs, particularly in areas such as fertilizer, fuel, maintenance costs, and imported goods/services, combined with inflationary pressures, currency losses, the inability to claim VAT on inputs after sugar was exempted from VAT, and competition from low-cost duty-free imported sugar, have severely impacted our ability to sustain current levels of operation, said the managing director.\n\nSince 2022, we have seen profit margins decline significantly by 55%, manpower costs increasing by 133% as a proportion of revenue, and debt levels rising to unsustainable levels.\n\nThe company has been unable to generate positive cash flows from its operating activities for the past three years and has faced a very constrained working capital position since the implementation of the revised cane supply arrangements, which has necessitated constant trade-offs between what the business needs and what it can afford.\n\nThe decision to cut jobs was arrived at in order to ensure the company remains viable in the wake of an unrelenting and unfavourable economic climate.\n\nDespite implementing numerous cost-reduction and revenue-enhancement initiatives, these efforts have proven insufficient to stabilize the business. This decision has been taken to protect the long-term sustainability of our organization and ensure that Triangle Limited continues to play its vital role in Zimbabwes economy and the livelihoods of communities in the Lowveld region, Masawi said.\n\nThe company pledged to provide fair severance packages and support programmes for affected employees. Its also a committee to work closely with union representatives and other stakeholders to ensure the process is conducted transparently and fairly.\n\nTriangle said the decision is unrelated to the business rescue process of its South African shareholder or its acquisition by the Vision Consortium.\n\nSince 2022, Triangles profit margins have declined by 55%, while manpower costs have risen by 133% as a proportion of revenue.\n\n",

Our client is not to be disqualified illegally,Makamure said.\n\nMakamure said the matter is of national interestas such Magayashould be heard.\n\nOur client should be given a chance to contest. However, there is an issue that the elections should be held on the 25th of this month before the elections so we met to push for a quick hearing because this is a matter of public interest and a notional matter so we managed to push for the matter to be heard this Friday.\n\nThe cleric and others including former Zimbabwe captain Benjani Mwaruwari, CAPS United owner Farai Jere and Temba Mliswa are notable figures who failed to pass the eligibility test.\n\nThe barring of the four candidates left Nqobile Magwizi, Twine Phiri, Marshal Gore, Philemon Machana, Martin Kweza and Makwinje Phiri contesting for the presidency.\n\nAccording to the ZIFA statutes, the barred candidates have the option to seek remedy from the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) in Switzerland.\n\nMwaruwari and former ZIFA deputy president Gift Banda have since filed joint appeals at CAS challenging their disqualification.\n\n",
