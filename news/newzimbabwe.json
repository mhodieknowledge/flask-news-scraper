            "content": "IOL Business\n\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened an additional 10% tariff on any country aligning with the BRICS nations policies, which could have severe implications for South Africa.\n\nAny country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday night.\n\nThis levy would be implemented over and above the base 10% tariff that is already being planned for all of the countrys global trade partners.\n\nThe new tariff threat was in direct response to criticisms of Trumps unilateral tariff measures, made by BRICS members during a summit held in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday. A joint BRICS statement released after the summit said the upcoming tariffs risked hurting the global economy.\n\nAt the event, BRICS leaders also collectively condemned the recent Israeli and US air strikes on Iran, expressing serious concern over deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure and peaceful nuclear facilities, and labelling the strikes a violation of international law.\n\nTrumps new threats come at the beginning of a crucial week for the global economy as the US Presidents July 9 tariff deadline looms. While the White House is expected to start sending out letters to its trade partners this week, outlining the new tariffs, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed during a press conference over the weekend that the new tariffs will now take effect from August 1.\n\nThe sweeping global tariffs were originally planned for April 1, but Trump announced a three-month delay after global markets reacted negatively to the looming trade war.\n\nSouth Africa has requested an extension of the 90-day tariff pause, after the US announced its intention to introduce a new trade template for countries in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe US President said he would impose unilateral levies on trade partners unless a deal could be struck by August 1, AFP reported.\n\nSouth Africa stands to lose billions in export revenue should the country face higher tariffs from the US, as well as the potential loss of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which provides duty-free access to that market. SA exports under AGOA amounted to $3.6 billion (R64bn) in 2022.\n\nThe agricultural and automotive sectors could be particularly hard hit. Although in the latter case only BMW and Mercedes export cars from South Africa to the US, these volumes are significant enough to make it the countrys third biggest auto export destination.\n\nBRICS, consisting of 11 emerging nations, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, along with more recent entrants such as Iran, accounts for about half of the worlds population and 40% of global economic output.\n\n",

She took over as mayor of the Berkshire city in May this year, having served four years as a councillor for Whitley Ward.\n\nThis is a huge achievement, not just for yourself but for us as a people and, more importantly, for our children, said Madzingo whosecompanysupported the hosting of the event.\n\nGone are the days when our children grew up without role models and thought that the barriers are too high for them. Your election is evidence that it can be done.\n\nDiaspora Insurance CEO Jeff Madzingo\n\nMadzingoadded; Honourable mayor, we cant salute you enough for doing this because, over the years, the story has been about negativity and poverty, but we are now changing the narrative to a story of resilience and a story of excellence.\n\nBeing mayor in a foreign country is not a joke but success is not accidental; its a culmination of good habits, hard work, professionalism and time management.\n\nDr Mpofu-Coles recounted what she described as a tough journey since relocating to the United Kingdom in 2002 from Zimbabwe and surviving a five-year battle against breast cancer.\n\nIm overwhelmed, she said before kneeling and clapping her hands in appreciation in the traditional Zimbabwean way.\n\nI arrived in the UK in 2002 and thought I would go back to Zimbabwe and become a member of Parliament for the then MDC (party). We were really passionate about Zimbabwe and campaigned right across the country.\n\nShe added, Its been tough; I had breast cancer or five years, and, in that time, I couldnt do anything, but this city of Reading carried me. It was amazing having people care for you.\n\nDr Mpofu-Coles was described as a poster girl of the idea that if I make it, Ill always turn back to pull my sister out too; I wouldnt just walk away.\n\nA former diplomat who served in Zimbabwes foreign service with postings in Mozambique and the former Yugoslavia Dr Mpofu-Coles brings a remarkable personal journey to her mayoral role.\n\nAfter arriving in Reading in 2002 as a refugee she had to rebuild her life in the UK, working hard in a sandwich factory, as a cleaner, a carer for the elderly and disabled, then qualified as social worker, before studying for a doctorate in Human Geography at the University of Reading and building a career in academia.\n\nHaving been supported by Reading Refugee Support Group herself, she became the Chair of the charity and has dedicated her time to advocate for refugees now as a trustee of City of Sanctuary.\n\nAs a Reading councillor, Dr Mpofu-Coles has chaired the Adult Social Care, Childrens Services and Education Committee, and sits on the Parenting Panel, Health and Wellbeing Board and Safer Reading Neighbourhood Forum, among others.\n\nA strong advocate or refugees and fighter against inequalities and poverty, Dr Mpofu-Coles chosen charities for her mayoral year are ReadiFood, a local foodbank service, and Utulivu Womens group, which supports equal opportunities for BAME and refugee women and girls.\n\n",

They deemed Mgunis appeal unfortunate, inaccurate, and misleading.\n\nUndeterred by the controversy, Mguni excelled, earning a silver medal in the Under 65kgs karate tournament.\n\nBongeka Mbokodo Mguni\n\nTshuma celebrated Mgunis achievement in a social media post at the weekend.\n\nShe is living proof that albinism is not a limitation. Congratulations to Bongeka Mbokodo Mguni, she is just 17 but she is on a mission to win, inspire and change the narrative that persons with albinism cannot compete in mainstream sports, wrote Tshuma.\n\nBongeka is a decorated young sports girl who has already bagged many accolades in karate. She is living proof that albinism is not a limitation, she too belongs in the arena without fear or favour.\n\nAmhlophe, congratulations, makorokoto for representing Zimbabwe with decorum and pride. She won us a whole silver medal on the under 65kgs karate tournament during the 2025 AU Region 5 Youth Games in Namibia this weekend.\n\nThank you to all who supported her on this. May God continue to bless all for touching the life of our champ, added the lead fundraiser.\n\n",
