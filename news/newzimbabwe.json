            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Harare Magistrates Court has convicted and jailed for nine years a former Highview Clinic accountant on charges of fraud and money laundering.\n\nAfter a full trial, Tonderai Shayimana (30) was found guilty of siphoning funds meant for the medical institution into his personal accounts after a full trial.\n\nIn sentencing, the magistrate imposed a nine-year jail term, of which six years were suspended.\n\nThree were scrapped on condition of good behaviour and another three on condition of restitution.\n\nShayimana will serve an effective three-year prison term for fraud.\n\nOn the money laundering charge, he was handed a five-year sentence wholly suspended.\n\nMagistrates heard that between August 2023 and March 2024, Shayimana created and used fake company email accounts to mislead medical aid societies, fraudulently instructing them to divert payments due to the clinic into his First Capital Bank account and Ecobank Nostro account.\n\nProsecutors revealed that he pocketed ZWL$15,362,415, ZIG$95,409 and US$123,739, which he later converted into personal assets.\n\nThe offender deliberately abused his position of trust and orchestrated a sophisticated scheme to deprive the clinic and medical societies of large sums of money, the court noted.\n\nWith the proceeds of crime, Shayimana purchased a residential stand in Budiriro for US$6,500, developed it into a seven-roomed house complete with a durawall, security cameras and solar system, and also bought a Nissan NV200 vehicle. Both the house and the vehicle have since been forfeited to the State.\n\nThe court said deterrent penalties in cases of insider fraud would serve justice.\n\nConvicted white-collar criminals will face stiff penalties and ill-got wealth will be forfeited, the National Prosecuting Authority said, commenting on the conviction.\n\n",

Authorities say he even became chairman of the defrauded investors group by leveraging these lies.\n\nIn one of the most elaborate scams, between 2020 and 2021, Chibaya allegedly defrauded a female investor of US$98,000, concocting stories about taxes, bribes and legal fees.\n\nHe is accused of faking his own arrest, impersonating a police officer, and later pretending to be dead to avoid detection.\n\nA stolen Samsung S20 cellphone was also traced back to him.\n\nOther counts include defrauding a complainant of US$850 in 2021 under the guise of tax fees and swindling another investor of US$2,000 after promising to help recover a US$30,000 investment while posing on duty as a doctor.\n\nA third investor lost US$2,000 after being promised recovery of his US$30,000 investment, with the accused again pretending to be on duty as a doctor when collecting cash, the court.\n\nAfter years on the run, the accused person was tracked down by Interpol in the UAE and handed over to Zimbabwean authorities.
