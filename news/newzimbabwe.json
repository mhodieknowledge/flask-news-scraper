            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nThe Zanu PF political landscape is increasingly volatile, and if current tensions are not carefully managed, the party could face an implosion that threatens its key structures and processes, a political analyst has warned.\n\nIn an interview withNewZimbabwe.com, political analyst Eldred Masunungure said the outcome of the ruling partys ongoing succession battle will hinge on who holds the strategic cards within the power structure.\n\nMasunungure cautioned that delegates attending the ongoing Zanu PF National Peoples Conference in Mutare must address internal divisions decisively to prevent a full-blown crisis.\n\nThe long and short of it is that the Zanu PF pot is overboiling and if not managed well, it may very well explode.\n\nIt is therefore incumbent upon the National Peoples Conference managers to sharpen their conflict resolution skills to abate a dangerous fallout, Masunungure said.\n\nThe conference, currently underway in Mutare is expected to deliberate on key issues including the ailing economy, corruption, and the 2030 agenda. However, the gathering has been overshadowed by factional wars between camps aligned to President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputy Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nDuring a Politburo meeting on Tuesday, Chiwenga reportedly questioned why Mnangagwa had not taken action against individuals named in a corruption dossier he presented earlier. Those implicated include controversial businessmen Wicknell Chivayo, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, and gold dealer Pedzai Sakupwanya, who are accused of stealing millions from state coffers.\n\nThe dossier has triggered a fierce backlash from Mnangagwas loyalists, including Zanu PF Secretary for Legal Affairs Ziyambi Ziyambi and party spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa, both of whom have publicly attacked the Vice President.\n\nIn response to the dossier, Ziyambi described Chiwenga as ignorant and accused him of treason, while Mutsvangwa slammed the VP for turning the presidium into a kangaroo court.\n\nCommenting on the power struggle, Masunungure said the decisive factor will be which camp is able to outmanoeuvre the other.\n\nThe critical factor depends on who is capable of outmanoeuvring the other or, to use Donald Trumps language, who has the cards?.\n\nFrom the vantage point of an outsider looking in, it appears like the incumbent Mnangagwa has most of the strategic cards courtesy of the power of incumbency, both in the party and the state.\n\nChiwengas military base has been significantly eroded and cannot be relied on to mount another military-assisted transition. The balance of evidence suggests that Mnangagwa will emerge the winner, on account of the manipulation of incumbency.\n\nRecent changes within Zanu PF have further fuelled speculation of a deliberate purge of Chiwengas allies.\n\nMnangagwa recently removed Obert Mpofu from the influential Secretary General post, reassigning him to the ICT department, and replaced him with Jacob Mudenda.\n\nWithin days, he also dismissed Zanu PF Director General Ezekiel Zabanyana, a move widely seen as an effort to weaken Chiwengas internal support base.\n\nMasunungure warned that the escalating factionalism could spill beyond the party, affecting national governance.\n\nThe fallout will most probably infect the state, its key organs and processes. More broadly, it will further deepen and widen the already worrying societal polarisation.\n\nZanu PF is expected to hold its elective congress in 2027, where the partys succession question may be resolved. Some of the resolutions from the Mutare conference are expected to be implemented in the lead-up to that crucial event.\n\n",

We should have 22 companies patrolling our borders, but currently there are only 15. Even these face critical shortages of personnel, vehicles and modern surveillance tools like drones, he said.\n\nThis admission paints a bleak picture of a defence force stretched thin across vast and often inhospitable border terrain.\n\nThe SANDF highlighted further challenges, citing insufficient manpower to monitor the borders shared with Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique. Soldiers are required to patrol hundreds of kilometres with limited resources, and the presence of informal settlements near the Limpopo River has complicated matters, with some residents allegedly assisting illegal crossings.\n\nDakota Legoete, chair of the PCDMV, was equally candid.\n\nIf we are being honest, we dont have functioning borders  and that puts the safety of our country at risk, he said. His comments were echoed by Mr Phiroane Phala, co-chair of the JSCOD, who emphasised the need to balance diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries and the imperative of national security. We cannot allow people to enter and leave the country without control, he said.\n\nCommittee members witnessed the dilapidated state of border fences and identified several areas where illegal crossings are rampant. Soldiers stationed in these zones shared their frustrations over the lack of numbers and support, saying they are unable to effectively monitor the largely unregulated movement of people.\n\nIn response, the committees have pledged to strengthen their oversight efforts.\n\nThey are advocating for increased funding, improved coordination between departments and modernised border infrastructure. They also plan to engage key stakeholders  including the Border Management Authority, the SANDF, the SAPS and SARS  to develop a more unified response to the crisis, with particular focus on the Beitbridge border post.\n\nThe visit comes at a pivotal moment in South Africas border control strategy, underlining the urgency of interdepartmental cooperation and renewed investment in national security infrastructure.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZanu PFs internal power struggles have escalated dramatically, with party spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa publicly rebuking Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, accusing him of turning the presidium into a kangaroo court.\n\nThe confrontation reportedly followed Chiwengas demand for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to take action against individuals named in a corruption dossier he presented to the Politburo.\n\nSources told NewZimbabwe.com tensions were high during the meeting. Chiwengas allies initially rallied behind him before retreating when questions were raised about the motives behind his dossier.\n\nThe document reportedly implicates several prominent businessmen closely associated with Mnangagwa, including Wicknell Chivayo, Delish Nguwaya, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Pedzai Sakupwanya, and Paul Tungwarara.\n\nThe group is accused of siphoning millions from state coffers, calling for their immediate arrest,a move that has deepened divisions within the ruling party.\n\nOur Vice President decides to turn the Presidium into a kangaroo court. An inquisitive court.KutongaPresident citing that document which was authored by Kasukuwere and his colleagues, Mutsvangwa told journalists at a press briefing in Harare, Thursday, expressing his disapproval of Chiwengas actions.\n\nMutsvangwa claimed that everyone in the Politburo professed ignorance about the origins of the dossier, with the exception of Chiwengaleading to speculation that the Vice President is acting alone.\n\nHefurther suggested that the incident had served as a reminder to Chiwenga that he is merely a Presidential appointee and lacks independent powerandshould conduct himself accordingly.\n\nIt reminded the Presidium that you are appointees of the President like us. You have no powers as the Presidium. And it was one person among these Presidium members who was championing that document. All these other people were just being dragged along.\n\nThe Politburo asked who penned the document, do you accept the ownership individually? All other members of the Presidium said we dont know where it came from. So it zeroed in on the Vice President.\n\nChiwenga has consistentlyslammed corruption, describing it as a national security threat. He has also repeatedly warned those who amass wealth through unscrupulous means to watch their backs, suggesting that their day of reckoning is coming.\n\nThe individuals named in the dossier are alleged to be securing government tenders through corrupt practices. These allegations are not new, but their formal presentation within the Politburo has brought the issue to a head.\n\nFor instance, Chivayo previously defrauded ZESA of US$5 million in the Gwanda Solar Power project through his Intratek Company, and failed to deliver on the project.\n\nTagwirei has been linked to the over US$3 billion Command Agriculture scandal and is also implicated in the recent dossier alleging that approximately US$3.2 billion has been stolen from state coffers. Meanwhile, Paul Tungwarara secured a tender to drill 10,000 boreholes under the Presidential Borehole Drilling Scheme, but was recently criticised by Parliament for failing to deliver.\n\nThe government has acknowledged that it is losing US$2 billion annually due to corruption and illicit financial dealings, making the current accusations all the more damaging and increasing the pressure on Mnangagwa to take action.\n\n",
