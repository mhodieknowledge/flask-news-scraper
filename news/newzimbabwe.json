            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE Mutare High Court has dismissed an application by Rusape Town Council seeking to permanently bar a local resident from publicly criticising the municipality over its controversial tender processes.\n\nJustice Sijabuliso Siziba handed down the ruling on Thursday, discharging an interim interdict previously granted in March against Takudzwa Noel Mwashaenyi.The interdict had prohibited Mwashaenyi from posting or circulating materials on social media relating to a $850,000 tender awarded to Hurntspine Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd for the redevelopment of a municipal building into a modern shopping mall.The council, represented by Absalom & Shepherd Attorneys, accused Mwashaenyi of defamation, alleging that he had circulated false and damaging information on WhatsApp and email, claiming the tender process was corrupt, lacked transparency, and that the winning firm was unqualified.In response, Mwashaenyi, through his lawyer, Leonard Chigadza of the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) argued that his actions were protected under the constitutional right to freedom of expression.He insisted his comments constituted fair public criticism and were based on publicly available information.Justice Siziba ruled that, as a public body, Rusape Town Council had no legal standing to seek protection from reputational harm through a defamation interdict.A local authority like the applicant cannot be allowed to muzzle public criticism under the guise that its reputation is at stake, the judge wrote, citing both Zimbabwean and international case law emphasising the need for transparency and democratic accountability.The judge further noted that although some of Mwashaenyis claims were inaccurate and misinformed, including allegations about the non-existence of the developer and claims of improper payments, this did not justify limiting his freedom of expression.Being a public body and a State organ, a local authority is there to serve the public and it cannot therefore be allowed to sue for defamation to protect its own public image or pecuniary interests, the judgment read.There can be no doubt that the freedom of expression, coupled with the corollary right to receive and impart information, is a core value of any democratic society deserving of the utmost legal protection.As such, it is prominently recognised and entrenched in virtually every international and regional human rights instrument, Siziba noted.He added, This court too has had occasion to recognise the freedom of expression as a core value of a free and democratic society.The importance of the right to freedom of expression has often been stressed by our courts. Suppression of available information and of ideas can only be detrimental to the decision-making process of individuals, corporations and governments.It may lead to the wrong government being elected, the wrong policies being adopted, the wrong people being appointed, corruption, dishonesty and incompetence not being exposed, wrong investments being made and a multitude of other undesirable consequences.It is for this reason that it has been said that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and is one of the basic conditions for its progress and the development of man.He ruled, I am therefore convinced that the interdict sought by the applicant is not supported by the law. It is contrary to it. Its effect will be far reaching in curtailing the fundamental rights of the citizens to express themselves and freely monitor the activities of local authorities to the detriment of good governance and service delivery.On the basis of the above considerations, the application cannot succeed for lack of merit.The court dismissed all preliminary objections raised by both parties and made no order as to costs.\n\nJustice Sijabuliso Siziba handed down the ruling on Thursday, discharging an interim interdict previously granted in March against Takudzwa Noel Mwashaenyi.\n\nThe interdict had prohibited Mwashaenyi from posting or circulating materials on social media relating to a $850,000 tender awarded to Hurntspine Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd for the redevelopment of a municipal building into a modern shopping mall.The council, represented by Absalom & Shepherd Attorneys, accused Mwashaenyi of defamation, alleging that he had circulated false and damaging information on WhatsApp and email, claiming the tender process was corrupt, lacked transparency, and that the winning firm was unqualified.In response, Mwashaenyi, through his lawyer, Leonard Chigadza of the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) argued that his actions were protected under the constitutional right to freedom of expression.He insisted his comments constituted fair public criticism and were based on publicly available information.Justice Siziba ruled that, as a public body, Rusape Town Council had no legal standing to seek protection from reputational harm through a defamation interdict.A local authority like the applicant cannot be allowed to muzzle public criticism under the guise that its reputation is at stake, the judge wrote, citing both Zimbabwean and international case law emphasising the need for transparency and democratic accountability.The judge further noted that although some of Mwashaenyis claims were inaccurate and misinformed, including allegations about the non-existence of the developer and claims of improper payments, this did not justify limiting his freedom of expression.Being a public body and a State organ, a local authority is there to serve the public and it cannot therefore be allowed to sue for defamation to protect its own public image or pecuniary interests, the judgment read.There can be no doubt that the freedom of expression, coupled with the corollary right to receive and impart information, is a core value of any democratic society deserving of the utmost legal protection.As such, it is prominently recognised and entrenched in virtually every international and regional human rights instrument, Siziba noted.He added, This court too has had occasion to recognise the freedom of expression as a core value of a free and democratic society.The importance of the right to freedom of expression has often been stressed by our courts.

She was married off for groceries and a few blankets.\n\nThese girls wanted to be teachers, nurses and to be Members of Parliament. Instead, they are burdened by early pregnancies and unpaid work, Murombedzi said.\n\nEvery climate disaster resets families to survival mode, where girls are the first to be sacrificed.\n\nMurombedzi also urged Parliament to find ways to mitigate the climate change crisis as a way to save young girls from child marriages.\n\nWe must also recognise that climate change has become a threat multiplier that fuels child marriages in Zimbabwe and across Africa.\n\nClimate change is not just an environmental crisis, it is a social and gendered crisis.\n\nIn seasons of drought when crops fail and livestock die, many families are pushed deeper into desperation, parents facing hunger and unable to pay school fees and are often seen marrying off their daughter as a coping mechanism to reduce households mouth to feed or to obtain a bride price for survival.\n\nTo break this cycle, we must act on several fronts. We have to strengthen the enforcement of the law.\n\nUnless we tackle the climate crisis and build resilience in our communities, through irrigation schemes, drought-resistant crops and social safety nets, our efforts to end child marriage will be undermined, Murombedzi said.\n\nAccording to the government, last year over 3,400 girls were forced out of school as a result of early marriages and adolescent pregnancies.\n\n",

The biggest thing is the economic issues and improving general welfare of Zimbabweans.\n\nThe performance of the economy is important because this creates the bond upon which Zanu PF continues to rule. It promised Zimbabweans of freedom, an army to defend themselves, independence, national consolidation and preservation of that independence, it promised people a modern economy and it is giving them.\n\nIt promised people their own national currency, it has given them. It has promised people more regional integration with our neighbours, it is giving them. This is the record which Zanu PF stands upon and not the cupping by detractors from left, right centre, Mutsvangwa said.\n\nHe explained that Zanu PF wanted to tick every box of the previous year and see how far the government had gone in achieving those benchmarks during the Manicaland indaba.\n\nHe commended the people of Manicaland whom he said, played a big role in terms of training the guerrillas during the liberation war.\n\nHe, however, blasted those outside Zanu PF for trying to bring in trivial succession issues due to their hatred of party First Secretary and President.\n\nHe alluded to party resolutions which were passed in Bulawayo in the previous conference where a resolution for President Mnangagwa to go beyond 2028 up to 2030 was passed amongst several others.\n\nWe are in the season of our conference. The dates are October 13 to 18, 2025. We are hardly two months away from the party conference.\n\nThis is an important event on the calendar of the party. The last one was held in Bulawayo.\n\nResolutions were passed including the one on 2030 and the President being the candidate for 2030. I know the President has said he is a constitutionalist; he is not prepared to go beyond 2028 when his constitutional mandate ends.\n\nSo, this is what will be decided at the party conference, leadership of the party and the future of the party. We are only two years away from the big party conference (Congress) where party leadership issues are going to be resolved, Mutsvangwa said.\n\nFurther, the Zanu PF Information secretary said it was democratic for people in the party to decide for him.\n\nHe casticated those wishing to see him go at the end of his constitutional mandate telling them off.\n\nIf you see a President who is performing so well. Some people are so excited about his performance and are saying the Constitution may say one thing, but the Constitution is a product of the people.\n\nWe would like you to continue and if it means that, we look at our Constitution to so facilitate. It is their democratic dispensation and volution to think like that and there is absolutely nothing wrong for them to think like that, Mutsvangwa highlighted.\n\nHe continued, So for people to continue to make an issue about it to say, should people think somebody whom they like should continue in power. Not its misplaced. You can also have your opinion why he shouldnt continue.\n\nYou keep your opinion but you are not a member of Zanu PF. If you are a member of Zanu PF, you can profer your views at the conference.\n\nIf you have your views and you are not a member of Zanu PF, you are not part of the club, so do not try dictate whilst outside the party, join the party and you can come to the conference with your views as a member and try to canvas your views with membership, added Mutsvangwa.\n\nMusvangwa reminded those joining the party to abide by its Constitution.\n\nMake sure that if you join the club and proffer your views, you will also be ready to accept the outcome of the majority in the party, should your views not carry the day.\n\nZanu PF is a democratic party. People have their views, and they give them in their resolutions and express them. The consummation of those ideas is another issue. It takes two; those who are advocating and those whose advocacy is targeted at, i.e. the President.\n\nThose are the people who matter in this debate. Anybody else, is by and large, irrelevant.\n\nHe revealed that.for a long time, some people did not want President Mnangagwa to be the President of the party.\n\nFor a long time, they did not want him to be the leader of the party. For a long time after he became the President of the country and leader of the party, they wanted to remove him. That is why sanctions were kept, that is why there has been a persistent debate about succession, not to state that the man is too busy running a modern economy.\n\nThat is where the attention should be but, those who are detractors cannot get out of their mindset that he should be out of power. Zanu PF is too busy modernising Zimbabwe and we members are too busy appreciating the leadership which is there.\n\n",
