            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nMining activities in several communities have taken a disturbing turn, with foreign investors accused of displacing villagers, disrupting livelihoods, and failing to compensate affected families or rehabilitate damaged land, Mashonaland East Senator Chief Chikwaka has warned.\n\nSpeaking in the Senate recently, Goromonzis Chief Chikwaka said that while Zimbabwe remains open for business, some foreign miners were wreaking havoc in the communities where they operate.\n\nWhat is government policy regarding the allocation of licences where you find miners displacing local communities? This is affecting peoples livelihoods. You would find that people are just relocated without improving their livelihoods.\n\nWhat is the government policy in terms of people who are being displaced by mining activities, where you find, them being relocated to areas which are not conducive? he said.\n\nHis concerns come just two months after President Emmerson Mnangagwa directed Parliament to expedite the long-overdue Mines and Minerals Bill to address ongoing disputes between miners, farmers, and communities.\n\nResponding to the issue, Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister responsible for Oil and Gas Research and other Strategic Minerals Exploration, Caleb Makwiranzou, acknowledged the challenges.\n\nThe Deputy Minister said, Before giving permission to miners, we require a report, which is called the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is a report, which looks at the community which is going to be affected, and where they are going to be relocated. If they going to receive houses where they are going to be relocated, then after getting that report, that is where we allow mining companies to go ahead.\n\nMakwiranzou also highlighted provisions in the new law.\n\nI want to inform this House that the new law [H. B. 1, 2025] allows that if someone has their field or their farm and there is a need for mining to be done in that field, that person is given the first option. The person is asked whether they allow the miners, and then they can discuss with whoever wants to mine if there is an allocation of shares. The person can then be given shares.\n\nOn the other hand, if that person is to be relocated, it should be consensual. They must give consent because the previous law was causing disputes where there was conflict between the Minerals Act and the Agricultural Act, said Makwiranzou.\n\nHowever, Chief Chikwaka argued that, in reality, no environmental impact assessments were being conducted before mining begins.\n\nThere is no Environmental Impact Assessment, which is being done. You would find that miners are just coming into the community. They start drilling in peoples fields. They start mining and excavating in peoples fields and leave such fields open.\n\nThey do not cover the pits and the original farmer cannot farm on his land because there are pits. There is a need for consultation with stakeholders, Chief Chikwaka said.\n\nMakwiranzou stressed that operating without an EIA is illegal, adding that government would send inspectors to the affected communities and block the mining activities.\n\n",

Among them is HC 2312/24  Collin Zondai Makoni vs The State, which the writer says came [before] Justice Munangati despite the fact that it was from her law firm, involving lawyers Skumbuzo Mpofu and Skyvaine Vongai Tendere. This matter is pending decision pronouncement, the letter notes.\n\nThe whistle-blower also cites Thelma Chimbanga vs L Gono Enterprises (HC 1518/24), which they say was heard by the same judge despite originating from the same law firm, and is still awaiting a set down.\n\nAnother flagged case is Blue Star Logistics vs Harare Motorways (HC 8108/24), where Thabani Mpofu is representing the Applicant, with the author adding: I believe this anomaly is being overlooked since Thabani Mpofu and Webster Chiikwanha are the best of friends.\n\nThe author insists that Justice Munangati Manongwa should not hear any matters instructed to Advocate Mpofu by Munangati and Associates legal practitioners, urging ZACC to intervene because these allegations, which are very serious in nature be investigated so as to avoid prejudice to other litigants.\n\nThe writer further notes that this is not their first complaint to ZACC: Kindly note that I once wrote to your good office again on the 24th of June 2024.\n\n",

Stability for beyond one year is crucial for the market to accept a mono-currency arrangement,  he said.\n\nThe Reserve Bank attributes the increase to several factors, including:\n\nGold reserves currently stand at around 3.5 tonnes, and the authorities say the country has benefited from the global gold price rally.\n\nZimbabwe also continues to accumulate reserves through the foreign-currency surrender system, in which exporters convert part of their earnings into local currency.\n\nAt the rate we are accumulating these reserves, it is quite encouraging. Our exports are increasing, and this is what funds reserve accumulation.\n\nHowever, they cautioned that beyond building reserves, confidence in the ZiG and broader economic performance will determine the success of the 2030 single-currency target.\n\nOur economy has been performing to expectations, and in some cases exceeding expectations, despite external shocks. But stability remains the foundation for trust in the currency, Gwanyanya said.\n\n",

That contrasts with the ZSE  long a haven for investors during bouts of high inflation  which is slightly lower.\n\nThe VFEX has been the standout performer, with market capitalisation rising over 40% year to date, the Harare-based brokerage said in its latest equity report, attributing the strong performance to gold-linked and consumer-facing stocks.\n\nLiquidity on the VFEX has also improved significantly, the brokerage added. With average daily turnover up 197% from the prior year, reflecting deepening participation by both institutional and retail investors.\n\nThe main exchange in Harare has borne the brunt of a yearlong liquidity squeeze thats been in place since the 43% devaluation of the ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, last September.\n\nTrading on the ZSE has slumped, and IH Securities expects the slowdown will continue to suppress stock market activity.\n\n",
