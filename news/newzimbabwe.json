The stadium pressure has not completely eased off, if you look at a situation like in Harare alone we have six clubs based in and around Harare, probably they will share two stadiums at the moment.\n\nLook, six teams sharing two facilities is not ideal, Thabe said.\n\nThe giant National Sports Stadiums facelift is expected to be completed before June and ease the pressure.\n\nOther than relying on the giant facilitys completion, newcomers MWOS are already renovating Ngoni Stadium in Norton, which is also expected to meet the required local PSL standards by mid year.\n\nScottland FC, on the other end, have embarked on a mission to uplift Mabvuku Stadium, which will hopefully be completed soon.\n\nI understand MWOS FC are working through midnight hours just to get their stadium ready.\n\nSo, from an inspection point of view we are looking to have most stadiums homologated and make sure that when the league kicks off it will not be a fixture congested season.\n\nWe will be able to divide what will be available, added Thabe.\n\n",

The extraordinary two-day event is set to take place from April 25 to 26, 2025, at The Westin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, concluding with a social golf tournament for attendees and exhibitors held on April 27th. Seeff Zimbabwe is one of the leading real estate businesses in Zimbabwe that has a presence in the SADC region.\n\nA Gathering of Minds and Opportunities\n\nThe Property Showcase aims to bridge the gap between property businesses in Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwean community in North America, addressing the challenges faced by the diaspora in managing and investing in properties from a distance. With alarming tales of lost investments and many more horror stories due to unreliable agencies and family members, this event strives to provide trustworthy solutions and promote investment back into Zimbabwe through real estate.\n\nWe are really excited that we can bring the real estate industry to North America to engage in productive dialogue with Zimbabweans and start the process of rebuilding relationships with that market, ensuring that we create a safe environment for them to invest in Zimbabwe. After the spectacular success of the UK Showcase we are expecting a similar result as the industry is now fully focused on creating diaspora-friendly products for those markets, the Managing Director for Seeff Zimbabwe Patience Patongamoyo said.\n\nEngage, Learn, and Network\n\nParticipants will have the opportunity to interact with exhibitors, including leading developers, financial institutions, conveyancers, suppliers, property consultants, and many other real estate stakeholders. Many companies have already started registering their attendance and we will expect over 40 to showcase their products and services in April 2025. The event will include panel discussions, presentations by property experts, and networking opportunities, all aimed at empowering Zimbabweans in the USA and Canada to invest confidently in their homeland.\n\nFor those looking to exhibit or to attend please sign up by connecting with the event organizers atwww.zimpropertyshowcaseusa.com.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nTHE African Energy Chamber (AEC)as the voice of the African energy sectorhas long advocated for a multi-energy approach in Africa, whereby investments in multiple energy sources fuel industrialisation and electrification.\n\nWith 600 million people currently living without access to electricity and 900 million lacking access to clean cooking solutions, the continent requires all of its energy resources to address its energy crisis.\n\nYet, organisations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) continue to perpetuate the myth that Africa can meet its energy needs without oil and gas. While an immediate shift to renewable energy may work in Western nations, this approach is not feasible in Africa. As such, the AEC is calling for an end to anti-fossil fuel narratives on the continent.\n\nSimilar calls were heard at the 15th IEA-IEF-Opec Symposium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where Tommy Joyce, acting assistant secretary for International Affairs at the US Department of Energy, spoke passionately about oil and gas and their role in combating energy poverty in Africa.\n\nThe AECs executive chairman, NJ Ayuk, participated in the Symposium, underscoring the need for an Africa-centric approach to energy development. Other attendees included Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, Saudi Arabias Minister of Energy; Haitham Al-Ghais, OPEC Secretary General; Jassim Al Shirawi, Secretary General of the International Energy Forum; Keisuke Sadamori, director of energy markets and security at the International Energy Agency; and US representatives.\n\nAfrica cannot adopt the same model as western nations in its energy transition, or the continent risks falling deeper into energy poverty. Given its reliance on oil and gas, its lack of requisite infrastructure to rapidly transition to renewable energy, its growing population, and its differentiated and complex energy needs, this approach would only exacerbate its crisis.\n\nSouth Africa, for example, Africas largest economy, relies on coal for 72% of its electricity. Operational challenges at its coal-fired generation facilities in recent years have plunged the country into an energy crisis, with load shedding impacting businesses, industries, and economic activity.\n\nYet, South Africa, like many of its regional neighbours, holds the promise of a clean and affordable power generation solution: natural gas.\n\nNatural gas has been dubbed the fuel of the future in Africa. With more than 620trillion cubic feet (tcf) of proven resources and a significant portion of the continents basins still underexplored, gas monetisation stands to power Africas economies, offering a low-cost, low-carbon energy solution.\n\nGas-to-power projects would address the very energy crisis that has impacted economic growth for years. They would also enable exports to regional neighbours such as Zimbabwe, which also grapple with inadequate energy supply.\n\nYet, the IEA has called for an end to new gas projects, citing the need to prioritise renewable energy utilisation over this widely available resource. The organisation has claimed that existing oil and gas fields are more than sufficient, yet reality tells a vastly different story. One cannot look at South Africa and believe this to be true.\n\nThe same can be said for Mozambique, which has been a regional leader in renewable energy through its hydropower projects. Yet, only 40% of the country has access to electricity. Recent discoveries have placed Mozambiques gas resources at upwards of 100 tcf, with major upcoming LNG developments offering a strategic opportunity for the country to boost domestic electrification.\n\nAn integrated and diverse energy mix would work well in Mozambique, just as it would in Angola, Tanzania, Senegal, Mauritania, the Republic of Congo, and many more African nations.\n\nFundamentally, African countries are best positioned to address their own complex energy needs. While oil and gas may be considered dirty words in Paris, London, or New York, hydrocarbons present cleaner alternatives to the solid biomass and kerosene that 85% of Africans use to cook their food today.\n\nTo help end energy poverty in Africa, global institutions like the IEA must cease perpetuating the myth that Africa can meet its populations needs without fossil fuels or can afford to sacrifice economic development for externally imposed climate goals.\n\nEurope, the United States, and China have made incredible strides in addressing malnutrition, life expectancy, and disease by powering economic growth with uninhibited access to coal, oil, and natural gas. Why cant we? said NJ Ayuk, executive chairman of the AEC, referencing the Symposium.\n\n",

When it arrived, Talent went outside to put their hospital bag in the car.\n\nAs he returned to help his wife into the car, a group of eight men attacked him. Tresadern said they beat him, before stabbing him in the head, stomach and chest. They then fled with his phone and the hospital bag.\n\nLillian, who was struggling with labour pains, struggled down the stairs to find her husband lying in a pool of blood.\n\nShe gave birth to a baby girl right next to her husband. He passed away a few seconds after [his daughter] was born, Tresadern said.\n\nTresadern said she met Talent five years ago when he was selling pumpkins.\n\nThe couple were originally from Zimbabwe and the newborn baby, who has been named after her father, was their third child. According to Tresadern, the family were to return home in April after securing funds to open a hardware store and welding business.\n\nABackaBuddycampaign has been started to raise funds for Lillian to return home and bury her husband. The campaign was started by Jeannie Ross, who says she met Lilian about five years ago when she hired her as a domestic worker.\n\nSince then, Ross says, she and Lilian had become friends.\n\nLilian now faces an unimaginable road ahead, raising three children without the man who was her anchor, Ross said in her BackaBuddy post.\n\nThe target the campaign is aiming for is R35 000. At the time of publishing, R34 770 had been donated.\n\nWhen contacted for comment on Friday morning, the police in the Western Cape said they were unaware of the incident.\n\n",

Some may experience immediate healing and transformation, while others may struggle with spiritual ailments that hinder their growth.\n\nAs Jesus taught, Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven (Matthew 7:21 AMP).\n\nThese words remind us that mere profession of faith is not enough; we must also demonstrate our commitment to Gods will through our actions and obedience.\n\nUnfortunately, the church can sometimes be contaminated by poisonous attitudes and behaviors, such as gossip, distractions, hatred, anxiety, jealousy, and unforgiveness. These spiritual toxins can spread quickly, causing harm to others and hindering the healing process.\n\nAs believers, we have a responsibility to create a safe and nurturing environment within the church, where everyone can receive the spiritual care and support they need.\n\nLet us strive to eliminate the mortality rate among fellow believers by promoting a culture of love, forgiveness, and encouragement.\n\nAs Galatians 6:2 reminds us, Carry each others burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.

May we be a hospital for the soul, where the wounded and broken can find healing and restoration.\n\nWe pray against the spiritual toxins that can contaminate our church, such as gossip, hatred, and unforgiveness. May we be a people of love, forgiveness, and encouragement, bearing one anothers burdens and supporting each others spiritual journeys.\n\nMay our church be a shining light in our community, a beacon of hope and love that draws people to You.

The sad thing is the long term om girls mental and physical health is severe.\n\nAs a way to combat the challenge, Koshesa Mwanasikana has put it upon its shoulders to donate all required materials for the sewing of reusable sanitary pads.\n\nAimed to target primary and secondary school girls around Checheche -Chipinge, the organisation will on March 8, 2025, host a netball tournament to drive their campaign focusing on combating period poverty.\n\nWe are supplying the volunteers with materials to sew re-usable pads which we will donate to young girls and women in marginalised communities around Checheche and Chipinge.\n\nOn the day, we will host a netball tournament using sport as a tool to drive our message and also creating a platform to have these girls in one place, explained Tariro Mutsengi ,a project coordinator for Koshesa Mwanasikana fight period poverty campaign manager.\n\nA study conducted in Malawi in 2024 revealed that the majority of female sport players struggle with period poverty.\n\nZimbabwe is no exception as the same plight is even affecting netball players progress especially those who play for teams in marginalised areas.\n\nA number of players usually miss games during the time of their cycle and usually some find it hard to participate but as a club we always try to make efforts to make sure we provide these pads for players, said Green Fuel netball team chairperson, Kuzivakwashe Mtazu.\n\nOther than just mitigating the period poverty challenge, the re-usable sanitary pads being sewn by Chenjerai and friends are flexible and can enable one to engage in any activity, which is an advantage to young girls in sport.\n\nRe-usable sanitary pads have become an escape plan for young girls in rural communities since they cannot afford sanitary pads which, on average, a pack costs more than a dollar.\n\n",

And he has again a situation to score, and it was not today, but every time he appears there he has a chance to score, Pereira said via Wolves official website.\n\nBut what I like in this player is the guy is the player that can miss a goal in the opponents box and then after 30 seconds, he is defending in our box.\n\nThis is what we wanted when we look for him. We wanted to find a physical midfielder who can support the other two midfielders.\n\nMunetsi must improve in one key area at Wolves\n\nMunetsi is different in profile to the likes of Andre and Gomes, offering a more physically imposing build and a greater attacking threat.\n\nThe Zimbabwe star capped off his debut with an assist for Cunhas strike but should have got on the scoresheet himself, shooting wide of the target in the second half despite being right in front of the goal.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nINFORMATION and Communication Technology (ICT) Minister Tatenda Mavetera is facing a barrage of criticism regarding her alleged fabricated academic credentials, including a Doctorate in Philosophy (PhD).\n\nThe allegations were recently brought to light by Dug Up, a platform run by United Kingdom-based Zimbabwean investigative journalist Maynard Manyowa, who exposed the controversial founder and leader of Young Women for ED.Social media platform X, formerly Twitter, erupted early Saturday, with users mercilessly ridiculing Mavetera for what they perceive as a charade, following her attempts to defend herself against claims surrounding a purported PhD award that was revoked by the High Court of Zimbabwe last year.Mavetera appeared to be all at sea as she struggled to articulate her position on her current PhD studies at Midlands State University (MSU), failing to speak coherently.One X account, under the name Tawanda Mupindu, challenged Mavetera to address the rumours of her possessing a fake PhD, which Mavetera denied.I am at the early stages of attaining one. I finished my taught courses two years ago and am now working on my proposal, Mavetera wrote on her X account Saturday.However, former Mt Pleasant Member of Parliament and renowned lawyer, Fadzayi Mahere, took Mavetera to task, demanding an explanation as to how she intends to complete a doctorate in nine months.She also questioned why it has taken her six years to reach the proposal stage.If you are telling the truth in your tweet, why have you been at the proposal stage of your PhD dissertation for six years? Why has it taken you six years to get started? Why are you failing to even complete chapter one, an introductory chapter?When did you get accepted to do a PhD at MSU? How did you get a PhD place without a substantive research proposal? Who is your thesis supervisor?Your LinkedIn page further states you will have completed your PhD by November 2025.How do you plan to complete a whole PhD in nine months if youve taken over six years to put together a research proposal? How will you balance this onerous academic burden with your role as a Cabinet minister, a Member of Parliament, and a senior party official?Mavetera replied:Covid and teething problems since it was a new course for Midlands State affected us. We started with 2 years taught courses. Proposal presentation started effectively last year. I did my part and personally went to present mine so we await the Higher degrees committee decision.Mavetera also refuted claims by Dug Up that she paid an unnamed academic in Mutare to complete her PhD work on her behalf.I wish I knew this person. Unfortunately, there is no name provided. Even to suggest that this person communicates with my supervisor, which institution in this world would allow such a thing? I am a public figure. Who would claim to be me, if they were not? I have not even started chapter one, so what would be the point of such deception? she stated.Mavetera also denied allegations that she lacks the five Ordinary Level subjects required for university enrolment, a claim she vehemently dismissed as false, arguing that she could not have been enrolled at MSU, where she claims to be pursuing her PhD programme.How does one get enrolled at a reputable university like MSU without those qualifications? For your information, I was Student Representative Council President at Womens University in 2014. I was a class representative in 2016 at MSU while undertaking my strategic marketing masters, so everyone from my class would know me, she explained.Mahere again laid into Mavetera, urging her to refrain from using the title Dr.In the circumstances, can you agree that there is no lawful basis at this stage for you to present yourself as a Dr.? Can you understand why we are surprised that as recently as yesterday, your ministry was still using this title in relation to you?In 2022, Mavetera was jubilant, announcing that she had been awarded a Doctorate of Humane Letters from the International Institute of Philanthropy (IIP).However, the Doctorates of Humane Letters issued by the IPP were officially revoked and withdrawn by the High Court of Zimbabwe in July of last year. Despite this, the government and her ministry continue to refer to Mavetera as Dr.This year, Shackmore Wellington Timburwa, another Zanu PF activist and Chegutu West Member of Parliament, was exposed as not holding a PhD in International Relations from the University of South Africa (UNISA), contrary to his claims on LinkedIn dating back to 2023.This year, yet another Zanu PF apologist, Prophet Walter Magaya, who was also a contestant for Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) presidency, was exposed for claiming a fake degree from the UNISA.Magaya had approached the High Court to challenge his disqualification from contesting as ZIFA president, a move resulting from his failure to produce an O-Level certificate with at least five subject passes.\n\nThe allegations were recently brought to light by Dug Up, a platform run by United Kingdom-based Zimbabwean investigative journalist Maynard Manyowa, who exposed the controversial founder and leader of Young Women for ED.\n\nSocial media platform X, formerly Twitter, erupted early Saturday, with users mercilessly ridiculing Mavetera for what they perceive as a charade, following her attempts to defend herself against claims surrounding a purported PhD award that was revoked by the High Court of Zimbabwe last year.Mavetera appeared to be all at sea as she struggled to articulate her position on her current PhD studies at Midlands State University (MSU), failing to speak coherently.One X account, under the name Tawanda Mupindu, challenged Mavetera to address the rumours of her possessing a fake PhD, which Mavetera denied.I am at the early stages of attaining one.

            "content": "By BBC\n\nA STATUE of late Pope John Paul II stands outside the Gemelli Hospital where Pope Francis is receiving medical treatment.\n\nOutside the Gemelli Hospital in Rome stands a large statue of one of its most famous patients, Pope John Paul II.\n\nMade of white Carrara marble, it depicts the pontiff in his later years, stooping and clutching a crucifix, his brow furrowed in pain.\n\nDoctors at the Gemelli hospital helped save John Pauls life, after he was shot in a failed assassination attempt in St Peters Square in May 1981. He underwent a six-hour operation to remove a bullet from his abdomen.\n\nIt was the first time a Pope had been treated at Romes largest hospital.\n\nAmong the hospitals current patients is Pope Francis, who was admitted last week with a respiratory infection. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs.\n\nOver the course of his 25 year-long pontificate, John Paul was admitted around 10 times, sometimes for prolonged stays. He received treatment for various illnesses, including a benign intestinal tumour, a broken hip and a tracheotomy, when his Parkinsons disease was at an advanced stage.\n\nThe Gemelli, which is a Catholic teaching hospital, opened in the 1960s. With more than 1500 beds, it is one of the biggest private hospitals in Europe.\n\nBuilt on land donated by Pope Pius XI to the theologian and physician Agostino Gemelli in 1934, it has become known as the Popes Hospital. John Paul II even nicknamed it Vatican Three, with St Peters Square being Vatican One, and the papal residence at Castel Gandolfo, Vatican Two.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Gemelli set up a special Papal suite, which is still in use today.\n\nIts a small apartment on the tenth floor, an all-white suite with austere, simple furnishings. As well as the bedroom and bathroom, there is a living room, with a sofa bed for his aides and a chapel with a kneeler and a large crucifix, where the Pope can attend or celebrate mass and say prayers.\n\nThe long access corridor, leading to the suite is guarded by Italian State Police, the Vatican Gendarmerie and hospital security.\n\nThe Papal suite is reserved for popes, but other patients are treated on the same floor.\n\nTheres a balcony where the Pope can appear to greet the faithful and say the weekly Angelus prayer.\n\nWell-wishers often gather in the square outside the hospital to pray for the health of the pontiff. Flowers, cards, photos and candles are often laid at the foot of the statue of John Paul II.\n\nPope Francis has been treated at the Gemelli several times.\n\n",
