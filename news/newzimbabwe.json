            "content": "IOL\n\nA Political analyst has said Julius Malemas call for Zimbabweans in South Africa to seek employment in their home country signals a policy shift to align the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with the aspirations and interests of the majority of South Africans.\n\nAddressing supporters at an EFF rally in Seshego, Limpopo, over the weekend, Malemastressed that South Africans must be prioritised for job opportunities, particularly within local municipalities.\n\nMalema emphasised that while Zimbabweans are welcome in South Africa, it is unjust for locals to be sidelined in their communities.\n\nWhen we say we want jobs where we pay for services, we are not saying we dont want Zimbabweans. We are saying we should be given first preference before everyone else to get jobs,Malema said.\n\nWe dont disagree that Zimbabweans should be given jobs, but they should be given jobs in their municipalities in Harare and other areas, so we have opportunities to get jobs in our municipalities.\n\nMalemasremarks come amid ongoing controversy in the Polokwane Municipality, where Mayor John Mpe has been accused of awarding tenders to foreign-owned companies, including one allegedly linked to a Zimbabwean partner of municipal manager Thuso Nemugumoni.\n\nMpe denied the allegations and defended the municipalitys procurement processes, stating that there is nothing unlawful about awarding tenders to foreign-owned companies if they comply with the law.\n\nKenneth Mokgatlhe, a political analyst and commentator, weighed in on the apparent EFF policy shift: Although this is not the first time Malema made similar remarks regarding the Zimbabwean question, this was the most direct address from him to them. In the past, he would tell them to go and vote to fix their situation.\n\nHe and his party had previously claimed that foreigners are not really stealing jobs from South Africans. We now know from [former EFF deputy Floyd] Shivambu that Malema did not engage his fellow executives on the immigration policy, which was responsible for their electoral decline in the past general elections.\n\nMokgatlhe said that there were now more voices which many disgruntled South Africans are associating with against illegal immigration.\n\nFor you to stay relevant and speak to the issues affecting the electorate, you have to tell them what they want to hear. He knows that he fumbled, but his ego wont let him come to the public and acknowledge weakness on his side, Mokgatlhe said.\n\nHe would rather silently make a policy shift to align his party with the aspirations and interests of the majority of South Africans. The EFF will not afford to ignore or speak against its citizens because immigration is one of the immediate global challenges for most countries that are stable in the world.\n\nHowever, Malema insisted that government projects funded by taxpayers must benefit South Africans first.\n\nHis comments take on greater significance against the backdrop of South Africas staggering youth unemployment crisis.\n\nAccording to recent statistics, 62.4% of young people aged 15 to 24 are unemployed, with the broader youth unemployment rate for those aged 15 to 34 sitting at 46.1%. For the 25 to 34 age group, the unemployment rate is 40.4%.\n\nThese figures, which have steadily worsened over the past decade, have raised alarms among economists and labour experts, who warn that the country is facing a generation excluded from economic participation.\n\nMalema said that it is unacceptable for South Africans to remain jobless while foreign nationals receive tenders and employment through municipal structures. He urged communities to resist and question such decisions and to demand accountability from local leaders.\n\nHis latest comments signal a shift from his earlier stance on foreign nationals and open border policy.\n\nIn 2022, Malema had defended the right of Zimbabweans to work in South Africa, while still calling for locals to be prioritised.\n\nWe want Zimbabweans to work in SA. They should make no apologies about hiring Zimbabweans or any other African brother or sister. But they must be considerate that there are locals who must at all times be given preference, he said at the time.\n\nIn previous years, Malema has also spoken out against xenophobia and expressed support for Pan-African unity.\n\nDuring a Heritage Day address in 2022, he urged South Africans not to discriminate against Zimbabweans or other African migrants.\n\nWe must never speak about heritage but refuse to want Zimbabweans or any person from another African country. You will see a Zimbabwean and see an African  this is my brother, this is my sister, he said.\n\nHe also encouraged Zimbabwean nationals in South Africa to participate in their countrys democratic process, even offering buses to transport them home to vote. Malema went as far as urging Zimbabweans to vote out the ruling ZANU-PF party, which he accused of plunging the country into economic ruin.\n\nHowever, another political commentator, Anda Mbikwana, cautioned: While political leaders often express their views within the broader context of national policy and sovereignty, such statements must be approached with both sensitivity and a commitment to regional unity.\n\nMigration across our borders is a complex issue, rooted in economic, social, and historical dynamics that require thoughtful, humane, and collaborative solutions, Mbikwana said.\n\nAny discourse on the matter should avoid fuelling division or xenophobia and instead focus on sustainable development, mutual support, and inclusive growth across the region.\n\n",

The absence of law enforcement has turned bus ranks into zones of terror. Women and girls are no longer safe. The governments efforts to curb tout activity remain inconsistent and ineffective.\n\n",

Asked if she admitted that death would result, she responded: Yes The child died.\n\nThe trial magistrate sentenced her to 12 months in prison, of which four were suspended for good behaviour. The remaining eight months were wholly suspended on condition she performed 280 hours of community service at Sunge Police Station.\n\nHowever, during routine scrutiny, the Regional Magistrate raised concerns over inconsistencies between the charge sheet and the state outline.\n\nThe charge sheet stated the child had been left unwrapped, while the outline erroneously recorded that the baby had been wrapped.\n\nHe also highlighted that the post-mortem listed the cause of death as indeterminate, questioning whether the child had been born alive.\n\nI am of the view that it is not clear if she gave birth to a live baby and hence should have been charged with concealment, the Regional Magistrate wrote in referring the case for review.\n\nForoma, however, found that the contradiction stemmed from a clerical omission  the word not had been dropped in the state outline.\n\nHad the scrutinising Magistrate read in between the lines, the reason for the contradiction would have become apparent, he ruled.\n\nThe High Court further held that the accuseds mental state and circumstances  central to the charge of infanticide under Section 48(3)  were canvassed adequately during sentencing.\n\nForoma concluded: It is clear that the proceedings under review were conducted in a manner that resulted in real and substantial justice being achieved. I confirm that the proceedings were conducted in a manner that ensured the achievement of real and substantial justice.\n\n",

            "content": "The Voice\n\nAMBITIOUS refugee Tawanda Muyeye is now a star of The Hundred. In early 2021, months before signing his professional contract with Kent Cricket, Tawanda had his right to remain in the United Kingdom approved by the Home Office.\n\nBorn and bred in Zimbabwe, Tawanda moved to England at the age of 17 and attended Eastbourne College on a cricket scholarship, while spending some time with the Sussex Academy.\n\nNow a batter for Kent Cricket and the Oval Invincibles, Tawanda is set to compete at The Hundred, where he will be one of the few Black players at the tournament.\n\nFor me to be a Black player, playing cricket in England, it just shows that there are no boundaries, Tawanda toldThe Voice.\n\nIf you have dreams, you can achieve them. The colour of your skin doesnt matter. Of course, therell be hurdles along the way, but I think being a player of colour and being a representative is quite a big thing because it just shows that anything is possible.\n\nWhile his professional career began in England, Tawandas love for cricket was born in Zimbabwe when he was just a child.\n\nFor me to be a Black player, playing cricket in England, it just shows that there are no boundaries\n\nMy brother was the person who got me into cricket. On the weekends, when hed come back home from boarding school, I would play cricket with him. Thats how it all started.\n\nIn the High School that I attended, theyd just built a high performance cricket centre, which is unheard of in Zimbabwe, unless youre playing for the national team.\n\nThere werent many high performance centres, especially not in schools, so that was a massive thing, and I spent a lot of my time in there.\n\nWhen I moved to England, I think the biggest change was the weather! Goodness, I found that change difficult, even in April, May, it was still quite chilly for a Zimbabwean kid.\n\nTawanda made a big impression during his time at Eastbourne College. His runs led him to be namedWisdensSchools Cricketer of the Year for 2020, and Kent took notice.\n\nKent are a big reason Im where I am today. They had to jump through some hurdles to get me to this point because Im a refugee, and my family are refugees.\n\nThere was a man named Paul Downton, he was the Director of Cricket at Kent, and he went out of his way to help me. Kent gave me the opportunity to grow and develop as a player, and theyve given me the platform to showcase what I can do.\n\nLooking back four years later, Im just very grateful for Kent and everything theyve done for me.\n\nIve just signed a new contract with them, and I want to give them a shoutout because it wasnt easy for them initially, but they made my life easier and treated me like a normal person and welcomed me with open arms.\n\nTawanda has achieved so much already, and it is the 24-year-olds mindset which keeps him moving forward.\n\nFor me, its about striving to be the best that I can be, not comparing myself to others, because I believe comparison is the thief of all joy.\n\nWhen you get into the professional game, it becomes a bit more complex, and the transition isnt easy. However, I think because I have that desire to be the best that I can be, it keeps me going and keeps me motivated to achieve my goals.\n\nMy main aspiration is to play cricket for England, to play as many Test matches as I can for England. However, I dont just want to play for England once, I want to play for a long time and be good enough to achieve that goal.\n\nKent had to jump through some hurdles to get me to this point because Im a refugee, and my family are refugees.\n\nWhile his focus is on cricket, Tawanda hopes he is remembered for so much more than just the sport. When I do finish playing cricket, I hope people remember me as a person first and foremost, because Im a human being. I go through everything that every other human being goes through.\n\nI dont want people to put me on a pedestal, because no one is bigger than anyone or bigger than the sport. If people are to think about me when I finish playing, I just want them to think that I was entertaining, and a fun person to watch.\n\nI just want to be myself, go out there, be free and play with a smile on my face and inspire people to have fun with what theyre doing.\n\n",

Noor, said EMA only released the ESIA after a court order, but it was the same flawed report initially rejected.\n\nShuntai managed to wangle an ESIA certificate from EMA, suggesting they had addressed stakeholder concerns, of which they had not, Noor said.\n\nThe school has now appealed to parents to stand firm as the legal battle escalates.\n\nWe are not yet out of the woods as Shuntai is determined to proceed even against the ruling of the High Court of Zimbabwe, Noor warned. Forty-three years ago, parents came together to build this school, and today we are appealing for parents to stand united to defend it.\n\nThe dispute now awaits a decisive hearing before the Administrative Court and the Minister of Environment, but with construction still underway, Bryden says children remain at risk.\n\nIn the meantime, massive building has continued on site, and the school has been experiencing increased dust influx as well as fumes from burning of noxious material, as well as noise of heavy machinery and some blasting mainly experienced on the pool side of the school.\n\nThus, the school was compelled to go back to court to reinforce the first stop order, Noor said.\n\n",
