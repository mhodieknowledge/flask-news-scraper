            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has unveiled plans to launch newly designed ZWG notes, effectively dumping the old defiled versions in a move set to trigger yet another wave of shock across the markets.\n\nIntroduced on April 5 2024, as the countrys lasting solution to currency problems, the ZWG has suffered major setbacks since its inception, including the 43% devaluation in September 2024, which left the local units gold-backed status in question.\n\nThe currency is still in short supply, with the rural economy having very limited access to the local unit despite being the most populous. Some regions have resorted to using the rand as a medium of exchange, especially for smaller denominations in transactions.\n\nIn the midst of another storm following the announcements that the country will adopt the ZWG as the sole currency in 2030, RBZ governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu, on Tuesday told a state-run publication that plans to launch a new version of ZWG notes were currently underway.\n\nThe Reserve Bank is working on the modernisation of the ZiG banknote series as advised in the recent mid-term Monetary Policy Statement. The new ZiG banknotes will be redesigned, including improved quality and durability for the convenience of the transacting public.\n\nIn this regard, the production process of the improved banknotes has progressed well and is at an advanced stage. The public will be advised of the expected roll-out at the appropriate time, he said.\n\nSceptics immediately took to social media platforms questioning the rationale behind the new designs, with many concluding it is a ploy to dump the failed first version.\n\nMarket watchers who anonymously spoke to our publication criticised the ghostly nature of RBZ announcements for creating more headaches than solutions.\n\nThey are of the view that the RBZ must accompany its policy announcements with finer details to avoid market speculation.\n\nOn his part, Mushayavanhu said the new notes must not be misconstrued as a new currency but just a normal routine in line with global best practices.\n\n",

I have never volunteered to come out of ZANU PF of my own will, and that must tell everyone concerned why I am seeking to go back to ZANU PF.\n\nI have always believed in this party, its ideology and its aims and objectives, Tsenengamu told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nOutside ZANU-PF, Tsenengamu formed his own party, the Front for Economic Emancipation in Zimbabwe (FEEZ), as he sought to challenge the ruling party.\n\nAhead of the 2023 election, Tsenengamu and his party backed former ZANU-PF Commissar Saviour Kasukuwere, with the latter being subsequently ejected from the presidential race.\n\nThe firebrand politician has never held back in his criticism of ZANU PF officials who have been implicated in corruption.\n\nTsenengamu says his seeking readmission is not a stamp of approval for certain operations within ZANU PF.\n\nBy seeking to rejoin ZANU PF, that does not mean that I agree to everything everyone does within the party, but there is no point in giving up on the organisation you also worked to grow. Differences will always be there even in institutions like families and churches, and ZANU PF is no exception, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Botswana has declared a public health emergency, with President Duma Boko saying the national medical supply chain collapsed due to depleted government coffers and steep cuts in aid from the United States.\n\nThe announcement came on Monday after the Ministry of Health and Wellness warned earlier this month that the system was severely strained with $75m owed to private health facilities and suppliers.\n\nIt cited shortages of medicines for a range of illnesses, including hypertension, cancer, diabetes, tuberculosis, asthma, mental and sexual health, and stated that elective surgeries were postponed.\n\nThe Health Ministry also said there were shortages of dressings and sutures.\n\nThe medical supply chain, as run by central medical stores, has failed, President Boko said in a televised address on Monday. This failure has led to a severe disruption to health supplies countrywide.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance had earlier approved 250 million pula ($18.7m) in emergency funding for procurement, said Boko, adding that the military would oversee the distribution of emergency medicines, with the first shipments dispatching immediately from the capital, Gaborone, with priority given to deprived rural areas.\n\nThe current prices [for medicine] often are inflated five to 10 times. Under the current economic conditions, this scenario is not sustainable, Boko added.\n\nThe crisis is also linked to a shrinking national budget caused by the ongoing downturn in the global diamond market.\n\nBotswana, with a population of 2.5 million, is one of the worlds largest diamond producers. Its vast diamond reserves, discovered just after independence from Britain in 1966, make up about 80 percent of the countrys foreign earnings.\n\nBut sales have weakened in recent years, pushing a cash-strapped government to suspend certain ministerial purchases last month.\n\nSweeping cuts in aid from the US under President Donald Trump have further strained the economy. Before the cuts, the US funded a third of BotswanasHIV response, according to UNAIDS, and provided $12m through The Global Fund to fight malaria and tuberculosis.\n\nThe United Nations agency for children (UNICEF) said urgent action was needed to address the deepening medical crisis in the country, adding that one in five children was underweight in a western district near the Namibian border.\n\n",
