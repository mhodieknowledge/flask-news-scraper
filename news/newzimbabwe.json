            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe sentencing of convicted businessmen Moses Mpofu and Mike Chimombewas further delayed on Monday to 1430 hoursafter their lawyers insisted they could not proceed without the written judgment, prompting Justice Pisirayi Kwendato reserve his ruling.\n\nLovemore Madhuku, taking instructions from Ashiel Mugiya and representing Chimombe, made an oral application in terms of section 4 of the sentencing guidelines, arguing that a copy of the written judgment of the copy that was read in court when they were convicted was essential for a fair sentencing process.\n\nWe are making the application in terms of sec 4 of the sentencing guidelines, he said, adding that although there was no express procedure, the guidelines give rights to accused persons. He argued that the Constitution gives the accused the right to a fair trial, and without sight of the written judgment, they will be unable to do proper mitigation and they will also be unable to respond adequately to the submission by the state on aggravation.\n\nHe said this would render their trial not fair, stressing that the accused did not take notes and needed to scrutinise the written judgment in the sense that it is relevant to the sentencing. Said Madhuku: It is a legal right of the applicant to get the judgment The request made by the accused persons is clearly not out of this world.\n\nThe accused persons certainly need the judgment to make preparations for the next steps. If the court says it is not readily available, the accused can wait; they are already in custody, he added, citing section 17(1)(c) which entitles an accused to be given adequate time and facilities to prepare a defence. He insisted, The request we are making is not too much. The judgment gives reasons for the convictions and the reasons are relevant for sentencing.\n\nTapson Dzvetero, representing Mpofu, concurred, saying proceeding without a written judgment would prejudice their clients. He said the law requires the court to produce its written judgment in accordance with legal provisions.\n\nState counsel Whisper Mabhaudhi opposed the application, arguing that the law provides only one circumstance where sentencing cannot proceed and there is nothing that can stop this court from sentencing the accused person. He said the defence did not cite relevant sections 331 and 333, instead relying on section 4, which is not applicable at all.\n\nMabhaudhi submitted that the request amounted to seeking further information, yet the judgment had already been delivered in open court, where parties were supposed to take notes, and no undertaking was made to release a written judgment before sentencing. The judgment which was delivered in the presence of the accused persons was final, he said.\n\nHe argued the accused do not require this judgment for any particular reason at all other than being a matter of preference, adding that their lawyers notes would suffice. Issues about the degree of participation were issues of appeal, he said.\n\nMabhaudhi added that proceedings were livestreamed and the accused were at liberty to go to YouTube where the proceedings were covered live The judgment is available in a video format, which they are at liberty to listen to at their own time.\n\nMadhuku dismissed that argument, saying, The accused persons do not have access to YouTube and we cannot take away the role they play in their own trial despite having lawyers.\n\nJustice Kwenda reserved the ruling to 1430 hours.\n\nThe pair was due for sentencing after being convicted of US$7 million fraud. Their sentencing has been repeatedly delayed, including after the State withdrew its earlier application for forfeiture of their properties.\n\n",

            "content": "By BBC\n\nPOPE Leo has held an audience with Hollywood stars, urging actors and directors including Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen and Monica Bellucci to continue their work as pilgrims of the imagination, helping to bring hope.\n\nThe celebrity meeting was a sprinkling of star dust for a still relatively new pope and a way for the Catholic Church to engage more with the world beyond.It was also a strong show of support from Leo XIV for the global film industry, as he spoke out against the troubling decline in cinema-going.Hailed by director Spike Lee as a great day, the gathering was the first of its kind in the Vatican.Beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall, Pope Leo spoke in Italian to praise the power of cinema to entertain and to educate  and for its capacity to amaze.But he urged filmmakers not to shy away from what he called the worlds wounds.Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated, the Pope said.Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognizes and explores it. This is what all the great directors have done.Six months since a conclave of cardinals elected the first North American to the Papacy, some Catholics feel that Leo has been slow to stamp his own mark on the role.His predecessor, Francis, was a charismatic Argentinian known for his off-the-cuff comments and dramatic gestures. Leos style is far quieter, so this star-studded engagement is a new look.Its not clear how the cast list was drawn up, although none of the directors in the hall  who came from all over the world  made it onto the Popes own top film list.This week, the Vatican revealed that his favourite four watches of all time included the 1960s nun-themed classic The Sound of Music, Its a Wonderful Life and Italian Roberto Benignis multi award-winning Life is Beautiful.Among those who did join todays A-list audience were Mortensen, Chris Pine and filmmaker Gus Van Sant  of Milk and Good Will Hunting fame. The large Italian contingent included Gianni Amelio and Cinema Paradiso creator, Giuseppe Tornatore.At a time of immense pressure on film, not long after a major Hollywood strike and with funding strains here in Italy, the Pope spoke in defence of the industry.He was applauded loudly when he talked of the quiet dedication of all those behind the scenes with vital roles.He also warned against the closure of cinemas which he characterised as the beating heart of communities.More than a few people are saying that the art of cinema and the cinematic experience are in danger. I urge institutions not to give up, but to cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value of this activity, the Pope said.After a fifteen-minute speech and a blessing he then received each audience member in turn, led by Blanchett.He really urged us to go back into our day jobs and inspire people, the Australian-born star told reporters.One of many who came bearing gifts, the actress  who works with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR  placed a woven bracelet in the Popes hand.

            "content": "By Dumani Moyo I The South African\n\nSOUTH African activist and March in March founder Jacinta Ngobese-Zuma has stirred controversy after blasting Zimbabwean men living in South Africa, calling them cowards who have abandoned their country instead of fixing it.\n\nNgobese-Zuma made the remarks during an interview with Gagasi FMs Siphumelele Zondi, following comments from Mduduzi Dube, a Zimbabwean man living in South Africa, who raised concerns about growing tensions between locals and migrants.Zimbabwe is not a province of South AfricaDube told Gagasi FM that the atmosphere in South Africa has grown increasingly hostile towards foreign nationals, citing the rise of anti-immigrant movements such as Operation Dudula.He argued that politicians and activists often use the immigration issue for popularity, saying, Anybody who wants to go into politics and gain immediate attention must make noise about foreigners.Dube added that historically, South Africans and foreigners coexisted peacefully until groups like Operation Dudula emerged.However, Ngobese-Zuma dismissed his claims, accusing Zimbabweans of entitlement.I think Zimbabweans first of all need to understand that Zimbabwe is not a province of South Africa.
