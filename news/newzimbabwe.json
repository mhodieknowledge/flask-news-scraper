Two of the four suspects are foreign nationals.\n\nAccording to police, the gun battle erupted after detectives tracked down a motorised robbery syndicate that had reportedly crossed into Zimbabwe from South Africa to carry out a series of armed robberies in Bulawayo, Harare, and Kwekwe.\n\nAs the detectives were following, the suspects fired at them resulting in a serious exchange of fire near Norton Tollgate, along HarareBulawayo Road, said Nyathi.\n\nFollowing the shootout, detectives recovered the gangs getaway vehicle, a Toyota Axio, and a cache of weapons including a Girsan 9mm Parabellum pistol with two rounds, another 9mm Parabellum pistol with one round, as well as clothing items believed to have been used during recent robberies.\n\nOne of the suspects was captured on CCTV wearing the recovered shoes and jacket during an armed robbery incident which occurred on 30th September 2025 at a local hospital in Harare, where US$1,833 cash and airtime recharge cards worth US$140 were stolen, the police statement revealed.\n\nInvestigations show the slain gang was linked to at least five armed robberies committed in Harare and Bulawayo between 25th June and 3rd October 2025, including a case in Njube, Bulawayo, where robbers made off with US$8,000 and an iPhone.\n\nNyathi said police would continue to act decisively against armed criminal networks operating in Zimbabwe.\n\nZRP reiterates that there is no going back in the fight against armed robbery cases in the country, he said. All syndicates, whether locally or foreign-based, will be decisively dealt with in line with the countrys laws.\n\nHe urged the public to assist law enforcement efforts by reporting any suspicious criminal activity.\n\n",

The victim sustained multiple stab wounds and was rushed to Tshilidzini Hospital, where he later died in the early hours of Saturday, 4 October.\n\nPolice have identified the suspect as Richard Chiraira, who fled the scene and remains on the run. The case, initially registered as attempted murder, has since been updated to murder.\n\nA manhunt is underway, and we are appealing to anyone with information to assist the police in locating the suspect, said provincial police spokesperson Colonel Malesela Ledwaba.\n\nInvestigations into the incident are ongoing.\n\nLast month, IOL reported that police in Limpopo launched an investigation into a suspected mob justice incident after the body of a man, believed to be a Zimbabwean national, was discovered in Mooihoek, Driekop. The victim, who is thought to be in his 30s, was found with severe injuries consistent with a brutal assault.\n\nPolice responded to a report of a murder, and on arrival, they discovered the mans body with multiple injuries, believed to have been inflicted with stones and bottles. Paramedics declared him dead at the scene.\n\nAt the time, police in the province confirmed that the motive for the killing was under investigation and appealed for the publics help.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nFORMER Energy minister Fortune Chasi has called on Zimbabweans to stop blaming Chinese for environmental degradation, arguing that local corruption and weak governance are at the heart of the countrys mining-related ecological damage.\n\nChasi was responding to growing outrage over the ongoing destruction of Christmas Pass Mountain in Mutare, where the Chinese reportedly working in collusion with political elites are accused of tearing apart the landmark for mineral extraction.\n\nThere have been various videos on social media showing the destruction going on in the Christmas Pass Mountain with locals accusing the Chinese of damaging the scenic environment.\n\nThis comes at a time when mountains, monuments and escarpments are being destroyed countrywide by Chinese companies in the mining sector with examples being Boterekwa in Shurugwi, Muvaradonha Wilderness in Muzarabani and now Christmas Pass.\n\nResponding to one of the debates on X, Chasi said while Chinese investors are often vilified for destructive mining practices, the real problem lies with local officials who enable such activities for personal gain.\n\nFor years, we have blamed the Chinese for destroying our environment through mining, but the truth is harder to face, the real culprits are locals.\n\nLocal officials sign the licences, local elites pocket the facilitation fees. Local silence allows rivers to turn into sludge. The Chinese did not corrupt our system, they found it already for sale, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe former energy minister argued that environmental destruction in Zimbabwe reflects a broader governance crisis rather than foreign exploitation alone.\n\nThis isnt a Chinese problem. It is a governance problem. If rules can be bought, someones selling, he added.\n\nEvery destroyed riverbed tells a local story, a signature, a bribe, a blind eye. Foreign miners only exploit the vacuum we created.\n\nBlaming outsiders has become a fashionable, convenient self-deception. Environmental destruction thrives because enforcement is selective and oversight compromised, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe reform we need is not about nationality; it is about integrity.\n\nUntil our institutions stop trading ecological integrity for quick cash, nothing will change. The Chinese did not destroy our mountains and rivers. Our signatures did, he added.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFORMER Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) president Nelson Chamisa has refuted claims circulating on social media that he has abandoned politics to pursue his education.\n\nChamisa dismissed the social media reports linking him to studies in the United States as sideshows and lies.\n\nWriting on his WhatsApp news channel, The Chamisa News Channel, on Sunday, Chamisa asserted that he is fully aware of the responsibility on his shoulders and that he represents the hope of millions of Zimbabweans who are still yearning for a better-functioning country with opportunities.\n\nFellow Citizens, ignore the sideshows, lies and falsehoods being circulated by our opposition. Stay focused. Im fully aware of the huge responsibility and heavy burden upon my shoulders. And I will never let you down or fall short, Chamisa said.\n\nThe veteran politician-turned-advocate blamed his unnamed political foes, whom he accuses of attempting to arm-twist him into divulging information about his political strategy, almost two years after resigning from the CCC party presidency.\n\nBear in mind that not all strategic decisions are shared openly or with the opposite team. Information is a strategic resource never to be shared recklessly. As for you who believe and support; worry not, fear not, doubt not and more importantly, be confused not.\n\nIn his characteristic style, Chamisa reassured Zimbabweans that better days for the country lie ahead.\n\nBe clear and of good cheer. You will soon appreciate the wisdom of my ways. Victory and success never come cheap. Every action I take, every decision I make, is focused on achieving our great and glorious future for Zimbabwe.\n\nHe insisted that his focus remains on building Zimbabwe.\n\nMy hands are on the deck, my eyes on the vision and mission. The struggle continues, and I remain steadfast, fully committed to the work that cannot pause for idle distractions.\n\nIt is understood that Chamisa is working on a new and soon-to-be-launched political movement, a new vehicle for the 2028 elections, nearly two years after stepping down as CCC party President.\n\nThe opposition activist is also reportedly steering clear of commenting on Zanu-PFs internal succession battles.\n\nHe has been accused on social media of inaction as a politician and a leader that people expect to lead Zimbabwe.\n\nCritics have pointed to what they view as the clerics obsession with scripture, which they claim is the biggest weakness of the former Kuwadzana East MP as a leader.\n\n",

Regardless of the circumstances or emotions of the moment, there is no justification for my actions, and I take full responsibility for the hurt and embarrassment they may have caused you, Chiragwi said.\n\nThe gaffer went on to reveal that he has since stepped aside as Warriors head coach ahead of two World Cup Qualifiers games.\n\nIn the spirit of transparency and respect for due process, I have stepped aside from my national team duties for the upcoming FIFA World Cup Qualifiers to allow all disciplinary procedures to take place without prejudice.\n\nI will cooperate fully with the investigations by the PSL and any other relevant authorities and accept whatever outcome or sanction is deemed appropriate.\n\nI remain committed to learning from this incident, rebuilding trust, and proving through my actions that this mistake does not define me, further stated Chiragwi.\n\n",
