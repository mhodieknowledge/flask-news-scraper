            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nPOLITICAL analyst Rejoice Ngwenya has poured cold water on wealthy businessman Kuda Tagwireis chances of succeeding President Emmerson Mnangagwa, saying the tycoon-turned-politician lacks a political power base to challenge for the highest office.\n\nNgwenyas remarks follow widespread speculation President Emmerson Mnangagwas faction was preparing the businessman for takeover as president following resistance within the ruling party for the incumbent to run for a third successive term, which violates the countrys Constitution.\n\nThis is a simplistic, if not naive, narrative. Zanu PF has no succession strategy. They rely on populist gravitas, and I can tell you Tagwirei has no grassroots credibility.\n\nIt would be catastrophic for ED [Emmerson Mnangagwa] to present him as a 2028 candidate. And besides, who really likes ED in the Central Committee? Which provinces would vote for Tagwirei in that party? said Ngwenya.\n\nTagwirei has unsettled a faction pushing for President Mnangagwas deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, to takeover when the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader retires in 2028 upon expiry of his second and final presidential term as per constitutional limits.\n\nThere are three factions in Zanu PF: the ED faction, the Chiwenga faction, and the neutral, non-committal, unsure faction. Definitely, the Chiwenga faction will say nobut we know how powerful it is. If it can shift attitudes in the military, then it has the capacity to hold sway, said Ngwenya.\n\nTagwirei has, in recent times, emerged from nowhere, criss-crossing the country presiding over Zanu PF-organised events thereby fuelling speculation of his ambitions to succeed President Mnangagwa.\n\nTo demonstrate the tensions within Zanu PF, Tagwirei was reportedly ejected, at Chiwengas behest, from this weeks Zanu PF Central Committee meeting in Harare ostensibly for not having followed proper procedures to ratify his membership to the all-powerful Zanu PF organ. He was forced out alongside other new coopted members from other provinces, sources said.\n\nTagwirei arrived at the Central Committee gathering at Zanu PF Headquarters on Thursday with opulence and a spring in his step, only to fail to see the meeting through.\n\nThe businessman, who was endorsed by the Harare Province led by Goodwills Masimirembwa, attended the indaba unaware of the partys procedures and statutes.\n\nDespite his name having been seconded by the provincial structure, it required ratification by the Central Committee to confirm his co-option into the most powerful organ of Zanu PF.\n\nAccording to political observers, his attendance at the Central Committee meeting exposed his ignorance regarding the ruling partys procedures.\n\nTagwireis supersonic ascension in Zanu PF has been met with mixed feelings among the general membership.\n\n",

            "content": "By BBC News\n\nTWO female tourists, including a British pensioner, have been killed by a charging elephant while on safari in Zambia, police have told the BBC.\n\nEaston Taylor, 68, from the UK and 67-year-old Alison Taylor from New Zealand were attacked by a female elephant that was with a calf at the South Luangwa National Park, said local police chief Robertson Mweemba.The two tourists were trampled to death by the nursing elephant after efforts by tour guides to stop it by firing shots failed. Both women died at the scene, he said.The British Foreign Office said it was supporting the family of a British woman who had died in Zambia and was liaising with local authorities.Mr Mweemba said the two women were part of a guided safari group who were walking in the park on Thursday when the elephant charged towards them at high speed.The two tourists had stayed for four days at the Big Lagoon Camp, about 600 km (370 miles) from the capital, Lusaka, where the attack happened.They were moving to other camps when the elephant charged from behind. We are really sorry that we have lost our visitors, Mr Mweemba said.They both died on the spot, he added.It is not clear whether the pair were related.Female elephants are very protective of their calves and Zambian authorities have previously called on tourists to exercise extreme caution while observing wildlife around the country.It is very difficult to control the animals and tourists like feeding them, Mr Mweemba said.Last year, two American tourists were killed in separate attacks by elephants in the southern African country. Both cases involved elderly tourists who were in a safari vehicle when they were attacked.Additional reporting by Dingindaba Jonah Buyoya in Lusaka.\n\nEaston Taylor, 68, from the UK and 67-year-old Alison Taylor from New Zealand were attacked by a female elephant that was with a calf at the South Luangwa National Park, said local police chief Robertson Mweemba.\n\nThe two tourists were trampled to death by the nursing elephant after efforts by tour guides to stop it by firing shots failed.
