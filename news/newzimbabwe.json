            "content": "By Reuters\n\nTANZANIAS main opposition party said on Friday hundreds of people had been killed in protests over elections this week, as the U.N. secretary-general called for an investigation into allegations of excessive use of force.\n\nThe U.N. human rights office said credible reports indicated at least 10 people were killed in protests in three cities, the first public estimate of any fatalities by an international body since Wednesdays vote.The foreign ministers of Britain, Canada and Norway issued a joint statement expressing concern over the situation and urging the Tanzanian authorities to act with maximum restraint and to respect the right of assembly and of free expression.Speaking to Reuters in some of the governments first public comments on the unrest, Foreign Affairs Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo said the oppositions death toll was hugely exaggerated but that the authorities had not yet tabulated casualties. He denied that security officers had used excessive force.Reuters could not independently verify the casualty figures.Protesters have taken to the streets since Wednesday, angered by the exclusion of President Samia Suluhu Hassans two biggest challengers from the race and what they described as widespread repression.Witnesses have said police fired tear gas and gunshots to break up some demonstrations.Police have imposed an overnight nationwide curfew over the past two nights after government offices and other buildings were set ablaze. Internet access has been disrupted since Wednesday.In a statement issued by his spokesperson, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a thorough and impartial investigation into all allegations of excessive use of force and deplored the loss of life.Partial election results announced on Thursday and Friday showed Hassan winning commanding majorities across the country, and complete results were expected in the coming hours.HEAVY SECURITY PRESENCEThe unrest presents a test for Hassan, who won praise after taking office in 2021 for easing repression but has more recently faced criticism from opposition parties and activists after a series of arrests and alleged abductions of opponents.Hassan has denied allegations of widespread rights abuses. She said last year she had ordered an investigation into reports of abductions, but no official findings have been released.Soldiers and police patrolled the streets of the commercial capital Dar es Salaam on Friday, preventing people from moving around without a valid reason.John Kitoka  a spokesperson for the CHADEMA party which was barred from the election for refusing to sign a code of conduct and had its leader arrested for treason in April  said the party had documented about 700 deaths since Wednesday based on accounts from health workers.He said protests continued on Friday in several cities, although they had waned in some due to the heavy security.We are calling for the protests to continue until our demands for electoral reforms are met, Kitoka told Reuters.GOVERNMENT SAYS VIOLENCE LIMITEDForeign Affairs Minister Kombo said there had only been a very few small pockets of incidents during the election period and that the violence was caused by criminal elements.Most Tanzanians are so much disappointed with what has happened, and they are calling for their government to end this impunity, he said.U.N. human rights spokesperson Seif Magango told reporters there were credible reports of at least 10 people killed in Dar es Salaam, Shinyanga and Morogoro.One Dar es Salaam resident, who asked not to be named for safety reasons, told Reuters a family member had been shot dead outside a hospital when he was mistaken for a protester.A police spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.Writing by Vincent Mumo Nzilani and George Obulutsa; Editing by Aaron Ross, Ros Russell, Andrew Heavens and Gareth Jones.\n\nThe U.N. human rights office said credible reports indicated at least 10 people were killed in protests in three cities, the first public estimate of any fatalities by an international body since Wednesdays vote.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Britain, Canada and Norway issued a joint statement expressing concern over the situation and urging the Tanzanian authorities to act with maximum restraint and to respect the right of assembly and of free expression.Speaking to Reuters in some of the governments first public comments on the unrest, Foreign Affairs Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo said the oppositions death toll was hugely exaggerated but that the authorities had not yet tabulated casualties.

Also, he did not engage the handbrake and left the ignition key on.Later, it was heard, Chingaya instructed Musekiwa to remove the car keys but he, instead, turned them on prompting the engine to start.

            "content": "Jonisayi Maromo l IOL\n\nZIMBABWE has stepped in to help neighbouring Botswana with a consignment of anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs), sending a batch that combines both a donation and a loan as Gaborone grapples with temporary shortages in its HIV treatment programme.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Botswana Embassy in Harare, trucks carrying the life-saving medicines departed Zimbabwe earlier this week under a bilateral arrangement that includes 20% of the consignment as a donation and 80% as a loan to be reimbursed in ARVs.The government of the Republic of Zimbabwe extended a generous gesture to the Republic of Botswana through a loan facility, with 20% of the consignment as a donation and 80% provided as a loan to be reimbursed in the form of ARVs, the Embassy of Botswana in Zimbabwe said.Botswanas Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Sarah Molosiwa, conveyed her governments appreciation on behalf of President Duma Gideon Boko, describing the shipment as a vital gesture of solidarity between two friendly nations.Ambassador Molosiwa was received and briefed by NatPharm Managing Director Newman Mazikwa before the convoys departure.The Botswana Ministry of Health and Wellness confirmed on Thursday that the ARVs had arrived in Gaborone.In a statement posted to its verified Facebook page, the ministry said the consignment would help stabilise the countrys ARV supply chain after procurement delays had caused concern among patients and health facilities.Loaning medicines and medical commodities is a common practice for countries that are friendly to each other as Botswana is to its neighbours, the ministry said.This will help stabilise the ARV situation in the country.Zimbabwes growing pharmaceutical powerThe emergency shipment underscores Zimbabwes growing pharmaceutical and logistics capacity, which has seen a sharp turnaround under President Emmerson Mnangagwas drive to boost local manufacturing and health-sector self-sufficiency.According to The Herald newspaper in Zimbabwe, Mnangagwa recently commissioned a US$6.96 million (more than R12 billion) National Pharmaceutical Company (NatPharm) warehouse in Mutare, describing it as a major step towards transforming Zimbabwe into a regional hub for medical supplies.Since 2018, there has been a 56 percent increase in the number of pharmaceutical entities from nine in 2020 to the current 14, Mnangagwa was quoted as saying at the launch.He added that the mega pharmaceutical warehouse represents a significant milestone in our concerted efforts to enhance access to essential medicines and health commodities, especially in rural areas.A viable health sector is not only an indicator, but also a precondition and outcome of social and economic sustainable development, he added.Analysts say the ability to loan ARVs to a neighbouring country marks a symbolic shift for Zimbabwe  once plagued by chronic drug shortages and donor dependence, it is now positioning itself as a regional player in pharmaceutical resilience and humanitarian diplomacy.Regional solidarity in actionThe exchange has sparked widespread attention across social media, where many Zimbabweans have hailed the gesture as a sign of progress and regional cooperation.In Botswana, health commentators have welcomed the move as evidence of African solutions to African challenges, with some urging that the arrangement be formalised into a Southern African Development Community (SADC) health-security framework.Observers say the episode could mark a turning point in Southern Africas approach to medicine security, where countries increasingly rely on each other to manage stock-outs caused by procurement delays, global supply disruptions or funding constraints.For Botswana, the immediate effect is stabilisation of ARV supplies for thousands of patients. For Zimbabwe, it is a rare diplomatic win  a testament to its expanding health infrastructure and a sign that its pharmaceutical sector is beginning to export strength rather than shortage.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Botswana Embassy in Harare, trucks carrying the life-saving medicines departed Zimbabwe earlier this week under a bilateral arrangement that includes 20% of the consignment as a donation and 80% as a loan to be reimbursed in ARVs.\n\nThe government of the Republic of Zimbabwe extended a generous gesture to the Republic of Botswana through a loan facility, with 20% of the consignment as a donation and 80% provided as a loan to be reimbursed in the form of ARVs, the Embassy of Botswana in Zimbabwe said.Botswanas Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Sarah Molosiwa, conveyed her governments appreciation on behalf of President Duma Gideon Boko, describing the shipment as a vital gesture of solidarity between two friendly nations.Ambassador Molosiwa was received and briefed by NatPharm Managing Director Newman Mazikwa before the convoys departure.The Botswana Ministry of Health and Wellness confirmed on Thursday that the ARVs had arrived in Gaborone.In a statement posted to its verified Facebook page, the ministry said the consignment would help stabilise the countrys ARV supply chain after procurement delays had caused concern among patients and health facilities.Loaning medicines and medical commodities is a common practice for countries that are friendly to each other as Botswana is to its neighbours, the ministry said.This will help stabilise the ARV situation in the country.Zimbabwes growing pharmaceutical powerThe emergency shipment underscores Zimbabwes growing pharmaceutical and logistics capacity, which has seen a sharp turnaround under President Emmerson Mnangagwas drive to boost local manufacturing and health-sector self-sufficiency.According to The Herald newspaper in Zimbabwe, Mnangagwa recently commissioned a US$6.96 million (more than R12 billion) National Pharmaceutical Company (NatPharm) warehouse in Mutare, describing it as a major step towards transforming Zimbabwe into a regional hub for medical supplies.Since 2018, there has been a 56 percent increase in the number of pharmaceutical entities from nine in 2020 to the current 14, Mnangagwa was quoted as saying at the launch.He added that the mega pharmaceutical warehouse represents a significant milestone in our concerted efforts to enhance access to essential medicines and health commodities, especially in rural areas.A viable health sector is not only an indicator, but also a precondition and outcome of social and economic sustainable development, he added.Analysts say the ability to loan ARVs to a neighbouring country marks a symbolic shift for Zimbabwe  once plagued by chronic drug shortages and donor dependence, it is now positioning itself as a regional player in pharmaceutical resilience and humanitarian diplomacy.Regional solidarity in actionThe exchange has sparked widespread attention across social media, where many Zimbabweans have hailed the gesture as a sign of progress and regional cooperation.In Botswana, health commentators have welcomed the move as evidence of African solutions to African challenges, with some urging that the arrangement be formalised into a Southern African Development Community (SADC) health-security framework.Observers say the episode could mark a turning point in Southern Africas approach to medicine security, where countries increasingly rely on each other to manage stock-outs caused by procurement delays, global supply disruptions or funding constraints.For Botswana, the immediate effect is stabilisation of ARV supplies for thousands of patients.

camouflage, stealth, and a secretive nature.Their distinctive spotted coats enable them to blend seamlessly into their surroundings, such as dry grass and foliage.During the day, leopards often rest in trees or dense vegetation, making them virtually invisible unless they move.As a fortunate traveller, Andiles safari adventures in the region yielded sightings that many wildlife enthusiasts would
