I think the formal sectors costs are very high at the moment.\n\nThe cost of power, labour and various statutory costs. It is critical that we grow the base. And once we grow the formal base, the tax revenues will grow automatically.\n\nSo, I think it is important at this moment in time to level the playing field, reduce taxes, reduce compliance costs, make compliance easy, so we can grow the formal market for the future of the economy, Ahmed said.\n\nThe company is producing 300 tonnes of wheat products per day and prefers to supply direct to huge retailers, avoiding the middleman in order to avoid counterfeit products on the market.\n\nWe have always been very strong with our big retailers, your Pick and Pay, your OK, your N. Richards and Gain. That has always been our traditional route to markets.\n\nWe enjoy that market because it gives us a good shelf presence, we ensure that the products that we produce actually get to the retailer. It avoids counterfeit products. So, were very pro the formal market,\n\nThe managing director highlighted that the market had shifted forcing most companies to cover every segment of the consumer.\n\nWe are forced to be both in the informal and formal market. Generally, the liquidity in the country is tight.\n\nThe formal retailers are struggling at the moment. I think the informal sector has become very strong. And given the overhead structure thats in the formal sector, they are struggling. And this is translating into cash flow which has an impact in our ability to supply the retailers., added Ahmed.\n\nHowever, he said the milling company, one of the largest in Africa, will not tire but adjust to current business environment.\n\nWe are navigating, we are looking for solutions with them, looking for payment solutions that are flexible.\n\nWe take local currency, we take ZIG, we take US dollars, we take Rand. Were trying to make it as easy as possible for the retailers. From our point of view, it is important that the retail sector survives in the country for the future of the economy, for the benefit of the fiscus, and for the general economic growth, he added.\n\nAhmed projected a high demand for Mega Market products.\n\n If you produce a good quality product and you have availability of product, I think there is demand out there.\n\nSo, were continuing to grow. Were continuing to go at full speed. Were looking at various projects of value addition and beneficiation.\n\nWe are looking at setting up a noodles line. Were looking at cereal lines, pasta lines, and various other projects that are currently in the feasibility stage. Weve all focus on the economy, and we continue to grow as a business.\n\nHigh production costs have led to closure of many companies in Zimbabwe.\n\n",

Some roads, although trafficable, are being used as an excuse to inflate fares.\n\nPAZ is demanding fair bus fares pricing and transparency.\n\nTransport operators must charge fares that reflect the actual distance travelled and the conditions of roads.\n\nOperators should clearly display their fare structures and provide explanations for any price increases.\n\nGoliath said relevant authorities must intervene and regulate fares and ensure that passengers are not exploited.\n\nTogether, we can fight for fair and affordable transportation, said the PAZ president.\n\n",

Our sovereignty is not there anymore.\n\nAn unquantifiable number of Zimbabweans work in South Africa illegally.\n\nThey were forced to brave trekking down south, passing through a crocodile-infested Limpopo river, by Zimbabwes continuously worsening economy that has destroyed hopes of finding jobs.\n\nZimbabweans form a unit of foreigners that include Mozambicans, Malawians and Somalis, which has over the past decades fallen victim to xenophobic vigilante groups chasing them out of South Africa. This includes the infamous Dudula militia.\n\nAdded Mashaba: I do not understand the logic behind this. The people who made this decision want to make sure that South Africans are as poor as possible.\n\nWe know our neighbouring countries are dysfunctional as a result of South Africa also not assisting but we are making matters worse.\n\nI am not sure who they are trying to satisfy. If I had my way, there was no way we would allow anyone without documentation in our country.\n\nAllowing them to use services when we cannot afford them for our own people (does not make sense). You even find in some schools children numbering 90 in a class.\n\nThis is not the first time a senior official has questioned the use of public resources by illegal immigrants in the rainbow nation.\n\nIn 2022, a health official, Phophi Ramathuba, was recorded chastising a Zimbabwean woman who had travelled to South Africa for medical attention after being involved in a car accident.\n\nYou are killing my health system, is what Ramathuba told the woman on video.\n\n",

The whereabouts of the new vehicles remained a mystery.\n\nResponding to images of a fleet of parked refuse trucks, Gama admitted the local authority didnt have adequate trucks to collect garbage.\n\nThose are old broken-down trucks, some which will be auctioned to scrap metal dealers while a few will be rehabilitated, said Gama\n\nEfforts by NewZimbabwe.com to seek clarification from Gama regarding the specifics of the truck hires were fruitless by time of publishing.\n\nCharles Sadondo, Mutare acting corporate communications officer, confirmed his organisation provided services for Harare.\n\nWhat we can share at the moment is that we hired out our trucks to the CoH after a request by the central government requesting us to assist them in the clean-up campaign spearheaded by the government, said Sadondo\n\nChegutus town clerk, Jacob Chikuruwo, also confirmed the hiring of a truck during the festive season.\n\nYes, they hired one truck from us during the Christmas period.

God has great plans for us, plans to prosper us and not to harm us, plans to give us hope and a future (Jeremiah 29:11). However, we must remain committed to seeking Him and following His ways.\n\nIn Hebrews 12:2, were encouraged to fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith.

In Matthew 6:14-15, Jesus teaches us that if we dont forgive others, our Father in heaven wont forgive us. Lets choose to forgive those who have wronged us and start the new year with a clean slate.\n\nIn addition to forgiveness, lets prioritize prayer, worship, and service to others in this new year. Lets seek to deepen our relationship with God, to love and serve our neighbours, and to shine His light in a world that desperately needs it.\n\nAs we embark on this new journey, lets pray:\n\nDear Heavenly Father,\n\nWe come before You with gratitude and hope, thanking You for the gift of a new year. Help us to fix our eyes on Jesus, to cling to Him in times of joy and sorrow, and to trust in His power and wisdom to guide us. Give us the courage to forgive those who have wronged us and the strength to serve You and others with love and humility. May Your Spirit empower us to shine Your light in the world and to bring glory to Your name.\n\nIn Jesus name, we pray.\n\nAMEN.\n\n",
