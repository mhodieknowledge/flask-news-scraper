Clearly, the applicant does not give an honest account of his default.\n\nWith the Supreme Courts decision, Thandiwe will retain both the Buena Vista property and the Mercedes-Benz, while Sibanda remains with the larger share of their estate.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court of Zimbabwe granted an urgent interdict to the Zimbabwe Diamond & Allied Minerals Workers Union (ZDAMWU), effectively blocking RioZim Limited from disposing of its mining assets while pending corporate rescue proceedings.\n\nThe judgment, delivered by Justice Maxwell Dembure, encapsulated the precarious intersection of corporate governance and worker rights.\n\nThe case arose after RioZim, a publicly listed company, issued a cautionary statement on July 21, 2025, initiating discussions regarding the potential sale of its mining and non-core assets. This announcement followed ZDAMWUs filing of a court application on April 28, seeking to place the company under supervision due to financial distress.\n\nDembure noted, The mere filing of the application for corporate rescue triggers an immediate moratorium on the disposal of a companys assets, emphasising the protective nature of the law intended to shield creditors and employees from the adverse effects of asset stripping.\n\nHe further highlighted that any attempt at asset disposal during this phase could render the corporate rescue application academic, fundamentally undermining the purpose of such proceedings.\n\nIn lambasting RioZims move, the judge said, If the applicants rights are not preserved, the purpose of the ongoing litigation will be defeated, which is against the interests of all affected, including the workers. The court affirmed that allowing the asset disposals would suit a strategy that frustrates and defeats the pending corporate rescue proceedings, further noting that the company must not be allowed to operate as if it were free from legal encumbrances.\n\nZDAMWUs counsel, R. Mabwe, characterised the urgency of the application as essential, asserting that should the court fail to act swiftly, irreparable harm would result, reflecting the unions commitment to safeguarding employee interests linked to the companys asset base.\n\nRioZims response, led by attorney E. Donzvambeva, contended that the company should be allowed to explore transactions to alleviate financial duress without impediment.\n\nHe argued, The proposed disposals are necessary for the companys survival, pointing out that asset sales could provide much-needed liquidity during corporate rescue discussions.\n\nHowever, Dembure countered, highlighting the lack of clarity in RioZims intentions about which specific assets might be sold, noting that such details could impact any ruling on the matter.\n\nThe court granted two key orders: prohibiting any asset sales contemplated in RioZims cautionary statement and mandating the company to bear the costs of the proceedings.\n\nThe balance of convenience strongly lies in favouring the applicants request for an interim interdict to prevent potential asset dissipation until a determination is made on the main application.\n\nAs a result of this significant ruling, RioZims shareholders and stakeholders will need to navigate the complexities of corporate restructuring under the courts oversight, while the future of the companys asset management remains uncertain.\n\nThe outcome of the wider corporate rescue proceedings now looms large, with potential implications for the mining sector and employee security within the industry at stake.\n\n",
