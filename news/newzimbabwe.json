            "content": "The Conversation\n\nKontuthu Ziyathunqa  Smoke Rising  was what they used to callBulawayowhen the city was the industrial powerhouse of Zimbabwe. Now, many of its factories lie dormant or derelict. The daily torrent of workers flowing eastward at dawn, and back out to the high-density western suburbs at dusk, has diminished to a trickle.\n\nBut there is an intriguing industrial-era institution that lives on in most of the older western suburbs (formerly called townships). It is the municipal beer hall or beer garden, built in thecolonial daysfor the racially segregated African worker communities. There are dozens of these halls and garden complexes, still serving customers and emitting muffled sounds of merriment to this day.\n\nLike other urban areas in Rhodesia (colonial Zimbabwe), Bulawayo was informally segregated from its inception, and more formally segregated after the second world war. Under British rule (1893-1965) and then independent white minority rule (1965-1980), municipal drinking amenities were built in the townships to maintain control of African drinking and sociality. At the same time, they raised much-needed revenue for township welfare and recreational services.\n\nI researched the history of these beer halls and gardens as part of my PhD project on the development of the segregated African townships in late colonial Bulawayo. As myhistorical accountshows, they played a key role in the contested township development process.\n\nBulawayos oldest and most famous beer hall, MaKhumalo, also known as Big Bhawa, was built more than a century ago, in 1913. It still stands at the heart of the historicMakokobaneighbourhood. Its enormous, but austere, and in the early days it was oppressively managed. Drinkers would describe feeling like prisoners there.\n\nThe more picturesque beer gardens began to emerge in the 1950s, reflecting the developmental idealism ofHugh Ashton. The Lesotho-born anthropologist was educated at the Universities of Oxford, London and Cape Town, and took up the new directorship of African administration in Bulawayo in 1949.\n\nHe was tuned into new anthropological ideas about social change, as well as developmental ideas spreading through postwar colonial administrations  about stabilising and detribalising African workers to create a more passive and productive urban working class. He saw a reformed municipal beer system as a key tool for achieving these goals.\n\nAshton wanted to make the beer system more legitimate and the venues more community-building. He proposed constructing beer garden complexes with trees, rocks, games facilities, food stalls and events like traditional dancing. So the atmosphere would be convivial and respectable, but also controllable, enticing all classes and boosting profits to fund better social services. As we shall see, this strategy was full of contradictions\n\nMaKhumalo, MaMkhwananzi, MaNdlovu, MaSilela. These beer garden names, emblazoned on the beer dispensaries that stick up above the ramparts of each garden complex,referencedthe role that women traditionally played in beer brewing in southern Africa. This helped authenticate the councils home brew.\n\nBut the reality was that the beer was now produced in a massive industrial brewery managed by a Polish man. It was delivered in trucks and stored in steel tanks at the tops of the dispensary buildings, to be piped down into the plastic mugs of thirsty punters at small bar windows below. (It was also sold in plastic calabashes and cardboard cartons.)\n\nAnd the beer garden bureaucracy, which offered a rare opportunity for African men to attain higher-grade public sector jobs, became increasingly complex and strictly audited.\n\nAs the townships rapidly expanded, with beer gardens dotted about them, sales of the councils traditional beer  the quality of which Ashton and his staff obsessed over  went up and up.\n\nExtensive beer advertising in the councils free magazine mixed symbols of tradition (beer as food) with symbols of modern middle-classness.\n\nThe systems success relied on the Bulawayo council having a monopoly on the sale of so-called native beer. This traditional brew is typically made by malting, mashing, boiling and then fermenting sorghum, millet or maize grains. Racialised Rhodesian liquor laws restricted African access to European beers, wines and spirits (although restrictions eased from the late 1950s).\n\nSo, the beer hall or garden was the only public venue where Africans could legally drink (apart from a tiny elite, for whom a few exclusive cocktail lounges were built). The council cracked down harshly on liquor offences like home brewing.\n\nThis beer monopoly system was quite prevalent in southern and eastern Africa, though rarely at the scale to which it grew in Bulawayo. Nearly everywhere, the system caused resentment among African townspeople, and so it became politically charged.\n\nIn several colonies, beer halls became sites of protest, or were boycotted (mostfamouslyin South Africa). And they usually faced stiff competition from illicit drinking dens known as shebeens.\n\nIn Bulawayo, the more the city council improved its beer system after the second world war, the more contradictory the system became. It actively encouraged mass consumption of traditional beer, so that funds could be raised for modern health, housing and welfare services in the townships. Ashton himself was painfully aware of the contradictions.\n\nIn his guest introduction to a 1974 ethnographicmonographon Bulawayos beer gardens, he wrote:\n\nThe ambivalence of my position is obvious. How can one maintain a healthy community and a healthy profit at one and the same time? I can almost hear the critical reader questioning my morality and even my sanity. And why not? I have often done so myself.\n\nMany citizen groups  both African and European  questioned the system too. They called it illogical, if not immoral; even some government ministers said it had gone too far. And when some beer gardens were constructed close to European residential areas, to cater for African domestic workers, many Europeans reacted with fear and fury.\n\nAs Zimbabweans struggle for independence took off in the 1960s, African residents increasingly associated the beer halls and gardens with state neglect, repression, or pacification. They periodically boycotted or vandalised them. Nevertheless, with few alternative options, attendance rates remained high: MaKhumalo recorded 50,000 visitors on one Sunday in 1970.\n\nAfter Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980, the township beer gardens remained in municipal hands. They continued to be popular, even though racial desegregation had finally given township residents access to other social spaces across the city.\n\nThe colonial-era municipal beers continued to be produced, with Ngwebu (The Royal Brew) becoming a patriotic beverage for theNdebele the citys majority ethnic group.\n\nBut with the deindustrialisation of Bulawayo since the late 1990s, tens of thousands of blue collar workers have moved to greener pastures, mostly South Africa. The old drinking rhythm of the citys workforce has changed, and for the young, the beer gardens hold little allure. Increasingly, they have been leased out to private individuals to run.\n\nNevertheless, there is always a daily trickle of regulars to the beer gardens, where mugs and calabashes are passed around among friends or burial society members. Some punters play darts or pool. And there are always some who sit alone, ruminating  perhaps in the company of ghosts from the past.The beer gardens of Bulawayo embody the moral and practical contradictions of late colonial development  and the ways in which such systems and infrastructures may live on, but change meaning, in the post-colony.\n\nResearch Associate, School of Environment, Education and Development, University of Manchester\n\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.Read the original articlehere.\n\n",

The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, we understand that theZimDiaspora Property Showcase is backinthe UK and will be held in Birmingham, UK on 12thJuly, 2025. What can the diaspora market expect?\n\nVM: Yes, I am glad that the Zim Diaspora Property Showcase is back in the UK and will be held in Birmingham on Saturday, 12thJuly, 2025 at the Hilton Metropole between 10am to 5pm.\n\nThanks again to its organisers, Seeff Zimbabwe, this showcase is unique in that it allows real estate and complementary businesses operating in Zimbabwe to engage and discuss with the market in the Diaspora. What is key to latch on to is that these businesses were already offering services to the diaspora market.\n\nThe difference now is that the Zimbabwe-based businesses and the diaspora market can operate from a position of mutual understanding and benefit. The aim is to create a symbiotic and not parasitic relationship between the businesses and their markets.\n\nThe event will showcase businesses in the Zimbabwe real estate industry, including complementary businesses like construction companies, money transfer agents, building equipment suppliers and mortgage providers to engage with their market, tinkering with their payment options to suit specific markets.\n\nReporter:What can the UK community expect from the event?\n\nVM: The community in the United Kingdom can expect that the 15 or more companies attending the event from Zimbabwe will showcase exciting deals and real estate products for the UK market.\n\nOur first showcase in July last year in Birmingham opened the business attendees eyes to the unique needs of this particular market. The diaspora property showcase in Texas, USA assisted the Zimbabwe businesses to understand the general needs of the diaspora community in their quest to invest and have properties in Zimbabwe.\n\nI say this so that the attendees understand that the participants this year have a more developed idea of how to tailor their products for this unique market to allow for more people to own properties, while also considering their unique economic and social obligations in their host countries. A commercialquid pro quo.\n\nReporter: What can we expect from your presentation on legal issues affecting property investments?\n\nVM: I suppose I represent one of the complementary businesses, as no property transaction in Zimbabwe can be done without the assistance of a lawyer and if somehow it is done without one, in more cases than not, a lawyer will get involved at a later stage to mitigate the mess.\n\nMy presentation at the conference will be aimed at clarifying or simplifying to the UK diaspora community the Zimbabwe legal and regulatory framework for real estate investment. My presentation will cover the investment process, including other ancillary social and commercial issues that may affect such investment.\n\nThe overarching objective is to ensure that potential investors at the conference are able to invest safely and wisely in Zimbabwe. To the foreign investors, my presentation will include issues related to the repatriation of capital and profits on disinvestment.\n\nReporter: The main concern for the diaspora is that they are not duped of their hard-earned money, will your presentation also look at what to do not to be duped?\n\nVM: That will be the crux of my presentation to mitigate that possibility so that attendees do not fall victim to fraudsters.\n\nOur property development sector is growing and the natural thing in any growing industry is that unscrupulous people view it as an opportunity for quick gains. The carrot normally being unrealistic deals that offer quick and commercially ridiculous gains.\n\nIt has been my experience that real estate investments should be made with a sober mindset having completed the necessary due diligence required. It is your classic aphorism, all that glitters is not gold.\n\nReporter: Are there any other presenters?\n\nVM: Yes, we have heads of banks and banking departments presenting at the conference offering mortgages and other financial products, Real Estate directors and agents, property developers, alternative energy players and many more attending and presenting at the conference.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima. We have to end here due to time constraints.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

As per leading retailers, a key impediment to viability has been S.I 81A of 2024, an exchange control act that mandated the selling of goods and services at the official exchange rate, noted the report.\n\nIt further though stated that Zimbabwesoperating environment for companiesremained challenging overall, citing key issues such as elevated production costs as well as sporadic operating liquidity squeezes in light of the tightening of monetary conditions.\n\nIt mentioned emerging cost pressures including the governments recent increase of 19.1% to the diesel levy as further worsening costs for companies.\n\nHeadwinds in Zimbabwe had already affected Hippo Valley, which has had to rightsize its workforce with 1 000 workers expected to be let go by August.\n\nOK Zimbabwe, another prominent retailer battling headwinds, is now undertaking a $30m rights issue to stabilize the company. The retailer has also announced further closures of stores, pointing to a 2025 year that remains volatile and fragile, but with a possibility of better performances by consumer companies.\n\n",
