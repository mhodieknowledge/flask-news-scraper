As far as I know, you liked it, and you are ready to build it in Zimbabwe with our help. We are willing to assist you in this, said Lukashenko, as quoted by Belarus state media.\n\nZimbabwes healthcare system is likely to collapse further following a halt in funding from the United States of America, which had assisted in providing medicines to vulnerable communities.\n\nDespite the government downplaying the current state of hospitals, health institutions are in dire straits, with patients required to bring their own essential supplies.\n\nWednesday, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Lukashenkos government to refurbish Parirenyatwa Hospital.\n\nHowever, critic Hopewell Chinono is sceptical about the agreement, raising concerns over its lack of transparency.\n\nThere is nothing he will bring from Belarus that you cannot find in South Africa, China, or Europe, where the goods are actually cheaper than in Belarus. The only difference is that it is harder to steal as much as he wants from those other countries!\n\nWe await the details of the prices of the medical goods that will be procuredwe will find out soon! said Chinono in a social media post.\n\n",

            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nFORMER Zimbabwe Peoples Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) combatants, widows and children of fallen fighters have so far spent three cold winter nights camped on a piece of land in Chinhoyi, Mashonaland West, in protest over the governments failure to facilitate the reclamation of their properties.\n\nThe land, on which a new suburb named Pearview has been established by a private land developer, reportedlybelongs to Nitram Holdings, a company established by former ZIPRA fighters after independence in 1980.\n\nNitram is a holding company formed by the ex-freedom fighters from their demobilisation payments. The veterans contributed $50 each from their demobilisation pay-outs after independence and purchased 52 properties, which include farms, hotels and buildings.\n\nIn a bid to reclaim the property allegedly seized by Zanu PF bigwigs and their cronies during the height of the Gukurahundi atrocities in the 1980s, the ex-ZIPRA combatants, led by Moffat Commander Karomo, have set up camp at a site opposite Mzari Extension, near Machamire area, in Chinhoyi.\n\nThe group numbering nearly 50, comprises former liberation struggle veterans, widows and children of those who died before and after independence.\n\nThe protestors say they will stay put for as long as it takes for whoever forcibly grabbed the property, and many others dotted across the town and countrywide, to hand over the properties to them.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com in Chinhoyi this Wednesday, Karomo claimed their actions, as staged recently at Glen Forest where another of Nitram properties lies, had the blessings of Vice President Kembo Mohadi.\n\nWe are here with the blessings of VP Mohadi, and we are here to take back what was illegally taken away from ZIPRA combatants, widows and their children who are wallowing in abject poverty, said Karomo.\n\nHe claimed President Emmerson Mnangagwa had tasked the veterans to identify their properties across the country so he could facilitate their repossession.\n\nIn Chinhoyi, Karomo claims that besides owning the vast land on which Pearview medium-density suburb was sited, Nitram is the legitimate owner of Old Chinhoyi Hotel and Caves Hotel, currently under the management of the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority (ZimParks).\n\nKaromo said it has taken far too long since Mnangagwa promised to facilitate the return of Nitram Holdings stolen properties.\n\nMnangagwa must show his sincerity now. Since he instructed us to identify our properties, we are doing exactly that, thats why we are here in Chinhoyi today on one of our properties. We are not here to fight anyone, but those who took what doesnt belong to them are the ones out to fight us.\n\nIts been 45 years of being taken for a ride. We are not politicking nor engaging in factional politics. We are all Zanu PF, but we want to hear from President Mnangagwa what he has to say, now that we have identified our properties, Karomo told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nA widow of a former ZIPRA combatant, Cecilia Moyo, said her late husband had confided in her of the vast wealth ex-guerilla fighters had accumulated courtesy of investment in Nitram Holdings.\n\nShe demanded the legacy of her children and grandchildren, which Nitram Holdings amassed under the stewardship of late Vice President Joshua Nkomo.\n\nWe are suffering from hypertension and other chronic diseases because of this matter. We are being victimised on the small plots where we were settled, yet we have all this wealth. We are suffering while some crooked people are enjoying our childrens inheritance, said Moyo.\n\nIn respect of the Chinhoyi land where the group is camped, Moyo claimed an Indian descendant only identified as Khan, now late, who was linked to late VP Nkomo, had knowledge of its ownership as well as the inventory of other Nitram Holdings properties in Mashonaland West.\n\nMoyo says the late Khans son has to answer for his father on how he transferred the disputed land to its current purported owner.\n\nFarai Madzvanya, a representative of children of war veterans, appealed to Mnangagwa to facilitate the expeditious return of the properties, an inheritance bequeathed to them by their now deceased fathers, who themselves never benefited from it.\n\nGovernment, which seized Nitram Holdings properties following the alleged discovery of arms caches at some farms in Midlands and Bulawayo provinces, is accused of dragging its feet in proceedings to return the properties to ex-ZIPRA fighters, widows and their children.\n\nTheNitram Holdings board is on record accusing some unnamed influential government officials of scuttling efforts to repossess their properties.\n\n",

            "content": "By Enos Denhere | VaccinesWork\n\nZimbabwes recovery from a deadly 2022 measles outbreak shows how community engagement, religious partnerships and education transformed vaccine hesitancy into proactive health-seeking behaviour nationwide.\n\nAmai Nyashas first-born was nine years old in in April 2022, when a ferocious measles outbreak began, soon sweeping through all ten provinces of Zimbabwe.By early October, thousandsof people had been infected, andmore than 750 childrenhad been killed.\n\nI didnt wait  I took her in for vaccination right away, recalled Amai Nyasha at a recent routine immunisation session at a clinic in Budiriro, Harare. Three years had passed, and she was back with her young son. This time, it hadnt taken the pressing threat of a deadly epidemic to prompt preventive action. The awareness campaigns helped me make the right decision, she said.\n\nFor health workers and parents alike, the memory of the 2022 measles epidemic is a sobering one. Routine immunisation had been severely disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In some communities, especially among apostolic religious groups, vaccine resistance had grown.\n\nThe outbreak was a tragic wake-up call, said Dr Aspect J.V. Maunganidze, Permanent Secretary in theMinistry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC). It showed us where our systems were weak, but it also forced us to act decisively.\n\nIn immediate response to the ballooning epidemic, the government launched a two-phase nationwide measles vaccination campaign. In the first phase, targeting children under five years, 1,970,123 children (85.9% of the 2,292,898 target) were vaccinated. The second phase, rolled out in early 2023, focused on older children, aged 5 to 14, in high-risk districts such as Chipinge, Gutu, Mazowe and Chiredzi.\n\nWere not just reacting anymore. Were building systems that prevent, that educate, that respond faster.\n\n Sister Ratowa\n\nThese figures, provided by the MoHCC, demonstrate a rapid and determined scaling-up of efforts. But behind the numbers lies a deeper human story  one of fears faced, myths dispelled and communities rallied.\n\nIn Budiriro, a densely populated suburb of Harare, the epidemic felt close and personal. Wilbert Mavhunga, a carpenter whose workshop is just steps from the Budiriro Polyclinic, recalls the uncertainty that spread faster than the virus itself. Rumours were everywhere, he said. People were saying the measles vaccines were actually COVID-19 vaccines in disguise.\n\nThe generalised sense of anxiety of the pandemic had left many families gripped by confusion, and trust between communities and the healthcare system frayed. But health workers, trained in community engagement, launched a door-to-door initiative to combat hesitancy.\n\nThey patiently explained the risks of measles and how vaccines could protect our children, said Mavhunga. Eventually, my wife and I agreed  it was better to act than to fear. Today, Im thankful we did.\n\nSister Mayoyo, Family Health Services In-Charge at Budiriro Polyclinic, oversaw much of this grassroots effort. We targeted children from four months to fifteen years, visiting homes and organising local clinics, she said. Education was our first tool. We wanted people not just to vaccinate, but to understand why.\n\nReligious engagement proved pivotal. Apostolic communities, which have historically resisted vaccinations, were approached not with judgement, but with empathy and partnership.\n\nWe reached out to church leaders respectfully, said Sister Ratowa, head of maternity services at Budiriro. We promised that there would be no media attention on their vaccination participation, which helped build trust.\n\nAt monthly baby clinics, mothers received consistent education on the importance of vaccines. These sessions allowed health staff to answer concerns directly, helping shift public opinion over time.\n\nVaccines are free and accessible. But access must be matched with trust. Thats where our ongoing engagement comes in.\n\n Dr Maunganidze\n\nDr Maunganidze echoed the importance of these partnerships. We worked closely with interfaith groups  Catholics, Muslims, Traditionalists, Apostolics. They cascaded health messages to their congregations, and that made all the difference.\n\nThe interfaith coalition included the Zimbabwe Council of Churches, Catholic Bishops Conference, UDACIZA, and Islamic Council, among others. Their participation helped bridge cultural divides and brought hesitant communities into the fold.\n\nIn every successful campaign, leadership on the ground matters. Francis Musiyiwa, a respected elder and religious leader in Budiriro, played a key role in reaching local apostolic families.\n\nI knew our people needed reassurance, said Musiyiwa. They trust church leaders more than anyone. So, I spoke to leaders of churches, organised meetings, and even shared information in our WhatsApp groups.\n\nMusiyiwas efforts helped shift the tone of the conversation from suspicion to protection. Every message shared was a chance to save a childs life, he said. His commitment left a lasting impression on his community.\n\nThe campaigns impact in Budiriro was striking. The area is home to 1,754 children under one year, 6,023 children aged one to four, and 19,061 under the age of 15.\n\nWere not just fighting measles. Were building a healthier future  child by child, family by family, door by door.\n\n Sister Mayoyo\n\nThanks to strong community engagement, Budiriro reached close to 100% coverage during the height of the outbreak, according to local health staff. Vaccines were transported using mobile teams equipped with vaccine carriers and ice packs. When overwhelmed, clinics hired additional staff to maintain the response.\n\nHealth teams are now better prepared for future outbreaks. Were not just reacting anymore, said Sister Ratowa. Were building systems that prevent, that educate, that respond faster.\n\nZimbabwe is planning a root cause analysis of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks in June 2025. The findings will feed into a national multi-year plan to improve immunisation infrastructure, access and education.\n\nAmong the priorities are building health posts in underserved areas, expanding mobile outreach and continuous capacity-building for health personnel.\n\nVaccines are free and accessible, emphasised Dr Maunganidze. But access must be matched with trust. Thats where our ongoing engagement comes in.\n\nThe 2022 measles outbreak laid bare Zimbabwes public health vulnerabilities. But instead of despair, the country responded with resolve.\n\nFor parents like Amai Nyasha, for leaders like Francis Musiyiwa, and for health staff like Sisters Mayoyo and Ratowa, this chapter is not the end  but a beginning.\n\nWere not just fighting measles,said Sister Mayoyo. Were building a healthier future  child by child, family by family, door by door.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nZimbabwe is set to get its first dollar-denominated real estate investment trust listing on Friday, as demand for property stocks grows.\n\nEagle REIT is seeking to raise $62 million from the listing on Zimbabwes US dollar-denominated Victoria Falls Exchange, said Bevin Ngara, managing director of Fidelity Life Asset Management Co., the property companys fund manager. It has already secured $24.5 million through a private placement and will use the money for projects in the resort city of Victoria Falls and Mazowe, according to a pre-listing statement.\n\nVFEX was chosen over the southern African nations local-currency bourse in Harare, the capital, as its easier to showcase value creation in dollars than in an emerging currency, Ngara said by text message on Wednesday.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Stock Exchange has two REIT listings  Tigere Property Fund and Revitus.\n\nInstitutional investors have been plowing into property stocks as a hedge against policy uncertainty, inflation and frequent currency crashes. Zimbabwe debuted the gold-backed ZiG last year, its sixth attempt at a functioning local currency since 2009.\n\nFunds under management invested in property increased to 47% in the final quarter of 2024 from 43.6% in the prior three months, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe, the industry regulator.\n\nREITs have become more popular than traditional asset classes, such as direct property ownership, listed equities and the money market, Ngara said.\n\nThey are particularly attractive as they can be sold much faster than physical property, said Lloyd Mlotshwa, head of research at IH Securities. They also frequently pay dividends, letting investors earn income from property without owning or managing it directly.\n\nInstitutional investors are more concerned about consistent dividend payments than capital gains, Ngara said. REITs guarantee consistent dividend payments.\n\nThese attributes have also made REITs popular in other destinations. Dubai Residential REIT recently drew demand for all units on offer within minutes.\n\nVFEX Chief Executive Officer Justin Bgoni said the exchange expects another REIT listing soon, declining to provide further details.\n\nThe Tigere REIT, listed in 2022, whetted institutional investors appetite for the asset class, Mlotshwa said. It will pay its 10th dividend to unit holders later this month.\n\nIn its first-quarter trading update, Tigere said, property remains the favored option for Zimbabwean investors seeking protection from currency shocks and foresees continued interest from individuals, corporates and pension funds looking for tangible exit options.\n\nConcerns of widespread price overheating within the sector are overstated, it said, noting pervasive supply-side gaps in key subsegments such as warehousing, affordable housing, quality retail infrastructure and office space.\n\n",
