            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE United Kingdom (UK) has removed former Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) boss Isaac Moyo, police Commissioner General Godwin Matanga and former army commander Anselem Sanyatwe from its sanctions list.\n\nMinister of State for Midlands and former Minister of State Security, Owen Ncube and the Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI) have also been removed from the list.\n\nAnnounced in a statement Tuesday, the four top officials and ZDI had been under sanctions for various human rights-related abuses.\n\nMoyo headed the dreaded CIO from 2017 until his exit earlier this year, taking charge of operations that included intimidation, abduction and assault of opposition politicians, human rights activists and journalists.\n\nNcube has been accused of being the godfather of mining gangs in the Midlands. He was fingered as the main man behind violent attacks that claimed the life of an opposition supporter in Kwekwe, in the run-up to the 2018 elections.\n\nThe UK announces the delisting of sanctions against individuals Owen Ncube, Isaac Moyo, Godwin Matanga, Anselem Sanyatwe, and the entity Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI), reads a statement on the UK governments website.\n\nThe revocations follow a similar move from the European Union in February 2025, when they delisted their last remaining entity (ZDI) whilst renewing their existing Zimbabwe sanctions framework.The US also removed a number of designations in March 2024.\n\nZDI was listed by the UK soon after late President Robert Mugabe chucked out the European Union (EU) observer mission ahead of the 2002 elections.\n\nIt stood accused of providing arms used in the abuse of ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nThe recent round of removals will be taken as a triumph for President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who has been on an overdrive courting the West.\n\nOver recent years, the EU, UK and America have eased restrictions on Zimbabweans and entities that had been fingered in corruption and human rights abuses.\n\n",

            "content": "As African eSports scene is growing fast, competitive gaming is attracting more viewers and more teams. However, to perform at a high level, players need one basic thing: strong and stable internet. Without it, real-time play becomes nearly impossible.\n\nAs eSports spreads across urban centres, better connectivity is helping the industry expand. Companies such ashttps://bizbet.africa/are watching this space closely. Many of them provide live odds and match coverage, relying on smooth streams and real-time updates. Poor speed limits not only gameplay, but also streaming and interaction.\n\nFast, consistent internet means lower lag, better reaction time, and access to online tournaments. It also improves player confidence. When the tech runs smoothly, skill becomes the real focus.\n\nSpeed is critical in eSports. A delay of even 100 milliseconds can change the outcome of a match. Most eSports titles depend on quick reflexes and real-time coordination. This makes internet performance as important as hardware or strategy.\n\nUrban gamers usually enjoy better conditions. Cities are more likely to have fibre lines or 4G/5G coverage. This is why most eSports hubs in Africa are in urban areas. Players gather in cafes or clubs where fast internet is guaranteed.\n\nSome betting-linked platforms also support gameplay tracking. Thehttps://bizbet.africa/mobileintegrates match data and team stats, including live feeds of tournament results. These services benefit when users experience smooth, uninterrupted access.\n\nFor those who follow streams or place live bets, fast internet is essential. They need real-time updates, not delayed scores. This creates a shared need for speed between gamers, platforms, and fans.\n\nWhile urban areas are progressing, gaps remain in rural regions. Limited bandwidth, high data costs, and poor infrastructure slow the growth of competitive gaming. Players may face issues connecting to servers or watching live matches.\n\nEfforts are being made to solve this. Gaming cafes, co-working spaces, and shared hubs offer fast internet in areas where home access is limited. Some developers now build lighter versions of games to suit slower speeds.\n\nIn addition, tech tools that allow low-latency match tracking often support bybizbet bet on sport. These features are built with mobile-first users in mind. This allows even mid-range devices to access real-time data without constant buffering.\n\nThe rise of mobile gaming also plays a role. Many Africans now compete or train on phones. This makes optimisation for mobile important. Fast loading times, reduced lag, and easy login improve the experience.\n\nGood internet access does more than improve play. It shapes the whole eSports economy. From coaching sessions and live commentary to sponsorship and betting markets, everything depends on smooth connectivity.\n\nKey areas affected by internet speed:\n\nIn many cities, local tournaments are beingstreamedfor the first time. This makes internet reliability even more vital. Fans want to follow favourite teams, comment on plays, and share clips. Without good bandwidth, these interactions stop.\n\nPlatforms offering sports odds and digital content rely on this as well. Live bets only work if data updates immediately. This is why strong mobile access supports both gaming and iGaming together.\n\nAfricas eSports future depends on internet growth. Faster networks mean more tournaments, better content, and larger audiences. Providers, platforms, and players all benefit.\n\nAs more users go online, and more titles enter the market, platforms will need to keep up. Investments in local infrastructure, device compatibility, and low-data apps will shape how far the industry can go.\n\nForAfrican gamers, internet speed is not just a technical need. It is part of how they train, compete, and earn. The more reliable the connection, the bigger the arena becomes.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nLISTED transport and logistics concern, Unifreight Africa Limited says the countrys tough economy added to high licensing fees is making operations very tough.\n\nIndustry has since raised similar concerns with the government over the years, now with several promises to deal with the problem being made. Several value chains in the economy are clogged with very costly, repetitive licensing fees, choking the ease of doing business.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments recently, Unifreights CEO, Richard Clarke, bemoaned the exorbitant licensing fees affecting transport sector players in the country.\n\nIn the transport sector specifically, operating costs in Zimbabwe are significantly higher than in neighbouring countries, which continues to squeeze margins. For example, fuel in Zimbabwe remains the most expensive in the region at around US$1,58 per litre, compared to about US$1,01 in Zambia. Vehicle registration and licensing fees are also exorbitantly high at roughly US$1,560 locally versus just US$132 in Zambia, he said.\n\nAdditionally, he said, diesel imports carry heavy duties (approx. USD 0.55 per litre)withexporters being forced to surrender 25% of foreign earnings for conversion into local currency (ZWG), which cannot be freely converted back to US$ at market rates.\n\nClarke said the combination of these challenges, added to currency volatility, liquidity constraints, inflationary pressures and a shortage of long-term financing in the local market, led many businesses to tighten their belts, creating a knock-on effect across supply chains.\n\nThe company said compounding cost pressures is the ongoing liquidity crunch in the banking sector prompting many financial institutions to pull back on lending, forcing companies, including Unifreight and our customers, to rely on shorter-term and more expensive financing.\n\nThese factors make operating a cross-border fleet out of Zimbabwe less attractive and more costly than regional competitors, Clarke said.\n\nMeanwhile, during the period, Unifreight Africa Limited delivered a strong start to 2025, with significant revenue growth in Q1.\n\nTotal revenues for the quarter surged by over 30% compared to the same period last year, reflecting robust demand and the success of recent strategic initiatives. Annual turnover rose from US$20.4 million in 2023 to US$24 million in 2024, and is forecast to reach US$32 million in 2025.\n\n",
