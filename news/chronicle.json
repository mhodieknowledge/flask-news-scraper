            "content": "Sikhumbuzo Moyo,[emailprotected]\n\nShocked to be discharged with a baby girl after giving birth to a boy via Caesarean section, a new mother from Bulawayos Cowdray Park suburb confirmed her suspicions through DNA testing about a month later.\n\nThe incident happened at United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) where the mother, who cannot be named due to ethical concerns, was discharged with a baby girl whose parents had already travelled to Esigodini in Matabeleland South with her son.\n\nThe testing, which cost a considerable US$220, was conducted at a laboratory in Bulawayos city centre to prove that the child given to the insistent mother by a maternity nurse at the hospital was not her biological offspring.\n\nThe day before the birth, she underwent a scan which confirmed she was expecting a boy. After the delivery, a nurse took the child for cleaning and returned it to the mother.\n\nThe mother, who had been taking photographs of her son, noticed the babys identification tag indicated it was a girl, said the source close to the woman, who lives in Cowdray Park.\n\nInitially unaware of the discrepancy, the new mother immediately alerted the nurse, expressing her concern. However, the nurse dismissed her concerns, suggesting that the effects of the anaesthesia for the Caesarean section might have clouded her judgment.\n\nAccording to the source, another expectant mother had been admitted to the ward just fifteen minutes before the operation, but she had already been discharged by the time the alert mother raised the alarm.\n\nShe contacted her relatives to inform them of the situation. Her uncle suggested DNA testing, but the nurse vehemently opposed the idea, claiming it was too expensive and unaffordable for the family. However, the uncle insisted, and they proceeded with the testing at a laboratory in the Bulawayo city centre. The results unequivocally confirmed that the baby girl was not her biological child.\n\nFurious, the family returned to the hospital, demanding answers and demanding the return of their biological son. Hospital staff were compelled to locate the other mother, who resided in Esigodini, Umzingwane District.\n\nA hospital vehicle was dispatched to retrieve her.However, the womans husband was unco-operative, adamantly insisting that the child was his.The police were subsequently involved, and the couple was brought to Bulawayo.\n\nAt the insistence of the aggrieved family, the hospital engaged the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) for DNA testing. The results unequivocally confirmed that the two babies had been exchanged.\n\nZephania Dlamini, head of the Applied Genetics Testing Centre at Nust, confirmed this shocking discovery.In the Bulawayo cases, two women who were in the same ward at UBH delivered around the same time.\n\nThe complainant asserted that her child was a boy, but when it was returned after cleaning, she was given a girl.Dlamini further said that when confronted with the discrepancy, the other mother adamantly insisted that her child was indeed a boy, a claim vehemently supported by her husband.\n\nHe even insisted that the ultrasound scan had confirmed the sex of the child as male. Before approaching Nust, the complainant had sought testing at Global DNA lab in the city centre, which confirmed that the baby girl was not hers.Our results corroborated these findings. Subsequent testing on the couple claiming to be the parents of the boy yielded negative results, while the boys DNA matched that of the complainant, and the girls DNA matched that of the other woman, said Dlamini.\n\nDr William Busumani\n\nDlamini revealed that the entire hospital administration was present at the laboratory during the testing process. UBH chief medical officer, William Busumani, declined to comment on the incident.\n\nWe do not discuss patient information, he stated.Maphios Siamuchembu, Provincial Medical Director for Bulawayo Metropolitan Province, said he was not aware of any reports of baby swapping from UBH.\n\nRenowned medical expert, Solwayo Ngwenya, described baby-swapping errors as tragic but avoidable with proper diligence.Receiving a child who is not your own is a devastating experience, particularly from a cultural perspective. In private medical practice, staff are rigorously trained to prevent such occurrences, and the lower volume of deliveries facilitates closer monitoring. We strive to ensure such errors never occur in private healthcare settings, as they would severely damage the institutions reputation, said Ngwenya.\n\nProfessor Solwayo Ngwenya\n\nHe stressed the importance of rigorous procedures in ensuring that each newborn is correctly identified and returned to their biological mother.\n\nImmediately after birth, each baby should be assigned a unique identification tag. This, combined with meticulous attention to detail and adherence to established protocols, is crucial in preventing these tragic errors.\n\nThere are likely many individuals who have been unknowingly raised by parents who are not their biological parents due to similar incidents. These individuals may have grown up in entirely different environments, speaking different languages, leading to profound and unforeseen consequences.\n\nNgwenya urged healthcare institutions to prioritise staff training on the importance of accurate newborn identification.These tragic incidents are entirely preventable. By adhering to strict protocols and maintaining a vigilant approach, we can ensure that such errors do not occur, Ngwenya stressed.\n\nThe case raises serious concerns about the potential for similar incidents to have occurred undetected, particularly among families who may not have the financial resources to pursue DNA testing.\n\nRichard Ndebele, a cultural expert, said that baby swapping was unheard of in the past due to the traditional system of village midwives.\n\nThose involved in such an act must be prepared to face the consequences, as misfortune may befall both the child and themselves. The child may experience difficulties throughout their life, and the perpetrators may face the wrath of their ancestors, Ndebele warned.\n\nHe further explained that traditional birth rites cannot be effectively performed for a child who is not biologically related to the family, as the ancestors would not recognise the child.\n\nThere can be no righteousness in such an act of deception. You may deceive mortal beings, but the ancestors will be aware of your actions, and any rituals performed will be rendered meaningless.\n\nMargaret Makumbe, a retired nurse with a distinguished career spanning four decades and delivering over 10 000 babies, stressed the unwavering commitment to excellence that characterised her profession.\n\nShe highlighted the paramount importance of meticulous attention to detail, a skill that every nurse and supervisor had to master to prevent any medical errors, such as the tragic case of a mother being mistakenly given the wrong baby.\n\nIn my entire career, I never experienced that wherever I was deployed, neither did I hear of it anywhere else and I think this was because we did what we did out of love. I just wonder how such a mistake can happen because once a baby is delivered the mother is shown the child before its taken away for cleaning with a name tag already strapped on the wrist, said Makumbe who at one time while at Mpilo delivered an incredible 15 babies in a single night.\n\n",

In a display of both love and remarkable bravery, Alois publicly proposed to Siphilisiwe at her workplace at So Sweet in Bulawayo on December 28.\n\nWitnessing the heartfelt moment were her superiors. Alois, aware of the potential for public rejection that often goes viral on social media, meticulously planned this special moment over two weeks, aiming for a truly unforgettable and cherished experience.\n\nTheir love story began six years prior, on December 28, 2018, within the sacred walls of their church. While their journey together has not been without its challenges, their unwavering love has endured.\n\nSiphilisiwe Mangena and Alois Mutambu on the day he proposed\n\nOver the past five years, I have been nurturing the woman I wish to spend the rest of my life with. We faced numerous obstacles, with many disapproving of our relationship, said Alois.\n\nSiphilisiwe echoed his sentiments, revealing that their bond blossomed from friendship.\n\nI first met my fianc in early 2018 at church. Back then, he was just another face in the crowd, and I paid him little attention. Every girl seemed infatuated with him, but I couldnt see what they saw in him. I wasnt particularly interested in dating at the time.\n\nThen, one of his friends introduced us, and we began to converse. Our friendship deepened, and eventually, he expressed his interest in me. Thats when I started to understand the appeal he held for others. It was on December 26 that he asked me out, and I agreed to a date on the 28th. He was my first boyfriend, she recounted.\n\nWith the help of Siphilisiwes boss, her uncle, and Aloiss brother, a beautiful surprise was orchestrated. Siphilisiwe vividly recalls the day.\n\nAlois informed me that he had an event to MC, so he needed to look his best. I assisted him in selecting shoes and an outfit, you know, the usual preparations. He told me the event was on December 28 and that I should also prepare myself. He wanted me to accompany him. So, I ensured I looked my best. On the day, I was at work  Im a barista at So Sweet Coffee Shop.\n\nWe finished work, but we were instructed to stay for a meeting with the boss, even though no meeting was scheduled. I was becoming impatient, eager to join my boyfriend. Suddenly, my uncle and a friend arrived at the workplace. I bombarded them with questions, and then I saw Alois enter, looking dapper, though there was something slightly off about his demeanour.\n\nSiphilisiwe said that despite the unexpected nature of the proposal, which left her speechless, she never hesitated in her response.\n\nHe presented me with roses, and before I could even react, he was kneeling. I was completely taken aback. I didnt know what to say, and when I saw the red box, I was simply staring at him, unable to utter a word until everyone started shouting yes! And there I was, saying yes before he even asked.\n\nI didnt feel nervous or pressured because Im accustomed to being in the spotlight  I sing in church. However, in that moment, I felt completely frozen.\n\nSiphilisiwe beamed as she described the ring.\n\nSiphilisiwe Mangena stunned\n\nI adore everything about it. It reflects my personality, exuding elegance and maturity. Im completely smitten with it. The amusing part is that it fit perfectly. This proposal holds immense significance for me because it marked our fifth anniversary. He has been an incredible partner throughout these years, making me feel cherished and valued.\n\nThe fact that he chose my workplace, the place where I pour my heart and soul into my work, to create this unforgettable memory makes it even more special. This proposal has positively impacted our relationship. We now command greater respect from those around us and have grown even closer. Being engaged is the most incredible feeling. If I feel this way now, I can only imagine how Ill feel on my wedding day.\n\nAlois acknowledged that proposing in public was a daunting prospect, filled with uncertainty about the outcome. He also faced financial challenges but persevered.\n\nAs the moment approached, my foot was tapping nervously, and my mind was racing. I was constantly wondering if it would go well, and my heart was pounding. When I knelt down, my mind went blank for a moment as I tried to gauge her reaction.\n\nI remember calling my brother to discuss my plan to propose to her at her workplace. He advised me to speak with her boss and explain my intentions, as a sign of respect for my partner. The entire planning process took two weeks. The most challenging aspect was when I lost the money I had saved for the event. However, by the grace of God, I was able to recover it, and everything went according to plan.\n\nI received invaluable support from my friends, and her boss was incredibly helpful. Even my pastors stood by me. The event was a complete surprise, and I am grateful to everyone for keeping it a secret.\n\nHe shared his thoughts on his partner and their relationship.\n\nMy partner is someone I can trust and rely on completely. She embodies 90 percent of the qualities I desire in a woman. No one is perfect, but I feel safe with her. My favourite moments are those early days of our relationship  you know how girls are when a relationship is new, those moments are priceless.\n\nWe are praying for Gods guidance and alignment with His plan. As the scripture says, For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord. My partner is honest, respectful, empathetic, courageous, responsible, kind, humble, confident, hardworking, and a woman of prayer, he said.\n\nAlois further expressed his apprehension leading up to the proposal.\n\nThe thought of being rejected was nerve-wracking. I experienced moments of anxiety, constantly praying for a positive response. Thankfully, she said yes before I could even utter the words, and it was a dream come true.\n\nAlois voiced his gratitude to the individuals who have been pillars of support throughout their journey:\n\nI am deeply grateful to my pastors, Keith Bhehane and Talent Bhehane of Rhema Word Ministries. They have provided us with unwavering support, along with all our friends who came to celebrate with us. And, of course, my family  they are the best team ever.\n\nHe concluded by sharing that plans for the traditional bride price and a grand wedding are currently underway.\n\n",

This is as it should be because members of opposition political parties are Zimbabweans first and foremost hence should work for Zimbabwes development and prosperity.\n\nZimbabweans should have a shared vision when it comes to national interests regardless of ones political affiliation. The engagement between the ruling party Zanu-PF and opposition political parties is very commendable as it is meant to promote the countrys development.\n\nThe ruling party and opposition Members of Parliament should be guided by what is in the best interest of Zimbabweans because they were elected into office to serve all citizens.\n\nDelegates at the Zanu-PF Gwanda inter-district party meeting\n\nWe totally agree with the interim secretary-general of the Citizen Coalition for Change (CCC), Senator Sengezo Tshabangu that engaging the ruling party Zanu-PF does not only enhance democracy but also promotes national development. Sen Tshabangu who is also the leader of the opposition in Parliament, dismissed claims that engaging the ruling party was tantamount to betrayal.\n\nIt is certainly strange reasoning to suggest that an opposition party which engages the ruling party is selling out, said Mr Tshabangu.\n\nIn the past the opposition political parties were criticised for their penchant for confrontation and violence which caused destruction. The situation has completely changed now, much to the chagrin of the countrys detractors.\n\nPresident Mnangaggwa has said the opposition legislators must give their ruling party counterparts a hard time in Parliament to build and develop Zimbabwe.\n\nHe said the ruling party MPs must be made to account so that they deliver for the general citizenry. The developments witnessed during the past few days confirm that the opposition political parties now realise that they have an obligation to contribute to the social and economic development of the country and this is very encouraging.\n\nZimbabwe is endowed with abundant natural resources that can make a difference and what is required is for citizens to unite and exploit these resources regardless of their political persuasions.\n\nIt is therefore incumbent upon each and every Zimbabwean to act responsibly and refuse to be used by the countrys detractors to disturb peace, a prerequisite for economic development.\n\n",

At that time, the Zimbabwean team, which featured Flower, his brother Grant, Heath Streak, Mpumelelo Mbangwa, Murray Goodwin, Guy Whittall, and Alistair Campbell, found themselves on the verge of a famous historic victory.\n\nThey needed 212 runs to win with nine wickets in hand, but the match was eventually called off due to rain disruptions. It ended as a draw. Zimbabwe lost the two-match series 1-0.\n\nIn an interview conducted by Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club, Flower took a trip down memory lane to recall the last time Zimbabwe played at one of Englands iconic cricket venues.\n\nAndy Flower\n\nThis is a beautiful place to play cricket. There is always a nice atmosphere. It has the look and feel of traditional English cricket, and usually the conditions here are excellent in any format of the game.\n\nAfter getting soundly beaten at Lords, the Trent Bridge Test was an excellent game of cricket. We had some outstanding cricketers.\n\nI felt that in our group, Murray Goodwin and Neil Johnson had made a huge impact when they came to play for us, and they did here at Trent Bridge as well.\n\nWe were able to put England under some pressure, even though it was a rain-affected game.\n\nWe made a brave declaration towards the end of a day, took some early wickets with the new ball, and had them under pressure. It ended up as a drawn Test, but it was a great game of cricket.\n\nAs you know, this is a beautiful place to play cricket, there is always a nice atmosphere. It has the look and feel of traditional English cricket, and usually, the conditions here are excellent for cricket in any format. Wonderful memories of Trent Bridge from back then. It was great to be involved in a match like that, said Flower.\n\n25 years since that game, Zimbabwe will return to West Bridgford for a historic four-day Test match against the Three Lions.\n\nThe match is scheduled for May 22-25, marking the Chevrons first visit to England since 2003.\n\nAs Zimbabwe prepares to return to Trent Bridge  a venue named the best in England for Mens International Spectator Experience at the 2024 Business of Cricket Awards  Flower said it is a privilege for the Chevrons to be touring England for a Test match, as it is considered one of the pinnacles of the game.\n\nHe urged the Zimbabwean team to embrace the challenge and showcase their talent, encouraging the players to represent the badge with pride.\n\nAndy Flower\n\nPlaying Test cricket in England is viewed as one of the pinnacles of our game. So for any touring side to come here and play Test cricket is an amazing privilege, and Im sure the Zimbabweans  who dont play much Test cricket these days  will really embrace that. I hope two things: that they really enjoy the challenge in front of them and enjoy the experience, and also that they show that they can play.\n\nI remember back to my early days with Zimbabwe, one of our biggest drivers was being proud of representing the nation and the sport from our country, and trying everything within your power to put on a display that justified our Test status at that time. I hope that the Zimbabwean players can do that out here, he said.\n\nFlower has already had the privilege of meeting the Chevrons coach, Justin Sammons, who took over the reins in June last year as a replacement for Dave Houghton. The Zimbabwean great was impressed by the South African and is confident that Sammons knows what he is doing and will steer the ship well.\n\nA strong performance at an iconic venue is something that will linger in the minds of the current Chevrons squad forever.\n\nZimbabwe has a new coach in Justin Sammons. I met him and had a chat when I was commentating on their T20 series against India. He really knows what hes doing, and Im sure hell be preparing them as well as he can for this challenge.\n\nTest cricket for Zimbabwe is a rare opportunity for both the players and spectators. To play at an iconic venue like Trent Bridge, hopefully in great conditions, with Zimbabwe putting on a great display of cricket and fight  that will be something the players will always remember.\n\nIts also another nudge towards Test cricket, at a time when Test cricket is being challenged by these other formats. Its being challenged for context, so this will be a big moment for Zimbabweans, Zimbabwean cricket, and also for Test cricket, Flower said.\n\nFlower also called on the staff at Nottinghamshire and Trent Bridge to do everything they could to create a pitch that is fair to both bat and ball.\n\nHe urged the Chevrons to be prepared, both physically and mentally, for the tough challenge ahead.\n\nThe Dukes ball in England can be a challenging affair for batters, so theyll have to get themselves organised and ready for that challenge. Trent Bridge can be really tricky, depending on the overhead conditions and the state of the pitch.\n\nIf we get weather like this (clear skies) and the conditions ease a little, it can be beautiful for batting.\n\nBut if we get overhead conditions, its going to be really tricky, with seaming and swinging conditions. The Zimbabweans arent used to Test cricket or those conditions, so they are going to be really up for that battle, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Mbulelo Mpofu,[emailprotected]\n\nTHE buzz around the Amapiano music scene is palpable, and today marks a significant moment for fans in Bulawayo as the celebrated South African artiste, Scotts Maphuma, makes his highly anticipated debut performance at the Cosmopolitan VIP Lounge.\n\nKnown for his infectious catchphrase, Bathini bona, Maphuma has taken the music world by storm with hits like Beke le beke, Biri Marung, and Shayi moto.\n\nThe performance promises to be an electrifying experience for attendees, fuelled by the demand from enthusiastic fans. Organised by 3D Events, the concert is set to carry on the festive spirit of January, following a vibrant holiday season.\n\nMduduzi Mdlongwa, the director of 3D Events, expressed his excitement about bringing Maphuma to Bulawayo.\n\nScotts Maphuma is by far the hottest artiste right now. We had plans to bring him in December, but due to other commitments on his part, we couldnt have him. Why January? Because we want to continue with the festive mood from December. We hope to have a great time with him.\n\nTo enhance the concert experience, 3D Events has partnered with ZimTickets, a leading ticketing company that is transforming the e-ticketing landscape in Bulawayo and beyond. The collaboration aims to streamline ticket sales and improve access control for the high-demand event.\n\nZimTickets has emerged as a game-changer in the ticketing sector, offering a host of features that set it apart from traditional ticketing platforms. Prudence Moyo, the Sales, Marketing, and Operations Manager at ZimTickets, highlighted the companys commitment to providing a seamless ticketing experience.\n\nZimTickets allows attendees to receive digital tickets that can be easily shared through email or messaging apps like WhatsApp. This convenience ensures that fans can secure their tickets without the hassle of physical copies.\n\nThe platform boasts a secure access control system designed to minimise ticket leakage and unauthorised entry, ensuring that only legitimate ticket holders gain access to the event, she said.\n\nFor event organisers unfamiliar with digital ticketing, ZimTickets offers various options, including Quick Response (QR) codes, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) wristbands, and RFID card tickets. These technologies enhance security and streamline the entry process, making it easier for attendees to access the venue.\n\nShe also outlined how, Organisers have direct access to ZimTickets system, allowing them to monitor ticket sales progress, manage event logistics, and make real-time adjustments as necessary.\n\nFurthermore, the platform provides detailed, real-time reports on ticketing data. Organisers can track ticket sales, attendee entry and exit patterns, and identify no-shows, offering valuable insights into audience behaviour.\n\nZimTickets has shown the potential to deliver marketing reports based on attendee behaviour observed during entry, helping organisers tailor their strategies for future events. Unlike other platforms that prioritise maximising sales volume, ZimTickets places significant emphasis on reducing ticket leakage.\n\nIn support of Maphumas performance, local artistes such as Mzistozz Mfanafuthi, Crazy Dee, and DJ Sands will also take to the stage, showcasing the vibrant local music scene. This blend of local and regional talent promises to create a rich cultural experience for attendees.\n\nFollow on X @MbuleloMpofu\n\n",

            "content": "Innocent Kurira,[emailprotected]\n\nHIGHLANDERS legend Joel Luphahla, now at the helm of Simba Bhora, is under no illusions about the daunting task ahead.\n\nTaking over the reins of the Shamva-based side, Luphahla faces the uphill battle of rebuilding a team that won the league title last season.\n\nHe has assembled a squad made up of experienced campaigners and his immediate challenge will be to mould them into a cohesive unit capable of challenging for honours in Zimbabwe and in Africa.\n\nLuphahla, who has had coaching stints with TelOne, Golden Eagles, Highlanders, and won the Chibuku Super Cup trophy with Dynamos last season, is not frightened by the task ahead.\n\nIf Luphahla does not know the industrial scale of the job he has taken on, then he will soon find out. His task is monumental.\n\nHe has to rebuild a team that has lost 13 key players, including Soccer Star of the Year Walter Musona. The mass exodus is leaving a gaping hole in the squad, and Luphahla has to act quickly to bring in new talent.\n\nThe pressure is on to deliver results, and Luphahla knows that he has to hit the ground running fast.\n\nThe challenge is further complicated by the fact that Simba Bhora are not only defending their Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title but also making their debut in the Caf Champions League.\n\nLloyd MaBlanyo Chigowe and his assistant Joel Luphahla after winning the 2024 Chibuku Super Cup\n\nThe stakes are high, and Luphahla has to navigate the team through uncharted territory. He has to balance the need to rebuild the team with the pressure to deliver results, all while navigating the complexities of African club football.\n\nThe heavy burden will not fall on Luphahlas shoulders alone. Simba Bhora has unveiled a bloated thirteen-member technical team ahead of the 2025 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season and their debut Caf Champions League campaign.\n\nA commendable step towards professionalism and the latest global technical team set-up trends. Luphahla will be assisted by Paul Chimalizeni and Yahanne Bauti, while Daniel Khumalo, who joins from Highlanders, is the goalkeepers coach.\n\nEverything is going well, I am settling in well into the job, though challenges will always be there in football. Football is a pressure game, and pressure always brings out the best in an individual who wants to succeed. We are losing some good players to other clubs, but we are equally bringing in quality to shore up for lost positions.\n\nThis is a big test for me now that I am the man making decisions, but I am confident that we can make the people of Shamva happy. The players we are bringing in are amazing, so we are happy with their progress, though not yet satisfied, because any coach is never satisfied with their squad, says Luphahla.\n\nThe defending champions made a bold move by releasing 13 first-team players, including Soccer Star of the Year, Musona, who is joining newcomers Scottland alongside goalkeeper Talbert Shumba, Tichaona Chipunza, Tymon Machope, and Vassili Kawe. The mass exodus also includes experienced players Partson Jaure, Mthokozisi Msebe, Tymon Mvula, Perfect Chikwende, Valentine Musarurwa, Albert Manenji, Simbarashe Maramwidze, Onifade Obubaka, and Talent Chawapiwa.\n\nTo replenish their depleted squad, Simba Bhora secured the signatures of goalkeepers Tonderayi Mateyaunga from CAPS United and First Gandisani (Bikita Minerals), defenders Carlos Mavhurume (Ngezi Platinum Stars) and Kelvin Gwao, midfielder Liberty Chakaroma (Manica Diamonds), and striker Malvin Hwata (Chicken Inn). Additionally, Trevor Mavhunga, Donald Mudadi (Dynamos), and Never Tigere (Ngezi Platinum) have also joined Simba Bhora.\n\nAs part of their preparations for the next season, the reigning champions are set to leave the country for South Africa tomorrow and return on February 3.\n\nThey will have their pre-season training in Pretoria. The team will play several clubs in South Africa as part of their preparations before returning home. Simba Bhora are using this time away from home to try and create new combinations and adapt to Luphahlas type of play.\n\nSimba Bhora will return home for a Castle Challenge Cup match against Dynamos on a date to be announced in February. The Cup match is a season curtain-raiser and is played between reigning league champions and Chibuku Super Cup winners.\n\n@innocentskizoe\n\n",

They were subsequently deported during the week, Mr Phiri said.\n\nHe indicated that the team on the ground will provide a comprehensive update on the situation by the weekend.Our team is on-site and we expect to receive a detailed report by Sunday. Our primary focus is to determine if any other Zimbabweans are among the rescued individuals or those who unfortunately lost their lives in the mine, said Mr Phiri.\n\nBrigadier Athlenda Mathe, South Africas national police spokesperson, confirmed in a statement on Thursday that rescue operations had been concluded.\n\nAccording to the mine rescue service, there are no longer any illegal miners trapped underground. However, a cage will be sent underground as a precautionary measure, Brigadier Mathe said.\n\n",
