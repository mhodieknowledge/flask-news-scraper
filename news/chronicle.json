Makombe takes over from Cde Kholwani Mbambo, who had been serving as Acting Chairman since 2022.\n\nThe last congress was held in 2020, during which Cde Raymond Chiwara was elected chairman. He was removed two years later following allegations of corruption.\n\nCde Makombe garnered 78 votes, narrowly defeating Cde Lenin Samhembere from Mashonaland West Province, who received 68 votes. Another candidate, Tawanda Chenana from Mashonaland East Province, was disqualified from the chairman race after failing to provide proof that he is the son of a war veteran.\n\nOther candidates elected include Cde Darlington Ndlovu as Vice Chairman, Cde Mbuso Mpofu as Secretary General, Cde Prince Mfudza as Secretary for Commissariat, Cde Flint Matenda as Secretary for Security, and Cde Emmanuel Musabaikana as Secretary for Transport and Welfare.\n\nCde Makombe commented that the election went well and that he is ready to lead the Children of War Veterans.\n\nIndeed, it was a tight contest, but I am happy the election was held freely and fairly, and that everyone was satisfied with the results. Its time to chart a new era, addressing the plights of the Children of Liberation War Veterans and supporting the vision of our nation, he said.\n\nCZLWVA is an offshoot of the Liberation War Veterans, a wing of the revolutionary party, ZANU-PF.\n\nThe Children of Liberation War Veterans are hopeful that the new leadership will push for their welfare, including access to education through school fee assistance and economic empowerment initiatives such as access to land and business opportunities.\n\nI am happy with the outcome of the election, which was decided by all provinces. I hope that our concerns, such as access to land, mines, and other development projects, will be addressed, commented Chiedza Maraire, one of the voters from Mashonaland West.\n\n",

I have left the EFF, I have left party politics. EFF is a political party. I have handed in my resignation as a member, and it is because where I want to go and contribute, I cant hold a single-party membership, he said.\n\nBut overall, I think that Ive made my contribution, and I think that there are brilliant young men and women, old men and women in the space who will continue in that category, as it were, of party politics.\n\nNdlozis move comes after months of speculation about his future in the Red Berets.\n\nHis departure follows those of other high-profile EFF members this year, including former deputy leader Floyd Shivambu, former national chairperson Dali Mpofu, former public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane and former government spokesperson Mzwanele Manyi, all of whom defected to Jacob ZumasuMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party.\n\nIn January, Ndlozi resigned as an MP after losing his position in the EFFs central command team during the partys national elective conference in December. The rift between Ndlozi and the Red Berets came after thedeparture of his close ally Shivambu, which saw the former being sidelined from EFF discussions.\n\nEFF leader Julius Malema criticised party members for not pledging allegiance to the party after alleging that Ndlozi was aware of Shivambus plans to defect to the MK party but did not say anything.\n\nIn one instance, Malema indirectly criticised Ndlozis wife, actress Mmabatho Montsho, after she liked an Instagram post by Shivambu announcing his defection.\n\nIn his interview, Ndlozi confirmed that he was barred from attending the EFF national peoples assembly in December and had been suspended six weeks before it. He said this was because of reports that he was among the EFF leaders waiting for the right moment to defect to the MK party. Ndlozi said it was not his responsibility to inform the EFF leadership of Shivambus plans to leave the party.\n\nHe described the suspension as irregular, arguing that it did not align with the partys constitution.\n\nI was told to stay at home and not participate in parliament and the rest of the activities of the EFF. It was very important for me because they said that the investigation is still ongoing; when it is finished, Ill then be given an opportunity to respond. I think we can agree that these are very serious allegations, he said.\n\nNdlozi said his decision to speak out was aimed at clearing his name.\n\nThe EFF has not issued a formal response to his resignation, but party spokesperson Sinawo Thambo said his public pronouncements constituted a resignation and that the party wished him well.\n\nNdlozi was a founding member of the party and previously served as its national spokesperson and an MP.\n\n",

The visuals will also feature model and fitness trainer Klate alongside dancer Siya.\n\nSpeaking to Chronicle Showbiz Online, Mzoe 7 said this release is part of his promise to fans to drop new projects every month.\n\nI had the honour of working with Smashmaker on the song Tshilamoya, and I realised how talented he is  he brought out the soulful side of my music. After that, he sent me another beat just as I was returning from a seminar, where a speaker emphasised the importance of loving without expecting anything in return.Inspired by that, I crafted the lyrics for Ungamthanda, flipping the message to highlight the pain of loving someone who doesnt love you back.\n\nI also featured the incredibly talented Macala. Nurturing young talent is crucial because we wont be here forever. Its important to leave behind a solid legacy, and I believe these two artistes represent the future of our music industry. Their talent is out of this world.\n\nMzoe 7 further explained that the song tells the story of a young man who has given up on love, only for his friend to encourage him to remain hopeful but not to expect the same level of affection in return.\n\nOn the choice of locations for the video shoot, Mzoe 7 said it was important to showcase local landmarks and tell authentic stories.This soulful song speaks to the inner person, and Im confident that people will love it. As promised, I will be releasing a music video every month, as fans have been asking for more content.\n\n@mthabisi_mthire\n\n",
