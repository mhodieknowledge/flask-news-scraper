Beitbridge experienced significant rainfall, leading to most water bodies filling up.According to Beitbridge Civil Protection Unit chairperson, Mrs Sikhangezile Mafu Moyo, four people managed to swim across the river on Wednesday night.Four people managed to escape from the island that same night, while we successfully rescued four others with the help of a boat provided by the National Parks and Wildlife Authority. The subcommittee responsible for search and rescue, led by the police, carried out the mission, said Mrs Mafu Moyo.By midday, three individuals remained stranded on the island, with reports suggesting that there could be more people still marooned at the same location.When our news crew arrived at the scene, a relative had come to deliver food to the three individuals still trapped. The food had to be thrown across the riverbank, tied to stones.I heard about the incident when I came to collect some clients at a nearby food outlet. Someone who recognised my relative told me about it, so I decided to bring food for him and came here to see if I could assist, said Mr Itayi Tavarwisa.He stated that his relative and the others were waiting for the water current to subside before attempting to cross the river into Zimbabwe.A few years ago, two cousins were marooned at the same spot after the river swelled while they were trying to cross into South Africa. They were later rescued by the Civil Protection Unit after enduring over 20 hours in the bush.Ends\n\n",
