            "content": "Trish Mukwazo ,[emailprotected]\n\nA verdict in the case of two men accused of defrauding CBZ Bank of US$41,000 using title deeds belonging to a deceased person was postponed to Monday due to an electricity outage at Tredgold Magistrates Court in Bulawayo.\n\nThe duo was scheduled to appear in court today to receive their judgment, but the power outage, reportedly caused by a fault, forced a postponement.\n\nThe regional courts were severely affected as they rely on electricity to record court proceedings. As a result, all cases scheduled for today were postponed until Monday.\n\nThe provincial courts were however unaffected by the power outage and continued with their proceedings as scheduled.\n\nThe duo  Anoop Ranmanlal Desai, director of Phenduka Supplies Pvt Ltd, and Prosper Moyo, son of the deceased whose title deeds were used in the loan application  had appeared before Bulawayo regional magistrate Ms Sibonginkosi Mnkandla facing fraud charges.\n\nThe State closed its case after its final witness, Detective Sergeant Jacob Kachitsa, the investigating officer, testified. He told the court that Desai and Moyo allegedly worked with another suspect, Rahmiben Tharolbual Desai, who remains at large.\n\nDet Sgt Kachitsa testified that the late John Nkonyane Moyo, whose title deeds were fraudulently used, had three children, including Prosper. It is alleged that Prosper facilitated the submission of the property deeds to Desai, leading to the fraudulent acquisition of the loan.\n\nWitnesses from CBZ Bank testified in court and produced paperwork as evidence supporting the States case.\n\nProsecutor Nomthandazo Mafu told the court that on 6 July 2016, Desai and Prosper, in collaboration with Rahmiben Tharolbual Desai, approached CBZ Bank to apply for a loan on behalf of Phenduka Supplies Pvt Ltd.\n\nThe accused persons presented title deeds for a property registered under the late John Nkonyane Moyo as collateral. They were given guarantor forms that were required to be signed by John Nkonyane Moyo, said Ms Mafu.\n\nThey later returned the documents to CBZ Bank, purportedly signed by John Nkonyane Moyo, knowing he was deceased.\n\nThe court heard that CBZ Bank processed the loan application based on the provided documents, approving a loan of US$30,000 in 2016. The funds were deposited into CBZ Bank account number 026023699010014, belonging to Phenduka Supplies Pvt Ltd.\n\nCBZ Bank later registered a mortgage bond for US$41,000. When Desai failed to repay the loan, the account was downgraded to recoveries in 2019.\n\nDuring the banks efforts to auction the property, it was discovered the property belonged to a deceased individual and therefore could not be sold.\n\nAs a result of the accused persons actions, the bank suffered an actual prejudice of US$30,000, plus US$11,000 in accrued interest, said Ms Mafu.\n\nHowever, the electricity was restored mid-afternoon at Tredgold Magistrates Court.\n\n",

We should facilitate equitable access to education and in our case as Zimbabwe, increased school infrastructure especially in resettlement areas has ensured that learners walk more than 5km to school, he said.\n\nThis is to make sure that no one is left behind. It is the duty of the government to make sure that every child has access to education.

Now, after years of honing her craft in the neighbouring country, she feels it is time to give back to the next generation of dancers in Zimbabwe.Here in South Africa, Im part of Royal Vibrations Foundation and also work with Izindlondlokazi, a continuous project where we perform on demand. Ive come to realise that home is best after all. According to my personal plans, Im most likely to return in September this year, Nolie shared.\n\nShe highlighted the differences between the South African and Zimbabwean creative industries, noting how South Africa invests heavily in its artists.Ive learnt a lot here and would love to bring that knowledge to the Zimbabwean dance scene. Theres a gap that needs to be filled, she added.\n\nReflecting on her journey, Nolie described it as a continuous process of growth and learning.I began performing in 2002, inspired by theatre for development using different artforms to identify problems and solutions within communities. The journey has not been easy. Many aspiring female artists face challenges, including a lack of mentorship and opportunities, as well as industry exploitation.At one of my lowest points in my career, Umkhathi Theatre Works Matesu Dube gave me a chance, and for that, I am grateful, she said.\n\nNow, as she looks toward her homecoming, she hopes to play a pivotal role in reshaping the local dance industry.
