We appreciate your understanding and apologise for any inconvenience this may cause. Thank you for your loyalty and support, was the messaged on the paper.\n\nThis sudden closure of the establishment which has become a home for the premiere of movies and holding of the European Film Festival Zimbabwe (EuroFilmFestZW) has led to unanswered questions.\n\nThe number on the paper was unreachable at the time of press.\n\nIn recent times, cinemas have found it hard to stay afloat with streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ impacting movie theatre attendance.\n\nThe recent trend of cinema closures is not unique to Bulawayo; it reflects a wider shift in the entertainment landscape. With the rise of streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Showmax, movie theatres are grappling with declining attendance.\n\nMore audiences are opting for the convenience and affordability of watching films from the comfort of their homes, leading to a significant drop in ticket sales and revenue for traditional cinemas.\n\nThis shift in consumer behavior poses serious implications for the entire film industry, impacting everything from production budgets to exhibition strategies.\n\nAs the cinematic landscape continues to evolve, the future of Ster Kinekor Zimbabwe remains uncertain. Movie lovers are left hoping for clarity regarding when, or if, the cinema will reopen its doors.  Follow on X @MbuleloMpofu\n\n",

Ward 1 received 304mm, Ward 2 recorded the highest at 396mm, while Ward 10 had the least at 209mm.

Intermittent streams are now flowing, ensuring water availability for livestock. Perennial and annual grasses are actively growing, providing feed for both browsers and grazers, although not yet in sufficient quantities. The body condition of surviving cattle is gradually improving, said Mrs Sibanda.\n\nShe added that the rainfall had spurred planting activities.Most farmers have taken advantage of the rains, and planting is now at its peak. However, many are replanting as their early crops were affected by poor emergence due to erratic and poorly distributed rainfall earlier in the season. Early-planted crops are now blooming and require top dressing, she explained.\n\nFollow on X: @mthabisi_mthire\n\n",
