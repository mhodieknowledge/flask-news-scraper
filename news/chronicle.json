By offering flexible financing options, we aim to make these tractors accessible to as many farmers as possible, ultimately contributing to the growth and sustainability of Zimbabwes agriculture.We are thrilled to partner with the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development as one of the resellers of the Belarus tractors to our local farmers, said Mr Changunda.He added that the tractors are available to individual farmers, registered agribusinesses, farming cooperatives, and irrigation schemes. Interested parties must meet specific criteria, including having a farmers account, providing a cover letter, security of tenure documents, a detailed project proposal, and a payment plan, among other requirements.The mechanisation of the agricultural sector plays a crucial role in driving the countrys agro-based economy forward.Zimbabwe aims to increase agricultures contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) from the current 20 percent to 33 percent.The initiative is also expected to help farmers transition into middle-income groups, supporting the countrys vision of becoming an upper-middle-income economy by 2030.In 2018, President Mnangagwa engaged his Belarusian counterpart, President Alexander Lukashenko, to support the farm mechanisation programme through the supply of farm equipment and the training of local farmers in cultivation, seeding, irrigation, and crop harvesting.In February 2024, President Mnangagwa commissioned 1,635 tractors, 16 combine harvesters, and other farming equipment under the US$66 million Belarus Phase 2 Mechanisation Facility.The first phase of the facility had earlier delivered 474 tractors, 60 combine harvesters, 210 planters, and five low-bed trucks to farmers.\n\n",

Dont just create for emotional release but have a specific reason why you are creating and that will be your fuel everyday.\n\nHe further challenged the artistes to keep on practising until they get it right.\n\nWork on your craft for at least two hours a day for the next five years and you will see tremendous changes and improvement in it. That will sustain you and make you a professional in whatever field you are in, he said.\n\nGuest facilitators Asaph Afrika and Raisedon Baya also hammered on the importance of identity. Baya, with 36 years under his belt shared how being resilient in art has made him the person he is today.\n\nIm a product of patience and perseverance. Back in the day, art was seen just as a pastime and it wasnt easy convincing parents that this was a path I would want to walk on for the rest of my life. To me, it hasnt always been about money but the love of art.\n\nHe also encouraged artistes to embrace education.\n\nTheres nothing sorry more than a shallow artiste. Lets take education seriously. Lets read wider, consume a lot of what we are about. If you are a writer, read more, if you are a singer, practice more and know yourself and know where you want to go. Be motivated to go on and ask yourself why you are doing what you are doing, he said.\n\nAsaph Afrika spoke of the magical four Ms in art: Money, message, music, mentality.\n\nTo me, art is about these Ms and what one is about. Im more on mentality more than anything but each one of us chooses which M they want to major at. Mentality brings out the message in my music I invest more on it because that defines who I am and what I produce. Also, we need to push art before finances, money will come as long as you have something going on. Just keep producing and those who are supposed to see will see, he said.\n\nThe bootcamp is set to continue and end on Saturday afternoon where the creatives will checkout from the Eveline High School premises.
