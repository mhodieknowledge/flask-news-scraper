The DRR committees on the ground are available to relay information on any imminent danger caused by heavy rains, said Mrs. Mafu-Moyo.\n\nShe urged residents to stock up on essential supplies, keep children away from water bodies, avoid crossing flooded rivers, and be ready to relocate if necessary, particularly those in low-lying areas.The districts flood-prone areas include Shashe, Tshitulipasi, Tshikwalakwala, Makakavhule, Tongwe, Umzingwane and Tshathapita among others\n\nIn Beitbridge Municipality, low-lying areas around the Dulivhadzimu bus terminus, the stadium, and council hostels are particularly vulnerable to flash floods.To mitigate risks, the committee has identified shelters, including churches, community halls, and schools on higher ground, to accommodate affected residents in case of emergencies.\n\nMrs Mafu-Moyo said there are ongoing awareness campaigns in areas prone to rainfall-related disasters. She also urged residents to stay informed through updates from the Meteorological Services Department (MSD) and the Civil Protection Committee.It is important for the community to follow weather updates to minimize the effects of climate-related disasters, she said.According to the MSD, Cyclone Chidos intensity has diminished significantly after moving overland. Increased friction has reduced its wind speed and rainfall intensity, downgrading it to a depression.\n\n",

Upon disembarking from her vehicle, Shava and his accomplices emerged from the darkness, brandishing a pistol, and robbed her of two mobile phones, car keys, and R6 000  items valued at R66 000 in total.The matter was reported to police in Musina, and the complainant returned to Beitbridge, where she conducted a SIM swap and traced her stolen phone to a local dealer in Dulivhadzimu.Teaming up with other mobile phone dealers, the victim located the stolen phones with a man who had been given them by Shava to sell on his behalf.An ambush was subsequently organised, and police arrested Shava when he arrived to collect his money from the phone dealer. The stolen mobile phones were also recovered.Ends\n\n",

            "content": "Zvamaida Murwira, Harare Bureau\n\nGovernment has made headway in advancing a people-centred national development agenda through initiating policies and projects that had a great impact on the collective aspirations of all Zimbabweans, President Mnangagwa has said. The Head of State and Government said this yesterday at State House while addressing the last Cabinet meeting for this year.\n\nToday marks the last Cabinet Meeting for the 2024 Cabinet Calendar. A synopsis of the business transacted during the year reveals that, as Government, we have made notable headway in our people-centred national development agenda. In this respect, during the course of the year, we crafted, reviewed and implemented impactful policies, programmes as well as projects in our quest to fulfil the collective aspirations of our citizens. In a nutshell, the 2024 Cabinet Calendar was a success, with its robust and frank deliberations, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nThese discussions were facilitated by the greatly improved quality of memoranda submitted to Cabinet. Guided by the principle of collective responsibility, it was pleasing that as Ministers, you rose above your respective sectoral interests, in favour of objectivity and the common national good, with co-ordination being more seamless. Congratulations.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa chronicled several achievements registered during the year in different sectors that include, energy, agriculture and health.\n\nHe said adequate grain continued to be distributed to citizens under the food deficit mitigation programme following the declaration of a State of Disaster for the 2023/2024 Summer Season, due to the El Nino-induced drought.\n\nThe timely delivery of food aid as well as agriculture inputs to our people at the grassroots level must be prioritised while complaints that transport costs are sometimes passed on to our people, must be honestly addressed. I, therefore, challenge the relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies to apply themselves and device strategies that will increase transport and logistical efficiency in getting aid and support to our people, he said.\n\nOn health, President Mnangagwa commended stakeholders in the sector for implementing multi-pronged intervention measures, which saw the country combat the cholera outbreak during the first half of the year.\n\nHe said mechanisms were in place to deploy the recently approved Multi-Hazard Contingency Plan to curtail the effects of floods and other national disaster emergencies.\n\nI call upon you to provide leadership and assist your communities to mitigate damage and harm to property and life in the wake of the ensuing rainfall season. On the economic front, the revision of economic growth projections, on the back of the El Nino-induced droughts negative impact on agricultural output, was inevitable. However, we remain resolute and optimistic that the fiscal and monetary reforms introduced during the year will increasingly underpin currency stability and usher economic rebound, he said.\n\nTurning to the energy sector, President Mnangagwa said while there was a shortage of power owing to low generation at Kariba Hydropower Station, the improved use and exploitation of renewable energy sources in the country, particularly solar by companies and households, continued to reduce national grid power demand.\n\nThe initiatives by Zesa through new models of Independent Power Producers are welcome moves to crowd in the private sector in power generation, specifically for their respective energy needs. More campaigns should be mounted to encourage our people, in both rural and urban areas to adopt renewable energy for domestic use,\n\nOn housing, President Mnangagwa said the Government will continue to channel resources towards housing delivery, as well as the upgrading and rehabilitation of both residential and institutional accommodation nationwide.\n\nThe strides made by local authorities during the course of the year are commendable. These include the conclusion of Master Plans by most local authorities. There are also glimpses of mindset change within that sector. Regrettably, cases of corruption emanating from the sector remain worrisome. The bold decision by Harare City Council to transfer waste disposal and management to private entities should be supported and replicated in other local authorities. Quality service delivery to our citizens remains the core objective, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nThe decentralisation and devolution agenda, said President Mnangagwa, has led to an improved standard of life and living environments for people with enhanced basic social services infrastructure.\n\nHe said the Government will continue prioritising the digital economy and empowerment of youths, women and small to medium enterprises.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa also called for innovative financing models to accelerate the reconstruction of the Mbare Traders Market following a fire incident that gutted the place recently.\n\nThe digital technology revolution is the cornerstone of modernisation, industrialisation and efficient service delivery to drive sustainable economic growth, he said.\n\nHowever, the digitalisation of Government information and services was occurring at a slow pace, something he said was worrisome. President Mnangagwa implored Ministers to ensure that Government continues to provide service to the public during the Cabinet break.\n\nAs Cabinet takes a well-deserved break, let us take note that we are not shutting down Government business and the subsequent delivery of service. Mechanisms must be put in place to balance the demands of a family and associated festivities with serving the people of our great motherland, Zimbabwe. The service delivery demands of the people of Zimbabwe must be responded to timely. After all, we are a Government by the people and for the people, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Zvamaida Murwira, Harare Bureau\n\nPresident Mnangagwa yesterday slammed some Cabinet Ministers for failing to attend Cabinet meetings and Committees saying they should toe the line or risk appropriate consequences.\n\nHe said it was critical for Cabinet Ministers to realise that Cabinet meetings take precedence over all other businesses they might have. The Head of State and Government said this yesterday while addressing the last Cabinet meeting for the year.\n\nHe said while most Ministers rose above their respective sectoral interests in favour of achieving the common national good, there was a worrisome tendency by some Ministers and senior Government officials who were not attending meetings.\n\nLet me however hasten to emphasise that Cabinet processes are anchored on the timely submission of vital documents and regular attendance by Ministers and officials. These include both ad-hoc as well as standing Cabinet Committees. The worrisome tendency by Ministers and senior officials to absent themselves from meetings is untenable, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nIn some cases, junior officials are delegated to attend and merely warm bench the meetings. This culture is tantamount to dereliction of duty. Permanent Secretaries should ensure that in their absence, only directors and above should attend working party meetings.\n\nHe directed the Chief Secretary in the Office of the President and Cabinet, Dr Martin Rushwaya to monitor Ministers attendance of the meetings.\n\nIn the 2025 calendar year, the Chief Secretary is directed to strictly monitor individual attendance and ensure that errant Ministers and officials toe the line or risk dire consequences. Ministers should remain mindful that Cabinet business takes precedence over all other business, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe said Deputy Ministers should be adequately briefed to help them represent the Government when they attend meetings.\n\nIn cases where Deputy Ministers are assigned, they should be adequately capacitated to enable active participation in the requisite deliberations. To this end, I direct that in the 2025 programme cycle and going forward, Deputy Ministers must now sign performance contractors. It is incumbent upon Ministers to ensure that their deputies are comprehensively briefed on Government business and given the latitude for effective involvement, he said.\n\nA few years ago, President Mnangagwa introduced performance contracts for Cabinet Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and heads of parastatals and State entities as a way of encouraging hard work and results oriented workmanship.\n\nHe has also been conferring awards to top-performing Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and heads of Government departments as the Second Republic continues to foster a culture of excellence, work ethic and servant leadership in its quest to attain Vision 2030.\n\nAmong the notable winners were Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Minister Dr Anxious Masuka who took first place as the top-performing Cabinet Minister for the second time running.\n\n",
