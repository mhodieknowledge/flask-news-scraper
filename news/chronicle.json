The man will effectively serve four months. In passing the sentence, Mr Muzembe took into consideration the minors young age.\n\nThe offender indecently touched a minor, which, given her age, is traumatic. The law ought to protect minors from sexual predators, he said.\n\nMr Muzembe emphasised the significant age gap of 36 years between the victim and the man.\n\nThe offender and the victim are neighbours, and the offender violated trust, as the victim expected protection instead of abuse from him, said Mr Muzembe.\n\nThe prosecutor, Mr Mehluli Ndlovu, said the incident occurred on 11 November last year when the man approached the minor at her mothers market place while she was alone and touched her stomach, claiming to be removing something from it.\n\nThe complainant was at her mothers market place when the accused person came and touched her stomach, telling her to look at what was on her stomach, he said.\n\nMr Ndlovu told the court that the minor then informed her mother about what had happened, prompting her to report the matter to the police.\n\n",

Its a dream come true for me. Ive always wanted to be part of something big, and being part of Wolves is something that is very big for me, and is big for my family. Its a team that Ive also seen from afar, and the Premier League is the best place to be, so Im delighted to join the family, to join the team.\n\nIm very excited. Its probably going to be the first time Ive had a big opportunity to be representing a bigger club. Nothing against Reims, but now youre going to be playing in the Premier League, playing for Wolves. Also, we have a greater population in England for Zimbabwean, I think I will feel even more at home than what I was doing in France.\n\nOn his experiences in France\n\nThe first time I got there, I didnt think I would stay for that long, but considering what I went through with the club, I really enjoyed my time there, and I think now its probably the best time, because Ive gained so much experience.\n\nBeing in the French league is also very tough, probably not as much as the Premier League, but I think its also quite competitive with the clubs that we have. So, I think those games will come in handy once I make this move.\n\nOn speaking to Chirewa and Abgadou\n\nObviously, Tawanda messaged me as soon as he saw the news. He was so excited, so at least now hes going to have his big brother there. So, it was very good. With Agba he did the same, because when he first came here, I was the one to welcome him. So, I think now its going to be his turn to welcome me.\n\nAs Wolves have seen so far, what he provides for the team, the impact that he has, the energy, the strength, the physique, its something that you need in in every top team. So, besides that, also hes a very good friend of mine. Weve been very good friends for the past three years. So, Im also looking forward to that.\n\nOn bringing leadership qualities\n\nI think in as much as we play football, we learn a lot. Being a leader is something that is not easy, but you also have to nurture yourself. You have to learn how to help others, how to guide, how to lead by example, on the pitch and off the pitch. So, I think its something that Ill also be able to bring to Wolves, considering what Ive also produced here at Reims. I think its some of the qualities that I do produce on the pitch, and off the pitch.\n\n",

However, any of the five permanent members can veto a resolution, and it is in this context that Ambassador Krasilnikov said there is a need for like-minded progressive nations on the powerful UN body.\n\nYou know that together we promote very important resolutions in the United Nations, like for example the UN resolution against glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and other forms of racism.\n\nThis issue is very important for Russia and like-minded countries, including Zimbabwe, especially this year when we celebrate and commemorate together the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War that facilitated the end of the Second World War, the establishment of the United Nations and the triumph of the liberation movements across the globe, including in Africa, he said.\n\nZimbabwe last served on the UNSC between 1991-1992 and before that in 1983-1984.\n\nThe Russian envoy said the existing cordial relations between President Mnangagwa and President Putin continued to be the backbone of Harare and Moscows increasing bilateral co-operation and partnership on the global stage.\n\nThe political dialogue between our principals reflects the very deep, very intensive and at the same time very cordial relations between President Mnangagwa and President Putin and also between our two brotherly nations.\n\nIt also gives impetus to the whole mechanism of our bilateral co-operation. We enhance our partnership along various directions, including the very close, deep co-ordination in the international arena, he said.\n\nThe Russian Ambassador said both countries were satisfied with the existing sound political relations which continued to be mutually beneficial.\n\nWe are happy with the quality and the essence of our political dialogue, our mutual comprehension of the current situation in the world and we are absolutely confident that together we can move forward not only in terms of co-ordinating our political agendas but also in terms of developing tangible co-operation to produce certain results for the benefit of our brother nations, he said.\n\nAmbassador Krasilnikov said Russia was also appreciative of Zimbabwes efforts in fostering peace in the region.\n\nWe highly appreciate and recognise the very significant role Zimbabwe plays in SADC as the chair of SADCthat was demonstrated by the recent (SADC) Extraordinary Summit held in Harare on a very crucial topic of a peaceful settlement in the eastern DRC, he said.\n\n",

Her baby, now in the neonatal intensive care unit, is responding well to treatment.\n\nReflecting on the experience, Ms Mwembe described the helicopter ride as life-saving.\n\nThe flight felt like five minutes. It got me to the hospital quickly, where doctors were already waiting for me. Without it, I dont know what would have happened to me and my baby, she said.\n\nHer ordeal began when she went into labour earlier than expected. Initially, she assumed the pain was normal, having experienced similar discomfort in her first pregnancy. However, as the pain worsened, she alerted her mother-in-law, who took her to Matemu Clinic using an ox-drawn cart.\n\nGiven her history of a previous Caesarean section, clinic staff referred her to Nkayi District Hospital. However, upon arrival, she faced another challenge as there was no electricity at the facility, while she was unable to push the baby out.\n\nThe nurses suggested I travel to Bulawayo by bus and hire a car from there, but I was in too much pain. Meanwhile, the doctors warned that my baby was in distress and at risk of infection because all the amniotic fluid was gone, Ms Mwembe said.\n\nRecognising the urgency, hospital staff contacted the helicopter ambulance service.\n\nWhen the helicopter arrived, I was told to leave my bags behind. Only the midwife who had been monitoring me could accompany me. The ride was like a dream, it was scary but comfortable and incredibly fast.\n\nMs Rumbidzai Mwembe\n\nBefore I knew it, the nurse told me that we had arrived, and the doctors immediately took me into surgery, she recounted.\n\nMs Mwembe expressed her gratitude to the Government for the life-saving initiative.\n\nHad this service not existed, I might have lost my life and my baby, she said.\n\nThe helicopter, a flying intensive care unit, is one of two air medical rescue service ambulances that are stationed at the United Bulawayo Hospital to offer swift medical responses for emergencies, such as the critically injured in road accidents. The air ambulance is used to airlift patients from hard-to-reach areas, which would typically take hours to get to by road.\n\nIf the air ambulance is summoned to an area where there is no helipad, the pilots use their discretion to use an open space such as a sports field to land.\n\nThe helicopter ambulance system, introduced last year, has since saved hundreds of lives. Last year alone, more than 100 expecting mothers were airlifted to various hospitals across the country for emergency medical care.\n\nUnder the Second Republic, President Mnangagwa is actively modernising the countrys health sector as part of a strategic initiative to transform the country into a prosperous, highly industrialised nation by 2030.\n\nIn June last year, the President travelled to Russia to seek investors for establishing air ambulance services for the public health sector. Russian HeliDrive Air Ambulance Medical Services quickly responded, arriving in Zimbabwe to assist in developing an efficient air ambulance system staffed by highly skilled medical professionals, including doctors, nurses, engineers, dispatchers and pilots.\n\n",

He further threatened to cut all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation into the matter was conducted.\n\nIn response, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa dismissed the allegations, saying his countrys land expropriation policies adhere strictly to legal frameworks and constitutional provisions.\n\nSouth Africa is a constitutional democracy that is deeply rooted in the rule of law, justice and equality. The South African government has not confiscated any land. The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the constitution, he said in a statement.\n\nSouth Africa, like the United States of America and other countries, has always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\n\nHe further clarified that, aside from the Presidents Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), which contributes 17 percent of South Africas HIV/Aids programme, the country does not receive any funding from the US.\n\nPresident Ramaphosa said he would engage the Trump administration to find common ground on land reform and broader bilateral relations.\n\nWe are certain that out of those engagements, we will share a better and common understanding over these matters. The US remains a key strategic political and trade partner for South Africa. With the exception of Pepfar Aid, which constitutes 17 percent of South Africas HIV/Aids programme, there is no other funding that is received by South Africa from the United States, he said.\n\nLocal analysts have criticised President Trumps stance, arguing that his approach mirrors the punitive actions taken against Zimbabwe at the turn of the millennium.\n\nUS President Donald Trump\n\nFollowing Zimbabwes land reform programme, the US and its Western allies imposed economic sanctions under the pretext of human rights violations, despite the initiative being aimed at addressing colonial land imbalances.\n\nZanu-PF Secretary General Dr Obert Mpofu said the land issue remains one of Africas most critical political and economic challenges. He urged South Africa to remain resolute in implementing land redistribution.\n\nIf you try to be diplomatic about land redistribution, you will achieve nothing. The process is often met with resistance, sanctions and vilification. However, for the benefit of the majority, ultimately, it must be done, he said.\n\nDr Mpofu said Zimbabwes land reform programme was a success, noting that it has empowered the black majority and considerably improved national food security.\n\nNegotiating land redistribution with Western powers has never yielded results. Africa must take decisive action on this matter, he added.\n\nNational University of Science and Technology (Nust) lecturer and political analyst Mr Methuseli Moyo said President Trumps approach reflects a broader effort to undermine African sovereignty.\n\nThe tragedy is that Trump leads a global superpower that sees itself as the worlds prefect. Donald Trump seeks to dehumanise black people to the extent that he thinks they are not fit to have access to anything, especially land, even their God-given land, he said.\n\nMr Moyo also criticised the irony of the US positioning itself as a human rights advocate while opposing African-led efforts to rectify historical injustices.\n\nAre black South Africans not human beings? The hypocrisy is staggering. Thankfully, President Ramaphosa has firmly stood his ground, he added.\n\nMr Moyo said more African countries need to take a leaf from Zimbabwe in the manner in which the Government handled the land question.\n\nZimbabwe did very well to pioneer a forceful land reclamation process, which stands as a reference point and inspiration to the dispossessed masses in South Africa and elsewhere. They must bite the bullet and take back their land, he said.\n\nMr Moyo said African countries must never be apologetic about controlling their resources.\n\nPolitical governance expert Mr Teddy Ncube echoed similar sentiments, stating that land reform in South Africa, like in Zimbabwe, is about correcting historical injustices rather than pursuing radical agendas.\n\nPolitics is not solely about economic transactions. It is also about people, history and justice. His (President Trumps) perspective on South Africas land reform overlooks the deep historical injustices that necessitated this conversation in the first place, he said.\n\nMr Ncube emphasised that the current reform efforts seek to promote fairness and inclusivity while rectifying past wrongs.\n\nThe issue of land reform in South Africa is not about confiscation or radical agendas; it is about addressing the long-standing disparities created by colonialism and apartheid, he said.\n\nMr Ncube said for generations land was grabbed from Africans leading to poverty and exclusion while also perpetuating inequities.\n\nThe current efforts are aimed at rectifying these imbalances in a way that promotes fairness and inclusivity. Trumps approach of reducing complex issues to simple economic calculations can be problematic when applied to international relations, he said.\n\nMr Ncube said the South African land issue is a domestic matter that should be handled internally, arguing that external interference from the US is unwarranted.\n\nHe said President Trump must respect South Africas sovereignty and allow its people to shape their own future.\n\nIt is essential that South Africans are given the space to resolve this matter themselves, free from external interference. President Trump should recognise this and allow South Africa to determine its own future based on its own principles and aspirations.\n\nAs the debate over land expropriation intensifies, Zimbabwes experience remains a key reference point for African nations seeking to address land ownership disparities. South Africas approach, though different in execution, is part of the broader continental effort to ensure equitable land distribution and economic empowerment for historically marginalised communities.  @nqotshili\n\n",

            "content": "PRESIDENT Donald Trumps decision to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organisation (WHO) has significant implications for global health, while his executive order banning new US foreign aid spending and the subsequent stop-work order on January 24 have far-reaching consequences, particularly for countries reliant on US aid for critical health programmes.\n\nAs we report in our business section today, FBC Securities Private Limited, a stockbroker listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, has called on the Government to take decisive measures in response to the US foreign aid freeze, cautioning that the situation could destabilise key sectors, exacerbate exchange rate volatility and heighten inflationary pressures.\n\nThe clarion call by FBC Securities is the cry of the entire Global South. Many US-funded aid programmes have begun firing staff and shutting down operations. This sudden halt affects a wide range of initiatives, from healthcare to education and infrastructure development.\n\nProfessor Mthuli Ncube\n\nLocally, Finance, Economic Development, and Investment Promotion Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube, has announced that the revenue generated from the sugar tax and the newly-introduced fast food tax will be specifically allocated to support the health sector.\n\nThe US was the largest contributor to WHO, providing about 22 percent of its mandatory contributions. This withdrawal is expected to undermine international public health efforts in several ways.\n\nBecause WHO relies heavily on contributions from member states to fund its operations, the US withdrawal creates a substantial funding gap, potentially reducing the organisations ability to respond to global health crises, conduct research and support health initiatives worldwide.\n\nWHO plays a crucial role in co-ordinating international responses to pandemics and without US support, the organisations capacity to track disease outbreaks and mobilise resources may be compromised, making it harder to combat future pandemics.\n\nThe USs withdrawal from the WHO could weaken international co-operation and leadership in addressing health challenges, potentially leading to fragmented and less effective responses.\n\nThe freeze on funding to Pepfar threatens to disrupt the supply of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) and resources for HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and malaria programmes in countries like Zimbabwe. Pepfar has been instrumental in providing life-saving treatments and support to millions of people living with HIV/Aids.\n\nZimbabwe, which has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the world, relies heavily on Pepfar for ARV supplies. The funding freeze could lead to shortages of these essential drugs, jeopardising the health and lives of those dependent on them.\n\nThe halt in US foreign aid affects not only HIV/Aids programmes but also efforts to combat TB and malaria. These diseases require sustained funding and resources to manage and control. Any disruption in support can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.\n\nHealth crises have broader economic and social impacts. Disruptions in health programmes can strain healthcare systems, increase healthcare costs and reduce productivity, further exacerbating poverty and inequality in affected regions.\n\nAs we have tried to illustrate, the US withdrawal from WHO and the freeze on foreign aid spending pose significant challenges to global health efforts. These actions undermine international cooperation, reduce funding for critical health programmes, and threaten the well-being of millions of people, particularly in vulnerable regions.\n\nWe concur with FBC Securities that bold and strategic reforms are essential to guide the country toward financial stability and sustainable growth.\n\n",

The forthcoming game will be the second red ball meeting between the two nations.\n\nErvine is confident that playing at home, they will be able to make maximum use of home advantage and make it count. He said what is crucial is to stick to their processes and is pleased with the improvement he has seen from the players over the past couple of months.\n\nAction from the Chevrons vs Pakistan match at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo yesterday\n\nWe didnt get the results we wanted when we played Ireland, it was in their conditions. For us, we are now at home, we have the home advantage and hopefully, we can utilise that. We just need to stick to our processes.\n\nWe have improved a lot in the last couple of months, especially with the amount of cricket that we have been playing. So, just because of the opposition, I dont think we need to change too much but a lot of focus should be on us and not them, said Ervine.\n\nZimbabwes Test squad includes two new faces, the uncapped duo of 27-year-old leg-spinner Vincent Masekesa and 26-year-old top-order batter Nicholas Welch, who have both been rewarded for their impressive performances on the domestic front.\n\nThe Chevrons skipper added that it is exciting to see new faces in the set-up and is hopeful that if they do make their debuts, they will continue with their good form.\n\nIts really exciting to see some new faces in the squad. A lot of credit to them for the hard work that they have put in during our domestic season. Its nice to see guys getting rewarded for some good performances and hopefully, if they do get a crack at this\n\nChevrons celebrate a wicket\n\nTest, they can continue with their good form, said Ervine.Zimbabwe and Ireland are set to face off in a series that comprises one Test, three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and as many T20Is.\n\nWith the solitary Test match taking place at Queens Sports Club, the white ball matches will be played in Harare.The three one-dayers are pencilled in for February 14, 16 and 18 while the 20-over matches will be played on February 22, 23 and 25.\n\nGate charges for the Test match are pegged at US$3 for the rest of the ground and US$5 for the grandstand.  @brandon_malvin\n\n",
