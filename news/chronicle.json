I urge war veterans to take advantage of the revolving fund to boost their income generating projects. We had a challenge in Bubi and Nkayi districts where the loans uptake under the revolving fund was very low, he said.Secretary of War Veterans in the Politburo, Cde Douglas Mahiya, called on war veterans to shun division and unite.ends\n\n",

They pounced on him at his residence, where they discovered the drugs in his bedroom. The confiscated substance tested positive for crystal meth, he said.\n\nComm Nyathi said they are now working to establish Siegfrieds supply chain and possible accomplices in the illicit drug trade.\n\nIn a statement, Zimras Commissioner General, Ms Regina Chinamasa, said the intercepted South African truck driver was trying to smuggle marijuana into the country on Sunday.\n\nPigors Tyron Siegfried\n\nThe drugs were discovered during a routine inspection at 4AM, concealed within a South African-registered Hino Horse truck carrying vehicles, which was in transit to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\nMs Chinamasa said customs officials, utilising K9 units, located the drugs hidden under blankets and plastic wrapping.\n\nShe said the matter is under police investigation.\n\nThe trafficking of illegal drugs poses a significant threat to our society. Zimra will continue to diligently safeguard our borders against drugs and illicit substances, said Ms Chinamasa.\n\nShe commended Zimra officials for their vigilance and urged the public to assist in the fight against drug trafficking.\n\nIn a recent operation, police intercepted and impounded more than 50 buses and 20 haulage trucks found transporting illegal drugs.\n\nOne of the buses was found with 71kgs of dagga while other buses and trucks were found with illicit alcohol imported from neighbouring countries.\n\nNational police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi, said the bus drivers and conductors could not name the owners of the dagga and illicit alcohol.\n\nPolice impounded close to 50 buses and trucks being used to transport illicit beers, dagga and other prohibited goods into the country, he said.\n\nComm Nyathi said the operation against drug and substance abuse is ongoing and police are on the ground to bring all the culprits to book.\n\nPigors Tyron Siegfried\n\nHe said the recent bust has resulted in multiple arrests and seizure of narcotics that could have flooded the streets, potentially putting countless individuals at risk.\n\nWe are focused on dismantling these networks that are not only bringing drugs into our communities but are also perpetuating a cycle of addiction and crime, said Comm Nyathi.\n\nIn the past few weeks, police have been conducting raids, targeting houses believed to be linked to drug activity.\n\nComm Nyathi said police over the last 30 days arrested many drug dealers and seized different types of narcotics. He warned transport operators against transporting contraband.\n\nPigors Tyron Siegfried\n\nAnyone found on the wrong side of the law will be arrested without fear or favour, said Comm Nyathi.\n\nHe said police have also noted with concern the rising number of rape and murder cases involving men believed to be under the influence of drugs and other prohibited substances.\n\nAs I said, it is disturbing to note that there are some illegal activities at various company premises where some drinks laced with a higher percentage of alcohol are being made. Such drinks, with medicinal and sex-enhancing claims, have been blamed for increasing cases of rape and murder countrywide, said Comm Nyathi.\n\nPigors Tyron Siegfried\n\nMeanwhile, in Bulawayo, following the arrest of socialite who is accused of peddling drugs, Gary Bell last month, police have stepped up their game in the fight against drug-related activities.\n\nThe buzz around Bells arrest has stirred the community into action.\n\nOver the weekend, several houses were raided in the city, with one of them reportedly being rented by a former associate of Bell.\n\nA police source said the raid led to a series of important discoveries that can aid their investigations.\n\nAuthorities have launched a series of raids targeting homes and establishments linked to the drug trade, aiming to dismantle networks that have thrived in the shadows.\n\nPigors Tyron Siegfried\n\nResidents are relieved by the polices proactive stance. Its time we feel safe in our neighbourhoods, said Council of Churches in Africa leader, Bishop Dr Rocky Moyo.\n\nHe said there has been a sense of fear and uncertainty that has hung over Bulawayo, which is gradually being replaced by hope that these actions will lead to a cleaner and safer community.\n\nBulawayo United Residents Association chairperson Mr Winos Dube said drug and substance abuse is worrisome and the problem was cascading to primary school children.\n\nPigors Tyron Siegfried\n\nEvery time we make a move against drug activity, it sends a clear message. We want our community to know that we are here to protect them and we will not turn a blind eye, he said.\n\nThe recent busts are just the beginning and we hope the police are committed to making Bulawayo a safer place for everyone, said Mr Dube.\n\nHe said residents are cautiously optimistic, with many noticing heightened police presence in neighbourhoods.\n\n",

Muzarabani will, however, serve an effective eleven years imprisonment after the court ordered the three major counts to run concurrently. It is our hope that Muzarabanis sentence will act as a deterrent to those that want to vandalise critical public infrastructure. Zimbabwe is spending millions of dollars every year to replace vandalised public infrastructure.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has described as treasonous the increased cases of vandalism that the country is witnessing.

Vandalism of key infrastructure is disrupting power supplies, communication, mining operations, industrial production and transportation of goods, among other operations. In some cases, suburbs are going for weeks without electricity as a result of vandalism of transformers and theft of copper cables.\n\nVandals have been a menace at the Epping Forest and Rochester aquifer in Nyamandlovu where they are vandalising transformers and stealing copper cables. Epping Forest and Rochester aquifer supply water to Bulawayo.

According to technology expert Ms Jacqueline Ntaka, drones surveillance enables institutions to cover large areas with minimal human intervention.\n\nShe said drones provide a birds eye view, allowing for comprehensive monitoring of large areas that are difficult to patrol on foot. Equipped with high resolution cameras and live feed capabilities, drones can transmit real- time footage to security personnel, enabling immediate response to suspicious activities, she said.\n\nWe want at this juncture to implore institutions such as Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) and TelOne to invest in drones as part of their strategies to fight vandalism.\n\n",

Looking on are Premier Africa Minerals General Manager Mr Jabulani Chirashe (left) and Zhou Xiaole.\n\nCorporate rescue, also known as business rescue or restructuring, is a legal framework in Zimbabwe designed to help financially distressed companies restore solvency and continue operations.\n\nThe process aims to balance the interests of creditors, shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders while preserving the companys economic value.\n\nPremier is engaging with all stakeholders, particularly Zulus prepayment and offtake partner, with whom detailed discussions are ongoing.\n\nWhile this remains our preferred solution, Premier is also engaged with other new potential investors. In the absence of a financing solution, Premier may need to consider alternative options for Zulu in the interests of its creditors and shareholders, which may include raising financing at the subsidiary level, a sale of Zulu whilst keeping it in a state of care and maintenance, the liquidation of the assets of Zulu, or other options available under Zimbabwean laws including a corporate rescue of Zulu, said the firm.\n\nChief Executive Officer, Mr George Roach, expressed confidence in the plants future performance. Based on extensive test work and design reviews conducted in the third quarter of 2024, including the purchase of a secondary spodumene float plant,\n\nMr Roach believes that once operations resume, the plant will achieve improved recoveries and concentrate grade. Spodumene, a lithium ore with a high lithium concentration, is critical for battery production in electric vehicles.\n\nLithium\n\nIn my opinion, to have attended to the issues associated with the comminution circuit and be able to supply the required tonnage to the float sections, we have dealt with the major and potentially most costly components of the plant and to not complete the final commissioning and optimisation of the float section now would not make any sense, said Mr Roach.\n\nIt should be noted that we are in discussions with interested parties regarding our Mutare Li3 claims and RHA Tungsten with a view to a possible restart of this mine.\n\nThe update followed a previous announcement on 21 January 2025, when Premier disclosed that a proposed 3,5 million fundraising had not closed. The funds were intended to support the final commissioning and optimisation of the Primary Spodumene Flotation Plant and the purchase of the Secondary Spodumene Flotation Plant.\n\nPremier is of the view that these steps are crucial for the full recommencement of operations at Zulu and to address trade creditors requiring immediate settlement to facilitate an initial 3-to-5-day test run.\n\nMr George Roach\n\nPremier, a UK-based mining and exploration company, has faced challenges with commissioning the lithium flotation circuit at its Zulu plant. It has missed several delivery deadlines and, at one point, issued a force majeure notice to Chinas Canmax Technologies, citing unforeseen operational hurdles encountered at the lithium plant in Fort Rixon.\n\nForce majeure, a French term, is a common clause in contracts that essentially frees both parties from liability or obligation when an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond the control of the parties occurs.\n\nThe plant was reported to be unable to produce sufficient spodumene to meet the quantities required by the off-take agreement with Canmax. The latter had wanted to terminate the agreement, a development that could have negatively affected the Zulu Lithium project.\n\nHowever, after extensive discussions, the companies managed to restore their partnership.\n\n",

            "content": "Nqobile Tshili,[emailprotected]\n\nGWANDA State University (GSU) has unveiled an ambitious masterplan to guide the construction of its main campus in Gwanda Town, which will be one of the giant modernisation projects for the Matabeleland South provincial capital.\n\nThe university is targeting to commence construction work next year as it is finalising works on its Epoch Mine Campus this year.\n\nThe higher-learning institution seeks to construct high-rise buildings taking advantage of the limited space where the campus will be situated in Gwanda Town and will occupy 90 hectares of land.\n\nThe university will run with two campuses, the Epoch Mine Campus in Insiza District, which houses the mining and agricultural programmes.\n\nGSU Vice Chancellor, Professor Doreen Zandile Moyo, has said the university was excited to have its master plan approved as the development speaks to the growth trajectory of the university.\n\nThe Gwanda campus is our main campus and we have a 90-hectare plot that was donated to us by the Government. We have done a comprehensive masterplan, it has all the administration, lecture rooms and other facilities, she said.\n\nWe submitted the masterplan to the Gwanda Municipality last year in September and the municipality conducted all the due processes and it was approved at the end of the year, said Prof Moyo.\n\nShe said the university wanted the construction programme to commence in 2026.\n\nWe will start with a multi-purpose building that will consist of lecture rooms, laboratories and offices and we intend to do a groundbreaking ceremony next year.\n\nWe are aware that the ongoing programmes are funded by the fiscus. This year, we are going to start some work, we are going to start by fencing the plot and also do the three-dimensional designs of the multi-purpose building, said Prof Moyo.\n\nShe said the Gwanda campus was important to the university as it would allow it to expand its programmes. The university is supposed to have a total of seven faculties and at the moment only three are offered.\n\nAt the Epoch Mine Campus we are only offering three and the other four will be offered in our Gwanda campus, said Prof Moyo.\n\nIt will enable us to increase our student enrolment and offer post-graduate studies. Our community engagement drive will be a better place. So, for us, the Gwanda campus is very important.\n\nThe Epoch Mine Campus will remain our campus, its important for our mining programmes, and it will be important for our agriculture programmes. So, we will continue to run the programmes at the Gwanda Campus, she said.\n\nWe have an agro-industrial hub here, which is very vibrant. So, it will be important for us to continue rolling it out and generating income. It will be a centre for our rural industrialisation programme.\n\nProf Moyo said the university will soon present the master plan to its stakeholders. GSU physical planning, works and estate director, Engineer Ezias Mabasa, presented a summary of the masterplan to the universitys administration yesterday.\n\nThe masterplan shows that once completed, the university will transform the face of Gwanda Town, making it the hub of modernity in the mining town. It will be compact and dominated by high-rise buildings.\n\nThere are quite a number of buildings that will be constructed, which in general shall be administrative structures, teaching and learning sites, innovation hubs, areas for transport circulation, said Eng Mabasa.\n\nThere are some open spaces that have been left out for agricultural purposes as well as sporting facilities. The design was done in line with the Heritage-Based Education 5.0 concept.\n\nMost of the faculties are going to be high-rise buildings to conserve space since we have 90 hectares only.\n\nHe said the university will construct an eight-storey students accommodation and a students service centre complex to be occupied by service providers.\n\nEng Mabasa said the university is also going to construct a medical centre, which will start off as a small clinic but will be developed into a university hospital. He said the university will have an agricultural research and innovation hub sitting on a 10 hectares piece of land while also having an artificial aquaculture dam.\n\nAn industrial park will also be constructed with quite a number of facilities to allow students to apply their knowledge and manufacture products that can be sold to the market. Students doing engineering and life sciences will have their workshop constructed, he said.\n\nEng Mabasa said a multi-purpose sporting facility aligning with Olympic standards will be constructed to cater for indoor and outdoor activities.\n\n",

            "content": "Peter Matika,[emailprotected]\n\nNINETY percent of children from Apostolic sects were not vaccinated against polio during a recent immunisation campaign led by the Ministry of Health and Child Care in partnership with the Bulawayo City Council (BCC).\n\nAccording to the latest council report, only 10 children from the churches received the vaccine, while the majority were denied immunisation by their parents due to religious beliefs. This has raised alarm among local authorities, who are calling for urgent intervention to address the matter.\n\nThese vaccination campaigns are conducted in good faith to protect children from preventable diseases. The refusal to vaccinate not only puts these children at risk but also endangers the wider community. As a council, we need to take decisive action to safeguard public health, said Ward 25 Councillor Aleck Ndlovu.\n\nBulawayo City Council (BCC)\n\nReligious doctrines within the Apostolic sects often discourage medical interventions, including vaccinations. While the local authority respects religious freedoms, the rising health risks associated with polio have prompted calls for immediate engagement with these communities to find a common ground where faith and health can coexist.\n\nTo tackle vaccine hesitancy, BCCs health department has intensified outreach and education initiatives. Health workers are actively engaging with members of the Apostolic sects, emphasising the importance of immunisation in protecting children from life-threatening diseases.\n\nDespite resistance from certain religious groups, the nationwide Round 4 Polio Vaccination blitz, launched last month, received overwhelming support from many communities.\n\nParents and guardians eagerly brought their children to designated vaccination sites, including public health centres, schools, and other strategic locations across Bulawayo.\n\nIn a recent development, the Government announced that it is in the process of drafting legislation that would compel members of Apostolic sects to allow their children to be vaccinated during mass immunisation programmes.\n\nDeputy Minister of Health and Child Care, Sleiman Kwidini, acknowledged the ongoing challenges posed by religious objections to vaccination, which continue to hinder public health efforts.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, immunising children from Apostolic sects has long been a challenge due to widespread religious beliefs that discourage the use of modern medicine, including vaccinations.\n\nThese beliefs often lead to parents seeking immunisations for their children in secret to avoid repercussions from their churches, and this becomes particularly concerning during outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles.\n\nThe deputy minister, however, noted that some religious sects have become more open to vaccinating their children.\n\n",
