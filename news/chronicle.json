The peace and security of our region is a shared obligation.\n\nOur political-will must be strengthened towards a concrete and actionable roadmap that will help accelerate the realisation of peace in the Eastern DRC, he said.\n\nMay we, as Member States, continue to do all we can to support our gallant men and women in the theatre of operations, and ensure that SAMIDRC achieves its important objective.\n\n",

With remarkable bravery, they confronted the armed robbers, pelting them with stones and driving them to flee empty-handed into the night. Their swift and fearless response not only foiled the robbery but also sent a powerful message that such criminal acts will not be tolerated in their neighbourhood.\n\nOne resident, Mr Emmanuel Mutoko, described how he scaled a nearby precast wall and hid in a neighbours yard as bullets whizzed in different directions. The robbers fired indiscriminately at the growing crowd of residents determined to stop the robbery.\n\nThe shop closes at 8pm, and as staff were leaving, there was commotion as some men forced their way inside. One of them, who seemed to be watching the place from outside, started shooting randomly.\n\nResidents gathered around the shop and began throwing stones, and he fired a few more shots. I jumped over a perimeter wall and hid next door because I was scared of being hit by a stray bullet, Mr Mutoko said.\n\nArmed robbers\n\nHe said that the robbers took advantage of a malfunctioning tower light to escape into the darkness after realising the residents were determined to stop them.\n\nIt all happened within a few minutes, and then the robbers were gone. No one chased them. Thats when we heard that the manager had been shot inside the shop, he said.\n\nBulawayo provincial police acting spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Nomalanga Msebele, confirmed the incident.Police in Bulawayo are investigating a case of attempted robbery and attempted murder that occurred on February 1, 2025 in New Lobengula, Bulawayo. At approximately 8:10pm, a brazen attempted robbery and attempted murder occurred at Choppies (now Sai Mart), where a 59-year-old male complainant, a resident of Cowdray Park, sustained serious injuries, she said.\n\nShe said that the attempted armed robbery and shooting happened as staff members were closing up for the night.The complainant (the shop manager) was reconciling invoices in his office while the rest of the staff were clocking out. As the complainant was about to open the door for the staff to leave, three suspects emerged from their hiding place near the shop.\n\nThe first suspect fired a single shot, causing some workers to scatter and others to seek refuge at the back of the shop. The second suspect fired two shots from the exit door, attempting to intimidate the crowd of onlookers, Assistant Inspector Msebele said.\n\nOne of the suspects then forced the manager into the strong room and demanded he open the safe. When the manager said he didnt have the keys, he was shot in both thighs.\n\nAs more people joined the crowd outside the shop and began pelting the suspects with stones, the armed robbers panicked and abandoned their attempt to rob the store. They left the scene empty-handed, said Assistant Inspector Msebele.She urged anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects to contact their nearest police station.\n\nWe would like to urge business owners to hire security guards from reputable security companies to protect their employees and property from such criminal activity.\n\n",

As a sector, we are looking forward to attracting these innovations into the country so that we see the re-industrialisation of the metal sector.\n\nMr Dosman Mangisi\n\nGovernment should come up with user-friendly policies that will also help financiers and other stakeholders to participate freely without fearing losses.\n\nThe US$1,5 billion Dinson Iron and Steel Company (Disco) plant in Manhize has commenced production, marking a significant milestone in Zimbabwes industrial revival drive.\n\nPig iron production started last year following the successful completion of test runs.\n\nThe milestone development has ignited a spark of hope for Zimbabwes industrial revival drive, confirmation of the Second Republics commitment to transforming the economy in line with the ambitious roadmap towards a prosperous upper middle-income status before 2030.\n\nPig iron, the initial product of the blast furnace, serves as the foundation for further steel production. The company commenced steel billet production in July, a vital raw material for various industrial applications.\n\nExperts believe that Disco will bring ease of doing business in the metal casting industry, making Zimbabwe a leading giant in foundry production.\n\nHowever, challenges persist, including the need for retooling and investment in modern technology. Mr Mangisi emphasised that what we want is enhanced quality in terms of material . . . but production will be enhanced when retooling takes place.\n\nMeanwhile, the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) has welcomed improvements in power supplies, which is expected to boost industry productivity.\n\nMr Louis Herbst, ZNCC southern region vice-president, noted that the recent improvements in electricity supply are nothing short of transformative.\n\nHe said in recent months, businesses had grappled with frequent outages and erratic power fluctuations, severely impeding production schedules and complicating the management of daily operations.\n\nThis unpredictability compelled companies to invest heavily in costly backup systems, such as generators, and solar, and often forced them to operate at reduced capacity, an approach that not only eroded profitability but also stifled growth, he said.\n\nThe relentless need to adapt to power shortages diverted vital resources away from innovation and expansion, reducing many firms to a state of reactive survival rather than proactive advancement.  @SikhulekelaniM1.\n\n",

Further details of the programme are expected to be released within the next two weeks.\n\nOver the weekend, the Gukurahundi steering committee met in Bulawayo to finalise preparations for the hearings.Chief Mtshane Khumalo, the president of the National Council of Chiefs, chaired the meeting at which traditional leaders agreed to begin community outreach and awareness campaigns.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has tasked traditional leaders with leading the process of addressing the post-independence conflict that affected the Matabeleland region and parts of the Midlands, as part of national healing efforts.\n\nThe President launched the Gukurahundi public hearings programme last July, empowering traditional leaders to conduct the hearings. However, the provision of adequate resources had previously stalled progress. The government has now committed further resources to ensure the process can begin.\n\nFollowing yesterdays meeting, Chief Mtshane Khumalo, in an interview, expressed satisfaction that preparations are progressing well and stressed the importance of chiefs educating their communities about the upcoming hearings.\n\nThe public hearings will be held in rural areas, meaning those wishing to contribute will need to travel to their rural homes to make submissions.\n\nThe message to the public is that all chiefs have been urged to make their people aware of this programme. Some have already done so, and those who havent should explain that the programme is imminent.\n\nWe believe this is important; the Gukurahundi issue has been with the people in the Matabeleland region for a long time. We dont know if we will fully close this chapter, but people should have the opportunity to share their experiences, he said.\n\nChief Mtshane Khumalo\n\nHe acknowledged the challenging task ahead but expressed confidence that the training received by traditional leaders over the past five years has equipped them to manage the process effectively.\n\nChief Mtshane Khumalo stressed that a victim-centred approach will be crucial for the success of the meetings.I believe its a mammoth task. Initially, when we were assigned, we thought we would complete it quickly. But, having gone through the processes, I can tell you it is a mammoth task. Going to the people will not be easy, but we have been trained on how to approach this process, how to conduct the meetings. We needed training on how to approach the victims. This is not like the normal cases we preside over in our courts.\n\nWhen we approach a Gukurahundi victim, you have to be very cautious. In most cases, these people are very emotional, and if you are not careful in your approach, you might cause more harm than good. So, we have to be careful how we approach them, and that requires training, he said.\n\nWhile some have suggested the Gukurahundi public hearings will be ineffective, Chief Mtshane Khumalo urged the public not to make assumptions and to allow the process to proceed smoothly.\n\nI dont think that assumption is correct, he said. Lets just wait and see what the victims will say because we are not all victims, and chiefs are merely facilitators in this programme. So, let us go and hear what the victims will say and await the Governments response and actions. I think its too early to pre-empt anything.\n\nHe confirmed that further details on the preparations for the programmes start will be provided in two weeks. Chief Mtshane Khumalo hopes to hold a final stakeholder meeting with all chiefs, rapporteurs, and panel members within the next two weeks, depending on resource availability.\n\nI dont foresee any other major meetings. We are most likely to have the last meeting with all chiefs, all rapporteurs, and panel members, depending on the availability of resources. We need to remind these people what they are expected to do.\n\nWe need some moot sessions so the chiefs can demonstrate what they have learned, if they still remember, how they will chair the meetings, and all that. They were trained over the past five years and have been in recess for a very long time. We will ask them to do some recapping; they have booklets on how the proceedings will be conducted, he said.\n\nHe said that the Public Works Department is expected to have completed renovations to the Command Centre in Bulawayo, which will be used to store witness testimonies.\n\nWhile hearings will be held in rural areas, all data will be transported to Bulawayo for storage at the Command Centre.Chief Mtshane Khumalo confirmed that the Government has assured traditional leaders that vehicles will be available when the hearings begin.\n\nWe have been told that there is enough transport that the Government has hired. The chiefs can also hire their own vehicles through the Central Mechanical and Equipment Department (CMED). All vehicles used will need CMED approval to ensure they are roadworthy. Chiefs will be using their own vehicles in addition to those hired for the programme, he said.The Government has already procured recorders and laptops for use during the programme. @nqotshili\n\n",

            "content": "Trust Freddy, Harare Bureau\n\nThe Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) has urged the Scientific and Industrial Research and Development Centre (SIRDC) to develop and implement cutting-edge forensic tools to fight crime as technology is leveraged to prevent, detect and successfully prosecute corruption.\n\nZacc chairperson Mr Michael Reza made the call while presiding over the signing of corporate and individual integrity pledges by SIRDC board members and management.\n\nOne of the most critical measures in tackling corruption is strengthening public institutions like the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission\n\nThis collaborative effort, Mr Reza said, sought to bolster the fight against corruption by leveraging innovation and technology to prevent, detect, and prosecute corrupt activities.\n\nYour expertise in data analytics, process optimisation, and technological innovation can revolutionise how we detect, prevent, and combat corruption. We envision collaboration in developing advanced forensic tools, creating corruption risk assessment models, and establishing technology-driven transparency mechanisms.\n\nThe importance of integrity in scientific research cannot be overstated. False data, manipulated results, or compromised methodologies not only undermine scientific progress but can lead to catastrophic policy decisions.\n\nThe commission is available to work with you in establishing specific integrity action plans and conducting regular integrity action plan implementation audits.\n\nThe two institutions could create a model that other institutions can aspire to emulate.The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission also proposes collaboration in several key areas such as joint training programmes on development of anti-corruption compliance frameworks tailor-made for research institutions, and the establishment of a centre of excellence for integrity in scientific research.\n\nSIRDC chairman Mr Misheck Kachere said: I am delighted to be here to reaffirm our commitment in upholding the highest standards of integrity through the signing of this corporate pledge. Today marks an important milestone in SIRDCs journey towards fostering a culture of transparency, accountability and ethical standards.\n\nIn signing this integrity pledge, we are making a solemn promise to ourselves and our stakeholders that we will uphold the principles of honesty, fairness, and responsibility in all our activities. This pledge serves as a reminder that we are accountable for our actions. We must always act with integrity.\n\nTo date, over 140 institutions, including Government departments, parastatals and private entities, have established integrity committees to combat corruption in the country.\n\nAt least 12 000 individuals from these institutions have signed personal integrity pledges, committing to uphold ethical standards.\n\nAn integrity pledge is a key component of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, designed to foster transparency, honesty and adherence to ethical principles across all sectors.\n\n",
