            "content": "Trish Mukwazo\n\nA prominent Bulawayo medical practitioner, Dr Nkonzo Ndebele, has been acquitted of charges relating to the non-payment of US$38,500 in child maintenance.\n\nDr Ndebele (59), of Bellevue suburb, appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Chellenge Mahembe, facing allegations of failing to comply with a court-ordered maintenance payment. However, the court ruled in his favour, citing legal technicalities arising from Zimbabwes evolving currency policies.\n\nIn delivering his judgment, Mr Mahembe explained that the original maintenance order, issued in 2015, was denominated in US dollars, the legal tender in Zimbabwe at the time.\n\nIt should be noted that in 2015, Zimbabwe was using the US dollar as legal tender, and the court ordered the accused to pay maintenance in that currency, said Mr Mahembe.\n\nAlthough it is clear the accused did not consistently make payments, the court has considered the impact of various statutory instruments enacted since 2019, specifically SI 142 of 2019, which reintroduced the Zimbabwean dollar as the sole legal tender, and SI 33 of 2019, which, under Section 4(1)(d), equated RTGS dollars to US dollars at a 1:1 rate.\n\nThe magistrate noted that the complainant had failed to demonstrate how the arrears amount of US$38,500 was calculated, given the significant changes in monetary policy over the years. He further pointed out that the complainant should have applied for a variation of the original maintenance order under Section 8 of the Maintenance Act, to reflect the currency transition.\n\nThe State has not managed to prove the arrears beyond reasonable doubt. In a criminal matter, the burden is on the State to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. It therefore follows that the accused is found not guilty and is acquitted, Mr Mahembe ruled.\n\nThe complainant, Ms Grace Ndlovu (49), had taken Dr Ndebele to court, accusing him of failing to pay maintenance for their daughter, an amount she claimed had accumulated to US$38,500 between December 2017 and December 2024.\n\nIn his defence, Dr Ndebele stated that he had co-founded a business, Quick Ketch Enterprises, with his wife and had invited Ms Ndlovu to assist in running the company, appointing her as a co-director.\n\nHe testified that in 2010, the landlord of their business premises offered an alternative location, and Ms Ndlovu, unbeknownst to him, signed a lease agreement in the name of her own company, Maiden Form Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd.\n\nDr Ndebele further claimed that Ms Ndlovu later purchased the premises using proceeds generated from Quick Ketch Enterprises.\n\nFollowing the issuance of the maintenance order in August 2015, which required him to pay US$500 per month (Order M1136/13), Dr Ndebele asserted that the two parties had agreed Ms Ndlovu would use business profits from Quick Ketch Enterprises to cover the maintenance payments.\n\nHe also stated that he had since been removed as a co-director and that the company was no longer profitable, leaving him financially incapacitated.\n\nIt was alleged that he had accrued maintenance arrears totalling US$38,500 over a seven-year period. However, the court found that the charges could not be sustained under current legal and financial frameworks.\n\n",

This was not easy to take knowing the plans one puts in place as a coach with a dream and a passion thats Godsend. We let ourselves down in the game against Namibia, this was the biggest score against us in my tenure as Head coach and our first loss to Namibia in four years.\n\nThis team, in my opinion, has the potential to be one of the top two sides I have ever coached. I know time is always a factor, not everyone shares a coachs vision, yes everyone has a dream not everyone can see the dream with you.\n\nWe have taken this set back and have reflected on our mishaps. Tactically, come game two on Wednesday versus Tunisia you will see a transformed team.

It is high time for the youth to continue with their day-to-day activities to improve the well-being of their country. It is only the youth who can shape the future of this country. Whose benefit will it be for one turn against the Government? Lets work hard towards the development of our countries as youth, said Mr Sakala.\n\nTurning to their visit, Mr Sakala said they were impressed with what they saw in Zimbabwe.\n\nWe came here to join our colleagues in celebrating their independence. We also went to Ziscosteel in Kwekwe to appreciate the impact of sanctions that were imposed by the countrys detractors.\n\nWe saw how a steel plant that used to employ about 7,500 workers and 150,000 casual workers was brought down to rubble, he said.\n\nHe stated that sanctions are not just inhuman, but they are an injustice against humanity, and must be lifted.\n\nWe also want to squash the false narrative that indigenous Zimbabweans are not managing their land.\n\nIts a false narrative that the Western powers would want to push so that they achieve their agenda of reversing the land reform programme. Contrary to the false narrative being pushed, we visited a number of farms to witness how productive they are.\n\nHe highlighted that as African youth, they will stand with Zimbabwe shoulder to shoulder in good and bad times.\n\nHe commended President Mnangagwa for showing resilience under the difficult circumstances.\n\nThey are still able to lead from the front and push the development agenda through the mantra Nyika Inovakwa nevene vayo. Only Zimbabweans will build this country.\n\nAs youth, we will push until we attain economic freedom during our lifetime, he said.\n\nAfrican Youth Congress chair Cde Taurai Kandishaya said the visiting delegation appreciated what they saw in Zimbabwe.\n\nCde Kandishaya also took a swipe at Geza, saying Zimbabweans cannot be told what to do by a fugitive.\n\nYou know; bitterness is the result of failure. Youths cannot be told what to do with a fugitive, one who has failed in his life. The approach of Geza is that of a person who is driven by personal ambition, echoed Cde Kandishaya.\n\nGeza as a war veteran is a beneficiary of the Government policies\n\nSo we dont listen to individuals like Geza. We cannot go for a shut down. We will be shutting down our own life. Its not Gezas life that you shut down. So they must just leave us alone, he said.\n\n",
