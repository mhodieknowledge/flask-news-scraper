We are also looking at other areas to support our community to access quality services at this hospital. For a start, we have drilled a borehole that will be powered by solar energy, and we are going to provide an additional water tank. We believe that this initiative will, in the long run, complement what our Government is already doing to upgrade this health facility, said Mr Mureyani.\n\nHe said the association was deeply concerned about some operational challenges at the Beitbridge District Hospital, which serves not only Beitbridge but also a significant number of travellers, including cross-border transporters and visitors from various SADC countries.\n\nMr Mureyani emphasised the importance of other community members joining in to support the hospital to ensure the continuity of quality health services.\n\nThe 140-bed hospital serves a local population of 250 000, alongside approximately 13 000 people transiting through the town daily, as well as patients from neighbouring districts such as Gwanda, Mberengwa, and Mwenezi.\n\nIn addition, the hospital handles an average of 350 baby deliveries per month, including caesarean sections, which require consistent and adequate water supplies.\n\n",

            "content": "Online ReporterIts business as usual on Monday in Bulawayos city centre as vendors go about their business while the council is adapting to prioritise the relocation of vendors first before implementing enforcement measures.\n\nLast week, the Government, through the Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Daniel Garwe, issued a 48-hour ultimatum to address the growing incidence of night vending. The argument has been that the surge in unregulated informal trading in the CBD has resulted in increased pedestrian traffic, widespread littering, and disturbances to established businesses within the CBD, making the cities unattractive to investors.\n\nHowever, the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) has decided to take a less aggressive approach to the vending saga, allowing the 48-hour Government ultimatum to lapse incident-free. Deputy Mayor Edwin Ndlovu said on Saturday that they were in the final stages of relocating vendors from 5th Avenue and other areas in town to designated alternative spaces.\n\nThis process will ensure a smoother transition to compliant trading practices. We had already set in motion the process of relocating vendors to designated areas such as Baktas and Egodini when the Government issued the ultimatum. All registered vendors will be moved to the council-constructed available bays, and this relocation process is nearing completion, said Councillor Ndlovu.\n\nRegarding enforcement, he noted that the council was going to collaborate with the Zimbabwe Republic Police to ensure measures were effectively put into place once the relocation had been finalised.\n\nOur enforcement efforts will be around the clock, but we will rely on the police since our municipal officers lack the authority to make arrests, he said.\n\nAccording to statistics, the BCC has a total of 3,416 vending bays in the Central Business District, of which 3,279 are occupied, and only 244 of those have the necessary licences to operate legally. The highest concentration of unlicensed vendors can be found at various sites throughout the city, with significant discrepancies in site allocations and licences.\n\nThe figures provided by the local authority indicate that the city has 16 vending sites in the CBD. The site between Lobengula Street and Herbert Chitepo and 6th Avenue up to 8th Avenue has the highest number of bays (814) that are occupied, where just 12 are licensed. The Highlanders site has 749 bays, with 720 having been allocated and 184 bays being licensed.\n\nAt Baktas (2nd Avenue and Lobengula Street), all 175 bays, despite being allocated, are unlicensed by the local authority. The same applies to the site located at the corner of 6th Avenue and Lobengula Street, where out of the 337 bays available and allocated, none of them are legally licensed to operate by the local authority.\n\nAt Hyper, all the 30 vendors allocated are also not legally licensed to operate. At 6th Avenue Extension, only three vendors out of the 118 that were allocated are licensed to operate at the site, while at the site along Lobengula Street between 5th and 6th Avenue, only three out of the 121 allocated bays are licensed to operate.\n\nThe Flower Trading Site, which is located adjacent to the Large City Hall, has 37 allocated bays, of which just eight are licensed to operate. Meanwhile, the Fruits and Vegetables site, located at the corner of Robert Mugabe Way and 8th Avenue, has 96 bays available, with 52 having been allocated, and of those, just one bay is licensed to operate.\n\n",

            "content": "Chronicle Writer\n\nTHE United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) has stressed the urgent need for a more coordinated regional strategy to achieve food security in Eastern Africa while tackling the enduring challenges of trade barriers.This emerged on the sidelines of the ongoing 57th session of the ECAs Conference of African Ministers of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development where Professor Mthuli Ncube is attending as outgoing chairperson.The event, entitled Food Security and Cross-Border Trade: Navigating Challenges and Opportunities Amid the Implementation of the Agreement Establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), was organized by the ECAs Subregional Office for Eastern Africa and Eastern Africa Trade Information and Negotiations Institute (SEATINI) on Sunday.It brought together senior officials and experts to discuss the dynamics of food security and cross-border trade within the context of the AfCFTA.Speakers at the event highlighted that while the Eastern Africa region has recently experienced a growing food trade deficit, it is not that large, representing just 0.3 percent of regional Gross Domestic Product and, with the right policies, achieving collective food security is an attainable goal.Acting Director of ECA in Eastern Africa, Mr Andrew Mold, said in the early 2000s, the region transitioned from being a net food exporter to becoming a net importer, with substantial disparities across countries and commodities.A number of countries in our region now sustain large food trade deficits. However, the region is also home to several countries, which are net food exporters. Tanzania and Uganda, in particular, have emerged as leading food exporters, with notable surpluses in key commodities such as maize, he said.Experts at the meeting stressed that the AfCFTA could provide a rapid pathway to achieving greater regional food security. The AfCFTA is an important mechanism to boost intra-regional food trade, particularly in processed agri-food products.Simulations undertaken by ECA suggest that intra-continental food trade could increase by more than 60 percent by 2045 if the AfCFTA is fully implemented. Greater regional cooperation in removing the remaining barriers to intra-African trade offers a path to supply chain resilience in the sector, and ultimately better food security, he said.FAO Subregional Coordinator for Eastern Africa, Farayi Zimudzi, highlighted the pressing issue of low agricultural productivity amidst rapid population growth in Africa.It is imperative that our agricultural production systems keep pace with population growth, she stressed.Increasing investment in research and development, particularly in high-yield crop varieties and improved livestock, must be prioritized.Channing Arndt, a Research Professor and Director of the Center for Global Trade Analysis, said that the persistent issue of high tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs) continues to impede the free movement of agricultural products in Africa.The session was moderated by Jane Nalunga, Director of SEATINI-Uganda who reiterated the importance of leveraging digital solutions and sustainable agricultural practices for Africas food security.She called on researchers to explore how technological advancements and green innovations can transform food systems and build resilience.The event also advocated for the implementation of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) to address productivity challenges and enhance agricultural investment across the continent. CAADP is aimed at increasing food security and nutrition, reducing rural poverty, creating employment, and contributing to economic development while safeguarding the environment.Moreover, CAADP aims for a six per cent annual growth rate in the agricultural sector, with African Union member states allocating at least 10 per cent of their budgets to agriculture.The side event concluded with a resounding call for strengthened regional cooperation to implement the AfCFTA, through the elimination of trade barriers to food stuffs, while increasing investment in agricultural development to ensure a food-secure future for Eastern Africa and the Continent as a whole.\n\n",

            "content": "Chronicle Writer\n\nON the margins of the 57th Session of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, policymakers, business leaders, and development partners have discussed how African businesses can successfully trade under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) while fostering inclusive growth and decent work.\n\nProf Mthuli Ncube delivered opening remarks at the conference, in Addis Ababa\n\nOrganized by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA Subregional office for Southern Africa, the Africa Trade Policy Center and the Subregional office for northern Africa) and the International Labour Organization (ILO), the event underscored both the transformative potential of AfCFTA and the pressing need for action to ensure businesses, particularly micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), can reap its benefits.Opening the session, Eunice G. Kamwendo, Director of ECAs Subregional Office for Southern Africa, emphasized that the AfCFTA is not just about transactions but about people.She stressed that MSMEs, which account for 90 percent of businesses and 80 percent of employment, must have the tools to succeed, as they are key drivers of economic transformation in Africa.On his part, Melaku Desta, Coordinator of ATPC at ECA, introduced the Step-by-Step Guide for Trade in Goods under AfCFTA, a practical tool to help businesses navigate trade procedures and access market opportunities. He emphasized that while National AfCFTA Implementation Strategies have been developed, they remain largely public-sector focused, leaving MSMEs with limited direct support.Teddy Soobramanien, CEO of the COMESA Business Council, emphasized the urgency of moving beyond policy discussions, urging the private sector to turn AfCFTA from paper into action.He called on businesses to actively leverage the agreement for regional trade expansion, ensuring that AfCFTAs potential is fully realized.Addressing the issue of labour rights, Hod Anyigba, Executive Director of the Africa Labour Research and Education Institute (ALREI) and Chief Economist at the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC)-Africa, stressed that trade must serve people, not just profits.He called for stronger labour protections, corporate accountability, and due diligence in AfCFTA implementation, warning that without these safeguards, trade liberalization could lead to informal employment and deteriorating working conditions.Marva Corley-Coulibaly, Chief of Globalization, Competitiveness and Labour Standards at the ILO, emphasized that good jobs do not happen automatically.Just as we meticulously plan trade, industrial, and investment policies, we must also plan for decent work, not as an afterthought, she stated.While AfCFTA includes some labour provisions, she pointed out that critical gaps remain, particularly in addressing issues like modern slavery, human trafficking, and workplace safety.She proposed the introduction of a Trade and Sustainable Development Protocol to ensure that trade translates into decent work and economic justice.Bringing the discussion to the role of women and youth entrepreneurs, Cynthia E. Gnassingbe, Senior Advisor to the AfCFTA Secretariat, underscored the importance of expanded market access, reduced trade barriers, and institutional support. She highlighted that the Women and Youth in Trade Protocol and the Digital Trade Protocol offer a framework for inclusive participation but need stronger financing mechanisms to ensure MSMEs can access affordable capital. She also called for capacity-building programs that provide business training, mentorship, and networking opportunities to empower entrepreneurs.Experts highlighted key actions to maximize AfCFTAs impact. These include promoting fair trade and decent work by strengthening labour protections, ensuring enforcement, and advancing social inclusion and aligning national policies for full AfCFTA implementation.Support for MSMEs, women, and youth with financing and training as well as improving trade facilitation with clear regulations and tools is also under focus with the private sector urged to turn policies into action.The ILOs Decent Work Toolkit, which facilitates the examination of labour provisions in trade agreements and the impact of trade policy on labour markets, along with ECAs Step-by-Step Guide for Trade in Goods under AfCFTA, serve as valuable tools to support private sector trade while promoting decent work. The session underscored the need for collaboration to ensure AfCFTA drives economic transformation for businesses and workers across Africa.\n\n",
