His message read: Bosso ngenkani! iTeam yezwe lonke. Babethi ayibulawe, ayisoze ibulawe sikhona. I will gladly pay this outstanding debt directly to the former coach tomorrow without fail. Someone please inbox and share the banking details with exact amount due asap.\n\nChivayos generosity and philanthropic efforts are well-documented, with a history of giving back to the community.

South Africa had controlled Namibia since World War One after a brutal few decades of German colonial rule remembered for the genocide of the Herero and Nama people.\n\nAs a boy he looked after his familys cattle and attended a Finnish mission school, before moving to the coastal town of Walvis Bay and then the capital Windhoek, where he worked for South African Railways, according to a biography posted on the website of Nujomas charitable foundation.\n\nNujoma left his job on the railways to focus his energies on bringing down the apartheid system.\n\nIn the late 1950s he became leader of the Owambo Peoples Organisation, a precursor to liberation movement SWAPO, organising resistance to the forced relocation of Black people in Windhoek that culminated in the police killing 12 unarmed people and wounding dozens more.\n\nNujoma was charged with organising the resistance and arrested.\n\nIn 1960, he went into exile. He travelled across Africa before reaching the United States, where he petitioned the United Nations for Namibias independence.\n\nMade SWAPO leader in absentia, Nujoma established its armed wing and in 1966 launched a guerrilla war against the apartheid government.\n\nIt took more than a decade of pressure from Nujoma and others before a U.N. Security Council resolution in 1978 proposed a ceasefire and elections, and another decade for the ceasefire deal to be signed and elections held in late 1989.\n\nSWAPO won a majority in those elections, and Nujoma took office in March the following year.\n\n",
