Thousands of jubilant kids from around the country attended the event. Indeed, this was a large party (and kids like them so much!), where food, drink, music and fun flowed; but it has a more profound meaning  it symbolises the continuity of Independence through the young.\n\nThe climax was yesterday when tens of thousands of citizens from all over the country gathered at the Mutora Open Ground to witness the main Independence Day celebration, again led by the President.\n\nA big downpour on Mutora blessed the event ahead of the beginning of proceedings, holding back later to allow the celebration to be staged.\n\nIndependence Day is a thoroughly important moment for us. That is the day when Zimbabwe was born 45 years ago after nine decades of struggle against British colonial misrule.\n\nThe first war of liberation in 1896 ended in defeat for the owners of the land. Spear, bow and arrow and the burning spirit to liberate the land were inadequate against the oppressors gun, dynamite and malevolent spirit.\n\nAlthough the masses fell, that uprising was a massive statement of what was to follow.\n\nSeventy more years of oppression ensued. Blacks were kicked out of their ancestral lands and left to wander and settle elsewhere.Whites soon zoned the fertile lands as theirs. They, too, grabbed gold workings and made much money out of them.They enacted multiple unjust laws to cement the misrule.\n\nThe injustice angered blacks more. Better trained and armed and with the spirit to liberate themselves now greater, the second war of liberation erupted in 1966 and ended in a crushing victory for the masses.\n\nThat is the long, difficult, sweaty and bloody road that the brave people of Zimbabwe walked to attain Independence on April 18, 1980, the 45th anniversary of which we marked yesterday.\n\nThe mood was celebratory all over the country yesterday as we reflected on the forgettable 90 years of colonialism, the peoples brave fight against it and the 45 years of post-Independence national development.\n\nWe are now governing ourselves in peace and unity. There is a growing consciousness among our people on the centrality of our nationhood, which is the basis for any people to thrive socially, politically and economically.\n\nZimbabweans own their land and are doing wonders on it. They are driving their economy, thanks to the indigenisation and economic empowerment policy championed by the Government most earnestly since 2000.\n\nInvestment in schools, colleges and universities since 1980 have made our people some of the most educated in Africa.There is massive investment in the health services sector as well, ensuring greater public access to health care.\n\nYesterday was certainly yet another moment for us as a nation to look back, celebrate the progress we have made over the past 45 years and look ahead with hope and commitment to overcome any challenges that come our way so we continue to progress.\n\nSynonyms for Presidentchairmanchairchairpersondirectorchief executiveCEOpresidingprincipalchairedmasterheadpresided\n\n",

He underscored that workers welfare remains a top priority, while also paying tribute to the security forces for the peace and stability prevailing across the country.\n\nAs the Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, the President urged the nation to embrace innovation, technology and skills development as the foundation of future success, with Vision 2030 now within reach.\n\nBefore addressing thousands gathered at Mutora Open Grounds in Gokwe for the main Independence Day celebrations, the President, accompanied by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa, inspected the Independence Parade mounted by the ZDF. Vice-President Dr Constantino Chiwenga and his wife, Cabinet Ministers, and Service Chiefs were among the dignitaries present.\n\nVice-President Dr Constantino Chiwenga and his wife\n\nIn his keynote address, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwes journey since independence has been one of inspiration, marked by significant progress across all sectors.\n\nAfter 45 years of independence, the Zanu-PF Government remains committed to building a future that honours the sacrifices of the past, while securing prosperity for generations to come. To ensure Zimbabwean products remain competitive both locally and globally, technical and vocational education, particularly in Science, Technology, and Innovation, is critical, he said.\n\nThe President said food security would always be prioritised, with the Agriculture Transformation Strategy deepening rural reforms to enhance grain production and efficiency.\n\nLand, which is our inalienable heritage, is being productively utilised, and we anticipate a bumper harvest from the 2024/25 summer cropping season. This will allow us to replenish the Strategic Grain Reserve, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa noted that while last seasons El Nio-induced drought affected many districts, the nation managed to feed itself.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa accompanied by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa\n\nThe Food Deficit Mitigation Programme, which included cash transfers to urban households, significantly reduced vulnerability, he said.\n\nWhile saluting the security forces, President Mnangagwa called on all citizens to protect the nation from both internal and external elements that threaten national development.\n\nHand-in-hand, with focus and discipline, let us defend and work harder for our motherland, Zimbabwe. We salute our security services for their loyalty and patriotism, and for steadfastly defending our sovereignty and hard-won independence, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the Second Republic is entrenching the rule of law and protecting law-abiding citizens while decisively dealing with rogue elements.\n\nHe also wished the nation a happy Easter holiday.\n\nDivisive and alarmist elements will never triumph over a nation such as ours, born from a rich liberation history and the blood of brave sons and daughters. Law enforcement agencies will always act in accordance with the law and the best interests of our sovereign motherland, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa delivers his remarks at the 45th Independence celebrations at Nembudziya Stadium in Gokwe yesterday.  Picture: Believe Nyakudjara\n\nZimbabwe being a unitary State, the President called for unity and development, encouraging every citizen to contribute positively.\n\nAs communities, let us uphold values of love, unity, compassion, empathy, discipline and hard, honest work  qualities for which Zimbabweans are known. These values must be passed on to all, young and old.\n\nRegardless of political affiliation, religion, race, gender or age, let us all put Zimbabwe first. It is the only country we call home, and so shall future generations, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said that just like culture and tradition, values such as love, trust and mutual support must be handed down through generations. He further highlighted how Zimbabweans, under the Second Republic, are defying odds and achieving remarkable development successes from household to provincial level.\n\nThe policies of the Second Republic are bearing fruit. The mining sector is leading in value-addition, with a projected 5,6 percent growth this year, spurred by new mines and favourable commodity prices, noted President Mnangagwa.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa inspects a parade at the Independence celebrations in Nembudziya, Gokwe\n\nThe accelerated implementation of the National Development Strategy has had a positive effect on the manufacturing sector. The pharmaceutical sector, for example, has seen capacity utilisation rise to 50 percent from 43 percent.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said Governments efforts to achieve energy security are yielding results, with rural electrification of schools, clinics, and administrative centres improving service delivery.\n\nOn veterans of the liberation struggle, he said the Government continues to honour their contributions by creating inclusive opportunities for socio-economic participation.\n\nMany programmes are underway, including Presidential Borehole Drilling, Rural Solarisation, Housing Schemes, and Youth Empowerment Initiatives. Communities must be actively involved in these programmes championed by the ruling Zanu-PF. All Zimbabweans regardless of gender, tribe, age or political affiliation must benefit. Zanu-PF is a peoples party, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe also highlighted the ongoing rehabilitation and upgrading of infrastructure, particularly in disaster-prone areas like Gokwe. Issuing a stern warning against the misuse of social media, the President urged Zimbabweans to remain vigilant and united.\n\nI commend you, my fellow compatriots at home and abroad, for remaining patriotic and steadfast, never allowing yourselves to be misled by shadowy elements with dubious agendas, he said.\n\n",

The day was chilly, and it rained in the morning, causing thick mud at the venue.\n\nHowever, this did little to dampen the lively spirit among the thousands of people from all walks of life who attended the Independence Day celebrations. The rural heartland transformed into a sea of celebration as people from all walks of life came together to honour the sacrifices of the past and look towards a brighter future.\n\nAt the centre of the days festivities was President Mnangagwa, who delivered a stirring address that captured both the historical weight of the occasion and the aspirations of the Second Republic.\n\nPart of the crowd that braved the rainy weather to attend the countrys 45th Independence celebrations at Nembudziya Stadium in Gokwe yesterday.

With a call to embrace technical and vocational education  especially in science and technology  he outlined a vision of a self-sustaining, competitive economy rooted in home-grown expertise and resilience.\n\nTo guarantee that Zimbabwean products are competitive in both local and global markets, technical and vocational education, with biases in Science, Technology and Innovation, are of critical importance, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwas words struck a chord with the audience.

I have lived in Gokwe for about 15 years and this is the biggest event to ever take place here. This day will never be forgotten by the people of Gokwe.\n\nThe Presidents speech was powerful. It feels like were being called to build something new  and I want my children to be part of that future, shared Mr Thabo Marurenza, who is an artisan at Zesa in Gokwe and is also a brand ambassador for Radio Zimbabwe.\n\nWar veteran Cde Eckem Moyo, whose Chimurenga name is Cde Robert Makiza, stood with pride as he reflected on the significance of Zimbabwes Independence Day celebrations.

It brings back so many emotions, joy, pride, and a deep sorrow for the comrades we lost along the way, he recalled.\n\nDraped in the colours of the national flag, Cde Moyo watched the festivities unfold with a sense of fulfilment. The beating drums, childrens laughter and patriotic songs all served as a reminder of what they had fought for.\n\nAs war veterans, we are grateful to the President for bringing such a mammoth event to rural Gokwe. He truly is a visionary leader who is living true to his mantra of leaving no one and no place behind, said Cde Moyo.\n\nGokwe businessman Mr Stan Manyiwa could hardly contain his excitement as his enterprise experienced a surge in activity during the Independence Day celebrations.\n\nMembers of the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services perform mass displays at the 45th commemorations at Nembudziya Stadium in Gokwe yesterday.

From traditional dance troupes to school choirs, the days performances reflected Zimbabwes cultural richness and enduring patriotism. President Mnangagwa also lit the Independence Flame, signifying that the legacy of independence is not just about the past, but also about striving for progress, peace, and prosperity.\n\nThe crowd was entertained by various activities, including displays by the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, musicians, and other performers.

The festivities began with a colourful procession of drum majorettes from D Square along Nketa Drive, escorted by the police and an ambulance, setting a lively tone for the day.\n\nBulawayo independence celebrations\n\nThe stadium was adorned with 45 national flags, symbolising each year of independence, while banners boldly displayed the milestone figure 45. Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube led the provincial event, which kicked off with the singing of the National Anthem.\n\nMinister Ncube inspected a quarter guard mounted by members of the Zimbabwe National Armys 1 Infantry Brigade before delivering President Mnangagwas Independence Day speech to a cheering crowd.\n\nThe audience was thrilled by a joint military parade that showcased the marching and drilling prowess of members from the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF), Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service (ZPCS).\n\nAmong the dignitaries present were Commander 1 Infantry Brigade, Brigadier General Cephas Gurira, ZRP Officer Commanding Bulawayo, Commissioner Jasper Chizemo, ZPCS Officer Commanding Bulawayo, Commissioner Mkhulunyelwa Ngwenya, Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Raj Modi, Bulawayo Provincial Affairs Permanent Secretary Mr Paul Nyoni and several Bulawayo City councillors.\n\nI just couldnt miss this moment.

Every chapter of our footballing past resonates with the spirit and legacy of this enduring institution.\n\nAs the Bulawayo giants edge closer to their 100th anniversary in 2026, one accolade stands out as indisputable for them  Highlanders boast the most passionate and loyal fan base in Zimbabwean football. Thats undeniable, too.\n\nFans at the Soweto end at Barbourfields Stadium\n\nBarbourfields Stadium, nestled in the heart of Bulawayos Barbourfields suburb, transforms into a cauldron of black and white colours on any given Sunday.\n\nDespite the clubs extended title drought, having last lifted the Premiership trophy in 2006, there are still thousands of fans who go through the turnstiles at the home ground, week in, week out. Between 6 000 and 8 000 supporters arrive not out of obligation, but out of a deep emotional bond with a club that has long transcended the football pitch.\n\nFor a team that hasnt lifted the league title, such unwavering support is rare and admirable. Bossos popularity seems to grow even when silverware is thin on the ground.\n\nThere are no two ways about it, Highlanders have the best and most loyal fans in the country. Probably one of the best-supported teams in Africas Southern Region. They are simply a cut above the rest.\n\nDynamos fans\n\nIn contrast, fellow giants Dynamos and CAPS United, who also boast rich histories, now struggle to attract even half of Bossos average crowd. What sets Highlanders apart is the way their supporters rally more fiercely when the going gets tough. Poor form, internal challenges, or financial constraints have not diluted the devotion of the Bosso faithful.\n\nIts an affair bound by love, passion, and a long-held tradition borne out of the teams founding fathers. The experience of following Highlanders is deeply personal. For some, its an inheritance; for others, a Sunday ritual that provides belonging and identity.\n\nThe all-time football legend, Pele, aptly described that experience.\n\nFootball is a powerful tool that can bring people together, unite them, and make them forget their differences. Its a universal language, said the great Pele.\n\nA few clubs can reflect that spirit. They wish they could.\n\nCaps United fans\n\nOne supporter, Wisdom Nyathi, encapsulates the sentiment perfectly.\n\nGrowing up in the vicinity of Makokoba, when it was the heartland of Highlanders Football Club, I was destined to become a die-hard Bosso fan. As a toddler, I began to speak the language of those around me, and Highlanders became a household name. I saw the team win four league titles in a row and was there when they last lifted the championship in 2006.\n\nThose moments are etched in my memory forever. Highlanders is more than just a football club to me; its a culture ingrained in my being.\n\nThat passion doesnt dim with age or disappointment. Even amid club challenges like unpaid salaries, slow infrastructure upgrades, and a lack of modern membership structures, support remains fervent.\n\nFemale fan Thobekile Moyo said: There is no place like Barbourfields Stadium. People believe football stadiums are not safe for women, but at Bosso, even the number of women who come to support Highlanders is growing each week.\n\nFor some the love is generational  its a tradition. For Themba Siziba, every visit to the Soweto End at Barbourfields is a tribute to his late father.\n\nMy father used to carry me on a bicycle to go to watch football. Every time I get to Soweto, I think of him. This is the team he left me to support. Its not about the result for me. Its not something political or tribal; its just pure love for Highlanders and what the club means to me. @innocentskizoe\n\n",

We also have initiatives such as the E-Learning strategy aimed at providing computers in schools, the Presidential Internet Scheme, and the distribution of land to Zimbabweans under the land tenure programme recently launched by President Mnangagwa.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the event, Chief Chireya, the traditional leader in the host district, expressed gratitude to President Mnangagwa for bringing the independence celebrations to his area.\n\nWe are happy that the hosting of these celebrations has brought development to our area. We did not have supermarkets, and now they are there.

The event aims to empower young creatives and foster sustainable growth within the fashion sector, positioning it as a viable career option and a key contributor to the creative economy.\n\nIn an interview with Saturday Chronicle, Danayi stressed the importance of the summit in the context of Zimbabwes evolving fashion narrative.\n\nThe Creative DNA programme promotes alternative and innovative approaches to the global fashion system. By showcasing the Zimbabwean fashion sector as a viable and rewarding career path for young people, we aim to demonstrate its potential as a significant contributor to the creative economy, she said.\n\nThe initiative comes at a critical time when many creatives, particularly those involved in tangible products like fashion, sculpting, and visual arts, face significant challenges in accessing information about exporting their products internationally.\n\nWe have realised that most of our creatives have limited knowledge about how to reach international markets, Danayi noted, highlighting a gap that the summit seeks to fill.\n\nA highlight of the Creative DNA Bulawayo Edition is the masterclass titled, Local to Global: Unlocking Trade and Export Opportunities for Zimbabwean Creatives. Facilitated by Candy Banda, a seasoned Relationship Manager at DHL Express, this masterclass will provide essential insights into navigating the complexities of global logistics and market access. With over nine years of experience in the logistics industry, Candys expertise will empower participants to expand their global reach.\n\nUnderstanding how to export is crucial for our designers. This masterclass will equip them with the tools they need to break into international markets and facilitate sustainable growth, remarked Danayi.\n\nThe summit will also place a strong emphasis on sustainability, an increasingly relevant theme in the global fashion industry.\n\nNkanyeziyethu Malunga, the founder and creative director of Ganu Designs, will lead a workshop focused on utilising natural resources and dyes to colour fabrics.\n\nThis approach taps into our cultural heritage. By using natural dyes, we can allow fashion designers to tell their stories authentically while promoting sustainability, said Danayi.\n\nParticipants will learn how to create patterns using resources found within their own backyards, fostering a sense of connection to their environment and heritage.\n\nIts about going back to our roots, she added, highlighting the importance of indigenous knowledge systems in the modern fashion narrative.\n\nIn addition to sustainability, the summit will feature a session led by Dumi Ndlovu, a multi-award-winning visual artist known for his innovative collagraph printing technique. This session aims to encourage designers to create their own fabrics, reinforcing their unique identities through customised textile designs.\n\nDumis expertise will inspire participants to explore originality in their work. By promoting their own fabrics, designers can distinguish themselves in a competitive market, she said.\n\nThe Creative DNA Bulawayo Edition will also include a pop-up showroom and fashion mixer, coinciding with the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) which will be held a stones throw away at the Zimbabwe International Conference and Exhibition Smart City. This event is designed to showcase the creativity and innovation within Zimbabwes fashion industry, providing a platform for local designers to interact with key stakeholders in trade and commerce.\n\nAs many industry leaders will be in Bulawayo during the trade fair, this is a fantastic opportunity for them to engage with the creative industry. Having this mix of audiences in one room will facilitate important conversations about breaking into international markets, added Danayi.\n\nThe pop-up showroom aims to bridge the gap between local talent and international opportunities, allowing designers to display their work and connect with potential buyers and collaborators.\n\nThis interaction is crucial for our designers. They have products that need allies to help push them into the world.\n\nThe Creative DNA Summit is part of a broader initiative by the British Council to support the creative industries across Africa. In partnership with organisations such as Paper Bag Africa and Afri-Digital, the programme provides access to business accelerator programmes, design think tanks, showcasing opportunities, and grants.Danayi highlighted the significance of these collaborations.\n\nThe projects impact on the local economy is significant. Creatives are receiving free education in areas that typically incur substantial costs, alongside access to expert guidance that is often difficult to obtain.Ultimately, the goal is to cultivate a creative industry with a strong business foundation, enabling sustainable growth.\n\nWhile our creatives possess abundant talent, creativity alone, without basic business acumen, is insufficient for a thriving fashion industry. We aim to empower fashion creatives to sustain their livelihoods through design and compete globally by exporting their work, she said. As the summit approaches, Danayi has some encouraging words for aspiring designers and creatives.\n\nThis summit offers fertile ground for connecting with both peers and industry professionals. Growth requires stepping outside your comfort zone. Your network is your net worth, and were providing creatives with an opportunity to expand theirs.\n\nShe encourages attendees to showcase their work, exchange ideas, ask questions, and explore collaborative synergies.\n\nIts also a chance to meet the Creative DNA team in Zimbabwe and share your programme desires. We want to build this programme alongside the community we represent.\n\nAs the Creative DNA Bulawayo Edition approaches, Danayis vision for the future of Zimbabwean fashion is clear.\n\nWere not just here to deliver; were here to serve our fashion community through this programme. Thats the exciting part of the summit  youll have direct access to the team shaping its development, and your input will help us tailor our work to best serve our community.Follow on X @MbuleloMpofu.\n\n",

            "content": "Sikhulekelani Moyo,[emailprotected]\n\nFOUNDED in 1982, Selbourne Park Christian Church, formerly known as Bulawayo Christian Centre, has become a community-centred institution, prioritising giving back to the community through various initiatives, including charity programmes, community-based support, and restoring families as a critical institution.\n\nThe church changed its name when it moved to the Selbourne Park neighbourhood 30 years ago. Originally founded by a team of five visionary pastors  Richard Langworthy, Neil Martin, Levy Masuku, Peter McKenzie, and Basil OConnell Jones  the church was built on a simple yet powerful vision of preaching the undiluted message of the cross of Jesus Christ and restoring dignity to families and communities.\n\nSpeaking to Saturday Chronicle, Pastor Richard Langworthy, one of the founding members, said the church has remained grounded in its core values, with the original leadership team still united after more than 30 years. He said the church started with five pastors and now has 19 pastors, where each member has understood what it is to pick up their cross and not to be self-seeking, but has a vision for the church and Gods people.\n\nMembers of Arise Choir at the Malibongwe Concert at Selbourne Park Christian Church\n\nSelbourne Park Christian Church is not just a place of worship; its a hub of hope. Through a wide array of outreach programmes, the church supports vulnerable communities in Nkayi, Ntabazinduna, Zvishavane, and Domboshava.\n\nAmong its flagship initiatives is a partnership with Health Education Food Organisation (HEFO), a local private voluntary organisation, through which they provide health interventions, educational support, and agriculture-based empowerment projects.\n\nWe work in partnership with Health Education Food Organisation (HEFO), a self-operating private voluntary organisation in three districts in Nkayi. We also run a programme called Restoring Families, which is a television programme that highlights Gods intention for the family unit, said Pastor Langworthy.\n\nThe church also runs a popular television programme, Restoring Families, which broadcasts uplifting messages on the importance of strong, godly family units. The show is produced at the churchs own Phakama Productions studio in Bulawayo, which also creates gospel-inspired content for Southern African audiences.\n\nAlso, our farming programme services enable us to support our communities through agriculture, and we also have educational programmes for the less privileged, said Pastor Langworthy.\n\nSelbourne Park Christian Church Childrens Ministry\n\nHe recalls how the construction of the church building in Selbourne Park was a major test of faith. Remarkably, the project was fully funded by Zimbabweans without any external donors and completed within 14 months. Beyond Sunday services, Pastor Langworthy said Selbourne Park Christian Church offers its building facilities to host community-based programmes.\n\nWe have constructed church buildings that are not only places of worship but also serve the broader community by being made available for specific community-based purposes and programmes, he said.\n\nToday, the church premises are more than a sanctuary. They host community meetings, youth camps, and skills development workshops. Every year, up to 500 young people attend its youth programmes, making it one of the most active Christian youth movements in the region.\n\nSelbourne Park Christian Church is a member of Church Team Ministries International (CTMI), a network of churches across Africa led by Pastor Miki Hardy. Through CTMI, the church engages with diverse denominations, promoting unity and the apostolic message of Christ and Him crucified.\n\nAsked about new initiatives and future plans, Pastor Langworthy said the church is engaged in the construction of buildings for the budding churches in Nkayi, Ntabazinduna, Zvishavane, and Domboshava. He also mentioned the Crossover Programme, an assisted reading initiative aimed at improving literacy among children in rural communities, which is set to be launched soon.\n\nDesigned to support young learners with limited access to educational resources, the programme seeks to bridge the literacy gap by providing tailored reading assistance and learning materials, said Pastor Langworthy.\n\nFor Pastor Witness Mzizi, a long-serving member of the church, the transformation goes beyond infrastructure and outreach. Its about the heart of the ministry.\n\nI have witnessed the power of the Gospel in breaking down racial barriers. In our church, black and white people live together as brothers and sisters, a true reflection of the gospels impact. Its amazing how the gospel is so simple yet so powerful, he said.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the unity of purpose and unwavering faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nSince the early 1990s, not a single pastor has left to start their own independent ministry. Every pastor has faithfully served, giving their lives for the common good of the body of Christ, said Pastor Mzizi.\n\nPastor Langworthy further said that during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Selbourne Park Christian Church established a community farming programme that provided vital support to 100 families. Using its resources, the initiative ensured access to food and basic supplies at a time when many were facing uncertainty and hardship.\n\nWe have built a multiracial, multi-social Christian family that is not limited to urban areas but extends into our rural churches and overseas, said Pastor Langworthy.@SikhulekelaniM1\n\n",
