Afterwards, they all travelled in the same car in a motorcade to the Capitol.\n\nKing Charles was among those wishing the new president well, sending a personal message to Mr Trump congratulating him and reflecting on the enduring special relationship between the UK and US.\n\n",

            "content": "Thupeyo Muleya,Beitbridge Bureau\n\nSouth African security authorities have arrested a 44-year-old migrant at the Beitbridge border post with a consignment of Remington Gold cigarettes worth an estimated R14 million, which are believed to have been smuggled from Zimbabwe.\n\nThe smuggling of cigarettes has become a persistent issue for authorities in both countries, who are often collaborating to reduce the illegal trade.\n\nIt is understood that South African customs laws are restrictive for Zimbabwean exporters, making it difficult to legally transport the cigarettes from Zimbabwe to South Africa, which has led to a rise in smuggling activities involving various brands.\n\nIn many instances, cigarettes are smuggled through the Limpopo River, while others attempt to cross the border illegally. It is estimated that at least one-third of the cigarette brands on the South African market are smuggled from Zimbabwe, including Pacific, Remington Gold, Mega, Dullahs, Branson, and Servilles.\n\nA box of cigarettes is typically bought for around US$120 from local producers and sold for between US$250 and US$300 to syndicates, who then smuggle them into South Africa, where they are sold for upwards of R15,000. Those involved in the illegal transportation of the cigarettes are paid between R100 and R300 per box, with much of the smuggling taking place under the cover of darkness.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Hlulani Mashaba confirmed that the contraband was intercepted on Saturday. The nationality of the migrant will be revealed following his initial court appearance at Musina Magistrates Court on charges of smuggling.\n\nThe Provincial Commissioner of police in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe, has applauded the police for their vigilance and alertness, which led to the arrest of a 44-year-old foreign national for smuggling illicit cigarettes worth more than fourteen million rands at Beitbridge Port of Entry on Saturday, he said.\n\nIt is reported that the suspect was driving a white truck with a tanker trailer when he was stopped by the police at the port of entry. The driver claimed the vehicle was empty, but the police suspected it might be loaded. The truck was then taken to the ramp zone at the commercial side for further inspection.\n\nDuring the search, police discovered that the vehicle was fully loaded with illicit cigarettes of the Remington Gold brand. The suspect failed to provide a satisfactory explanation regarding the origin of the cigarettes and was immediately placed under arrest on the spot, added Brigadier Mashaba.\n\nPolice have since confiscated 710 boxes of Remington Gold illicit cigarettes, with an estimated street value of R14,449,363.00, as well as the truck tanker, which is valued at R2,500,000.\n\n",

He is also not admitted to a local hospital for further medical care. The alleged kingpin and ringleader, a Lesotho national, is known by the name James Neo Tshoaeli, but is commonly referred to as Tiger.\n\nBrigadier Mathe added that Tshoaeli has been implicated in several statements as one of the leaders controlling underground operations. He is also accused by some of the miners who resurfaced from underground of being responsible for deaths, assaults, and torture, based on videos in police possession.\n\nTshoaeli is also alleged to have hoarded food and kept it away from other illegal miners.\n\nMajor General Asaneng has expressed disappointment over what he described as an embarrassment to the Vala Umgodi operation, which has been running since December 2023. He has vowed to ensure that those responsible for this escape from custody are brought to justice and that Tshoaeli is found. Tiger is now a fugitive of justice, she said.\n\n",

The services are scheduled to start at 4pm each day.The programme will feature Bishop Robert Clancy, an internationally renowned preacher, delivering the main message, while Apostle Anele Bongani Ndebele will lead intercessory prayers. The message for the event is inspired by Matthew 24:14: And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.Bishop Clancy, an Australian minister, has a global ministry that spans Asia, Africa, India, Brazil, Mexico, the Caribbean, and the USA. His mission is centred on spreading the Gospel, calling individuals and the church to genuine repentance, and fostering spiritual renewal.He is a passionate advocate for prevailing prayer, spiritual warfare, and deliverance, emphasisng their role in breaking strongholds and achieving true freedom in Christ. Bishop Clancys teachings focus on spiritual gifts, fasting, and building a strong relationship with Jesus Christ.Bishop Clancys powerful testimony recounts his transformation from a life of crime and gang activity in 1997 to a radical salvation experience that led him to full-time ministry. His first missionary trip was to East Timor in 1999, where he later married Pastor Aida Clancy.In 2011, Bishop Clancy left his career and sold his home to dedicate himself fully to ministry, relocating with his family to Africa. He established a mission before returning to Australia, continuing his work to spread the message of the cross.In his early ministry, Bishop Clancy received a vision of Africa experiencing a spiritual revival, beginning in the East and spreading across the continent. This revival, he believes, will ignite a global spiritual awakening, heralding the return of Christ for His church.Despite pandemic travel restrictions, Bishop Clancy maintained an active online presence, reaching over 10 000 daily viewers through social media platforms. Since 2022, he has spent six months ministering across Africa and Asia, with plans for further missions in 2024, including a visit to the USA during the election season.The Heavenly Factor Prophetic Transition outreach is expected to draw participants seeking spiritual renewal, deliverance, and empowerment.\n\n",

Each month, the concert series will showcase artistes from a different Zimbabwean province, with the performances held at the iconic Theatre in the Park.\n\nSpeaking to Chronicle Showbiz Online, earGROUND Media founder Plot Mhako expressed his excitement about the project, noting that while Zimbabwe has an abundance of talent across its provinces, the spotlight has largely focused on Harare-based artistes.#VoicesFrom_ is our effort to shift the narrative by celebrating exceptional artistes from regions that are often marginalised, including rural communities, Mhako said.\n\nThe series builds on earGROUND Medias work with the Kombi Station, a mobile media platform launched in 2022 that documents and gives visibility to artists in remote areas.\n\nMhako explained that while Kombi Station has been successful in uncovering hidden talent, #VoicesFrom_ takes it further by connecting these artistes with larger audiences, media visibility, and new opportunities.We realised there was a need to create a stage where these artistes could be seen by a broader audience, where they could secure bookings, collaborations, and industry recognition, he added.\n\nThe initiative includes partnerships with Theatre in the Park to organise travel, accommodation, rehearsals, venue bookings, and publicity for the artistes. In return, the artistes will benefit from a revenue-sharing arrangement.\n\nThe initiative also aims to connect these performers with radio and TV stations, newspapers, studios, and potential promoters, maximising their exposure while in Harare.\n\nearGROUND Media has a proven track record of championing emerging talent. In 2022, they co-hosted the AMPLIFAYA Festival, where artistes from nine provinces showcased their work to great acclaim. #VoicesFrom_ takes this success to the next level by ensuring that talent from outside Harare gets the recognition it deserves.Imagine a #VoicesFrom_Bulawayo edition featuring top artistes like MJ Sings, Vuyo Brown, Hwabaraty, Thandy Dhlana, Aku Khanya, and MsizKay, Mhako said.\n\nThese artistes, who have international-calibre talent, rarely get the platform they deserve. With #VoicesFrom_, were changing that by fostering collaboration and amplifying their reach to audiences and industry stakeholders.\n\nThe first installment of #VoicesFrom_ will kick off this March at Theatre in the Park. Stay tuned for more updates as earGROUND Media prepares to unveil the full line-up of talented artistes ready to take Harare by storm.\n\nFollow on X: @mthabisi_mthire\n\n",
