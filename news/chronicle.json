The two sides have only played red-ball cricket against each other once with Ireland emerging victorious last year.For Ervine, the wicket prepared for this match is different to the one used against Afghanistan but believes that discipline will be key with the ball and with the bat, they need to work hard and try to convert the 50s to centuries.For us as a batting unit its about working hard to get yourself in and once you do get in, you need to go really big and make sure that counts. In Test cricket, 50s and 60s dont necessarily put you in good positions but like Afghanistan, getting 172s, 230 odd, those are the scores that really put you in good positions, said Ervine.\n\n",

This meeting gives us the opportunity to take stock of the progress made under the Devolution and Decentralisation Policy, which is a critical cog of the 2nd Republic, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nMASHONALAND WESTHon. Marian Chombo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution\n\nHe highlighted the commendable strides made in upgrading livelihoods but stressed the need for increased momentum in achieving national goals.\n\nThe President warned against complacency, stating: Dragging of feet and fancy seating are not acceptable dispositions under my watch. Increased momentum towards achieving our goals requires leaders who are dedicated.

He noted that at the time of preparing and approving the budget, the 2019 tariffs were in US dollars, as the multi-currency system was still in operation.\n\nFollowing an outcry over the level of tariffs charged from July 2022, it was proposed that the current USD tariffs be reviewed downwards, using the gazetted 2019 tariffs (USD) as the baseline. An increase of 51 percent on the 2019 tariffs (i.e., on the US$110.76) was expected to cover the increases in the cost of providing the service since 2019 to date. This would reduce the lowest shop licence fee by 30 percent, from US$238.11 to US$167.01, said Mr Mpunzi.\n\nHe added that the council had also considered residents concerns over the proposed cemetery and community facility fees for 2025.\n\nThe 2025 proposed budget reverted its proposed tariffs for cemetery and community facility fees to the gazetted tariffs, thereby lowering the cost of burial.\n\nIt was recommended that (i) business licence fees for 2025 be reduced by 30 percent, (ii) sports and social clubs property rates be reduced by 30 percent, while the rest of the proposed tariffs and charges for 2025 remain unchanged as proposed in the 2025 budget, said Mr Mpunzi.\n\nBulawayos initially proposed 2025 budget was declared null and void following the intervention of the Chief Secretary in the Office of the President and Cabinet, Dr Martin Rushwaya.\n\nHe instructed the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works, Dr John Basera, not to approve the budget until all objections raised by stakeholders, particularly the business community, were addressed.\n\nA special budget committee was subsequently established to revise the 2025 city budget, and it is yet to present the final document.\n\n",

This new module aims to streamline the registration of employees and the declaration of their earnings, making the tax process more efficient for employers.\n\nZimra Domestic Taxes Commissioner, Mr Misheck Govha, said the Employee Management Module provides a platform for entities to register their employees and declare their earnings, allowing for automatic tax computation by the system.\n\nHe said each registered employee will be allocated a Tax Identification Number (TIN), and those who are already registered will retain their existing TINs.\n\nThe new Employee Management Module will include several features, with the most notable being Comprehensive Employee Registration, Flexible Registration Options, Additional Tax Credits, and Auto-filling of PAYE and AIDS Levy, said Mr Govha.\n\nUnder the Employee Management Module, employers will be able to auto-fill PAYE and AIDS Levy. After generating earnings for all employees, the PAYE and AIDS Levy will automatically populate on the PAYE return within the Tax Returns Management module.\n\nAdditionally, employers can choose to register employees individually or utilise the Employee Upload Function to register multiple employees at once.\n\nHe said in order to fully benefit from the systems comprehensive employee registration, employers must declare essential information when registering employees. This, he added, includes marital status, blindness, physical disabilities (for both employees and their children), and the date of birth.\n\nMr Govha said this data will enable the system to automatically grant applicable tax credits.\n\nZimra encourages all taxpayers and employers to familiarise themselves with the new Employee Management Module to ensure compliance and a smooth transition, he said.\n\nThe new module also provides for Additional Tax Credits, under which employers will also have the opportunity to declare other tax credits, such as Medical Aid Contributions and Medical Expenses Credits, during the earnings declaration process.\n\n",
