Seventeen people died on the spot, while seven others died upon admission to the Beitbridge District Hospital, while the other died days later.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister, Felix Mhona, said the bus involved in the accident lacked a valid Passenger Insurance Policy and route permit while the driver was non-compliant with retest requirements.\n\nInformed by the foregoing violations, I have directed the Commissioner of Road Motor Transportation to invoke provisions of Section 17(b)(i) of the Road Motor Transportation Act [Chapter 13:15] and suspend, with immediate effect, Urban Connect (Pvt) Ltd from operating all its omnibuses in all the routes for a period of six months as we further investigate, he said.\n\nPursuant to the fatal accident, which occurred on 13 February 2025 at the 263km peg along the Masvingo-Beitbridge Road, which claimed 25 lives and caused serious injuries to many passengers, the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development has established that Urban Connect Holdings Pvt Ltd was not compliant with the countrys regulations on road traffic and safety management.\n\nThe bus, registration number AGL2474, belonging to this company, did not have a valid Passenger Insurance Policy as prescribed under Section 38(b)(1) of the Road Traffic Act [Chapter 13:11], reads the statement.\n\nIn addition, the vehicle did not have a valid Route Permit as prescribed in Section 12 of the Road Motor Transportation Act [Chapter 13:15]. Similarly, our inference is that the driver of this bus was not compliant with the Re-Test requirement prescribed under Section 5 of Statutory Instrument 168 of 2006, saidMinister Mhona.\n\nThe above violations by the bus operator are a serious breach of the terms and conditions of the operators licence issued to the company for it to operate in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Minister expressed heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and said the Government mourns with the rest of the country.\n\nWe mourn the demise of innocent men and women, most of whom were breadwinners who perished in this crash. Our thoughts are with all the families of the people who were killed in the crash, and our prayers are with those injured as they continue to receive treatment and care. We wish them a speedy recuperation, said Minister Mhona.\n\nIn light of the ongoing road fatalities, he said he has taken a bold stance to reduce road carnage as the Minister responsible for enforcing road traffic laws and safety regulations.\n\nGoing forward, we shall build on this momentum of strict enforcement of road motor transportation and safety regulations for the safety and well-being of the people, said the Minister.\n\n",

Collecting water revenue in time is our business. We would want to work with all municipalities that are ready to implement the project.\n\nWe are geared not only to support councils but Givernas a whole, so that we realise the Sustainable Development Goals of brining safe water to everyone. Ours is to make life superb for water authorities by providing prepaid water meters that makes collecting water revenue a stroll in the park, said Mr Mhlanga.\n\nHe explained that over a period of time, revenue collected from water metering will go a long way in propping service delivery in developmental projects such as infrastructure and other social amenities.\n\nHe said councils will also be able to monitor water usage and make wise decisions in conserving the precious resource.\n\nAfter collecting back the water revenue in time as the first stage, then water authorities shall focus on monitoring and analysing the customer consumption. This data is crucial for better decision making during water production. With such close monitoring, our water authorities should be able to find any possible water leakages and temper situations in time.\n\nIn our new world order where a client is a king, we would want to make water vending much more convenient. Our meters are equipped with mobile vending solutions. We are also ready to implement mobile applications and point of sale machines, he said.\n\nMr Mhlanga further said:\n\nWe are also in a position to offer gadgets that provide end-user provisions with a 20 digits meter recharge tokens either at vending points, appointed vendors through the POS system, Ecocash/One money, online banking services, then clients put into meter via the customer interface unit.\n\nTaf Mining and Hardware, according to Mr Mhlanga has partnered one of the worlds biggest manufacturers of technically-advanced utility meter products and systems, Hangzhou Laison Technology of China for the supply and installation of Smart Water Meters in the country.\n\nSo far we have presented our products from Hangzhou Laison Technology to most water delivery companies in the country. We are glad that our Government is in full support of this noble idea, said Mr Mhlanga.\n\nMr Mhlanga highlighted that there have worked out easy payment solutions that suit well with clients, as they will also allow the use of the local currency.\n\nOur bankers are ready to assist with forex to purchase the meters in China while local water companies and authorities can pay us using local currency.\n\nThe facility is very noble as our bankers understand the reality of technology and moving forward with time, he said.\n\nIn previous engagements with Zimpapers, Mr Mhlanga highlighted that there is a lot that both consumers and councils can benefit from by installing these smart water meters, in particular the improvement of the billing system. He said as soon as they install the meters, councils and water companies will realise eased cash flow while consumers are left satisfied with service provision.\n\nEarly January, the City of Bulawayo resolved to seek Expressions of Interest (EOI) for the supply, delivery, and installation of prepaid and smart water meters, replacing an earlier procurement plan for citywide implementation.\n\nThe citys Water and Sanitation department reported in their 136 156 metered water connections, they faced challenges with accurate billing due to a lack of sufficient meter readers.\n\nFollow on X -@mthabisi_mthire\n\n",

She began the year with a significant achievement, publishing her latest work, Laugh Through It Anyway, a collection of poems, short stories, and puns.\n\nHer previous works include Write: Your Ultimate Journey to Becoming a Professional Writer, The War in the Writers Mind, How to Become a Consistent Writer, and Thoughts of Progress: A Book of Poems.\n\nAuthor Zibusiso Ngulube\n\nIn an interview, Ngulube shared that the journey to creating her latest book was not without its hurdles. She started writing Laugh Through It Anyway in March 2024, but her progress was interrupted by serious health complications.They say you have to lose yourself to find yourself. Thats exactly what happened to me in 2024 when I was fighting for my life. I was battling an unexplainable and unknown illness, but I knew that God was still in control, she said.\n\nShe had originally planned to release her fifth book on skills development in November 2024, but her health setback led her to pause the project after completing five chapters.Despite the doctor advising me to rest, I couldnt stop writing. Its always been my escape, she said.\n\nThe doctor told me to clear my head, eat healthier, relax, exercise a bit more, and avoid taxing my brain. But I knew that the only way to deal with the chaos around me was to lean on my escape  writing.\n\nAs her health worsened, Ngulube found new motivation to try something entirely different. Known for her work in non-fiction, particularly in business, technology, self-help, and autobiography, she took a leap into the world of humour writing.Since I wasnt allowed to strain my brain, writing was something I wasnt supposed to do. But my escape never disappoints. So, I had to find a way to balance writing with maintaining my physical and mental health.\n\nEmbracing the challenge, Ngulube decided to explore humour writing, despite never having ventured into this genre before.They say laughter is the best medicine, so I put that to the test. I decided to do something completely different from what I had ever done  write a humour book.I have over a decade of experience in the literary field, mainly focusing on business, technology, self-help, and autobiography. Never in my life did I think I would be a humour writer, but as I always say, Gods plans are different from ours. His plans are to prosper us and give us an expected end, as Jeremiah 29:11 says, she shared.\n\nNgulube credits God for inspiring her to write a humour book that would help her manage her illness and find joy through the process.I believe God put it in me to write a humour book to ease the pain and help me not to dwell on the illness I had, she said.\n\nShe started working on Laugh Through It Anyway in April 2024, as her health continued to decline. Despite the physical and mental challenges she faced, she wrote as much as she could each day, often completing one joke, short story, or poem at a time.The writing was my strength and, with each passing day, I regained more power. By November 2024, my health began improving, and by January 2025, I completed the book, she shared.\n\nI give all the glory to God for His indescribable gift. I dont know how, but I know He did it through me, for me, and for anyone who benefits from this book.\n\nThe author hopes her book brings comfort and joy to its readers.My aim is to make you laugh, give you a reason to smile, and ease whatever pain you are feeling. I hope this book finds you in time, she concluded.\n\n",
