The vehicle veered off the road and struck 11 pedestrians walking in the same direction.\n\nThe accident resulted in two pedestrian fatalities and nine others being injured. One passenger from the vehicle was also injured, bringing the total number of injured to 10. The injured were transported to Mpilo Hospital for treatment, while the deceased were taken to the United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) mortuary for post-mortem examinations, said Assistant Inspector Msebele.\n\nShe said the accident was caused by speeding, and the driver is facing charges.\n\nThe cause of the accident was due to speeding and the drivers failure to keep the motor vehicle under proper control, hence a charge of culpable homicide has been preferred against him, said Assistant Inspector Msebele.\n\n",

            "content": "IN years gone by, the race for the top four in the Premier League has been a byword for Champions League qualification.But that could change this season, with the Premier League leading the race to earn a fifth spot in Europes premier club competition.As was the case last season, Uefa will award two bonus spots in the 2025-26 Champions League to the domestic leagues which perform best in Europe this season.What does it mean?Supporters of Bournemouth, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest could be cheering on Manchester City, Aston Villa and Manchester United as we head into the final group-stage matches in the Champions League and Europa League.There is even a scenario that could give English clubs seven Champions League places next season.Confused? Let us explainHow can leagues earn extra Champions League spot?Each league earns a coefficient ranking based on how their teams perform in Europe.Coefficient points are earned through match results  two for a win and one for a draw.The points earned by clubs from the same domestic league are added up and divided by the number of clubs the league has in Europe.For example, if the Premier League had 100 points, that would be split by the number of teams playing in Europe (seven) and give England a coefficient of 14.28.This season bonus points are available to clubs playing in the Champions League, which is advantageous to leagues with more clubs competing in it, such as Germany and Italy.The countries that finish in the top two of the coefficient table earn an additional Champions League spot.Those spots are awarded to the teams which finish in the first position below the Champions League allocation in those leagues.In the Premier League, the top four clubs qualify for the Champions League via league position, so any additional spot would go to the team in fifth.Last season the additional spots were given to Bologna and Borussia Dortmund, who finished fifth in Serie A and the Bundesliga respectively.Who is leading the coefficient table?As of 26 January, England is leading the coefficient table. Premier League clubs have built up the most points and have the highest average.1. England  points: 100; average: 14.342. Italy  points: 88; average: 11.053. Spain  points: 82; average: 11.774. France  points: 66 average: 10.945. Germany  points: 79  average: 9.88According to Opta, there is a 98% chance that the Premier League will earn an additional place in next seasons Champions League.Which Premier League team could get bonus spot?Should the Premier League earn an additional spot, the team finishing fifth this season will qualify for the 2025-26 Champions League.Currently that is Newcastle.But there is an 14-point gap between Arsenal in second and Fulham in 10th, meaning the race for the top five is very much open.Third-placed Nottingham Forest are having a sensational season and Opta predictions give them a 44% chance of finishing in the top four.Should fifth place earn a Champions League spot, Forests chances of qualification increase to 63%.Opta gives Newcastle a 27% chance of finishing in the top four and 45% in the top five, with Bournemouth at 13% and 26% respectively.Should the Premier League earn five Champions League places, there will still be two places available in the Europa League and one in the Conference League next season.What about the Europa League winners?The winners of the Europa League are granted a Champions League slot.Under previous rules, one league could have a maximum of five clubs in the Champions League.However, that rule has been scrapped.This season any team that win the Europa League but do not qualify for the Champions League via their domestic league position will go into the Champions League  as well as the domestic qualifiers.This raises the possibility of Manchester United or Tottenham, who are both unlikely to qualify for the Champions League via their Premier League position, winning the Europa League to enter the Champions League alongside the top five.What about the Champions League winners?Now were getting specific.The winners of the Champions League are guaranteed a place in next seasons competition.On rare occasions, teams have won the Champions League but finished outside the qualification places in their domestic league  as Chelsea did in 2011-12.Chelsea finished sixth in the Premier League but earned a Champions League place at the expense of fourth-placed Tottenham because there was a four-club limit from one country.But if, for example, Manchester City win the Champions League this season but finish outside the qualification places in the Premier League, they will earn a place alongside those teams who qualify through league position.It means the Premier League could theoretically have seven teams in next seasons Champions League  the top five in the table, the winners of this seasons Champions League and the winners of the Europa League.

            "content": "WHEN Dan Burn trained with Allan Saint-Maximin, he thought the Frenchman was the best dribbler he had ever seen. Then he met Alexander Isak.Watching Isak at close quarters  and occasionally trying to get the better of the Swedish striker in training  Burn has been able to appreciate just how talented his team-mate is when he has the ball at his feet.And that, as much as Isaks superb goalscoring record, is the reason why Burn regards the 25-year-old as priceless despite the transfer rumours that continue to swirl around him.Saturdays 3-1 victory at Southampton saw Isak take his goalscoring tally to 15 in the Premier League as he scored for the ninth league game in ten.Newcastle are ready to initiate a new round of contract discussions at the end of the season in order to fend off interest from suitors at home and abroad, with Arsenal having repeatedly been linked with a possible move for the Sweden international.Like the rest of his team-mates, Burn is aware of the speculation that reappears in every transfer window, but feels it is impossible to put a price on Isaks head given his all-round quality.Asked about Isaks value to Newcastle, Burn said: Its for the owners to say, but hes priceless to us. The way he moves  you come up against special players, but theres nobody out there that dribbles the way he dribbles.Allan Saint-Maximin was something different, and he was probably the best dribbler Ive ever played with. But you just have to look at the quality (of Isak), its not just dribbling for the sake of it.Hes on fire at the moment, probably one of the best strikers in the world at the moment. Its hard because its hard to defend just the way he moves. He moves his feet quickly, but his top half doesnt really move.Newcastle briefly fell behind Southampton at the weekend, with Jan Bednarek heading home in the 10 th minute before Isak levelled from the penalty spot after being fouled by Joe Aribo.The leagues bottom side quickly crumbled allowing Isak to add his second shortly afterwards from Jacob Murphys through-ball.The best of Newcastles goals was scored by Sandro Tonali. Isak chested the ball off to Anthony Gordon who, with one touch, knocked it through to the former AC Milan midfielder who stroked it into the corner.It was a tenth win in 11 games in all competitions for Eddie Howes side, who sit fifth in the league, outside the top four on goal-difference after fourth-placed Manchester City beat Chelsea, who dropped to sixth.The gaffer has just said youve got to dream what you can do, said Burn. We could definitely do something special this season.Saturdays victory was a welcome return to winning ways for the Magpies after Bournemouth had ended their nine-match winning spree with a 4-1 win at St James Park seven days earlier.The defeat to the Cherries was a shock to the system after a superb couple of months, although Burn feels it might have come at an opportune time to ensure he and his team-mates do not start taking anything for granted with four months of the season still to go.It was probably just a little bit of a kick that we needed, said Burn. We were probably getting too far ahead of ourselves, but even at the start of the season when we were inconsistent, we were still just trying to hit our standards. The Northern Echo\n\n",
