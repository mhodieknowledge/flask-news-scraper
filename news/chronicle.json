We came up with the idea to host a sports competition to assist the youth in emulating the character and deeds of our Vice President Kembo Campbell Mohadi. He has been an inspiration not only in Matabeleland South but throughout the country. Young people should follow in the footsteps of our liberation struggle veterans like KCD Mohadi, who began their political careers at a young age.\n\nThe tournament also seeks to combat drug and substance abuse, an issue that has greatly affected the future generation of this nation, said Cde Langa.\n\nZanu PF Bulilima District Secretary for Youth Affairs Cde Dumisani Mpofu added:\n\nFor now, preparations are at an advanced stage as most youths have organised their teams for the tournament, and our leaders have also made significant contributions. All this demonstrates that the VP tournament will indeed be a success.\n\nMoreover, the significance of this tournament lies in its promotion of unity, patriotism, and love for the party, as everyone is gearing up for the day, said Cde Mpofu.\n\nFollow on X  @mthabisi_mthire\n\n",

The mayor alleged multiple complaints of abuse of office and corruption against Mr Dube.\n\nLocal Government and Public Works Minister Daniel Garwe declared the suspension non-procedural and unsupported by policy. He instructed the councillors to rescind their resolution and reinstate the Town Clerk.\n\nSuccessive council meetings failed to implement the government directive until Tuesday, when councillors convened a special council meeting. One of the meetings lacked a quorum, as only five of the 11 elected councillors attended, while another could not discuss the issue due to the mayors absence, who was in possession of the letter from the minister.\n\nResidents were closely watching the situation, opposing the reinstatement of the Town Clerk and putting councillors in a difficult position between following the government directive and satisfying the electorate.\n\nThe council had set up two bodies of inquiry to investigate the allegations and had presented a report advising the local authority to proceed with an internal disciplinary hearing against Mr Dube.\n\nThe mayor chaired a special full council meeting that rescinded the resolution on Tuesday, paving the way for normalcy and harmony, as directed by Minister Garwe.\n\nThe minister stated that the suspension contravened Section 139 of the Urban Councils Act and invoked Section 314 of the same Act to reverse the resolution. The final decision was to rescind the suspension of the Town Clerk, allowing him to resume work on Monday, 6 January.\n\nIn December, residents, under the civic consortium comprising the Victoria Falls Combined Residents Association (Vifacora) and Hwange District Residents Association (HWADRA), convened a series of meetings over the issue.\n\nMr Herbert Ncube, chair of HWADRA, emphasised that residents would remain steadfast in their resolution to hold public office leaders accountable.\n\nVifacora chair Mr Kelvin Moyo acknowledged that the suspension of the Town Clerk has had an impact on the city.\n\nThe impact of the events in Victoria Falls is that everyone is worried to know what exactly is happening and what can be done to alleviate the situation. Victoria Falls economy depends on tourism and investment, especially with the foreign currency stock exchange here, and we need to create investor confidence. In my view, this is not a personal matter.\n\nCouncillors are elected and have a mandate from the people, so if they see it fit to follow the directive from the government, so be it. That will be judged against residents, he said.\n\n@ncubeleon\n\n",
