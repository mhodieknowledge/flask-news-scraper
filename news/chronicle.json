The President called for collaborative synergies between SMEs and relevant ministries, departments and agencies, saying such collaboration was important towards the formalisation of small businesses and start-ups.\n\nAs we continue to diversify our economy, the formalisation of this sector must never be viewed as a direct threat to the survival and sustainability of your respective businesses.\n\nOn its part, my Government will continue to improve the ease of doing business, through reducing barriers to entry, as well as streamlining business registration, licensing and compliance levies.\n\nHE commissions Mbare Msika\n\nDialogue with the SMEs sector is an essential building block for enhanced business productivity. There should not be a them and us mentality, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe added that the Government and SMEs sector must act as one for the good of the country.\n\nThe Ministry of SMEs was challenged to deploy innovative initiatives that will see more SMEs becoming fully fledged business entities with footprints beyond Zimbabwe and the SADC region.\n\nGovernment is determined to see the realisation of the Urban Transformation Agenda designed to primarily focus on addressing rapid urbanisation by prioritising safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable cities and human settlements, in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Number 11.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said Phase 2 of the New Mbare Musika is designed to be a multi-storey complex with improved sanitation, fire safety features and organised trading spaces, thus resonating with Vision 2030 and the SDGs.\n\nMbare Musika\n\nHe applauded Masimba Construction and Mkambo Misika Hubs, who partnered the Government in the project, for their professionalism and work ethic, which have ensured the completion of Phase 1 of the Market.\n\nEarlier on, President Mnangagwa commended Mbare residents for their consistent support of Zanu PF that saw the revolutionary party winning in that constituency in the 2023 harmonised elections.\n\nBe assured that the interests of the people of our great motherland, Zimbabwe, remain at the core of my Administration. Two weeks ago, I was pleased to receive, at State House, representatives of Vendors and Tuckshops Associations from across the country.\n\nThat engagement, among many others I have had in the recent past, gave me general insights into matters that concern you and the broader Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises sector. Government is seized with facilitating an environment where your businesses can thrive for an improved standard of living for all, he said.\n\nHE commissions Mbare Msika\n\nDefence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri said the construction of the market resonated with President Mnangagwas national vision spelt out in the National Development Strategy 1 and Governments ultimate goal of elevating Zimbabweans to a prosperous and empowered upper-middle-income society by 2030.\n\nThis bustling market has been a cornerstone of Zimbabwes SMEs and a vital source of livelihood for traders and their families.\n\nThis initiative has not only restored the markets infrastructure but also upgraded it to a cutting-edge facility, demonstrating Governments commitment to creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, she said.\n\nLocal Government and Public Works Minister, Daniel Garwe, said the commissioning of the market was a precursor to the second phase of another market to accommodate more people.\n\nThis event also marks the ground-breaking ceremony of the main market, which is going to accommodate 10 000 traders, he said.\n\nMinister Garwe said following the fire disaster that destroyed stock and stalls, President Mnangagwa directed the engagement of domestic investor, Masimba Holdings, in terms of the urban transformation policy to undertake reconstruction works.\n\nHE commissions Mbare Msika\n\nThe infrastructure, as you have witnessed, Your Excellency, is augmented by social amenities such as banks, Zimbabwe Republic Police Post, advanced security services, CCTV, advanced ablution facilities, advanced fire suppression systems, and availability of water infrastructure, among others, he said.Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Minister, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa, said the new market was set to transform the SMEs sector that has been looked down upon over the years.\n\nMinister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Harare Metropolitan, Charles Tawengwa, commended President Mnangagwa for restoring the livelihood of traders following the fire outbreak.Yesterdays event was attended by Cabinet Ministers, permanent secretaries, Harare City councillors, captains of industry, Zanu PF leadership, and traders, among others.\n\n",

            "content": "Danisa Masuku\n\nRODNEY TONGAI JINDU. The very name conjures a chilling picture of unimaginable horror of a serial killer.\n\nHis confession to the gruesome murders of his two friends  a macabre narrative amplified by the unthinkable admissions of eating their raw liver and cooking their brains  now casts a long, dark shadow once more.\n\nNext week, his re-sentencing appearance at the Bulawayo High Court threatens to tear open the wounds of the families who suffered the irreparable loss of their loved ones to Jindus murderous rampage, that had started to scab.\n\nAs the legal process revisits the horrific details, a fresh wave of raw grief and trauma is inevitable, forcing the relatives to relive the terrifying final moments of their loved ones, a cruel and unwelcome reminder of the monstrous depravity that stole them away.\n\nThe path to this re-sentencing has been long and fraught. Haunted by two counts of murder, Jindu was initially brought before the courts, where Justice Nokuthula Moyo, at the Bulawayo High Court, delivered a sentence of death. This pronouncement in 2018 condemned Jindu to a life contemplating his final reckoning.\n\nHowever, the immutable hand of fate, in the form of the abolition of the death penalty, has irrevocably altered his destiny.\n\nPresident Mnangagwas signing of the Death Penalty Abolition Bill has granted Jindu and 48 other inmates on death row a new, albeit grim, prospect. The gazetted Act now dictates that individuals convicted of murder in aggravating circumstances shall face a lengthy jail term, ranging from 20 years to life imprisonment.\n\nNow, Jindu, incarcerated within the unforgiving walls of Khami Maximum Prison, is scheduled to reappear in court on April 14 at the Bulawayo High Court for re-sentencing.\n\nThis once flamboyant young man, known for his expensive tastes, designer suits, and top-of-the-range vehicles, first seared his name into public consciousness on February 3, 2017. This publication broke the chilling news of his cold-blooded murder of his childhood friend, Cyprian Kudzurunga, a young man of just 28, whose remains he callously buried in a shallow grave on a plot in Bulawayos affluent Burnside suburb.\n\nJindu disturbingly disclosed to investigators that he murdered Kudzurunga out of fear  the fear of exposure. Kudzurunga, it was alleged, had stumbled upon evidence of Jindus ritualistic murder of Mboneli Ncube. In a calculated attempt to conceal his heinous acts, Jindu even sent a deceitful message to Kudzurungas mother, impersonating her son and claiming a sudden departure from the country.\n\nWhile the public reeled from the sheer horror of this revelation, Jindu, already the subject of morbid fascination both within Zimbabwe and beyond, struck again, plunging the nation into further despair.He chillingly recounted to detectives from the Homicide section how a cross-border transporter had approached him, offering a macabre exchange: US$20 000 or a Toyota Quantum for the body parts of Mboneli Ncube. This grotesque proposition, he claimed, ignited his desire to murder his friend Mboneli Ncube, a 30-year-old who lived a mere four houses away in Bulawayos Glengarry suburb.\n\nSoon after, he delivered Ncubes lifeless body to the transporter, who proceeded to harvest the head, hands, and both legs, leaving Jindu with the torso. This he placed in a plastic bag, transported on a wheelbarrow to the same plot in Burnside, and there, with chilling indifference, burnt and buried the remains in four separate shallow graves, mere metres from Kudzurungas final resting place. The gruesome discovery was swiftly reported to the police, triggering an urgent manhunt that culminated in Jindus arrest.\n\nWith a disturbing lack of remorse, Jindu led detectives to the scene, where the fragmented remains of Ncube were exhumed. When questioned by Homicide detectives, he confessed to the dismemberment. Following this horrifying revelation, he was brought before the court.\n\nHis initial court appearance in 2018 was marked by macabre drama as he openly confessed to shooting his two friends and the unspeakable act of consuming their flesh. This prompted Justice Moyo to order a psychiatric evaluation by two state doctors to ascertain his mental state under the provisions of the Mental Health Act.\n\nThe accused persons conduct is prima facie bizarre and abnormal. It is for these reasons that the court finds it fit that a mental examination be conducted to rule out any possibility of mental issues. This will allow the court to proceed to try the accused person after having been satisfied that he is mentally stable, ruled Justice Moyo.\n\nFollowing that, armed with a medical report certifying his mental soundness and fitness to stand trial, he returned to court. He appeared before Justice Moyo again, and during his initial trial appearance, he confessed to hiring his two neighbours to dig the graves. He also claimed to have been intoxicated by heroin and methamphetamine, a synthetic stimulant at the time of the murders.\n\nHowever, Justice Moyo ultimately rejected this defence, convicting Jindu on two counts of murder with actual intent, committed under aggravating circumstances. In delivering the sentence, Justice Moyo deemed capital punishment the most fitting and appropriate for Jindus heinous crimes.\n\nThe accused person is convicted of two counts of murder with actual intent. You killed two people in a space of three weeks. You mutilated the body of the deceased in count one; you took away property belonging to the deceased in count two.\n\nHe executed the murders meticulously by first of all carrying a gun which should have been kept at his mothers home. He then tried in a very clever way to conceal the murders by first sending text messages to the relatives of his victims as to the deceaseds whereabouts. He also deceived the police.\n\nHe even refused to divulge intricate details of the murders hiding behind his fabricated Lucifer image. He cannot be found to be remorseful. His Lucifer version means that he is still bent on tricking the court right up to the end.\n\nIf the accused person does not deserve capital punishment or if he is spared capital punishment then it means the relevance of capital punishment as enshrined in our law will become meaningless, ruled Justice Moyo.\n\n",

He said Zimbabwe does not tolerate corruption hence the need to unite in fighting the scourge.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa who was addressing delegates to the Charted Accountants Conference hosted by the Public Accountants and Auditors Board (PAAB) Zimbabwe in Harare on Thursday, said accountants are the gatekeepers of the countrys national resources and it was therefore incumbent upon the accounting profession to take a firm stand against corruption.\n\nAs accountants, you play a crucial role in strengthening Public Financial Management (PFM). Further, you are key cogs that enhance financial transparency, accountability and efficiency in both the public and private sectors, he said. President Mnangagwa said Government recognises the role of accountants in supporting private sector growth and Investment through maintaining accurate financial records.\n\nI challenge you, the accountants in both the public and private sectors to be trustworthy gatekeepers of national resources. Every dollar spent must be accounted for, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said accountants are not mere record-keepers of financial transactions but are the architects of economic transformation, custodians of corporate and public finances as well as enablers of national development.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said loopholes that allow financial mismanagement, illicit financial flows and corporate fraud must be closed with no exceptions.\n\nThe President has said in the past that there is a need for the private sector and other stakeholders to complement Government efforts to fight corruption. He said Government on its part has embarked on a robust programme to strengthen good corporate governance and accountability in the management of public resources. Integrity committees have been set up at public institutions to prevent corruption and promote good corporate governance.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the private sector, civil society and other stakeholders should also prioritise transparency and accountability through in-house anti-corruption efforts. The Chartered Governance and Accountancy Institute of Zimbabwe (CGAIZ) has trained police officers and Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) officials in forensic accounting, auditing and cyber security.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said such collaboration goes a long away in strengthening public institutions to effectively and efficiently deliver on their mandate. He also urged members of the security sector to constantly upgrade their skills to keep abreast with criminals and corrupt elements modern techniques to evade the law.\n\nGovernment has already announced that plans are underway to introduce anti-corruption curricula from ECD to tertiary education as the nation steps up its fight against corruption.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has said his administration will not shy away from taking corruption by the horns as the scourge has debilitating effects of retarding economic growth and development.\n\n",

            "content": "Robin Muchetu, Lifestyle Health and Gender Editor\n\nCLOSE to R1 million is required to buy a new Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) machine at Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo that will enable cancer patients to receive radiation sessions uninterrupted by power outages.\n\nPatients undergoing cancer treatment with the radiotherapy machine need continuous power supply as the machinery is very sensitive to power fluctuations and any sudden changes or fluctuations with power damages the machine, experts say.\n\nAlready, two of the cancer treatment machines at the hospital are down. This emerged during a visit to the referral hospital by Vice-President Kembo Mohadi on Friday who directed the Treasury to urgently look into the issue and avail the R1 million for the servicing of radiotherapy machines to save lives.\n\nVP Mohadi said critical cancer machinery that services the Southern region must always be functional as patients are incurring huge costs travelling to places like South Africa, India and other destinations.\n\nVice President Mohadi tours Mpilo Central Hospital\n\nMpilo Central Hospital chief medical officer, Dr Narcisius Dzvanga, said the UPS at Mpilo Central Hospital requires 24 batteries to keep it functional and the batteries now need to be replaced. He said according to quotations from South Africa, the set of batteries cost just over R1 million.\n\nDr Dzvanga said the hospital had been told to downsize their UPS machine to match that of Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, a proposal that VP Mohadi vehemently rejected.\n\nThat is about US$100 000 needed for the machine. The machine was made like that and it has to run like that. We need to get this machine running, we cannot fail to raise this amount as a country, said the Vice-President. Why do they say it (UPS) machine is too big? No, we do not want that, we want the US$100 000 and Mthuli (Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion) has got to act, said VP Mohadi.\n\nAlmost 50 percent of the cancer patients that visit Mpilo Hospital require radiotherapy but these are not being treated as the machines are down with revelations that the radiotherapy machines were procured and left in storage for many years, causing some of the faults and deterioration of the machines.\n\nThe machines are said to have been locked up at Beira, Mozambique for three years before they were eventually delivered to Bulawayo. All patients requiring radiotherapy are being referred to Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare and are having to endure long waiting periods of up to five months as the hospital is overwhelmed by the demand for the service.\n\nVP Mohadi said it was too much of a burden for one public institution to be treating cancer in the country.\n\nVice President Mohadi tours Mpilo Central Hospital\n\nParirenyatwa cannot carry the entire nation, it is impossible. We need to have other referral hospitals offering the same service. People are dying every day; they are dying because we cannot avail US$100 000 to have these things fixed. We need to get these machines to function, people pay a lot of money to go to India and the Government also pays a lot of money too, that is foreign currency, which is being wasted, said VP Mohadi.\n\nHe said if the ministry wants to buy new machines its fine but what is urgent at the moment is to fix the machines that the hospital has so that people can start receiving the service.\n\nVP Mohadi said the hospital and cancer patients cannot wait for the promised new machines because it is not known when these will be bought.\n\nWe dont know when the new ones will come or when the money will be available. There is no radiotherapy taking place here and we cannot allow that as a Government, he said.\n\nEverybody cannot go to Harare to seek the services as Harare is already overwhelmed hence the long wait, said VP Mohadi.\n\nHead of Radiotherapy Dr Tatenda Chingonzoh said the waiting periods for treatment were too long.The waiting period for a patient to get on the machine at Parirenyatwa is four to five months because of their own burden plus ours from Mpilo. When we treat cervical cancer, a patient receives treatment for up to six weeks and they need to be in Harare,he said.\n\nDr Chingonzoh said in January engineers came to try and get things running but the problem was the issue of power.\n\nThe cancer machines are down again and we have not managed to treat anybody. For the first quarter of the year, we have seen about 1 200 cancer patients and usually about 50 percent of these patients require radiotherapy services, she said.\n\nDr Dzvanga said the hospital was servicing their machines via a South African company but it later engaged local technicians who unfortunately failed to repair the broken-down machines.We got a local company whose technicians came and spent a week here, only to tell us that they had failed to repair the machines, he said.\n\nDr Dzvanga said to address the problem, Mpilo Central Hospital must have comprehensive service contracts.\n\nA service contract mandates that if there is a minor fault to machinery, they (manufactures) come and attend to that fault and without this, no service can be done and institutions have to pay cash upfront for spare parts, he said.\n\nAbout US$80 000 was at one time disbursed for diagnosing the problem when the radiation machines were down but there was no extra funding for the procurement of spare parts for repairs.\n\nWe have a sort of service contract in place, the engineers have been coming but not quite getting things working. They once came but due to power fluctuation, they could not test the machines, said Dr Dzvanga.\n\nDr Chingonzoh said the hospital was offering chemotherapy only yet many of the cancers that they have such as cervical cancer, require radiotherapy.@NyembeziMu\n\n",

Lulu found herself particularly moved by Chief Mbusi Bekithemba Dakamelas unassuming nature and his palpable dedication to the preservation of Ndebele culture, a sentiment that resonated deeply with her.\n\nLulu, known for her work across social media platforms and YouTube, shared with Saturday Chronicle that she was born in Umzimkhulu, a region to the south-east of Durban, 42 years ago.\n\nLulu Njapa at the Chale Wote Street Festival\n\nI was born in Durban and I lived there before going to Johannesburg where this journey of mine began. Ive always loved writing from a tender age which was fuelled by my English teacher who would award us if we did well at school. She taught us how to write poetry pieces.\n\nLulu Njapa (centre) attending the Chale Wote Street Festival in Ghana\n\nWhat started the travel writing in particular was through a friend who was writing for American monthly lifestyle magazine, Essence and she was interviewing travel writers and she knew my obsession with travelling around Africa and encouraged me to go for it after she sent me pieces of how the travel writers went about their business and this was in 2028. Since then, I havent turned back, she narrated.\n\nWriting across lifestyle, tourism, and culture, her portfolio also encompasses the arts and fashion, earning her by-lines in prominent publications such as the Mail & Guardian, Sunday Times, City Press, and The Informer Independent Digest Malawi, where she has contributed features and regular columns.Her travels have taken her to numerous African nations, including Namibia, Zambia, and Ghana on several occasions, the latter being a place where her deep appreciation for the continent first took root.\n\nLulu Njapa (right) with Umntwana uGcina Zulu at the Imiklomelo KaDakamela event. (Picture by Adept Dazz Siziba)\n\nMy first trip outside South Africa was to Ghana (where she attended the Chale Wote Street Art Festival) after I quit my job at a telecoms company, and I felt a profound sense of anticipation. My fascination with Ghana was ignited in 2002 when I met the renowned poet, Atukwei Okai, in Durban. At 20 years old, his words stirred something within me, sparking a desire to explore the heart of Africa, a journey that has shaped my identity ever since, she shared.\n\nLulu Njapa\n\nZimbabwe holds a special affection for her, owing to the warm welcome she consistently receives from its people and the linguistic similarities between Shona and her native IsiXhosa. Lulu recounted her enjoyment of Imiklomelo KaDakamela, noting that it provided her with a novel experience  her first night spent under canvas, albeit one tinged with a confessed fear of spiders.\n\nKoDakamela was quite a different experience for me, firstly because it was my first time to be in Zimbabwe for a significant amount of time and I had to camp. What intrigued me the most is that the chief himself is one with the people. He doesnt consider himself up there.\n\nLulu Njapa arriving in Zimbabwe for the Imiklomelo KaDakamela event\n\nWhen we slept, I didnt notice that he was there with us but in the morning, I realised that he actually slept where everyone else did, a humble gesture if you ask me. The way he was interacting with everyone showed that he is well-grounded. He didnt treat people like his subjects but rather, people he holds dear, she said.\n\nLulu loves culture but wouldnt call herself a cultural activist or ambassador because in as much as she loves it, there are some parts that she doesnt resonate with, especially those that dont uplift women.Follow on X @MbuleloMpofu\n\n",

            "content": "Mthabisi Tshuma\n\nTHE music plays on, but the cost is escalating. This is the stark reality for local musicians, who are voicing their concerns over the soaring music licensing fees that threaten to silence their performances.\n\nFrom cover bands to solo artistes, the new charges are striking a discordant note, prompting the question: is the price of performing becoming prohibitively high?\n\nMany musicians rely on performing cover songs for their livelihoods, but the increased fees are making it increasingly difficult to break even. The licensing fees, intended to compensate songwriters and publishers, have risen sharply in recent years, leaving many feeling priced out of the industry.\n\nThe impact of these increased fees is being felt across the local music scene, with numerous venues and festivals struggling to remain financially viable.\n\nAs the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (Zimura) faces accusations of stifling artistes livelihoods, the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) has intervened, initially demanding the revocation of the charges.\n\nHowever, the situation remains unresolved.\n\nZimura maintains that it does not report to NACZ, while NACZ asserts its position as the regulatory body under which Zimura should be registered.\n\nThis dispute arose shortly after a meeting with stakeholders, which many had hoped would lead to a resolution.\n\nArtistes now find themselves caught between two regulatory bodies, required to comply with both NACZ for artistic regulation and Zimura for royalty benefits.\n\nSaturday Leisure spoke with Zimura, NACZ, and artists to gain insight into their perspectives on this contentious issue.\n\nZimuras executive director, Polisile Ncube-Chimhini, confirmed that the charge remains in place and that they are in the process of engaging stakeholders on related matters.\n\nThe meeting addressed the US$150 fee, the calculation methodology, the issue of venues paying for blanket music licenses, the regional and international practice of venues, rather than cover bands, paying licensing fees, and the possibility of reducing the US$150 fee.\n\nOur response was that the US$150 fee was calculated based on feedback from our survey, which considered the average number of songs performed and hours played by cover bands, their weekly performance frequency, and their average earnings per event.\n\nRegarding blanket licenses paid by venue owners, Ncube-Chimhini clarified that the licenses do not cover live performances.\n\nA blanket licence grants permission to play local, regional, and international repertoire, but it does not extend to live performances. Concerning the venue owners obligation to pay the licence, we referred to the provisions of the Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act Chapter 26:05, which clearly outlines the infringement of copyright and the obligation to pay for the Zimura licence. As for reducing the tariff, we emphasised the need to consult with the rights holders whose music is performed by cover bands.\n\nWe have initiated this consultation process, and some have suggested meeting with Mr Nyanhi, the NACZ CEO, before our final meeting with stakeholders at NACZ. The majority of those consulted so far consider US$150 to be a reasonable fee. Compliance has begun, but enforcement needs to be intensified in major towns, Ncube-Chimhini said.\n\nMubu argued that Zimuras proposal, while well-intentioned, disregards Zimbabwes socio-economic realities and global copyright norms.\n\nWithout transparency, tiered pricing, and technological upgrades, it risks suffocating the very industry it aims to protect. We need policies that respect both creators and performers. Currently, this fee feels more like policing poverty than protecting art, Mubu said.\n\nEdith WeUtonga described the licensing structure as ill-conceived and detrimental to musicians ability to perform.\n\nMost young musicians learn by performing covers, and their earnings do not justify a US$150 fee per gig per band. In an economy that is particularly challenging for musicians, penalising them for performing covers is not the solution, WeUtonga said.\n\nSarah Dee suggested that Zimura is implementing this initiative to encourage artists to perform original material, as copyright protection is required.\n\nThe issue is the rushed implementation. This should have been introduced when the industry was more stable. They should focus on collecting and distributing royalties fairly. How can they justify demanding US$150 per show when I received only US$20 in royalties from 2007 to 2024? This is unfair and provokes artists who are already struggling, she said.\n\nDr Lux said there is a need to return to dialogue and educate artistes about the Copyright Act to prevent such issues.\n\nRonald Stone, leader and vocalist of Band of Misfits, described the fees as absurd.Thandoe of The Travellers Band said that they have no objection to paying fees, but the amount is disproportionate.\n\nWe are willing to pay, but it must be fair. We earn around US$250 per restaurant gig, and paying US$150 leaves little for transportation, sound equipment, and band member fees. In this scenario, we would be working solely to benefit Zimura, Thandoe said.\n\nPablo Nakappa, a jazz, reggae, and bass player who has worked with artistes such as Winky D, Dumi Ngulube, Afrika Revenge, Cello Culture, and Transit Crew, said the fees must be justifiable. @mthabisi_mthire\n\n",

            "content": "Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Reporter\n\nFOR a player like Joel Josta Ngodzo, who has the distinction of having worn the colours of both Highlanders and CAPS United, the Battle of the Cities fixture that pits the two giants, is a fiercely contested affair that transcends mere bragging rights.\n\nNgodzo honed his skills in the youth ranks at Highlanders before later joining Makepekepe as his footballing career progressed. However, it was some years prior to this, during his time as a gifted midfield that Ngodzo witnessed the exhilarating 2009 Bossos quest for consecutive Battle of the Cities victories. These encounters produced a staggering 13 goals and are widely remembered as the most explosive clashes between Bosso and Makepekepe in the topflight of Zimbabwean football.\n\nHighlanders and CAPS United locked horns in a thrilling 3-3 draw at Barbourfields Stadium before the former became the only side to defeat Charles Mhlauris men in another captivating match that concluded 4-3 in Bossos favour at the National Sports Stadium.\n\nThis Sunday will mark the over 50th meeting between Bosso and CAPS in the Premier Soccer League. Barbourfields Stadium will provide the stage for this afternoons eagerly awaited showdown.\n\nAll the games between CAPS United and Bosso are always exciting and very tight contests. The team that wants it more usually get the three points. The major drive in this fixture is the need to protect your citys bragging rights.\n\nWhen I was at Highlanders, it was an abomination to lose against a team from Harare. Even when I moved to CAPS United, I also didnt want to lose to Bosso because I was now fighting for Harare. I think Bruce Kangwa who also played for Highlanders and now CAPS United has the same mentality. So this fixture is down to the players themselves; coaches play a little role, said Ngodzo.\n\nFormer CAPS United goalkeeper Witness Munkuli, who stood between the posts for Makepekepe during those captivating back-to-back encounters in 2004, has previously noted on record that this derby could occasionally descend into violence.\n\nI still remember 2004 very well. We drew 3-3 at BF (Barbourfields), yet at some point we were 3-0 down. The comeback stunned Highlanders fans, who turned violent and threw missiles onto the pitch.The match was abandoned in the 89th minute but the result stood. Then came the second leg at the National Sports Stadium, which we lost 4-3. What a massive game that was. My opposite number,\n\nTapuwa Kapini, scored twice: One from the spot and from a long-range free-kick.\n\nThose were really tight games. The name Battle of Cities itself tells you all. If you are CAPS United, you are fighting for Harare, and if you are Highlanders, you are fighting for Bulawayo, he said.\n\nAs if perfectly timed, both sides, having endured somewhat shaky starts to the season and they hope to rediscover their form in tomorrows clash. Bossos head coach, Kelvin Kaindu, has said that they are aiming for a positive outcome against Makepekepe.\n\nThere were some injury concerns from the last game we played but all the players that got the knocks have been training while we continue to assess them. They are coming from a big win. They come with most of their players who have experience in terms of playing in the Premier League. We know what they are capable of doing. We just look forward to an exciting game of football, said Kaindu.\n\nHe called on the Bosso faithful to come in their numbers and rally behind the team.\n\nWe expect fans to come in their numbers and we appreciate the role they play as the 12th man who is always behind the team and giving us that support. We also know CAPS United can draw a crowd so we expect a big crowd for this game which we hope will be very exciting, said Kaindu.-@FungaiMuderere\n\n",

            "content": "Brandon Moyo,[emailprotected]\n\nPLUMTREE HIGH School holds a hallowed place in the annals of Zimbabwean rugby. A veritable cradle of talent, it has gifted the nation iconic figures, from the legendary Victor Olonga to the esteemed former Sables captain, Cleopas Makotose.\n\nFor generations the school has been synonymous with the nurturing of exceptional rugby prowess. Its playing fields have produced a remarkable lineage of distinguished players, including Sanele Sibanda, Lloyd Makwati, Japhet Ndebele, Biselele Tshamala, Victor Chiwara, David Kapuya, and Thabani Sakupwanya, amongst a plethora of others who have carved significant rugby careers.\n\nTheir rugby team, affectionately known as Amabhubesi (The Lions), was a formidable force, a spectacle to behold as they consistently competed against the very best of Zimbabwean schoolboy rugby and frequently emerged victorious.\n\nPlumtree High rugby team coach Francis Nakama gives instructions during a match against Midlands Christian College rugby team during at Hartsfield Sports Ground\n\nHowever, the past few years witnessed a regrettable decline in the fortunes of the sport at the school. Rugby was fading, the playing fields fell into disrepair, and the teams competitive edge, once so sharp, had dulled significantly. Rugby had seemingly become a relic of the past, with only nostalgic memories of bygone dominance remaining. Yet, through the dedicated efforts of the Old Prunitians (the schools alumni) and a committed team working tirelessly behind the scenes, the schools rugby fortunes have begun to revive, and Amabhubesi are steadily reclaiming their place amongst the elite.\n\nThe past couple of years have marked a consistent upward trajectory for Amabhubesi, a resurgence acknowledged by their coach, Francis Nakamu, who was deservedly named the CBZ Development Coach of the Year at the 2024 Kyros Sports Schools Rugby Awards.\n\nFast forward to the present, and Amabhubesi defied expectations to triumph in the 2025 Bulawayo Metropolitan Rugby Football Board (BMRFB) Archer Clothing Under-20 League, a hard-fought competition that concluded last Saturday after nine weeks of intense action.\n\nAt the campaigns outset, they were not considered contenders. They suffered defeats in their opening two matches before staging a remarkable comeback, winning their next four games  a run sufficient to secure their place in the semi-finals against Christian Brothers College (CBC) Hornets, whom they convincingly brushed aside with a resounding 46-3 victory, sending a clear message of their intent.Prior to the semi-final clash, Nakamu had confidently stated, If we get to the semis, we will win this tournament, and his prediction proved accurate.\n\nEntering the final as the underdogs, facing an undefeated Western Suburbs Panthers side who had narrowly defeated them 15-12 in their opening fixture, Amabhubesi roared the loudest. They secured a comprehensive 38-15 victory, demonstrating complete dominance throughout the match. They emphatically showed Zimbabwe that Plumtree High School rugby is back to its rightful place at the top. And these sentiments were powerfully echoed by the schools headmaster, Sipho Khumalo.\n\nWe have been taking rugby seriously for the past few years. We will continue with the tradition of being the best of the best. These were preparations for the rugby season and it shows that we will play better. We are doing well, we rule, we are the best and we will continue to be the best, said Khumalo.\n\nNakamu said that they are progressing in the right direction, asserting that with continued determination, they will undoubtedly reach their desired goals. He attributed their current success to the diligent groundwork laid in previous years, stating that the rewards they are now experiencing are the direct result of that earlier dedication.\n\nThis is a step in the right direction, we have been building from years back. We started back with the Under-14s who are now coming to the senior team. But, special thanks goes to the Old Boys that are funding the project and with more funding, we will see more results coming. For now, we keep our feet on the ground, focus on working hard and taking each game as it comes. We are on the right track, said Nakamu.\n\nWriting his name into the celebrated history of Plumtree High School Rugby is Mduduzi Sibanda, the young leader who proudly captained the team to their recent victory. Sibanda expressed his delight at etching his own chapter into the Amabhubesi legacy, a moment of personal triumph as the skipper of this victorious side.\n\nI just wanted to make my own piece of history. Plumtree High is a big school. It has a rich rugby history but a few years ago, we went down. Some players left but we worked hard to go back to the top and I am very proud of what we have achieved, said Sibanda.\n\nSibanda now has his sights firmly set on emulating the achievements of his former schoolmates, Menelisi Bhebhe and Spencer Dube, who successfully secured rugby scholarships to Spain and the United States of America (USA) respectively, demonstrating the global pathways that Plumtree Rugby can offer.\n\nWith the Under-20 league triumph now part of their celebrated history, Plumtree are currently engaged in the 2025 Unforgettable Milton Rugby Festival, which commenced on Friday. This prestigious tournament serves as a crucial component of their preparations for the upcoming schoolboy rugby season, providing invaluable match practice and exposure.\n\nAdding significant anticipation to their festival campaign is a highly anticipated clash against their traditional rivals, Churchill High School, scheduled for today. This encounter promises to be one of the highlights of the tournament, reigniting a long-standing and fiercely competitive schoolboy rugby rivalry.-@brandon_malvin\n\n",

This week-long event, hosted by Esigodini Agricultural College under the auspices of ZACSA, brought together talented students from eight agricultural institutions across the country.\n\nThe inter-college competition not only provided a valuable arena for healthy sporting rivalry but also actively encouraged physical well-being, fostered social interaction and facilitated the development of sporting prowess among students pursuing studies in agriculture.\n\nThe participating institutions were Chibero Agricultural College, Gwebi College of Agriculture, Kushinga-Phikelela Polytechnic, Mlezu Agricultural College, Mazowe Veterinary College, Rio Tinto Agricultural College, Shamva Agricultural College and the esteemed host college, Esigodini Agricultural College.\n\nIn the fiercely contested womens football final, Gwebi emerged victorious with a 1-0 win against Mlezu. The ladies volleyball final saw Kushinga recording a decisive 3-1 victory over Mlezu, while in the mens category, Mazowe triumphed with a 3-0 win against Gwebi.\n\nA tense and closely fought netball final saw the host team, Esigodini, secure a narrow but hard-earned 36-31 victory against Kushinga.Speaking at the events closing ceremony, Deputy Minister Marapira described the games as truly inspiring.\n\nDEPUTY Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Davis Marapira\n\nIt is an honour and a great pleasure to join you today at the closing ceremony of this years ZACSA Games Gala. What a vibrant and inspiring event this has been! The annual ZACSA Games are not just a showcase of athletic talent as they serve a much greater purpose. They are a platform for building unity, discipline, and resilience. They remind us of the value of teamwork, the importance of health and wellness, and the power of sport to bring people together across backgrounds and campuses.\n\nHe commended Esigodini Agricultural College for successfully hosting the event. Deputy Marapira also highlighted the importance of recognising top-performing participants.\n\nOne of the exciting outcomes of these games was the identification of the most outstanding teams and individual athletes. I fully support the idea of selecting the best-performing team to go on and represent not just their college but Zimbabwe at the competition of agricultural colleges from different countries, he said.\n\nDeputy Minister Marapira also emphasised the importance of mental strength in sport.\n\nLet us nurture athletes who are strong in both body and mind. Allow me to sincerely thank the organisers, the sponsors, the staff, and most importantly, the students for the passion, energy, and dedication that brought this event to life. Your commitment is the reason we are all gathered here today in celebration. At the ministry, we are deeply committed to our vision of food security everywhere, every day. And I believe that what we see in ZACSA is directly connected to that mission, he said.Deputy Marapira also drew parallels between sport and agriculture.\n\nSport teaches preparation, strategy, endurance and teamwork  exactly the same values we need in agriculture. The strong, focused, and disciplined youth we are celebrating today are the very same ones we look up to for tomorrows agricultural transformation.@innocentskizoe\n\n",
