Picture  BELIEVE NYAKUDYARA\n\nIn his keynote address, President Mnangagwa, chair of SADC, emphasised the importance of discipline and vigilance among the youth. The event was attended by Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga, Cabinet ministers, top Government officials, and representatives from sister liberation parties, including the ANC (South Africa), Frelimo (Mozambique), Chama Cha Mapinduzi (Tanzania), and CNDD-FDD (Burundi).\n\nI extend a special welcome to you, our young people, as well as delegates from other countries. Your presence here is a testament to the unity and solidarity that define us, the SADC region, and indeed the continent of Africa. I urge you, our young people, to guard jealously this long-standing tradition of unity, solidarity, and peaceful co-existence. The current development era equally demands that you constantly learn from each other, sharing knowledge and experiences for the betterment of your respective communities and countries. None but yourselves has that responsibility, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe underscored that the prosperity and future of the region and Africa lie in the hands of the young generation.\n\nWe, the older generation, played our part to bring about independence, freedom, and peace. The ball is now in your court. You must deliver. In unity, the youth of Africa can do more for the realisation of the Africa we want and deserve.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa reaffirmed the older generations belief in the youths potential.\n\nThis National Youth Day is set aside and dedicated to recognising the potential of you, the young people of our country. We, your leaders, believe in your potential and will continue to ensure that your zeal and energy are harnessed so that you accomplish your dreams and aspirations and ultimately, our national Vision 2030. The huge turnout, peaceful, jovial, and electric atmosphere characterising this gathering is a reflection of our collective unity and defining national character as an independent and sovereign people.\n\nEmphasising unity, he urged the youth to remain hardworking, patriotic, and loyal to the country.\n\nResist and reject machinations of those who would want to divide you and divide our nation.\n\nThe President said the celebrations were a chance to reflect on past generations contributions and stressed the importance of discipline, commitment, and hard work for Zimbabwes future.\n\nWe also have a chance to chart and refine the journey we are taking for a brighter future, particularly the role of you; our young people. In undertaking this critical task, remain emboldened by the virtues of courage, selfless sacrifice, and bravery which were defining among the youths of yesteryear. They took up arms against the oppressive colonial regime and brought us independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, freedom, and democracy.\n\nThese historical milestones, including the rich liberation war heritage, are indispensable and must be safeguarded and passed down from generation to generation, he said.\n\nI, further, call upon you, the young people of this great nation, to continue displaying utmost discipline, commitment, and hard, honest work for the collective good of our country. In doing so, you must be aware that the unity and peace we enjoy today is a fundamental inheritance of the liberation struggle. No one must jeopardise or endanger these critical national aspects.\n\nNational Youth Day, a public holiday under the Second Republic, has become an inclusive platform for youth expression and engagement.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa reaffirmed the Governments commitment to youth empowerment through leadership roles in Government and other key institutions. He stressed that National Youth Day should be a platform for hope, unity, and safeguarding Zimbabwes heritage and freedoms.\n\nIn view of these achievements, I challenge the young people deployed in various leadership positions to continue displaying principles of servant leadership and discipline while galvanising the youth to fully participate in the socio-economic and cultural affairs of our country. As the vanguard of our country, you must take the initiative and develop synergies and partnerships while building a common united front to advance the aims and objectives of our peoples revolution and development thrust.\n\nHe implored the youth to remain vigilant and patriotic.\n\nDefend the integrity and dignity of our country, leadership, and its people. Stand firm, and inculcate a culture of volunteerism and service among all the young people in our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe. The young people both within our country and in the diaspora are called upon to leverage their potential, competencies, and skills towards the pursuit of fulfilling careers.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa urged young people to embrace technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship to create wealth, jobs, and economic growth, expressing confidence in their ability to make Zimbabwe a success.\n\nThe future of our country lies in your hands, he said.\n\nThe celebrations also saw the launch of the Zimbabwe Digital Skills Development Programme, an ambitious initiative implemented in collaboration with the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThis initiative will train 1,5 million young people across the country as software engineers, developers, and programmers. This will enhance digital literacy and skills among Zimbabwean citizens and empower a new generation of professionals who can contribute to technological innovation, he said.\n\nThe programme will train young people in programming, data science, and Android development, fostering innovation and supporting local tech solutions and start-ups.\n\nThis must enhance the countrys competitiveness in the global market, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Vusumuzi Dube,[emailprotected]\n\nHIGHLANDERS, Bulawayos iconic football giants, are a year away from their centenary.\n\nHopes for a celebratory season were briefly dashed when Fifa slapped them with a transfer ban for unpaid wages to former coach Baltemar Brito and his assistant.\n\nBrito was owed US$14,778 plus interest, and Torres US$11,788 plus interest, both accruing further penalties.\n\nJust when it seemed Bosso faced a prolonged crisis, socialite Wicknell Chivayo stepped in, paying off the debts in full.While this saved the clubs blushes, it exposed worrying questions about financial management.\n\nThe debt was notably absent from discussions at last months AGM, leaving fans in the dark.\n\nClub chairman Kenneth Mhlophe said they were relying on sponsors to resolve the issue before Fifas punishment, but the near miss has raised serious concerns about transparency as Bosso approaches its 100th year.\n\nKenneth Mhlophe\n\nWe engaged our sponsors over the issue. Going into the annual general meeting week, all appeared in place for the debt to have been paid, and we counted on their usual support, Mhlophe said.\n\nMhlophe deflected criticism by blaming his predecessor, Johnfat Sibanda, for the stalled Inyathi gold mining venture.\n\nThe project, intended to generate club revenue, reportedly made no progress under Sibandas leadership.\n\nThere was no action at all on the mining venture.\n\nThings were still as I had left them, and we then began to chase paperwork. As we speak, the papers have been lodged with the Ministry of Mines. Once they respond, we will be fine, Mhlophe said.\n\nBossos crisis has sparked scrutiny of Mhlophe and Sibandas leadership.Fans and stakeholders are comparing their tenures, achievements, and failures.\n\nThis week, Saturday Chronicle will analyse their impact on the club.\n\nMhlophe, the current chairperson, is no stranger to the Highlanders community, having previously served as the clubs chair from 2018 to 2021 before losing to Sibanda. His return to the helm of the club was seen as an opportunity to build on his earlier tenure and address lingering issues.\n\nHits:\n\nSecured more sponsorship for Highlanders\n\nMhlophe continued the Sakunda deal and secured a Better Brands sponsorship from Pedzai Scott Sakupwanya. Sakunda remained the main sponsor, while Better Brands covered costs for the Highlanders Academy (including all junior teams and the womens team, Highlanders Royals), paying staff and players.\n\nInfrastructure Development\n\nDuring his earlier tenure, Mhlophe initiated plans to renovate the clubs facilities, including the training grounds and the clubhouse. These efforts have continued in his current term, reflecting his commitment to improving the clubs infrastructure.\n\nImproved relations with fans\n\nMhlophe has worked tirelessly to restore trust and goodwill between the club and its fan base. Through community outreach efforts and fan engagement programmes, he sought to re-establish Highlanders as the peoples team. Last year, they held a successful fundraising initiative that was well-supported by both local and international fans.\n\nMisses:\n\nLimited success on the field\n\nDespite the perceived financial stability and structural improvements, Highlanders have yet to translate these gains into major success on the pitch. The club has not won the league title since 2006, and fans are growing increasingly impatient as the wait for a championship continues. In 2024, Highlanders failed to retain the Independence Trophy, were knocked out of the Chibuku Super Cup via a boardroom decision, and finished sixth in the league.\n\nFifa ban after failing to pay former coaches outstanding salaries\n\nThe biggest failure that has marred his leadership was the Fifa ban on registering new players after they failed to pay their former coaches. What makes this a greater stain on his tenure is the manner in which he hid this from the clubs membership during their AGM. A question on everyones mind is how many skeletons in their closet were not revealed to its membership; what else is Mhlophe and his executive hiding?\n\nFailure to negotiate meaningful contracts with players\n\nHighlanders continue to lose players on free transfers due to poor contract negotiations. Under Mhlophe, Marvelous Chigumira, Godfrey Makaruse, Peter Muduhwa, Lynoth Chikuhwa, and several juniors left for free after their contracts expired. This costly mismanagement, despite a prior AGM resolution against it, forces the team to rebuild without transfer revenue.\n\nLack of a clear plan to help finance the club\n\nMhlophes corporate experience hasnt translated into success for Highlanders. The club remains financially unstable, reliant on handouts, and lacks a clear survival plan.Proactive leadership is absent; Mhlophe mainly reacts to problems.The long-promised mining venture offers little immediate hope.\n\nFailure to provide replica jerseys\n\nLast season, fans made do with purchasing replica jerseys from the streets. The club continuously promised that the replicas were coming in a few weeks right up to the last game. We are now in 2025, and no sign of the replicas. Mhlophe has no plan at all on how he will counter the sale of these replicas on the streets. All that the club provided were woollen hats and scarves, which ironically were released during the summer season.\n\nNo movement in the transfer market\n\nIt is clear to all that Highlanders need to boost its squad, but a few weeks before the season starts, there is little or no movement on the transfer market. Other teams are busy bolstering their squad, but Mhlophe and his team are just silent. We will just give them the benefit of the doubt; maybe they are preparing to unleash a secret weapon that will once again bring smiles to its legion of fans\n\nSibanda took over the reins of Highlanders Football Club in March 2021, after defeating Kenneth Mhlophe in a closely contested election. His tenure was marked by high expectations, as he campaigned on a platform of change, accountability, and financial stability for the club.\n\nHits:\n\nSecured Sakunda sponsorship\n\nSibanda secured a lucrative Sakunda sponsorship, providing US$420 000 for player salaries, US$60 000 each for sign-on fees and operational expenses, a potential US$200 000 league-winning bonus, and Ford Everest and Ranger vehicles for the coach and captain.\n\nAvailed replica jerseys for fans\n\nThrough sponsorship from Sakunda, replica shirts were available in three colours for Bosso fans to purchase.\n\nBrought in Brito\n\nSibanda hired foreign coach Baltemar Jos de Oliveira Brito, who nearly won the league, and brought in Joel Luphahla as assistant, with a succession plan. Luphahla later left, finding success at Dynamos and now coaching Simba Bhora.\n\nBaltemar Jose De Oliveira Brito\n\nRenovation of the Highlanders Clubhouse\n\nThe Highlanders Clubhouse had gone for years without any notable renovations; it was now an eyesore, with non-functioning toilets, broken furniture, and everything in a state of disrepair. However, Sibandas administration secured a partnership deal with local businessman Phathisani Nkomo to modernise the clubhouse. This has made it a popular venue for Bosso fans after matches.\n\nBrought some cup glory to Highlanders\n\nDuring his tenure, Sibanda saw the team win the Independence Cup in 2022 and 2023.\n\nRevenue generation through the selling of players\n\nHe sold Daniel Msendami and Nqobizitha Masuku to Jwaneng Galaxy, thereby generating much-needed revenue for the club.\n\nMisses\n\nFailure to strengthen the squad, despite interest from players like Kuda Mahachi and Bruce Kangwa, resulted in a goal drought (just 24 goals) and cost Highlanders the league title.The championship remained elusive.\n\nFailure to produce audited results\n\nHe failed to produce audited accounts for the 2023 AGM, something that had not happened at the club in years. This eroded the trust of potential sponsors.\n\nFailed to get the clubs mining project in Inyathi off the ground\n\nHighlanders Inyathi gold mine claim, awarded in 2020 by President Mnangagwa, saw little development under Sibanda, despite plans to use proceeds for facilities and junior teams.A designated mine manager made no progress.\n\nInternal Divisions\n\nSibandas leadership was also marred by internal divisions within the clubs structures. Reports of factionalism and disagreements with board members occasionally surfaced, undermining his ability to lead effectively\n\nUltimately, Highlanders remain in a rebuilding phase, and the true measure of any chairpersons success will be the clubs ability to reclaim its status as a dominant force in Zimbabwean football. Both leaders have contributed to the clubs journey in different ways, and their legacies will hinge on whether the foundation they have laid can lead to sustained success in the future.\n\n",

May I take this opportunity to recognise my fellow youthful ministers, said Minister Machakaire.\n\nAs part of your strategic innovations towards achieving Vision 2030, we recognise and celebrate the progress made in key areas for youth development. One remarkable step has been establishing Youth Focal Desks. We commend you, Your Excellency, for creating these desks, important points of contact for youth engagement. However, further optimisation is needed to ensure they function more efficiently and effectively, ultimately becoming more responsive to young peoples needs.\n\nMinister Machakaire acknowledged Zimbabwes youth potential but stressed the need for further empowerment. He said his ministry is modernising Vocational Training Centres (VTCs) to equip young people with practical skills for national development.\n\nHe lobbied for a local scholarship programme to support students lacking the financial means to attend tertiary institutions.\n\nYour Excellency, you will be pleased to know that, thanks to your support for underprivileged students in ZimFEP schools, 13 students from Binga, who benefited from this initiative, successfully completed secondary education and have applied for the 2025 Presidential Scholarship Scheme. While this is commendable, we acknowledge that not all deserving students can be accommodated under the Presidential Scholarship Scheme.\n\nBuilding on this success, we humbly propose, through your wisdom and guidance, that we also create scholarships for our local state universities. This initiative would resonate with your core principles of devolution and the commitment to ensuring that no one and no place is left behind.Minister Machakaire said the Ministry is also prioritising digital skills training for young people.\n\nIn todays digital age, digital literacy is crucial for empowering young people to access education, employment, and economic opportunities. The ministry continues to prioritise digital literacy and skills development, ensuring our young people are well-equipped to thrive in our increasingly interconnected world, he said.\n\nMinister Machakaire called for improvements to the Youth Empowerment Bank and suggested the Government prioritise employing graduates from the Youth Service Zimbabwe programme, which has trained over 1 000 young people since last year.\n\nWe wish for a policy prioritising the employment and placement in higher learning institutions of these graduates. Such a policy would ensure that our home-grown talents contributions are not only recognised but prioritised in driving our country forward. It is worth mentioning, Your Excellency, that our Youth Service in Zimbabwe graduates are qualified in several fields.\n\nGone are the days when it was assumed this programme was only for the uneducated. Under your astute leadership, Your Excellency, we have trained qualified graduates who are more than able and ready to serve their country, he said.\n\nHe commended First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa for initiating programmes addressing social ills like drug and substance abuse and gender-based violence among young people.@nqotshili\n\n",

This years festival is especially significant as it honours the theme: Celebrating Women.\n\nThe festival has always showcased the best of European cinema while highlighting the talents of Zimbabwean and African filmmakers.This year, for the first time in several years, the festival will be held in May, coinciding with both Europe Day (May 9th) and Africa Day (May 25th).\n\nMovie lovers taking notes at a EuroFilmFestZW workshop\n\nThese dates hold historical importance, marking the anniversary of the Schuman Declaration, which paved the way for the European Union, and the formation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), now the African Union (AU).\n\nThis timing provides a perfect opportunity to foster a stronger cultural dialogue between Europe and Africa, right here in Zimbabwe. We invite audiences to celebrate not just cinema, but the arts, music, culture, and food that connect and inspire us all, Gwaze said.\n\nCompetition gongs\n\nTo recognise and encourage Zimbabwean filmmakers, the prize pool for the Bioskop Competition has been doubled from US$400 to US$800. This increase aims to further inspire creativity and participation, particularly among women.\n\nWhile we typically receive 50 to 60 entries each year, weve noticed a concerning trend: fewer entries from female filmmakers.The theme Celebrating Women is therefore a deliberate and passionate focus to amplify womens voices and stories, Gwaze said.\n\nThe Bioskop Short Film Competition invites filmmakers to explore the theme Celebrating Women, encouraging interpretations ranging from personal stories to historical tributes. Films that depict women challenging norms and inspiring change are particularly welcome.\n\nThe Bioskop Short Film Competition offers prizes in the following categories: Best Narrative Short (US$800), Best Documentary Short (US$800), Best Sound Editing (US$400), Best Cinematography (US$400), Best Diaspora Film (US$400), and Best Actor/Actress (US$400).\n\nMovie lovers enjoy film screenings\n\nThe competition is open to Zimbabwean residents, and those of Zimbabwean heritage living in any European or African country.\n\nFor a decade, the festival has been a launchpad for talented filmmakers, providing a platform to showcase their work and connect with industry professionals. The winning film receives a cash prize and is screened at EuroFilmFestZW.\n\nLast years winners included My Husband Joe by Derby Bheta (Best Narrative) and Chasing Levels by Dumie Manyathela (Best Documentary). The addition of the Best Actor/Actress category last year broadened the festivals scope and recognised on-screen talent.\n\nFilmmakers have until April 6 to submit their entries via FilmFreeway. The competition welcomes all genres, including animation, documentary, and live-action. Films will be judged on content and creativity, with a focus on innovation, regardless of the filmmakers resources.\n\nAsaph performs at one of the EuroFilmFestZW sessions\n\nAs EuroFilmFestZW celebrates its tenth anniversary, it aims to highlight womens contributions, not only in cinema but across all industries.\n\nThis festival is an opportunity to shine a spotlight on the remarkable women who inspire, break barriers, and redefine societal roles, both in front of and behind the camera, Gwazesaid.\n\nThis years festival also coincides with the ongoing Zimbabwe Film Strategy 2025-2030, launched by the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) last year, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the local film industry.  @MbuleloMpofu.\n\n",

Introduced in 1986, the movement sought to encourage youths to emulate the patriotism, selflessness, fortitude and upright qualities that defined the then Prime Minister, Cde Robert Mugabe who became President the following year. Cde Mugabes birthday was February 21.\n\nAs soon as he assumed the presidency in November 2017, President Mnangagwa declared February 21 as National Youth Day to not only celebrate the birthday of his immediate predecessor and mentor, but also perpetuate all that he stood for from the days of the liberation struggle to his post-Independence leadership of the country.\n\nYesterday, President Mnangagwa led proceedings at this very important day on the national calendar.\n\nIn his address, he recognised the big turnout of young ones at the event and implored them to unitedly and diligently forge ahead in their various endeavours.\n\nThis National Youth Day is set aside and dedicated to recognising the potential of you, the young people of our country, he said.\n\nWe, your leaders, believe in your potential and will continue to ensure that your zeal and energy are harnessed so that you accomplish your dreams and aspirations and ultimately, our national Vision 2030. The huge turnout, peaceful, jovial, and electric atmosphere characterising this gathering is a reflection of our collective unity and defining national character as an independent and sovereign people.\n\nHe added:\n\nWe also have a chance to chart and refine the journey we are taking for a brighter future, particularly the role of you; our young people. In undertaking this critical task, remain emboldened by the virtues of courage, selfless sacrifice, and bravery which were defining among the youths of yesteryear. They took up arms against the oppressive colonial regime and brought us independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, freedom, and democracy.\n\nWe are glad that the celebration has become so popular among our youths that they voluntarily came from all over the country to participate. We are sure that everyone who attended recognises the principles that underpin the day.\n\nWe are sure too that, as they return to their respective bases today, they are taking with them the Presidents message. The need for them to work hard to fulfil their dreams, to uphold national unity, to be as courageous and diligent as the countrys liberators. The imperative of putting the national interest ahead of personal comfort.\n\nAnyone who lives by these virtues will be successful in their lives, and would be useful in the collective effort to develop the motherland.\n\n",

            "content": "Mbulelo Mpofu,[emailprotected]\n\nDAYS after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order freezing almost all foreign aid, anxiety is palpable across various sectors in Africa, with Zimbabwes creative industry also feeling the impact. Many Africans had anticipated that Trumps America First policy would deprioritise their continent, but the implications are now beginning to resonate deeply.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the creative sector is bracing for a potential collapse as funding sources dry up. Saturday Leisure reached out to arts commentators and artistes to gauge the freezes effects on the industry.\n\nRaisedon Baya, arts commentator and director of the Intwasa Arts Festival KoBulawayo, highlighted the broader implications of the ban.\n\nAsaph Afrika\n\nIt (freezing of US foreign aid) will affect a lot of sectors, directly or indirectly. Its difficult to assess now but definitely the sector will be affected. There will be a lot of prioritising and changing of focus, and in that changing of focus support might move from the arts and culture sector to the gaps created in the humanitarian sector, he said.\n\nTo combat financial frailty, Bayas Intwasa Arts Festival KoBulawayo has come up with a contingency plan aimed at having 50 supporters, aka Friends of Intwasa, each donating US$20 to help provide a platform for talented young artistes to shine.\n\nContrastingly, South African hip-hop artiste Mlue Jay expressed scepticism about the freezes impact on the creative community.\n\nMadlela Skhobokhobo\n\nHonestly, I dont think Trumps decision to freeze financial aid in Africa will significantly impact the creative sector. In my opinion, most creatives havent really benefited from this aid in the first place. It seems like the funds mostly reach certain individuals or groups, rather than trickling down to the creative community.\n\nAward-winning journalist and founder of Creatives Magazine, Sithokozile Sibanda, highlighted the potential setbacks for Zimbabwes cultural landscape.\n\nRaisedon Baya\n\nZimbabwe has a rich cultural heritage, but without financial backing, it could be challenging to showcase that talent to the world. That would stifle innovation, reduce collaborations with global partners, and make it harder for creatives to access resources that help develop the arts.\n\nAgain, we may need to understand the current situation in Zimbabwe. How has financial aid been benefitting the creative sector so far, and who has been the main beneficiary? Once we have a clear picture of that, we can better understand how Trumps decision might impact Zimbabwes creative industries before expanding the conversation to other African countries.\n\nNkululeko Nkala lamented the mismanagement of funds intended for artistes.\n\nObviously, many creatives benefitted from commissioning and funding from US Grants. We will obviously feel the pinch as an already under-funded industry which benefits from peoples liquidity. When peoples wallets cough, we catch the cold. But its obviously a bigger lesson to governments and politicians that this dependency should stop. We have all the natural resources that the likes of US can only dream of. But they are calling the shots because of the corruption and mismanagement in our countries.\n\nNkululeko Nkala\n\nIn contrast, Tshibilika music artiste Madlela offered an empowering perspective, calling for self-sustainability among artistes.\n\nIts a wake-up call to every African to really see and know that we are on our own. Its time we put our houses in order and really strive to feed ourselves from the God-given resources. I think we must stop the begging mentality yikho okwenza basidelele abantu laba. We are not their subjects, we are not inferior to anyone. We just need to realise our potential and then, Africa will really be saved.\n\nThabani Hillary Moyo, from the Centre for Talent Development, warned of the broader ramifications.\n\nFreezing financial aid to Africa could have significant consequences for the creative sector. Such a move would not only cut direct funding but also weaken cultural exchange initiatives, mentorship programmes, and training opportunities that help African artistes thrive in the global creative economy.\n\nMoyo also noted a positive aspect of Trumps policy.\n\nSithokozile Sibanda\n\nWhat I find positive about the thrust being taken by Trump is encouraging hard work and rewarding it. That for me is what everyone should be thinking about.\n\nNkululeko Dube, director of Inkululeko Yabatsha School of Arts (Iyasa), called for a reset in the sector.\n\nPresident Trumps decision to freeze financial aid to Africa will undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences for the creative sector, which has long relied on grants and funding from international organisations, including Usaid. This move threatens the very existence of many networks and projects that have been built around this assistance.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of this policy, its crucial to explore alternative solutions. As nations increasingly prioritise their own interests, its essential for African countries to adopt a similar approach and seek new funding opportunities. I believe by adopting a proactive and innovative approach, the creative sector in Africa, including Zimbabwe, can navigate the challenges posed by this policy and continue to thrive.\n\nMusic producer Black Orient summed up the sentiment concisely.\n\nNkululeko Innocent Dube\n\nTrumps action goes to show that we must stop looking for hand-outs and build our own creative economy.\n\nOver the years, the US had been a benefactor of diverse arts programmes in Africa. Case in point, last year, local hip-hop artiste, Tafadzwa Asaph Tarukwana, toured the US, representing Zimbabwe at the Next Level Global event, a cross-cultural creative exchange programme organised by the US Department of State and the Meridian International Centre.\n\nAs panic spreads and the future remains uncertain, the cultural and creative industries (CCIs) in Zimbabwe and across Africa are at a crossroads, facing both challenges and opportunities for renewal.\n\nFollow on X @MbuleloMpofu\n\n",

            "content": "Stephen Mpofu, PerspectiveTODAYS youth must be Zimbabwes brave new future, just as they should be the bright future of any nation if peace and order are to prevail in our global village.\n\nHowever, the drug menace currently plaguing Zimbabwes youth offers no such bright future for our beautiful motherland. It is therefore incumbent upon key stakeholders  our Government, born from the armed revolution, parents, and other key players  to create a conducive environment for young people to shape a brighter future for generations to come.\n\nThe drugs and substances circulating in Zimbabwe are turning young people into virtual zombies.\n\nOne is led to believe this is at the behest of the devil, with the peddlers acting as his agents, seeking to reverse the gains of the armed revolution. Ironically, it was young men and women who bore the brunt of racist colonisers machine guns and fighter planes to bring about the independence, freedom, peace, and national development we see today.\n\nThe drugs destroying young lives include marijuana (mbanje), which is grown domestically, bronco, crystal meth, chlorpromazine, mutoriro, and guka.\n\nMarijuana\n\nReliable sources from rehabilitation facilities report that mutoriro causes impotence, and that some of these drugs are trafficked from East Africa, through some SADC countries, to southern\n\nZimbabwe and into our nation. Others come across our northern borders, wreaking havoc. Some users resort to stealing and selling possessions to fund their drug habits. (For instance, this writer had an imported lawnmower stolen and dismantled by known young addicts to buy more of these dangerous substances.)\n\nSome law-abiding young people, speaking anonymously, suggested that opportunities, such as jobs, should be created. They believe that occupying young minds with progressive developmental tasks, such as employment, is crucial, as the devil uses idle minds for crime, including drug use.\n\nThis suggests, in this writers opinion, that schools should incorporate job skills into their curricula.\n\nThis would enable graduates to move directly into their chosen careers.\n\nOur Government might consider this option, alongside other measures, to prepare students for the countrys future  economically, politically, and socially  as vital ingredients for national unity, peace, and stability.\n\nUrban communities, where the drug menace is rampant, should establish neighbourhood watch committees to police their areas against drug trafficking and abuse. The police and law courts must act decisively to maintain law and order.\n\nAs current chair of SADC, Zimbabwe is well-placed to encourage other member states to prevent drugs from being trafficked across their borders.\n\nIt is likely that those who impose sanctions on our country, in response to our land reform programme, hope that the drug problem will derail our national development, peace, and stability.\n\nIn these circumstances, Zimbabweans, including opposition parties, must unite against the drug peddling menace. All progressive citizens, regardless of political affiliation, must stand together so that all young people, including their own children, refrain from actions that would negate the freedom, peace, and stability that liberation heroes fought so hard to achieve.\n\nA crackdown on smugglers, including those dealing in drugs, is essential.\n\nIf young men and women, armed only with AK rifles, faced down snakes, mosquitoes, and the enemys machine guns and aircraft, driven by their determination to bring freedom to the masses, why cant todays youth use modern technology to transform lives, as is happening elsewhere?\n\nMind-boggling is not the answer.\n\nPatriotic Zimbabwean institutions, including businesses, educational bodies, and churches, should rally behind the government. This support is crucial to empower Zimbabwean youth to contribute to development, transform our society, and progress alongside other nations, instead of being held back.\n\nIn conclusion, all developmental initiatives should be guided by the principle: nyika inovakwa nevene vayo/ilizwe lakhiwa nganinilo/a country is built by its owners.\n\n",

A tangible sense of excitement filled the air as students explored exhibits ranging from remarkably durable and attractive paving bricks made from discarded tyres to a truly ground-breaking machine that converts used plastic into fuel.\n\nGraduate Isheunesu Mukome narrates the process of converting old tyres into pavers\n\nThe displays werent just static exhibits; they sparked curiosity and conversation, prompting students to engage with the innovators and learn about the processes behind these remarkable inventions. The sheer ingenuity on display highlighted the potential of young minds and the power of technology to address real-world problems, leaving a lasting impression on the aspiring scientists and engineers in attendance.\n\nThe combination of National Youth Day celebrations and these engaging exhibitions proved a masterstroke. The event allowed young people to celebrate the 21st of February holiday while learning and sharing ideas about two of their key interests: technology and innovation. Thousands of young people celebrated National Youth Day in style, packing three halls at the ZIEC. President Mnangagwa was the guest of honour.\n\nFor young Prince and his Form Four classmates from Milton High School, seeing and touching paving bricks made from discarded tyres was a first. The expressions on their faces showed they recognised the ingenuity of the innovation.\n\nIsheanesu Mukome, a Biochemistry graduate from the University of Zimbabwe (UZ), said that the paving brick innovation was born from a desire to protect the environment by repurposing non-biodegradable materials. Discarded tyres, a significant environmental hazard, can be transformed into durable and attractive paving blocks.\n\nOld tyres can be harmful to the environment if not disposed of in an environmentally friendly way, and we have found a way of turning them into paving bricks. One old tyre is shredded into very small pieces, and the wires are removed before we compact the material into paving bricks that are both durable and beautiful, said Mukome.\n\nHer stand proved popular with schoolchildren, fascinated by the idea of transforming old tyres into building materials traditionally made from sand and cement.\n\nNearby, Benson Manjengwa, another UZ graduate, was kept busy answering questions from schoolchildren eager to understand his innovation  a machine that turns plastic into fuel. Like a patient teacher, Manjengwa explained the process of converting this notorious environmental pollutant into usable energy. The innovation, a Pyrolysis Plant, cost the team of innovators US$600 to build.\n\nPrincess Moyo of Lobengula High School was thrilled by the innovations she and her friends saw.\n\nThis years National Youth Day celebrations were different from previous ones because we learned a lot about how other young people are making all kinds of products and inventions that will make a difference in peoples lives. President Mnangagwa said the future is in our hands and that we should use science and technology to build our country, so Im happy that we got a chance to see how innovation and technology are good for Zimbabwe, said Princess.\n\nThe exhibitions provided a perfect opportunity for universities and colleges to showcase their offerings to students who will soon be choosing their tertiary education paths.\n\nThe world is now in the technological revolution, and this years National Youth Day celebrations gave us the perfect opportunity to show young learners what our university has to offer. The learners want to know what separates us from other universities and colleges so that they can make informed decisions when they finish high school, said a lecturer from a local university.\n\nIn Hall 3, the Mpopoma High School choir entertained exhibitors, schoolchildren, and guests with an impromptu singing session.\n\nIn Hall 4, where the main proceedings took place, the Head of State and Government addressed thousands of young people from across the countrys ten provinces. The hall erupted in applause when President Mnangagwa announced the countrys digital skills training programme, which aims to empower 1,5 million young people nationwide.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the initiative will enhance digital literacy and skills among Zimbabwean citizens and empower a new generation of professionals who can contribute to technological innovation.\n\n",
