Public sector officials are directed to keep up with the ongoing reforms.\n\nOn its part, my Government will continue to roll out sensitisation and training in Results Based Management across the public sector, at all levels.Digitalisation of performance contracting will also see increased efficiencies within our systems, while benchmarking with best practices remains ongoing.\n\nThe Whole of Government and Society Approach is being strengthened through consultative engagements with grassroots communities and the private sector, as well as bilateral and development partners, he said.President Mnangagwa said officials should never betray the sacred trust and confidence bestowed on Government and other departments by the general citizenry.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nThe Second Republics foremost duty, he said, remained to uplift Zimbabweans livelihoods.\n\nWe derived our mandate from the people as they expressed their democratic right by voting our ruling, revolutionary Party, Zanu-PF into office.\n\nIn this regard, the various mandates that we are discharging as the public sector, should be reflective of the will of the people of Zimbabwe and undertaken in their interest.\n\nIndividually and collectively, we all have a duty to empower and uplift many more of our fellow country men and women, the young and the old alike, as well as our boys and girls, out of poverty into prosperity.\n\nLet us, never betray the sacred trust and confidence that the people have entrusted on us and our colossal mass Party.\n\nI urge us all to wholeheartedly serve our country with honest, unflinching patriotism, uttermost professionalism, humility and unquestionable integrity, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said Governments implementation of performance contracting was one of the reforms geared to ensure that the public sector is market and people-centred.Performance contracting, which was introduced in 2021, has had a propelling effect and enabled stakeholders, including ordinary citizens, to assess progress by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).\n\nSince its introduction, the system, which has cascaded to Deputy Ministers, has registered notable milestones across all sectors including steady economic growth, introduction of the ZiG, launch of the Presidential Title Deeds Programme and establishment of Village Business Units, among other initiatives.\n\nUnder the Second Republic, we have committed ourselves to achieve an agile, innovative, responsive and resilient governance system.\n\nThis is underpinned by policy thrusts which include: Thinking Big: Policy entrepreneurship and innovation; Managing for Sustainable Development Results; and Accountability.\n\nMy Government is determined to re-purpose our institutions and systems to remain relevant to current and emerging trends, as we harness present opportunities and grapple with the associated challenges, said the President.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa presents the Second Best Performing Chief Executive Officer Rural Local Authorities Award for 2024 to Umguza Rural District Council CEO Mr Collen Moyo at State House in Harare yesterday during a signing ceremony for performance contracts and an awards ceremony for ministers and senior public sector officials.  Picture: Believe Nyakudjara\n\nHe said it was therefore critically important that in the final year of the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), the implementation of highly impactful programmes and projects is scaled up to leapfrog the countrys quest to attain high-income society status.\n\nI look forward to the overall Outcome Evaluation Report at the end of the 2025 fiscal year. This will allow us to comprehensively and factually ascertain the impact of Performance Contracting on the economy and citizenry as well as afford us insightful lessons for the implementation of National Development Strategy 2, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nThe enactment of the Government and Results Act, he said, was envisaged to consolidate the nexus between public sector performance and accountability for results.\n\nAlignment between planning and budgeting, and enhancing the rewards and sanctions mechanisms, remain priority areas of focus.\n\nIt is notable that this years Performance Contracts have been extended to Deputy Ministers, Deputy Chief Secretaries, Public Service Commissioners, the Clerk of Parliament and Secretary to the Judicial Service Commission, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nThe President also announced the introduction of Joint Performance Contracts for programmes and projects which will be implemented with effect from next year.\n\nThis should bring traction in the completion of projects, while improving resource allocation and utilisation.These interventions equally provide avenues for the incorporation of the private sector and development partners into public sector programming.\n\nI expect that Joint Performance Contracting will be mainstreamed as we formulate National Development Strategy 2, he said.\n\nIn terms of the performance ratings, awards and recommendations, President Mnangagwa said they had enhanced policy and structural responsiveness, while injecting positive competition among MDAs.Sector specific reforms are being instituted across the public sector so that Government is modernised and responsive to the needs of the people.\n\nThis includes reviewing and eliminating some of the overlapping permits and licences being charged by MDAs.\n\nThe streamlining of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures affecting the ease of doing business, is also being prioritised.\n\nWe are determined to comprehensively consolidate and improve on the gains we have realised towards Zimbabwe being an attractive and competitive investment destination, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa shakes hands with Minister of Sports, Kirsty Coventry\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the ongoing reforms within public entities were set to see a turnaround towards greater viability and profitability.\n\nKey to this strategic refocusing was the creation of the Zimbabwes Sovereign Wealth Fund, under the Mutapa Investment Fund, he said.\n\nWith regards to the Devolution and Decentralisation Agenda, the President reiterated that Provinces were expected to emerge as dynamic and competitive economic hubs, with marked growth across all sectors.Ministers of Provincial Affairs and Devolution are, thus, directed to champion the implementation of people-centred development projects.\n\nMay I emphasise that Ministries, Departments and Agencies and the public sector as a whole, are directed to adopt synchronised, co-ordinated, and results-driven governance frameworks.\n\nUnder my Administration, the public sector succeeds as one united team, chasing one common national vision, for the good of all our people, leaving no one and no place behind, he said.\n\nIn his remarks before introducing the President, Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga said the signing of performance contracts had resulted in improved performance.\n\nHe reiterated President Mnangagwas philosophy that nyika inovakwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe Lakhiwa Ngabanikazi Balo.\n\nOnly through collective effort can we achieve lasting success, VP Chiwenga said.In delivering the vote of thanks, Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri congratulated the award winners and encouraged the rest.\n\nRemember that the performance contracts framework remains the cornerstone of Governments accountability, she said.\n\n",

However, Chief Secretary in the Office of the President and Cabinet Dr Martin Rushwaya, flagged anomalies in its formulation, prompting a directive for revisions based on audited 2017 figures.\n\nA special budget committee was subsequently established, comprising council representatives, business stakeholders, residents associations, tertiary institutions and tourism players. Despite these efforts, disagreements between council officials and stakeholders, particularly over the disclosure of salary details, led to a deadlock.\n\nThe local authority cited provisions in the Cyber and Data Protection Act to justify withholding senior management salary details. Stakeholders, however, argued that this lack of transparency undermined trust.\n\nThe business community also raised concerns over labour costs, which had increased by 104 percent since 2017, from US$53 million to US$108 million.\n\nActing Local Government director Mrs Fikile Marovatsanga, confirmed Minister Garwes scheduled meeting with council management and members of the special budget committee. While her comments did not reveal the ministers intended course of action, sources suggest that Minister Garwe may issue stern warnings to council officials. If no resolution is reached, there is speculation that a commission of inquiry could be appointed.\n\nThe Minister will be here on Wednesday, where he will meet council management and members of the special budget committee that was set up last year. The meeting is over the outstanding city budget, which remains unapproved to date, she said.\n\nEarlier this month, Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube, gave both parties a one-week ultimatum to resolve their differences. However, this deadline passed without progress, leaving the city without an approved budget as it enters the second quarter of 2025.\n\nThe lack of an approved budget has considerably hindered critical infrastructure projects in Bulawayo. Water shortages remain a pressing issue due to delays in upgrading water reticulation systems. Road maintenance, housing development and sanitation services have also been affected.\n\nBulawayo mayor Councillor David Coltart, expressed concern over the delays, saying it has exacerbated urban decay and deteriorating services.\n\n",

This is despite the fact that the security situation in the DRC remains fragile, with supply routes, including the Goma and the Bukavu airports, still closed, he said.\n\nThe humanitarian situation in the eastern DRC remains dire, while armed groups continue to pose a threat to the sovereignty of the country and the stability of our two regions.\n\nThere is, therefore, a need for us to accelerate the implementation of our joint interventions to arrest these\n\nworrisome developments. We continue to call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire and cessation of hostilities.\n\nYour Excellencies, we have consistently acknowledged that military interventions on their own are not an absolute panacea to the security challenges besetting our sister country. Instead, it is important that we provide impetus to the peace process in line with our decisions.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the establishment of a political framework is a crucial enabler for the implementation of critical outstanding outcomes of the previous meetings.\n\nThere is, therefore, a need to initiate diplomatic and political engagement to facilitate the withdrawal of Sadc Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC) troops.\n\nAs we continue to engage, let us remain aware that the successful implementation of our joint efforts is encouraged by our collective resolve and commitment. It is incumbent upon us all, given the weighty responsibilities bestowed upon us, to demonstrate unity of purpose and the political will to deliver tangible results for the people of the DRC, he said.\n\nPresident Ruto commended DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame for having a direct engagement aimed at discussing the hostilities in eastern DRC. This followed a meeting held by the two in Qatar, facilitated by that countrys authorities.\n\nAllow me, Excellencies, also to commend and congratulate our two brothers, President Felix Tshisekedi and President Paul Kagame for the face-to-face engagement that they have had in the last few days.\n\nAgain, a clear demonstration on their part that they are equally committed to seeing to it that we resolve the matters in eastern DRC that affect our countries and our region, he said. President Ruto said the situation in eastern DRC continues to deteriorate.\n\nIt is, therefore, a source of concern, not just for DRC as a country, but all of us in the region, said President Ruto.\n\nHe noted that the conflict had resulted in the loss of life and displacement of people.And therefore, I want to thank all the Heads of State who have demonstrated their commitment by attending this virtual meeting. It is a confirmation that we are all concerned rightfully about the situation in our neighbourhood and all of us are taking steps to deal with that, he said.\n\nForeign Affairs and International Trade Minister Professor Amon Murwira, Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri\n\nFrom the Zimbabwean side, last nights meeting was attended by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Professor Amon Murwira, Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Barbra Rwodzi, Zimbabwe Defence Forces Commander, General Phillip Valerio Sibanda, and Deputy Chief Secretary in the Office of the President and Cabinet responsible for Presidential Communications, Mr George Charamba.\n\n",

As a result of this, the Groups dam water usage has increased significantly.\n\nMafuro Farming accounted for 44,74 percent of the groups total water usage.The group said it was working towards reducing its water usage rather than water consumption.One key approach to water conservation being implemented across the group is behavioural change, by making employees aware of the importance of conserving water and by businesses installing water-efficient faucets to reduce water usage.\n\nThe group has instigated a number of water conservation initiatives within its operating procedures to further reduce their water usage. AMP Meats, for example, has implemented a leak detection and repair system where, through regular monitoring, leaks can be identified on a daily basis.\n\nAt Profeeds condensate steam at the boilers points is reused as a water source while Irvines recycles 80cubic metres of water a day for cleaning crates. The Bakers Inns new plant in Bulawayo uses the latest technology for its cooling system and crate washing to minimise water usage.\n\nIt added that at The Buffalo Brewing Company (TBBC), through condensate recovery of over 70 percent and a reduced water consumption ratio by over 35 percent, TBBC strives to minimise its water usage.\n\n",

Initially, his uncle, John Khumalo, was appointed acting chief. However, earlier this year, Zanele was named regent chief by the Government to serve for nine years until Vusumuzis son, Wayne Makhosemvelo Khumalo, reached adulthood and assumed the position of substantive chief.\n\nA section of the Khumalo family has challenged Zaneles appointment in the High Court. Family spokesperson Mr Donald Khumalo, argued that their culture does not allow women to become chiefs, during a press briefing yesterday.\n\nMabhikwa family spokesperson Mr Donald Khumalo addresses journalists from different media houses during a press conference in Bulawayo yesterday\n\nHe claimed that the appointment of a female is unprecedented in their clan, arguing that only men are recognised as chiefs in their culture.\n\nMr Khumalo said Zaneles appointment undermines their traditions and accused a committee led by Chief Nkalakatha of imposing her against the familys wishes.\n\nThere is no place for a female chief in our culture, its unheard of. This is the first time we are hearing of a female chief in the Khumalo clan and to us, its an indication that our culture is slowly being eroded, he said.\n\nMr Khumalo also claimed that Zaneles marital status disqualifies her from leadership by virtue of being married into another family and raising her own children.\n\nEven our daughters, like our princess here MaKhumalo (Sibonokuhle) sitting next to me, understand that their culture doesnt allow them to take up the role of a chief in the Khumalo clan, he said.When we meet as the Khumalo men to discuss important issues women know and understand that its not in their place to sit in those meetings.\n\nDespite opposition from some family members, Zanele was publicly installed as regent chief on March 14 at a ceremony attended by hundreds in Jotsholo.\n\nSpeaking at the unveiling event in Jotsholo, Matabeleland North Provincial Council of Chiefs chairperson, Chief Siansali, explained that Zaneles appointment aligns with Nguni customs. He clarified that while Wayne Makhosemvelo is the substantive chief, his minority necessitated appointing a regent.\n\nAs you take up this role, understand that this is not an easy role. As a chief, you have to know that you no longer have the luxury of making jokes. Whatever statement you make will be taken seriously and people may ignore whatever issue of substance you say and focus on the perceived joke, said Chief Siansali.\n\nZanele is no stranger to the community, having grown up in Jotsholo before pursuing studies and employment in South Africa. She acknowledged the challenges ahead but expressed confidence in fulfilling her duties.\n\nZaneles appointment marks a major milestone for gender representation in traditional leadership. She joins two other female chiefs in Matabeleland. In 2020, Ms Silibaziso Mlotshwa, the daughter of the late Chief\n\nMvuthu of Matabeleland North Province, was appointed a chief.In Filabusi, Chief Ndube  born Nonhlanhla Sibanda, was appointed chief in 2007 when she was aged 22 years.\n\n",

If, as we hope, the project materialises, it will mean scores of local jobs, growth in incomes and improved standards of living for the community.\n\nAs most investments of this scale often do, we look forward to the company investing in new roads and other amenities or working with the Government to do so. We also expect Yuanlin to undertake corporate social responsibility investments as well  building new clinics and schools, expanding or equipping existing ones, improving food and water security and so on.\n\nAt a macro level, we see the project contributing to the attainment of national energy security after decades of shortages that are frustrating household and commercial consumers. Coal-based power plants are generally stable come rain, come drought. They just provide electricity round the clock, all year round.\n\nFor these reasons and more, we expect the ESIA to be carried out expeditiously, finding the project as not harmful to the ecology around it. In addition, we are hopeful that the project will be complementary, not harmful to its social setting. If any possible future challenges are identified, Yuanlin, the Government and the Binga community must find ways to go round them.\n\nThat is the function of an ESIA anyway, to thoroughly study the context around a proposed project, spot its possible adverse implications and craft strategies to address them as the project is implemented.But we feel it is very important for us to note the continuing role of Chinese companies in our economy, specifically in coal-based electricity generation.\n\nChinese companies built Hwange Units 7 and 8, are involved at Manhize and, as we indicated earlier, are involved at the Palm River Energy and Metallurgical Project.China also, was instrumental in expanding Kariba South, a hydropower facility.\n\nWe, as a country, would not have mobilised enough financial resources to execute the projects on our own without this very invaluable Chinese support.\n\nThe Kalungwizi project is yet another indication of the success of the Look East policy.We, thus look forward to the completion of the ESIA for the project to enter construction and operation stages so the people of Binga and the nation a large enjoy the benefits of the investment and the energy security it will engender.\n\n",

It was a really good contest. But now Nigeria, you see, its halfway through the campaign and Nigeria from the individual areas, from the names, its top class, absolutely top class, said Nees.\n\nAnd they messed their campaign at the beginning really up. Theres the third coach (Eric Chelle) now involved in this campaign. They have now won in Rwanda, which was for them. I think they are always a little bit difficult opponent, really.\n\nSo, they will come now with confidence and with all their power and all what they want to turn this campaign around. But so do we. It is going to be an exciting game. We have to perform to our maximum, for sure.\n\nWe can expect a real tough opponent giving everything. They must accept the challenge. But, we have to also give everything and we will.\n\nNees challenged the players to take up the challenge, the climate, the pace, the conditions.Nees said he has the quality in his ranks to help break the Nigerians.You mustnt be afraid of anything. Theres no reason for it. We can play football. We have analysed the opponent. We have analysed our game. The players give instructions and they can believe in themselves, added Nees.\n\nHe called on the boys to hold their nerves.They have showed it already many times that they are very good players, very good characters, and Im really looking forward to this game. That will be a real football match. I dont know how many spectators, but could be 30 000. I dont know, said Nees.\n\nNees could be making changes to the starting 11 from the previous encounter against Benin last Thursday.Walter Musona, an unused substitute in the tie against Benin, could finally get to line-up alongside his brother, Knowledge in an international match.\n\nKnowledge who has made a U-turn from a two-year retirement marked his comeback with a fine goal that ensured a share of the spoils against the Benin Cheetahs.\n\nBut he never got to be on the pitch with his younger brother Walter, a local football hero having won the Soccer Star of the Year prize twice inside the past three years.\n\nThe brothers might start the match as Walter looks very much in line to replace Khama Billiat who missed Sundays training session as he was down with a flu bout.\n\nTawanda Chirewa could also be drafted in for Prince Dube.\n\nProbable Line-UpWashington Arubi, Emmanuel Jalai, Divine Lunga, Munashe Garananga, Gerald Takwara, Marshal Munetsi, Andy Rinomhota, Jordan Zemura, Walter Musona, Tawanda Chirewa, Knowledge Musona\n\n",

            "content": "Lovemore Dube,[emailprotected]\n\nFORMER Black Rhinos, Caps United and Zimbabwe midfield general, Stix Mtizwa says their development was aided by having extremely talented players to emulate.\n\nMtizwa was for over a decade from 1979, among the best players in the local league. He won virtually everything that was there to play for and among his accomplishments were two league titles and on six occasions, he was on the Castle Lager calendar, among the countrys 11 best players at a time Zimbabwe was teeming with talent.\n\nTo have appeared so many times, is testament of his quality as a player at a time when Zimbabwe had dominant and exciting talents like Joel Shambo, Stanley Ndunduma, Madinda Ndlovu, David Mwanza, Moses Chunga, Boy Ndlovu, Mike Abrahams, Tito Paketh, Nkulumo Donga, Boyce Lunga, Kenneth Jere, Robert Godoka, Max Tshuma, Mercedes Sibanda, Willard Khumalo, Ephraim Chawanda, James Takavada, Gift Mpariwa, Oliver Kateya, Shaky Tauro and Charles Chirwa.\n\nHe was in the city on Saturday at the launch of the Jadel Football Academy Bulawayo Chapter.Mtizwa said he was inspired by a generation of great players. Growing up in Mbare, a stones throw from Rufaro Stadium and Zimbabwe grounds, all he could do when time allowed and there were three things available, a ball, a pitch of empty land and other boys was to play, among themselves.\n\nWe never got tired of playing football. We loved the game and passion drove us to spend hours on hours playing the game. We had several role models to emulate who had some special features that we valued a great deal, said Mtizwa.\n\nAmong his role models were George Shaya, Tymon Mabaleka and William Sibanda.Mabaleka and Sibanda were brilliant mid-fielders, very good on the ball and off it. Had good ball control, energy to run from box to box, dribbled very well and game intelligence of knowing when to exert their energies. George Shaya was a Mastermind a very good footballer, who we all envied and wished to scale his great heights. Several other good players around the country vowed audiences with their talents, said Mtizwa.\n\nHe said the youth club concept, which had him and his peers flock to Mai Musodzi Hall to try a hand at football with other sporting disciplines available, allowed peers to play informally, work on their skills before being identified for formal football activity with organised clubs like Black Aces and Dynamos.On the launch of the Jadel Academy, he said he came through junior development and that its essential in the development of talent.\n\nThe youth clubs that we grew up at, like Mai Musodzi in Mbare, were key in the development of talent. We came through this type of initiative (like Jadel Academy). At that time, we had Mai Musodzi and Stoddart Hall, here we have Mzilikazi (Thabiso Youth Centre) where Peter and the Ndlovu brothers came through.\n\nYouth clubs provided a number of disciplines, we would go there and spend the whole day, we did not have time to do something like drinking and drug abuse, said Mtizwa.\n\nCollin Nyambiya, who owns an academy that has been around for over a decade was also at the launch of the Jadel Academy, he said he had grown up in the same youth club concept where an unemployed volunteer assisted them.\n\n",

Its my favourite course in Bulawayo and I have always enjoyed playing here. Its a real test, especially the greens, especially when I dont have to fix the pitch-mark. Its so hard that I cant stop the ball quick enough. I really love this course, its one of my favourites, actually in Zimbabwe and every time I come here, I look forward to it. It feels quite good to win the Matabeleland Amateur. I know a couple of big names that have won this before, so to get my name on this trophy feels good, said Shutt.\n\nHe carded four-under-par-212 while second-placed Li shot two-under-par-214 after playing 54 holes.Once again, Shutt didnt have the best of starts as he shot three-over-par-75 in the first round. He then followed it up with a three-under-par-69 on round two on Saturday, which left him on level-par-144. In the third round, he carded a solid four-under-par-68 to leapfrog Li into the top of the leaderboard.\n\nLi, in his three rounds shot 69, 74 and 71.

I enjoyed playing with you guys and I hope to see you next time, she said as she received loud applause and cheers.\n\nMasiya also won the Manicaland Amateur ladies championship.Tilowakuti had a gross of 231 after shooting 79, 78 and 74. In third place there was Tracy Humbira on a 243 gross with scores of 79, 85 and 79.\n\nThe Matabeleland Amateur was the most talented field in recent events with juniors set to represent the country in Tunisia for the All Africa Juniors as well as national teams going to Botswana for Region Five Games taking to the greens.\n\nNext up on the calendar is the Masvingo Amateur, set for Masvingo Golf Club on April 5 and 6.  @brandon_malvin\n\n",
