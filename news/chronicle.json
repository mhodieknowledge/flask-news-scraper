There will be at the time a lot of travellers who will have to be processed through our ports of entry, he said.\n\nDiscussions on migration and border security that will unfold today will, without doubt, prepare us to deal with the influx of such a high volume of travellers. As we gather here today, we are reminded of the complexities and challenges of managing borders in the 21st century.\n\nThe world is becoming increasingly interconnected, and the movement of people, goods, and services across borders is on the rise. This presents both opportunities and challenges for the BMA and for our stakeholders.\n\nHe said the BMA primarily exists to secure South Africas borders and concurrently facilitate legitimate movement of people and goods in all ports of entry and border law enforcement areas.\n\nHe said he organisation was working in collaboration with Government departments including; Home Affairs, Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, South African Police Service (SAPS), the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), and the South African Revenue Service (SARS).\n\nContrary to what some people consider to be the functions of the BMA, Dr Masiapato said their function is not just about stamping passports at the ports of entry, but they play a crucial role in facilitating the smooth movement of people, goods, and services across borders while ensuring the safety and security of the country.\n\nSome of the key functions include managing environmental, port health, agriculture, immigration and general border law enforcement related issues, he said.\n\nWe have also screened millions of travellers who destined for South Africa in the last 24 months for infectious and communicable diseases (those we picked up with diseases have been referred to medical facilities for further medical attention) and have also confiscated a lot of undesirable Agricultural products and got them destroyed.\n\n",

The meeting really went on very well and exposed to all of us that Chief Mphini sold our grazing land we had jealously kept for more than 74 years. Now that it has been sold by an individual because of the love for money and personal gains, we are very angry and cross, reads the letter by villagers.\n\nThey said the matter must be pursued to their satisfaction and raised concern that officials seemed to be taking a lackadaisical approach while those allocated land were continuing with construction instead of being stopped.\n\nMr Ndebele promised to come back to us as soon as possible with the results or an outcome. It is now taking too long while the illegal settlers are still busy fast-tracking development, the delays in giving feedback is seen as an advantage given to them directly or indirectly. In this view we are requesting the promised feedback and a system that monitors that the illegal settlers stop building as was agreed on the above dated meeting, wrote the villagers.\n\nChief Mphini is on record denying that it was him who sold the land, claiming that it was the village heads.\n\nThis is an old story, something which was done by village heads. In any event, the area which people are complaining about was no longer used for pastures as the livestock are grazing at a nearby farm, Sibantubanye, said Chief Mphini.\n\nHe also claimed that Bulilima Rural District Council had targeted the same land for development as it was closer to their sub-office in the area.\n\nHowever, Bulilima RDC acting chief executive officer Mr Billiat Mlauzi, said the council is not involved in the allocation of land under dispute.\n\nAs council we are not involved, infact we are disappointed that the piece of land has been allocated to some villagers because it was part of our long-term plan as we expand but on this particular matter, we are no way near the allocation of the stands, said Mr Mlauzi.\n\n",
