            "content": "Lesley Chikudo,[emailprotected]\n\nA 34-year-old Bulawayo man who allegedly stole from his mother has been dragged to court facing theft charges.\n\nMatthew Mutobaya, from Nketa suburb, appeared before Western Commonage Magistrate Mr Mehluli Moyo, who remanded him in custody to 27 January.\n\nHe is being charged with two counts of theft. Prosecutor Mrs Ellen Matenga said the first count occurred on 24 December 2024 when Mutobaya allegedly stole a DSTV decoder and sold it.\n\nThe offence is alleged to have occurred around 4pm when Mutobaya was sitting in the sitting room and his mother, Mrs Irene Mutobaya, was in her bedroom folding her clothes.\n\nThat is when she noticed that there was no longer any noise in the sitting room. She then went to check and noticed that the accused was no longer in the house, and the decoder was missing, said Mrs Matenga.\n\nAs for the other count, Mrs Matenga told the court that on 29 December 2024, Mutobaya went into his mothers bedroom, took a trunk claiming it was his, and sold it.\n\nTestifying in court, Mrs Mutobaya said that on the day in question, Mutobaya was pacing up and down in the sitting room while insulting and harassing her.\n\nHe was pacing up and down in the sitting room, and I asked him why he was doing that. He did not give me a proper answer; instead, he started to harass and insult me. I then went into my bedroom to do my chores, and after a few minutes, the noise in the sitting room had stopped. The television was no longer producing any sound. Thats when I decided to go and check what was happening, she said.\n\nMrs Mutobaya told the court that when she entered the sitting room, she found the television off and the accused was no longer in the house. She then noticed that the decoder was missing.\n\nFor the other count, she found her trunk missing in the house and was told that it had been taken by Mutobaya.\n\nIn his defence, Mutobaya pleaded not guilty to the first count but admitted to taking the trunk, claiming it was a gift from his cousin.\n\nI did not steal the decoder. I suspect that my mother might have taken the decoder and hidden it away from me so that I would not make noise in the house. As for the trunk, I did take it, as it belonged to me. I never thought I would be accused of stealing it as it was a gift from my cousin, he said.\n\n",

We expect management and councillors to work together in collaboration, and councillors should maintain constant communication with the electorate by engaging residents on ongoing developments while providing regular feedback, said Mr Moyo.\n\nConcerns are often raised about office-bearers distancing themselves from the electorate after being ushered into office, only reconnecting during election time.\n\nMr Moyo urged councillors to familiarise themselves with the Urban Councils Act to ensure they make informed resolutions and effectively represent the interests of the residents who elected them.\n\nHe said that during the course of the year, the local authority should focus mainly on water and sewer reticulation, refuse collection, drainage, and other services.\n\nThe council submitted its US$22 million 2025 budget after revising it to include the 7 percent for sports facilities as directed by the Government.\n\nMr Moyo said residents were hopeful that their contributions during the budget-making process were considered in the financial statement.\n\nWe hope that the council took into consideration the contributions made by residents. We always support a participatory approach where residents are given room to speak about the actual needs of the community, like water-logging and flooding in Mkhosana.\n\nThe council management should guide councillors in coming up with a budget that includes the residents. Our wish is that they quickly address the issue of estimated water bills, which has been a persistent source of frustration for residents. We expect the perennial water problems plaguing the city to be addressed, he said.\n\nThe city is already constructing underground and elevated water reservoirs in Mkhosana after investing US$4 million into the water, sanitation, and hygiene project.\n\nMr Moyo commended the local authority for its efficient refuse collection, which has helped keep the city in its pristine state.\n\n",
