We do not bid him farewell, but we mourn and celebrate his life, history, and achievements, he said.\n\nNamibias Vice President and President-elect, Dr Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, emphasised the importance of staying true to the ideals of Namibias liberation, a cause to which Dr Nujoma dedicated his life.\n\nDr Nujomas successor and Namibias second President, Dr Hifikepunye Pohamba, said he was privileged to have worked closely with the liberation icon for 63 years, both in exile and after independence.\n\nDr Nujoma held the people together, and indeed history was achieved, Namibia was free, he said.The late Dr Sam Nujomas eldest child, Unoti Nujoma, who is Namibias Minister of Labour, Industrial Relations and Employment Creation, described his fathers legacy as one of unity, not just within Namibia but across the African continent.\n\nNamibian Member of Parliament and leader of the Official Opposition McHenry Venaani praised Dr Nujomas unparalleled leadership, describing him as not just a leader but a master tactician in the field.\n\nThe memorial service was attended by former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, former DRC President Joseph Kabila, former first lady Grace Mugabe and dignitaries from various countries, including Cuba, the Netherlands and the European Union among others.The late Dr Nujomas body lay in state at the Independence Stadium ahead of his burial at Namibias National Heroes Acre today.\n\n",
