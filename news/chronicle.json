They could possibly stagger movement and upon reaching the border we have marshals directing them to various terminals where they will get customised services depending on their needs.\n\n",

We have made adequate arrangements for the safety and security of Independence commemorations at national, provincial and district levels, said Commissioner-General Mutamba.\n\nIn a clear message to pirate taxi operators (commonly known asmushikashika) and unlicensed buses, the Police Chief declared that such vehicles would not be allowed to pass through roadblocks and checkpoints during the holiday period.\n\nPolice commanders across the country have been instructed to take strong action against unlicensed buses and pirate taxis that operate without the required licenses or permits. Unroadworthy and defective vehicles will be impounded, and any driver found to be under the influence of alcohol will be arrested, he said.\n\nThe ZRP also emphasized that its current blitz on drug dealers and users will continue without let-up. Commissioner-General Mutamba called on communities to assist law enforcement by reporting known drug bases and suppliers.\n\nThe public is encouraged to report any drug-related activities. The police will not relent in bringing to book drug barons, suppliers, and users, he said.\n\nParents were also urged to closely monitor school children during the holidays to prevent them from falling victim to drug and substance abuse, which has become a growing concern nationwide.\n\nPolice have pledged to ensure all liquor outlets comply with the Liquor Act Chapter 14:12, warning that unlicensed bars and shebeens will be shut down and operators prosecuted.\n\nLicensed liquor outlets must adhere to stipulated operating times. Unlicensed operations will be closed and offenders arrested, he said.\n\nCautioning against the rising cases of robbery, Commissioner-General Mutamba advised the public not to carry large sums of money or store cash at home or business premises.\n\nCompanies must safeguard sensitive financial information and avoid sharing such details with all employees, as this can lead to inside jobs, he added.\n\nThe ZRP is set to intensify stop-and-search operations, traffic patrols, and public awareness campaigns across all provinces to combat crimes including armed robbery, rape, murder, and stock theft.\n\nAs the holidays approach, the police are calling on all citizens to act responsibly, cooperate with law enforcement, and report any suspicious or criminal activities through the ZRP National Complaints Desk on(0242) 703631or via WhatsApp on0712 800 197.\n\nMay I take this opportunity to wish all Zimbabweans and our esteemed visitors a blessed, crime and accident-free 2025 Easter and Independence Holidays, said Commissioner-General Mutamba.\n\n",
