            "content": "VUSUMUZI DUBE,[emailprotected]\n\nHIGHLANDERS, Bulawayos iconic football giants, are a year away from their centenary. Hopes for a celebratory season were briefly dashed when FIFA slapped them with a transfer ban for unpaid wages to former coach Baltemar Brito and his assistant. Brito was owed US$14,778 plus interest, and Torres US$11,788 plus interest, both accruing further penalties.\n\nJust when it seemed Bosso faced a prolonged crisis, socialite Wicknell Chivayo stepped in, paying off the debts in full. While this saved the clubs blushes, it exposed worrying questions about financial management. The debt was notably absent from discussions at last months AGM, leaving fans in the dark.\n\nWicknell Chivayo\n\nClub chairman Kenneth Mhlophe said they were relying on sponsors to resolve the issue before FIFAs punishment, but the near miss has raised serious concerns about transparency as Bosso approaches its 100th year.\n\nWe engaged our sponsors over the issue. Going into the annual general meeting week, all appeared in place for the debt to have been paid, and we counted on their usual support, Mhlophe said.\n\nMhlophe deflected criticism by blaming his predecessor, Johnfat Sibanda, for the stalled Inyathi gold mining venture. The project, intended to generate club revenue, reportedly made no progress under Sibandas leadership.\n\nThere was no action at all on the mining venture. Things were still as I had left them, and we then began to chase paperwork. As we speak, the papers have been lodged with the Ministry of Mines. Once they respond, we will be fine, Mhlophe said.\n\nBossos crisis has sparked scrutiny of Mhlophe and Sibandas leadership. Fans and stakeholders are comparing their tenures, achievements, and failures. This week, Saturday Chronicle will analyse their impact on the club.\n\nJohnfat Sibanda\n\nSibanda took over the reins of Highlanders Football Club in March 2021, after defeating Kenneth Mhlophe in a closely contested election. His tenure was marked by high expectations, as he campaigned on a platform of change, accountability, and financial stability for the club.\n\nHits:\n\nSecured Sakunda sponsorship\n\nSibanda secured a lucrative Sakunda sponsorship, providing US$420,000 for player salaries, US$60,000 each for sign-on fees and operational expenses, a potential US$200,000 league-winning bonus, and Ford Everest and Ranger vehicles for the coach and captain.\n\nAvailed replica jerseys for fans\n\nThrough sponsorship from Sakunda, replica shirts were available in three colours for Bosso fans to purchase.\n\nBrought in Brito\n\nSibanda hired foreign coach Baltemar Jos de Oliveira Brito, who nearly won the league, and brought in Joel Luphahla as assistant, with a succession plan. Luphahla later left, finding success at Dynamos and now coaching Simba Bhora.\n\nRenovation of the Highlanders Clubhouse\n\nThe Highlanders Clubhouse had gone for years without any notable renovations; it was now an eyesore, with non-functioning toilets, broken furniture, and everything in a state of disrepair. However, Sibandas administration secured a partnership deal with local businessman Phathisani Nkomo to modernise the clubhouse. This has made it a popular venue for Bosso fans after matches.\n\nBrought some cup glory to Highlanders\n\nDuring his tenure, Sibanda saw the team win the Independence Cup in 2022 and 2023.\n\nRevenue generation through the selling of players\n\nHe sold Daniel Msendami and Nqobizitha Masuku to Jwaneng Galaxy, thereby generating much-needed revenue for the club.\n\nMisses\n\nFailure to strengthen the squad, despite interest from players like Kuda Mahachi and Bruce Kangwa, resulted in a goal drought (just 24 goals) and cost Highlanders the league title. The championship remained elusive.\n\nFailure to produce audited results\n\nHe failed to produce audited accounts for the 2023 AGM, something that had not happened at the club in years. This eroded the trust of potential sponsors.\n\nFailed to get the clubs mining project in Inyathi off the ground\n\nHighlanders Inyathi gold mine claim, awarded in 2020 by President Mnangagwa, saw little development under Sibanda, despite plans to use proceeds for facilities and junior teams. A designated mine manager made no progress.\n\nInternal Divisions\n\nSibandas leadership was also marred by internal divisions within the clubs structures. Reports of factionalism and disagreements with board members occasionally surfaced, undermining his ability to lead effectively.\n\nKenneth Mhlophe\n\nMhlophe, the current chairperson, is no stranger to the Highlanders community, having previously served as the clubs chair from 2018 to 2021 before losing to Sibanda. His return to the helm of the club was seen as an opportunity to build on his earlier tenure and address lingering issues.\n\nHits:\n\nSecured more sponsorship for Highlanders\n\nMhlophe continued the Sakunda deal and secured a Better Brands sponsorship from Pedzai Scott Sakupwanya. Sakunda remained the main sponsor, while Better Brands covered costs for the Highlanders Academy (including all junior teams and the womens team, Highlanders Royals), paying staff and players.\n\nInfrastructure Development\n\nDuring his earlier tenure, Mhlophe initiated plans to renovate the clubs facilities, including the training grounds and the clubhouse. These efforts have continued in his current term, reflecting his commitment to improving the clubs infrastructure.\n\nImproved relations with fans\n\nMhlophe has worked tirelessly to restore trust and goodwill between the club and its fan base. Through community outreach efforts and fan engagement programmes, he sought to re-establish Highlanders as the peoples team. Last year, they held a successful fundraising initiative that was well-supported by both local and international fans.\n\nMisses:\n\nLimited success on the field\n\nDespite the perceived financial stability and structural improvements, Highlanders have yet to translate these gains into major success on the pitch. The club has not won the league title since 2006, and fans are growing increasingly impatient as the wait for a championship continues. In 2024, Highlanders failed to retain the Independence Trophy, were knocked out of the Chibuku Super Cup via a boardroom decision, and finished sixth in the league.\n\nFIFA ban after failing to pay former coaches outstanding salaries\n\nThe biggest failure that has marred his leadership was the FIFA ban on registering new players after they failed to pay their former coaches. What makes this a greater stain on his tenure is the manner in which he hid this from the clubs membership during their AGM. A question on everyones mind is how many skeletons in their closet were not revealed to its membership; what else is Mhlophe and his executive hiding?\n\nFailure to negotiate meaningful contracts with players\n\nHighlanders continue to lose players on free transfers due to poor contract negotiations. Under Mhlophe, Marvelous Chigumira, Godfrey Makaruse, Peter Muduhwa, Lynoth Chikuhwa, and several juniors left for free after their contracts expired. This costly mismanagement, despite a prior AGM resolution against it, forces the team to rebuild without transfer revenue.\n\nLynoth Chikuhwa\n\nLack of a clear plan to help finance the club\n\nMhlophes corporate experience hasnt translated into success for Highlanders. The club remains financially unstable, reliant on handouts, and lacks a clear survival plan. Proactive leadership is absent; Mhlophe mainly reacts to problems. The long-promised mining venture offers little immediate hope.\n\nFailure to provide replica jerseys\n\nLast season, fans made do with purchasing replica jerseys from the streets. The club continuously promised that the replicas were coming in a few weeks right up to the last game. We are now in 2025, and no sign of the replicas. Mhlophe has no plan at all on how he will counter the sale of these replicas on the streets. All that the club provided were woollen hats and scarves, which ironically were released during the summer season.\n\nNo movement in the transfer market\n\nIt is clear to all that Highlanders need to boost its squad, but a few weeks before the season starts, there is little or no movement on the transfer market. Other teams are busy bolstering their squad, but Mhlophe and his team are just silent. We will just give them the benefit of the doubt; maybe they are preparing to unleash a secret weapon that will once again bring smiles to its legion of fans.\n\nLast word\n\nUltimately, Highlanders remain in a rebuilding phase, and the true measure of any chairpersons success will be the clubs ability to reclaim its status as a dominant force in Zimbabwean football. Both leaders have contributed to the clubs journey in different ways, and their legacies will hinge on whether the foundation they have laid can lead to sustained success in the future.\n\n",
