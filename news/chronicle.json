Thats despite the himonly taking charge in November.\n\nAmorim, 39, reportedly lost his temper during a critique of his players dire performance, later labelling themmaybe the worst team in Uniteds historyduring his post-match press conference. Theex-Sporting Lisbonboss, as first reported byThe Athletic, vented his anger towards his players, in a marked change from his usual approach of staying silent until the next day.\n\nIts been claimed by the publication that the TV, which used for tactics before kick-off and at half-time, will need to be fixed  and quickly. Its understood, however, that the repairs will be completed in time for the Red DevilsEuropa Leagueclash withRangersat Old Trafford on Thursday.\n\nAmorims fury was particularly striking to those inside the dressing room because the Portuguese coach usually doesnt say a word immediately after matches. Uniteds players have experienced angry managers before but the 39-year-olds reaction to the loss stood out.\n\nIn [the past] 10 games in Premier League, we won two, Amorim told reporters following his alleged rant. Imagine what this is for a fan ofManchester United. Imagine what this is for me. We are getting a new coach who is losing more than the last coach. I have full knowledge of that.\n\nWe are the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you [the media] want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go: your headlines.\n\nFormerLiverpooldefenderJamie Carragherwas stunned by Amorims comments, describing them as bizarre and ridiculous. It was one of the most bizarre and ridiculous things Ive ever heard a manager say, Carragher said onMonday Night Football. Why you would make a comment like that?\n\nRuben Amorim damaged a big screen TV( Image:Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)\n\nThats the type of comment a pundit would make, someone in my position, and youd have to defend that. I dont know what he gains from that, what the benefit is. We all know its a poor Man United team. Theyd lost another game at home to Brighton, theyd done that in the last couple of years anyway.\n\nWe know its a tough season, we know its a poor team. He has just loosened it up. That will be a quote that follows him for the rest of the season. He said to the journalists there, Ill give you your headline. Why you would like to do that as a manager, Ill never know.\n\nUniteds players are still struggling to get to grips with Amorims 3-4-2-1 formation, a system which hes married to after successfully using it with former clubsBragaand Lisbon. Their two best performances came earlier this month, drawing with both Liverpool andArsenal the latter of whom they beat on penalties  away from home when they notably surrendered possession.\n\nI knew it was going to be hard to put in a completely new idea in the moment, Amorim explained. But when you lose games, you dont have that luck to win three games in a row, its becoming really hard. Thats why Im telling [you] we are going to suffer because Im going to continue to do the same.\n\nManchester United were beaten 3-1 by Brighton last weekend(Image: AP)\n\nTo help my players is to give them the tools to play this way, but, without training, it is really hard. Then, without training and losing games. You could feel it in the end of the game, everybody was changing position, and that is something I will not see again. We can lose, but we will not change position.\n\n",
