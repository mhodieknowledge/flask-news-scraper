Under a thicket of vegetation, a resident spotted a small leg protruding from the bushes and immediately alerted the search party.\n\nThe boys lifeless body was found a short distance from where he was last seen, hours after he had gone missing while in the company of his eight-year-old brother. A group of about nine men carefully retrieved the body, while news of the tragic discovery spread through the suburb.\n\nPolice were called to the scene and later transported the body to Mpilo Central Hospital for a post-mortem examination.\n\nWe abandoned the search last night around 10 PM as it was too dark to continue. As early as 6 am this morning, we resumed our efforts. We agreed that the childs body couldnt have been carried too far by the water, so we focused our search within a confined area, said Mr Love Dube, a resident and member of the Bulawayo Progressive Residents Association.\n\nAnother resident, Mr John Oka, said the body was discovered near the confluence of two small streams before the water flowed into a large storm drain pipe.\n\nWe feared that he might have been carried into the massive storm drain pipe under Luveve Road, but it seems his body was trapped in thick vegetation along the streams banks, said Mr Oka.Residents said the tragic incident started when the young boy and his older brother had been sent to a local tuck shop by their mother. When heavy rains began to fall, they sought shelter.However, on their way home, the younger child was swept away by the sudden flash floods. His older brother rushed home to alert their mother, prompting residents to launch an urgent search operation, said a resident.\n\n",

MSD head of forecasting, Mr James Ngoma, said they were still collecting data from other monitoring stations but expressed surprise at the extent of the floodingWe are still getting statistics from other stations but the rains were insignificant to have caused such flooding in suburbs like Pumula, said Mr Ngoma.The floods left a family in New Lobengula devastated after their young child was swept away by the torrents. The childs lifeless body was discovered a few metres away along Luveve Road, near Josiah Chinamano Primary School.In Entumbane, some residents faced the distressing sight of water flooding their homes. Authorities expressed concern that some residents were refusing to open weeping holes in their perimeter walls, defying council by-laws designed to facilitate better drainage.Meanwhile, a heavy downpour near Nyamande Primary School in Old Lobengula resulted in severe flooding on the road connecting to Njube suburb. The rising waters caused mechanical failures in several vehicles, leaving some motorists stranded in the waterlogged streets.Flash floods occur due to a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, saturated soil, and urban infrastructure that limits water absorption. Some of the key contributors to such flooding include: Heavy Rainfall: Intense rains overwhelm the grounds ability to absorb water, leading to rapid runoff and localised flooding. Saturated Soil: When the soil is already waterlogged, additional rainfall cannot be absorbed, increasing surface runoff. Impermeable Surfaces: Urban areas with extensive paved roads and buildings reduce natural water absorption, worsening flood risks. Topography: Low-lying areas and steep slopes accelerate water flow and accumulation in certain locations. Poor Drainage Systems: Blocked or inadequate drainage can lead to standing water and increased flood damage. Environmental Factors: Areas affected by wildfires or deforestation become more prone to flash flooding due to reduced vegetation that would typically help absorb rainwater.\n\n",

            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza,[emailprotected]\n\nTHIEVES broke into a Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) sub-station housed at Mpilo Hospital on Monday night and stole infrastructure used to supply power to the referral hospital, forcing the medical institution to turn to diesel-powered generators.\n\nThe latest incident of theft and vandalism of electricity cables and infrastructure supplying power to Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo is part of a growing problem that the health institution has been facing for the last couple of months.\n\nThe vandalism of power infrastructure at Mpilo continues to place immense strain on the hospitals operations.\n\nMpilo public relations officer Mrs Noma Mabhena confirmed the latest theft incident.\n\nMpilo Hospital recorded yet another case of theft and vandalism on the hospitals power infrastructure. The rising cases of cable theft and vandalism are a major concern for the hospital. A police report was made at the local Zimbabwe Republic Police base located within the hospital premises, said Mrs Mabhena.\n\nLast week, Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube expressed her deep distress over the situation.\n\nThis situation is incredibly alarming, Minister Ncube said. I was informed that Mpilo Central Hospital had no electricity for two days due to the stolen cables. Hospital staff warned that critical operations, including surgeries, could be disrupted or delayed, leading to the potential loss of lives.\n\nThe frequent power cuts have put immense pressure on the hospitals backup generators, which are now being used as the primary power source. The situation has significantly increased operational costs, particularly with the rising price of diesel.\n\nWe have 10 generators, all meant to serve as backup power sources in emergencies, said Mr Phineas Sithole, the hospitals Director of Operations.\n\nHowever, due to the constant power outages, we are now relying on them for our daily operations, which is financially unsustainable. These generators consume about 300 litres of diesel each per day, which adds up to 3,000 litres daily, costing us nearly US$4,800 every day.\n\nMr Sithole added that while the hospital also has a solar power system in place as part of the Solar for Health initiative, the full integration of solar power into the hospitals main grid has not yet been completed. The solar system currently only supports the hospitals laboratories.\n\nThe theft and vandalism of electricity infrastructure is a growing problem in Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) reported over US$2 million in losses from cable theft and vandalism between January and October last year alone. Copper conductors, transformers, and high-voltage pylons have been frequent targets, with criminals causing widespread disruptions to power supply and economic activity.\n\nDespite government measures imposing a minimum jail term of 10 years for cable theft, the crime continues to plague the country. ZESA statistics show that nearly 30 tonnes of copper conductors, worth US$600,000, were stolen, along with 10 tonnes of aluminium conductors valued at over US$100,000. In addition, over 1,500 litres of transformer oil were siphoned, and 136 transformers were vandalised, causing losses exceeding US$840,000.\n\nWhile the authorities have made efforts to address the problem, with 76 arrests and 24 convictions, the persistence of cable theft and vandalism continues to threaten lives and vital services, including healthcare. The ongoing situation at Mpilo Central Hospital is a stark reminder of the dangers posed by these criminal activities.\n\n",
