They were each granted ZWG6 000 bail and remanded to February 12.\n\nThey are being represented by Mr Tinashe Runganga of Tanaka Law Chambers\n\nThe prosecutor Mr Dominic Moyo, said the accused broke into the ZETDC Glenville substation in Richmond suburb at around 8pm on January 25. They allegedly used a ladder to gain entry before employing a hacksaw and bolt cutter to cut the cables.\n\nOnce inside, they used a hacksaw and bolt cutter to remove 60 metres of 185mm-squared, three-core armoured copper cable, which was used to distribute electricity to Richmond suburb, said Mr Moyo.\n\nThe case came to light when Ntonga and Chamhudze were caught with 92kg of copper, leading to an additional charge of possessing copper cables without a licence. Their arrest led to a full scale investigation, which resulted in the arrest of the other accused persons.\n\nPolice later discovered burnt armoured copper cables inside a Toyota Hilux driven by Ntonga and Chamhudze. A ZETDC engineer confirmed that the stolen cables were essential for electricity distribution.\n\nThe total value of the stolen and burnt cables was US$283 000. Upon their arrests, police recovered overhead copper cables, a makeshift ladder, bolt cutter and Toyota Hilux used in the alleged crime.\n\n",

I am honoured to make a difference in the lives of those who often face significant barriers.\n\nLe Roux said the learnership programmes are designed to provide pathways to dignity, independence and economic participation for people who struggle to access education and employment due to their disabilities.\n\nThe initiative is a step towards a more inclusive society where everyone, regardless of their abilities, has access to opportunities to succeed. Our purpose is to change lives, she said.\n\nThe pilot programme for the partnership kicked off in October last year, and successfully facilitated 120 learnerships.\n\nToday we are officially launching our first public learnership application campaign. Application tour opened on February 1 and closes on February 28.\n\nLe Roux also outlined the application requirements: You need to apply with a motivation letter explaining why you should be chosen, that you have South African citizenship, are in the age range of 18 to 45, have completed grade 10, the ability to read and write in English, and a doctors letter confirming your disability.\n\nOn successful completion of the programme, all learners will receive an NQF 2-5 accredited qualification, making them employable in a wide range of industries from business administration to sales.\n\nI cant wait to walk this journey with you, said Le Roux.\n\n TimesLive\n\n",

More than 223,000 fans attended the show across the two nights.\n\nA fan who attended Coldplays concert in Ahmedabad told us the record-breaking show was mesmerizing. She described the atmosphere as being a conduit to experiencing the bands music meaningfully.\n\nThe stadium is massive and you really feel like a little speck when youre in there, she told us. [That] worked out really well with their setlist because a lot of songs require you to be in a mindset where youre one with the crowd.\n\nWhen the band started playing Human Heart , the sixth song on the Music of the Spheres album, a couple shared their wholesome proposal.\n\nIts an incredibly moving song, the fan told us. Both of them had rings for each other because they had both planned to propose on the same day which was very sweet.\n\nThe tour commenced in March 2022 with a show in Costa Rica, marking Coldplays first ever show in the country. The bands next show will take place in April in Hong Kong, followed by Seoul before heading to the United States.\n\nPlaying live and finding connection with people is ultimately why we exist as a band, the group said when they announced the tour. Weve been planning this tour for years, and were super excited to play songs from across our whole time together.\n\nThe Music of the Spheres album came out in 2021 and was a UK Number 1 album within two weeks of its release.\n\nColdplays latest tour adds itself to the lists of some extraordinary concerts that have claimed Guinness World Records titles. To list a few, Outside Lands broke the record for highest-grossing music concert in 2019 and in 2010, Bon Jovis Circle Tour set the record for the most expensive concert VIP packageThough Music of the Spheres is the second-highest grossing tour after the Eras Tour, Coldplay will be performing through September.
