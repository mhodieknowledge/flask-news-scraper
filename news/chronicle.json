The South African government stated that any further attacks on its troops would be regarded as a declaration of war.\n\nIn a swift rebuttal, Rwandas President Kagame accused South Africa of acting as part of a belligerent force.\n\nHe claimed that South African troops were engaged in offensive combat operations to support the Congolese government in its fight against its own citizens.\n\nResultantly, tensions were high before last weeks SADC Summit in Harare, which mandated its Organ Troika on Politics, Defence and Security Co-operation to engage all state and non-state parties to the conflict on a ceasefire process to protect lives and facilitate a smooth flow of humanitarian support to people and communities affected by the armed conflict.\n\nThe Summit also urged Political and Diplomatic leaders who are parties to the conflict to engage in a co-ordinated effort of dialogue, including supporting the Luanda Process, Monusco and others, to restore peace and security in eastern DRC.\n\nSADC leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to the DRCs sovereignty, territorial integrity and long-term stability, pledging ongoing support for its development and security.\n\nLast week, the African Unions Peace and Security Council (PSC) at its 1256th Emergency Ministerial meeting on the Recent Developments in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), condemned the DRC conflict and called for adherence to the Luanda Process.\n\nUnder the Luanda Process, Angolan President Joo Manuel Gonalves Loureno has tried to broker peace between DRC President Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart, Kagame.\n\nSuch talks have, however, remained elusive, amid escalatory rhetoric and trading of accusations between the two leaders.\n\nThus, the summit, which will be held in Tanzania, offers a platform for both President Tshisekedi and President Kagame to meet directly with mediation from SADC and the EAC.\n\n",

            "content": "Ashley Phiri,[emailprotected]\n\nTHE Civil Registry Department has launched a mobile registration exercise targeting vulnerable children and child-headed families in St Peters, Robert Sinyoka, and Methodist Village in Ward 17, on the outskirts of Bulawayo.\n\nThe 10-day exercise, which commenced yesterday and will run until February 13, is in response to appeals made by residents during last years hearings conducted by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Defence, Home Affairs, Security Services and War Veterans Affairs. The hearings revealed that many residents in peri-urban areas lacked essential documentation, which hindered their access to education, healthcare and other social services.\n\nFor many undocumented children, the issue is generational, as their parents and grandparents also lack birth certificates and identity cards. Several families in these areas relocated from the Killarney squatter camp, where their documents were lost or destroyed.\n\nOn the first day of the exercise, teams from the Civil Registry Department set up at St Peters Primary School, where they identified 86 learners without birth certificates. These children are now being assisted in securing proper documentation, a move expected to empower them and their families by granting them access to their legal rights.\n\nPumula legislator, Ms Sichelesile Mahlangu, expressed gratitude to the Civil Registry Department and the Government for facilitating this critical initiative.\n\nThis registration drive is a direct response to the concerns raised by residents during public hearings last year. The people spoke, we listened, and we engaged the relevant authorities. We are grateful to the Civil Registry Department for responding to the call and coming to assist these communities, she said.\n\nMs Mahlangu noted that many of the affected children are orphans living with their grandparents or are part of child-headed households.\n\nThe response has been overwhelming, especially from child-headed families who often struggle with administrative hurdles. Many of these minors take on adult responsibilities at a young age and face challenges in providing for their siblings without proper identification documents, she said.\n\nMs Mahlangu said she is optimistic that at the end of the registration blitz, hundreds of children and families would have received critical identification documents, enabling them to access essential services and opportunities.\n\nSt Peters Village chairperson, Mr Reginald Mkhosana, welcomed the initiative, saying the documentation crisis has long plagued their community.\n\nIn our area, the lack of documentation is a major issue, particularly for child-headed families whose parents did not have documents themselves. We are grateful that the Government has not forgotten us and has taken steps to address this problem, he said.\n\nBeyond providing documentation, the mobile registration drive underscores the importance of inclusive governance and community support. Over the next several days, Civil Registry officials will be stationed at various locations to facilitate the registration process.\n\nThe teams will be at St Peters Primary School until Friday before moving to Robert Sinyoka Primary School on Saturday until next Monday.\n\nThey will then wrap up the exercise at Hyde Park Primary School from Tuesday to Thursday next week.\n\n",

            "content": "Sikhulekelani Moyo,[emailprotected]\n\nRESERVE Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has announced that it will widen its ongoing blitz on businesses across the country, defying the Government directive to accept the use of multicurrency, which also includes embracing the local currency, the ZiG, as a legal tender at the official rate when pricing products.\n\nThe operation, which was hitherto confined to Harare and its environs, will be extended to other provinces during the first quarter of the year as part of enforcing financial laws.\n\nThis comes at a time when some businesses in Bulawayo among other cities and towns, continue to defy Government directives to accept ZiG as the legal tender, with the informal sector, continuing to give flimsy excuses, among them network hurdles on their point-of-sale (POS) machines, forcing consumers to use foreign currency.\n\nZimbabwe Gold\n\nThe Statutory Instrument (SI) 81A of 2024, promulgated by the Government after the successful launch of the structured currency in April last year, compels businesses to use the official exchange rate when pricing products.\n\nAlso, in 2022, the Government gazetted SI 218 of 2023, which effectively extends the use of the multiple currency system to December 2030.\n\nHowever, regardless of all these statutory instruments, some businesses continue to frustrate consumers as they refuse to accept the local currency, with some businesses opting to accept it using the black-market rate, which erodes consumers purchasing power.\n\nIn an interview, RBZ Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu said when the Government enacts policies, it expects businesses and the general public to comply with the regulations.\n\nOn the financial side, these policies are enforced by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and other Government units that have instruments to deal with such malpractices.\n\nIt should be noted that FIU monitoring and compliance operations have hitherto been concentrated in Harare and its environs, but beginning the first quarter of 2025, the FIU is expanding its enforcement operations into Bulawayo and other provincial capital cities, said Dr Mushayavanhu.\n\nSome of the measures include heavy penalties for organisations that violate the exchange control regulations, and this will greatly improve compliance across the board. The FIU continues to urge the public to report issues of non-compliance, and they will swiftly respond as necessary.\n\nDr Mushayavanhu said in promoting compliance, efforts by the FIU are beginning to bear fruit as some areas witness increasing levels of compliance in the smaller shops that are now accepting the local currency.\n\nCompliance is a confidence issue, and the RBZ continues to refine its monetary policy to achieve and maintain price and exchange rate stability, and confidence will be restored in the transacting public, he said.\n\nRBZ\n\nDr Mushayavanhu noted that while the informal sector compliance levels are still far below the formal sector, it is encouraging to note that the trend is improving.\n\nThe Government is working towards increasing usage of local currency in all parts of the country including for settlement of taxes, purchase and sale of goods and services in local currency.\n\nIt is, however, important to take cognisance of the increased reliance on digital or electronic payment methods over cash, which has, to an extent, seen a reduction in the demand for cash and resultantly lower the proportion of cash in circulation to broad money, he said.\n\nDr Mushayavanhu said the foreign exchange market has been liberalised to reflect free market forces, adding that there should be no incentive for trading on the parallel market.\n\nIt has been noted that cases of exchange control-related violations have significantly declined over the last quarter of 2024, aligning with the exchange rate stability that has been obtained, he said.\n\nRBZ will continue to implement measures to augment the current stability and will remain mindful of balancing currency and price stability with economic growth.\n\nConsumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) director, Mrs Rose Mpofu, said the refusal by some shops to accept ZWG as legal tender is an offence as it violates consumers right to choose currencies to use.\n\nConsumer Council of Zimbabwe\n\nConsumers that are formally employed, especially those in the public sector, earning a portion of their incomes in the local currency are disadvantaged. It creates a huge demand and appetite for foreign currency thus pushing the alternative market rate high, and creating a lucrative market for the US dollar in the informal sector, she said.\n\nMrs Mpofu said the Government should build market confidence in ZiG acceptance by businesses, urging consumers to report any business unethical tendencies.\n\nIn a snap survey yesterday, the Chronicle news crew observed that some businesses in Bulawayo were refusing to accept the ZiG.\n\nWe are not accepting ZiG because our suppliers are refusing transactions in local currency, which makes it difficult for us to trade in ZiG, said an informal trader operating at the market\n\nSome selected foreign-owned shops and informal shops visited by the news crew in the city centre had displayed an exchange rate of US$1:28 ZWG, purportedly indicating that they accepted ZiG transactions.\n\nHowever, they had no POS machines preferring cash.\n\nConfederation of Zimbabwe Industries President Mr Denford Mutashu said it is illegal for retailers not to comply with exchange regulations.\n\nHowever, while most major retrial outlets are complying by accepting the ZiG, unfortunately, some have found the going tougher due to unfair competition from the informal shops, said Mr Mutashu.\n\n@SikhulekelaniM\n\n",

Communities then decide on development projects they want executed.\n\nWe remember the big names  Mhondoro-Ngezi CSOS,which is supported by Zimplats, Marange-Zimunya CSOS, which is backed by diamond miners at Chiadzwa and the Tongogara CSOS supported by Unki Mine.\n\nThrough the schemes, roads, clinics and schools were built in many parts of the country.Scores secured fulltime jobs in the secretariats of the schemes and as project-based employees.Incomes and livelihoods improved markedly.\n\nFor the Government, this was a smart move. Instead of using its resources to build infrastructure, the private sector did the job. This meant a huge saving of public resources, which were then channelled to other pressing undertakings.\n\nHowever, CSOSs appear to have lost steam.\n\nSpeaking at Blanket Mine near Gwanda recently, Presidential Affairs and Devolution Permanent Secretary, Engineer Tafadzwa Muguti hailed the great work that CSOSs have done but said they must be more effective.\n\nHe wants decision-making to be more collective, not the situation now, which has seen a few making decisions for communities. He wants greater transparency on the impact of the schemes.\n\nOne major challenge is that when these schemes are introduced, only a few educated or privileged individuals tend to dominate decision-making. We must ensure greater community engagement so that everyone has a voice. Reports on the socio-economic impact of the 10 percent share ownership allocation must be shared openly, he said.\n\nThe Second Republic wants businesses that integrate themselves into local communities, where value is visible and felt by all.\n\nAs a matter of fact, CSOSs have been overshadowed by the devolution fund, which has built hundreds of projects, evenly spread across the country as opposed to the mainly mine-specific impact of CSOSs.\n\nEng Mugutis observations must be followed through for the empowerment initiative to perform to its full potential.\n\nWe ask Government to demand, from eligible companies, up-to-date, detailed reports showing the amounts of money they are allocating to their CSOSs.The trusts must identify the projects on which they spent their allocations and pinpoint them physically.\n\nAs Eng Muguti observed, the secretariats of the schemes should let the people prioritise projects they want done.\n\nIf CSOSs thrive alongside the devolution fund, rural areas would undergo a rapid, inclusive and sustainable transformation which we all desire.\n\n",

            "description": "COMMUNITY share ownership schemes (CSOSs), launched in 2011 as part of the wider economic indigenisation and empowerment drive, transformed rural areas, mainly those adjacent to large mines. In terms of the law, extractive companies must set aside up to 10 percent of their shareholdings to communities they operate in. Communities then decide on development projects [\u2026]",

            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza,[emailprotected]\n\nVILLAGERS in Bulilima District, Matabeleland South Province, a hotspot for mopane worms harvesting, say the yield of the popular delicacy was low this season despite good rains recorded across the region and the rest of the country.\n\nMatabeleland region received good rains in December and the greater part of January bringing relief to farmers as crops and livestock improved significantly.\n\nThe good rains, which saw some places receiving rainfall almost on a daily basis, turned out to be not a blessing at least as far as mopane worm harvesting is concerned, villagers in Mopane and Mbonqane villages lamented yesterday.\n\nThis time, I harvested just two buckets, which are equivalent to two 20kg bags, compared to previous seasons when we made a lot of money from selling amacimbi that we would have harvested.\n\nI will keep this seasons harvest for my family only, I cant afford to sell any as the harvest was not very good, said a Mbonqane villager, Mrs Atallia Mhlanga.\n\nWe received a lot of rain at a time when we expected to start harvesting amacimbi. So, we did not get ample time to go into the wild to harvest.\n\nAmacimbi grow so fast that if you dont harvest them while they are still feeding on tree leaves, they burrow into the ground and disappear.\n\nShe said villagers are hopeful the next mopane worms harvest season expected sometime in April will be much better.\n\nMrs Evelyn Ngwenya, another villager said this time around locals did not witness an influx of people from other regions rushing into Bulilima District in search of the delicacy.\n\nAmacimbi harvesting has in the past been a source of conflict between locals and dealers from other provinces.\n\nIn the past, traditional leaders in Matabeleland South province have expressed concern over rampant deforestation caused by people harvesting mopane worms in the area.\n\nIn less than three weeks, amacimbi were gone and I think by the time the outsiders learned that the harvesting season had started there was nothing in the wild to harvest. The difference between locals and outsiders is how we harvest amacimbi.\n\nAmacimbi\n\nWe simply pick them from the trees or the ground while they cut down trees and do not care about the destruction that they leave behind, said Mrs Ngwenya.\n\nShe showed The Chronicle part of the 20kg of amacimbi that she harvested in early January.\n\nIt rained so heavily in this area that it was difficult to harvest amacimbi and by the time the skies opened up, they were gone,\n\nA villager from Mopane village, Mr Aleck Siziba, said a few people in his area harvested the delicacy.\n\nWe had hoped to have a good amacimbi harvest since the vegetation is in a good state but surprisingly few people managed to get a good harvest.\n\nAmacimbi season comes in two stages, so we hope in April when rainfall is expected to be minimal, there will be plenty of them for villagers to harvest and keep for their families, said Mr Siziba.\n\nIn 2023, the Bulilima Rural District Council took practical steps to control the harvesting of amacimbi after noting that the delicacy was facing a high risk of extinction in the wild due to over-harvesting and deforestation.\n\nSince time immemorial, amacimbi widely consumed in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, South Africa and Zambia, has provided food at low cost and generated income for locals helping to fight hunger and poverty.\n\nAmacimbi constitute one of the cheapest sources of protein for locals.\n\nFor a long time, locals in the Matabeleland region have collected amacimbi from the wild and partly traded them to earn money to buy other needs.\n\nIn recent years, there have been growing concerns over unsustainable harvesting practices that have decimated amacimbi species in areas bordering Botswana and South Africa.\n\nUnder Bulilma by laws, persons harvesting amacimbi will be required to pay a certain amount of money to the council, which would then be ploughed back into the community.\n\nBotswana banned the harvesting of amacimbi after the government and conservation experts agreed that taking drastic measures would allow the popular delicacy to pupate or burrow into the ground and become stock for the next season to increase the severely depleted amacimbi population.\n\nAuthorities in that country have stopped issuing harvesting permits to amacimbi dealers who trade the delicacy both locally and in neighbouring countries.\n\nZimbabwe is yet to ban the harvesting of amacimbi for commercial purposes.\n\n",
