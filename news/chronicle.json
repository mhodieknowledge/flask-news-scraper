            "content": "Trish Mukwazo,[emailprotected]\n\nMRS Isabel Mavengano, a 52-year-old teacher from Bulawayo who has been battling a chronic kidney ailment for several years, has secured a matching organ donor and on Thursday left the country for a life-saving kidney transplant in India.\n\nAccompanied by her husband, Mr Richard Mavengano, she departed for the surgery at Joshua Mqabuko International Airport. They will be travelling with the donor, a family member who is based overseas.\n\nFamily and friends, who have supported Mrs Mavengano throughout her challenging journey, gathered at the airport to bid her farewell, offering their well-wishes and prayers for the upcoming procedure.\n\nThe surgery, which is not readily available in Zimbabwe, will be performed in India at an estimated cost of US$40,000. Through fundraising efforts, including a GoFundMe campaign, individuals, and companies came together to help raise US$29,300 of the required amount to cover the surgery, post-operative care, and travel and accommodation expenses.\n\nMrs Mavenganos initial kidney donor had to withdraw due to health complications, but she was fortunate enough to secure another donor, a family member, who will be travelling with her for the procedure.\n\nSpeaking at the airport, Mrs Mavenganos friend, Mrs Nomathuli Makwenzi, who played an active role in the fundraising efforts, expressed gratitude for the overwhelming support from the community and people from around the world.\n\nThis was possible because of the support from people worldwide. Its a testimony of what unity can bring. We are all looking forward to Mrs Mavengano being back on her feet after the procedure, she said.\n\nShe also mentioned the success of a fundraising walk that had been held to promote awareness and raise additional funds for the cause.\n\nMrs Charity Kwangwadzai, another family friend who contributed to the fundraising, shared her excitement about Mrs Mavenganos trip and the potential success of the transplant.\n\nIts such an exciting day for us to see them travel to India for the transplant. We are hoping and praying that the procedure will be a success. We trust that both Mrs Mavengano and the donor will be well, said Mrs Kwangwadzai.\n\nMr Tulani Makwenzi, a committee member involved in the fundraising, also expressed his gratitude to all who had contributed.\n\nWe are hopeful that the funds will see Mrs Mavengano through her treatment in India, and we appreciate everyones support. Please continue to keep her and the donor in your prayers, he said in a statement.\n\nMrs Mavengano, who teaches children with learning difficulties, has been on peritoneal dialysis for the past three years, a treatment that has helped maintain her condition but is not a long-term solution. Her doctors have recommended a kidney transplant as the best course of action for her health and survival.\n\nShe has been managing her health condition since the age of 16, when she was diagnosed with diabetes, and has been on insulin treatment ever since. However, her kidney condition has limited her ability to perform everyday tasks, and she has been forced to avoid certain foods due to her health requirements.\n\nThis condition has taken a toll on me. I can no longer take as much fluid as I want. It has also made me prone to anaemia, and Ive lost a lot of energy, Mrs Mavengano explained.\n\nThe dialysis requires a lot of planning and has restricted my diet. I can no longer enjoy foods high in phosphorus and iodine, like choumoellier and sweet potatoes, she added.\n\nMrs Mavengano is expected to be in India for at least two months as she undergoes treatment and recovery. Her family and friends remain hopeful for her full recovery and look forward to her return with a new kidney, ready to regain her health and quality of life.\n\n",

There is a need to protect the girl child through passing harsh sentences to such offenders, and accordingly, they are sentenced to an effective 15 years, said Mrs Marondedze.\n\nThe prosecutor, Ms Manyika said sometime in September last year, the complainant was coming from school when she passed through where Mvere and Msipa were seated.\n\nThe two men called the girl but she did not respond and continued with her journey.\n\nThe court heard that Mvere and Msipa pursued the girl and caught up with her.\n\nMvere produced a kitchen knife and threatened to stab her if she screamed.\n\nAfter that, they dragged her to Msipas house where they took turns to rape the complainant.\n\nThe matter came to light when the complainant was asked by her father why she arrived home late and she narrated her ordeal. A report was made to the police leading to the arrest of the two men.\n\n",

However, the segment was partially offset by gains in the commercial categories.\n\nThe plastics and metals segment saw a 10.2 percent increase in volume, driven by higher demand for PET preforms and HDPE closures.\n\nHowever, the company noted that production volumes were somewhat constrained by severe power outages throughout the year in Ruwa, which limited their ability to operate at full capacity.\n\nSales volumes for CaraudMetalBox decreased by 0.57 percent compared to the previous year, though there was growth in both closures and HDPE categories.\n\nThe group noted that metal volumes had also declined compared to the prior year.\n\nOverall, Nampak Zimbabwe is navigating a challenging environment, with external factors such as power shortages and adverse weather conditions impacting performance.\n\nThe company remains focused on maintaining operational efficiency and exploring new opportunities to adapt to market demands.\n\n",

The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina.\n\nVarious strains of the human papillomavirus, also called HPV, play a role in causing most cervical cancers. HPV is a common infection that is passed through sexual contact. When exposed to HPV, the bodys immune system typically prevents the virus from causing harm. However, in a small percentage of people, the virus survives for years. This contributes to the process that causes some cervical cells to become cancer cells.\n\nMs Barbara Kembo-Nyathi, the founder of Bold Dialogue, an organisation that raises awareness about cervical cancer, said the event is open to everyone, including men.\n\nShe said people do not often talk about cervical cancer because society still believes the only way a woman can get it is by being promiscuous.\n\nCervical cancer is such a scary topic in our societies, and people still believe the only way a woman can get it is because they have been sleeping around, which is not true. That is why we are hosting this teal brunch. Its going to be a space for everyone to talk about everything related to cervical cancer and look for possible solutions on how best we can eliminate it. This brunch is not meant for women only but is also going to be a great space to teach men about cervical cancer and how they are also potential carriers of the virus that causes cervical cancer, said Ms Kembo-Nyathi.\n\nShe said the event will feature a number of panellists, including medical professionals and cervical cancer survivors, who will all share insightful information.\n\n@flora_sibanda\n\n",
