Our President is a listening leader with a clear vision.\n\nManicaland Provincial Affairs Minister, Advocate Misheck Mugadza\n\nHe listens to peoples concerns and addresses them promptly, he said.Adv Mugadza said the donation resonates well with the Presidents National Digital Ambassador Programme that seeks to empower 1,5 million young Zimbabweans with digital skills by 2030.\n\nThis initiative will go a long way in enhancing digital literacy and skills among Zimbabwean citizens, and empowering a new generation of professionals who can contribute to technological innovation. This digital skills programme is tailor-made to cover the digital divide as youths from remote areas have access to technology, he said.\n\nThrough the programme, Adv Mugadza said, Junior MPs will acquire skills in digital literacy, online safety and effective communication.\n\nYou will have access to a range of digital tools and resources to support your academic and professional pursuits. I would like to applaud the Ministry of Youth, Empowerment, Development and Vocational Training for the Junior Parliament concept as this gives young leaders a chance to become active participants in the developmental process of our country, he said.\n\nThis is in the spirit of leaving no one and no place behind as espoused by President Mnangagwa. As we navigate through the digital age, it is evident that digital literacy is crucial for the empowerment of young people to access education, employment and economic opportunities. This means we will continue to prioritise digital skills development and ensure that young people are adequately equipped to thrive in an increasingly inter-connected world.Adv Mugadza said Manicaland Province has immense potential for growth and enterprise development, and to fully capitalise on this, youths must be equipped with the relevant skills.He said Government is spearheading the transformation of vocational training centres and aligning them with global trends, where modern practical skills that empower youths for both personal and national development are offered.\n\nJunior Parliament Second vice president, Luke Mavada, applauded Government for availing the tablets to young people, saying they will help make learning much easier.\n\nThe Government has done a very noble thing to give gadgets to members of the Junior Parliament and Cabinet. These tools will help us in our studies. They will help us in conducting research and for communication purposes.\n\nThese gadgets will help in our education. We are the generation of new technological advancement, and these tools will help us a lot, said Mavada.\n\nCurren Masakura, the Junior Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, said the tablets will enhance their adaptation to the Heritage-Based Curriculum being implemented in schools.\n\nI would like to extend my deepest gratitude to President Mnangagwa for availing these essential gadgets for us.This is empowerment of youths who constitute the majority of the population. This will improve our digital literacy, he said.\n\n",

The road is set to undergo rehabilitation\n\nMinister Moyo told Chronicle that the partnership between Government and mining companies was critical in rehabilitating the potholed road to ensure smooth flow of traffic.\n\nA resolution was made at the meeting with officials from Muchesu Coal Mine and Kamativi Mining Company, road engineers and the Binga RDC CEO that rehabilitating the Cross Dete-Binga Road is a priority project that should start as soon as possible, said Minister Moyo.\n\nHe said the road engineers were tasked to find out the materials needed for pothole patching from Cross Dete to Binga and that information is supposed to be available in the next few days.\n\nIn the past, Binga had no investors to talk about but all that has changed because of the leadership of President Mnangagwa which has brought in big mining companies to operate in Matabeleland North Province, said Minister Moyo.\n\nHe said what is encouraging is that the mining companies understand how important it is to partner Government in implementing key projects such as rehabilitation of roads which they also use.\n\nMinister Moyo said the pothole patching project will cover the whole of Cross Dete-Binga Road as the area received a lot of rains this year, which unfortunately caused significant damage to the road.\n\nKamativi Mining Company has in the past rehabilitated a section of the road, which is still in a good state and we want to make sure that we rehabilitate the whole road up to Binga, said Minister Moyo.\n\nKMC has resurfaced a stretch from the Mines main gate to the Cross Dete-Binga road up to the roundabout.The road that connects from the roundabout to the business centre has also been tarred, including the one that passes through the police station to Transmedia transmitters.\n\nAnother tarred section of the road leading to the community hall has been named after Chief Nekatambe as it falls under his jurisdiction.\n\nMr Albert Savanhu, a truck driver said the bad state of the road has made driving to Binga a nightmare.Unfortunately there is no other route that we can use from Hwange to Binga except the Cross Dete-Binga Road but driving on that road is now a nightmare, he said.\n\nSome of the potholes are so big that even haulage trucks are forced off the tarred road onto the dusty side roads, said Mr Savanhu.\n\nChronicle observed that the incessant rains received across the country, including Binga, have damaged roads and bridges making if difficult to reach places such as Tinde in Binga.\n\nA small bridge which is about five kilometers from Tinde High School, was extensively damaged following heavy rains and motorists have to exercise extreme caution when navigating their way.\n\nLocal business owner Mr Patrick Chisulu said if some of the small bridges are not attended to, the area will be cut off from the rest of Binga.\n\nWe now rely on two commuter omnibuses that travel to Cross Dete every day to buy stock for our shops. While we are happy that Binga received good rains this year, we are at the risk of being cut off from the rest of Binga if some of the bridges are not fixed, Mr Chisilu.\n\nCross Dete-Binga Road is one of the major highways, which Government has identified as a critical road in need of urgent attention.\n\n",

            "content": "Trish Mukwazo,[emailprotected]\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Cross-Border Traders Association (ZCBTA) has unveiled a series of initiatives aimed at formalising and securing cross-border trade while curbing smuggling and corruption.\n\nThe new measures will not only streamline customs processes but also provide financial and security benefits to traders.Speaking during a meeting with ZCBTA members on Sunday, the organisations president, Mr Killer Zivhu, outlined a plan to differentiate traders from ordinary travellers to ensure a more efficient border clearance process.\n\nUnder the new system, traders goods will be transported exclusively by registered cross-border transport operators, commonly known as omalayitsha, while travellers will be encouraged to use their own buses.\n\nMr Zivhu said this strategy will significantly reduce delays at roadblocks, as traders will no longer have to endure long clearance processes.\n\nHe said goods would be officially declared at the border, with members receiving declaration documents to present in their shops and flea markets to promote accountability and legal trade.\n\nFollowing rising cases of robberies targeting Zimbabwean traders in neighbouring countries such as South Africa, ZCBTA has partnered with banks to introduce a Rand Visa Card, which will allow members to make secure transactions without carrying large sums of cash.\n\nPeople will be using this visa card when they travel outside the country. It has a lot of benefits that will be explained during the official launch in Bulawayo, said Mr Zivhu.\n\nHe said they are rolling out a funeral insurance scheme and a banking initiative tailored for cross-border traders.To further facilitate trade, ZCBTA is in talks with financial institutions to assist in transporting goods from key trading hubs such as South Africa, Tanzania and Botswana. This move aims to reduce logistical challenges and ensure that traders can access goods at competitive prices.\n\nBeyond logistics and financial security, ZCBTA is spearheading efforts to secure dedicated trading spaces for its members. Mr Zivhu revealed that an agreement has been reached with a bank to finance the purchase of land for the construction of a formal marketplace. The project will be self-sustaining, with the bank recovering its investment through rentals from traders. With a membership of over 350 000 traders in Bulawayo alone, ZCBTA is positioning itself as a key player in the countrys economic growth.\n\nMr Zivhu said the association is aligning its initiatives with the countrys Vision 2030 development agenda by promoting formalised trade, financial inclusion and digital commerce.\n\nMost of our traders are leveraging social media platforms such as Facebook to sell their products. The majority of these goods are imported, making structured cross-border trade a crucial component of the national economy, he said\n\nAs cross-border traders, we want to participate and be part and parcel of the Vision 2030.Mr Zivhu said they have also proposed a housing development initiative for their members, many of whom do not own homes.We also told the bank that most people dont own houses, and they also agreed in principle that they can develop if we get land\n\nso that traders can build their own homes and pay the bank, he said.Cross-border traders welcomed the initiatives, with Ms Netsai Madzivire highlighting the potential benefits of improved trade logistics. This will help us travel to more destinations like Dubai and source products more efficiently, she said.\n\n",

            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza,[emailprotected]\n\nWHEN the skies opened up in Content 1 Village, Ward 9 in Umguza District in January this year, local farmer Ms Agnes Moyo took a leap of faith by allocating more land for traditional grains compared to maize.\n\nWhile maize, a staple crop that she has been growing consistently for over two decades is common, allocating more land for small grains like sorghum and millet, has proved to be a very good decision.\n\nMs Moyo does not regret this bold step as she is poised for a bumper harvest from the one-and-a-half hectares of land that she planted small grains.\n\nBy applying skills she learnt from farmer-field capacity building programmes that she and fellow villagers from Content 1 Village in Umguza District attended and were under the mentorship of their local Agricultural and Rural Development Advisory Services (ARDAS) officer, Ms Moyo meticulously checked on the state of her small grains and applied chemicals when she detected pests in the fields.\n\nYesterday, the communal farmer was awarded for her hard work, resilience and strong will for championing the planting of small grains as a response to climate change challenges that require farmers to shift to drought resistant crops during a field day held at her homestead.\n\nOfficials from ARDAS, Zimbabwe Farmers Union (ZFU), Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA), Grain Marketing Board (GMB) and representatives of businesses that sell seeds and agro-chemicals, villagers as well as communal farmers from Ward 9 in Umguza District, attended the field day.\n\nThe event showcased a positive story about the resilience and success of planting small grains and that these are not only critical for household food security but are beneficial to health and are climate-smart.\n\nI have been planting maize for many years but the yields kept reducing hence I decided to take a risk and reserve a bigger portion of my land for small grains this year, said Ms Moyo.\n\nThe land where I planted small grains is slightly over one-and-a-half hectares, which is a lot considering that I am a communal farmer and I dont own huge tracts of land.\n\nOwing to rains that came a bit late this season, Ms Moyo said she was encouraged to grow small grains because of their ability to survive harsh and hot conditions in the event of a drought.\n\nThe first heavy rains came in early January, and I knew that I had to settle for short-seasoned small-grain crops, given that we only had two-and-a-half months to expect rains. Over the years, I have realised that growing maize has been risky because when we receive little rain, the entire crop is wiped out, said Ms. Moyo.\n\nShe said she will deliver the bulk of her small grains to the GMB and only keep what is required for family consumption and stockfeed for her chickens. I need money for my childrens school fees and other necessities so I will sell the bulk of the harvest to GMB. Looking back, I do not regret the decision to reserve more land for small grains. The maize crop is also doing well after the good rains so Im happy, she said.\n\nMatabeleland North Ardas provincial agronomist Mrs Zenzele Ndlovu, called for the resuscitation of farmer field schools, which she described as vital for practical lessons.\n\nCommunal farmer Miss Agnes Moyo (right) receives farming inputs from Ardas provincial agronomist Mrs Zenzele Ndlovu at Content 1 village in Ward 9, Umguza District yesterday\n\nA farmer field school is a group-based learning process where farmers carry out experimental learning activities that help them understand the ecology of their farming practices.\n\nThese activities involve simple experiments, regular field observations and group analysis. Knowledge gained from these activities enables participants to make the right farming decisions.\n\nIts important to work hand in hand with local Ardas officers as they are able to tell farmers how much rain is expected each season and that information helps farmers to make decisions on which crops to grow, she said.\n\nThis season farmers were informed that normal to above normal rainfall was expected and those who worked closely with our officers used that information to make informed decisions, said Mrs Ndlovu.\n\nShe said in the past farmers used to shun growing traditional crops such as sorghum, millet and rapoko but these small grains are now popular because people are now aware of their high nutritional value.\n\nGovernment, through the Ministry of Agriculture, Lands, Water, Fisheries and Rural Development, has been urging farmers in dry areas to grow traditional grains and those who took heed of this advice are expecting bumper harvest this cropping season Small grain crops are drought-tolerant and suitable for semi-arid areas such as the Matabeleland region and Masvingo provinces. In the past the value attached to small grains had been so low that some were viewing the crops as varieties for the vulnerable communities.\n\n",

The retail chain, which is now undertaking a re-branding exercise, has retained all the Choppies Zimbabwe employees, which are estimated to be about 1 100.\n\nThe Botswana-headquartered Choppies retail chain recently exited Zimbabwe saying it wants to focus on sustainable growth and profitability across its regional operations.\n\nThe retail chain, which used to operate 30 grocery stores across the country, entered the Zimbabwean market in 2013 when it acquired several Spar shops and expanded its footprint in 2014 when it opened its distribution centre in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe move by Cde Modi to takeover former Choppies and retain all the workers is very commendable. Fear gripped the workers when Choppies announced that it was exiting Zimbabwe and the decision by Cde Modi to retain all the workers has therefore given them a new lease of life. Instead of just mourning about businesses closing down, we want people like Cde Modi who takeover such businesses because they have confidence in their countrys economy.\n\nWe have said it before that Zimbabweans should take the lead in investing in their country and investment by foreigners should just be a bonus.\n\nCde Modi who is also Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce said all the former Choppies outlets across the country have been restocked.\n\nWe acquired all the Choppies outlets nationwide and retained all the workers, said Deputy Minister Modi who is leading from the front.\n\nThe countrys detractors were celebrating the closure of retail outlets such as Choppies and citizens like Cde Modi are now shaming them. Zimbabwe last year recorded many positives as far as development is concerned. Instead of building on this success, this year started badly with a number of retail outlets threatening to close due to stiff competition from the informal sector.\n\nWhat is, however, encouraging is that the situation seems to have stabilised. The formal and informal sectors should co-exist as has been the case over the years.\n\nGovernment should be commended for stepping up its fight against smuggling of goods into the country, which were finding their way to the informal sector where they were being sold for ridiculously low prices. This has been giving the informal sector unfair advantage hence it was threatening formal businesses.\n\nZimbabwe has been witnessing the establishment of new companies across the country and many other such projects that have transformed the livelihoods of citizens but the threat by big retail operators to close branches was now sending a wrong message to potential investors.\n\nThe swift Government intervention has stabilised the situation as fewer goods are now being smuggled into the country. Zimbabwe should remain an investment destination of choice in the region and beyond as it remains Open for Business for both its citizens and foreigners.\n\nLet every citizen put shoulder to the wheel as we build the Zimbabwe we all want.

The World Cup qualification will be a hybrid project where we are chasing qualification as well as preparing for the Afcon finals, Nees said.\n\nPlayers can recommend themselves for the Afcon. The competition is open, so they want to be there.And so, on one hand, its a preparation for the Afcon finals while on the other hand, its the qualification for the World Cup as well.\n\nNees also underscored the importance of both the World Cup qualifiers and the Afcon, where there is no room for trying to nurture talent.\n\nIts not a development thing, we have to perform.The German said Zimbabwe are not far off the pace and can as well find their way to the top if they perform well in the remaining qualifiers.\n\nIts a very tight group, there are still six games to go and 18 points to play for. The group is not decided yet for any team, thats it, the team in first place can easily go down.\n\nWe have got to rise up. The group is not decided yet and thats for sure. And even if the group was decided, every team has the responsibility to compete until the final game with the best and maximum effort, because you need to ensure fair competition.\n\nAnd now, is the main project, the World Cup qualification, but the second project is like preparation already, for the Afcon.We have to re-start that World Cup qualification positively. We want to do that, to get the positive mood going, and to do everything in our power to turn the table a little bit around, turn the page and to move up.\n\nAnd thats our approach and now we have to look at what is the next task at hand.Meanwhile, the new Zifa executive led by Nqobile Magwizi is hardly two months in office, but they have already made significant strides in striking partnership deals with different corporates.Just last week, the association inked two agreements for digital enhancement of their operations and technical development.\n\nAnd yesterday, the motherbody unveiled yet another deal, which will see the Warriors getting formal wear from 4May International, for every assignment in the next three years.\n\n",

Although we are waiting for finer details, we are told that there was a female adult who was washing clothes downstream in the company of her two children and one of them  four years old  was swept away and the body was later retrieved.\n\nThe other child who was with her mother, a 15-year-old, was swept away and was left marooned on a piece of land. The teen was later rescued.\n\nThe other person who died was a 30-year-old man who was on a fishing expedition. It happened at a farm that is owned by the late national hero Brigadier Bandamas family. The other two deceased were swept downstream, said Mr Misi.\n\nIn a separate interview, Chipinge District Development Co-ordinator Mr William Mashava said a search is underway for the bodies of missing people, adding that some macadamia farmers were left counting losses after their pump houses, which were close to the river in Ward 7 and 10 of the district, were swept away.\n\nSeveral pumps houses in Ward 7 and 10, which were installed close to the river, were destroyed due to flooding, said Mr Mashava.\n\nWard 10 Councillor Piason Sithole, said the community, together with various stakeholders is on the ground assisting in the search for the missing persons.He added that some villagers also lost their livestock.\n\n",
