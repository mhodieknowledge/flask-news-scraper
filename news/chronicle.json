Above all, they make us winners in every sphere of human endeavour.\n\nAs we strive to develop our country, what must always guide us is the need to shun hatred, and embrace each other through love, tolerance and forgiveness.\n\nIf you become a false witness, then you are betraying these three comrades we are laying to rest today.\n\nLack of respect for each other and petty jealousies are mortal sins which cannot be forgiven here on earth and in Heaven.\n\nWe should respect one another and continue to be guided by the principle of Ubuntu, taking cognisance of the fact that every Zimbabwean who was born as we fought for our Independence contributed in different yet important capacities towards this one sacred goal which motivated us all and built solid unity in struggle.\n\nActing President Chiwenga called on different sectors of society, particularly the media and communications fraternity at large, civil society and national-interest driven opposition political parties and other social interest groups to play a positive role in the promotion of nation-building and unity of purpose.\n\nAmbassador John Shumba Mvundura\n\nDespite our divergent political views, we should always remember that we are one people who should be guided by the ethic of transformative politics where tolerance, forgiveness and ubuntu take precedence in our quest to build a prosperous, secure and stable Zimbabwe that we will continue to be patriotically proud of.\n\nHe implored the citizenry to make the most of the rains we are currently receiving by growing short-season variety crops to enhance the Governments food security efforts.\n\nBrigadier-General Mpulaeng Siziba, young brother to the late Major-General (Rtd) Siziba, hailed the legacy left by his brother.\n\nHe said his late brother contributed wholeheartedly to the growth and development of the agricultural sector in the region.\n\nMr Cleopas Nyangoni, brother to Cde Chimutengwende, said the family had lost a pillar who assisted in the education and development not only of his immediate family but extended family.\n\nHe said his brother was a hard worker and an easygoing man who enjoyed his free time through music and dance.\n\nMs Jayne Mvundura, daughter to Ambassador Mvundura, said her late father was a loving family man but at the same time a strict disciplinarian who demanded the very best from his children and family.\n\nShe said Ambassador Mvundura also contributed to the education and personal development of several people who are not his family.\n\nThe burial of the three national heroes was attended by Vice-President Kembo Mohadi, Cabinet Ministers, Service Chiefs and other senior Government officials.\n\n",

The certificate is issued upon request to a person whose tax affairs are up-to-date or who has made satisfactory tax compliance arrangements with Zimra.\n\nSome of the benefits of having valid tax clearance certificates are that no 30 percent withholding tax is deducted when payments are made for goods and services supplied, and no presumptive tax will be levied on importations.\n\nTax clearance is usually required when bidding for tenders, and this is a pre-requisite when applying for licenses issued by local authorities, while business players have confidence in compliant taxpayers.\n\nIn a recent Public Notice 92 of 2024 issued last month, and in accordance with the amendment to Section 80A of the Income Tax Act (Chapter 23:06), Zimra listed the nine affected bodies as Architects, Engineers and Technicians, Land Surveyors, Legal Practitioners, Auditors and Accountants, Health Practitioners, Veterinary Surgeons, Real Estate Agents and Quantity Surveyors.\n\nAll individuals seeking certification, registration, or licensing with their respective professional bodies must present a valid tax clearance certificate at the time of application or renewal, reads the notice.\n\nThe tax clearance certificate must be valid no earlier than 30 days prior to its submission. Zimra encourages all professionals in these fields to ensure compliance with this new requirement to avoid any disruptions in their practice.\n\nThe tax authority further stated that all new registrants have to register through the Zimra Service Portal (SSP), mytaxselfservice.zimra.co.zw.\n\nZimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra)\n\nWhen sampled, the given application portal showed that one needs to sign in or sign up first before being taken to the main page upon which they are asked whether they want to register as individuals or as an organisation.\n\nAfter clicking on the correct box, a new page opens with further requests such as ones taxpayer information number (TIN), employment period, and type of employment, among other requests.\n\nThere is no payment required for one to get a tax clearance certificate.\n\nIn compliance with the directive, the Nurses Council of Zimbabwe (NCZ) on Tuesday advised all health institutions and organisations to submit a list of their Zimra tax-cleared personnel ahead of registration or renewal, warning that no NCZ practicing certificate shall be issued without the valid tax clearance.\n\nIn line with the requirements of Public Notice 92 of 2024, issued on the 5th of December 2024 by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra), the Nurses Council of Zimbabwe wishes to advise all nurses to produce a valid tax clearance as part of the registration and renewal requirements, said the professional body.\n\nAll health institutions and organisations are hereby required to submit a list of their Zimra tax-cleared personnel to the NCZ as a prerequisite for renewal. Please note that all nurses residing outside Zimbabwe are exempted from this requirement, it said.\n\nA member of the Engineers Council of Zimbabwe said they would be engaging Zimra over the matter, while Mr Lyndon Kashangura, chairperson of the Council of Land Surveyors said he was still in consultation with members of the council on a position about the Zimra directive.\n\nZimra communications manager Mr Francis Chimanda requested to have questions in writing yesterday afternoon but had not responded by time of going to print.\n\n",

I hesitated to check my sons grave because it survived last year, she said. However, her fears were confirmed when she arrived and saw the damage.\n\nHad he not been buried next to a tree, I dont think I would have recognised the grave. This is supposed to be his resting place, but how does he rest in a place like this? Its as if the land is trying to re-bury him, Mrs Dube lamented.\n\nFor families like Mrs Dubes, the rainy season brings not just memories of loss but also the added burden of restoring their loved ones final resting places.\n\nThis is not the first time graves at Luveve Cemetery have been affected by the rains. Many families have faced similar heartache over the years.\n\nMrs Dube, said the council cannot be blamed, as the unpredictability of weather and soil conditions makes it difficult to prevent such occurrences.\n\nShe expressed gratitude for the councils willingness to supply soil for repairs but acknowledged that families must take responsibility for maintaining their loved ones graves.\n\nIve heard the council usually helps by supplying soil to fill the graves. As a family, well fix it by the weekend because, culturally, its not right for a loved one to rest in a grave with water, she said.\n\nHowever, while the city councils provision of soil is a helpful gesture, the recurring nature of this issue calls for more sustainable solutions to prevent further damage during future rainy seasons.\n\nA cemetery worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the issue has persisted for years. While some graves suffer minor damage, others are severely affected.\n\nAnother problem is that families dont maintain their loved ones graves. Tombstones erected long ago lose their strength over time, leading to destruction and sinking, the worker explained.\n\nBulawayos ongoing infrastructure challenges, particularly in drainage management, have a ripple effect on many aspects of urban life, including the preservation of cemeteries. The councils efforts to address drainage issues citywide, including in cemeteries, remain critical.\n\n",

Grade was adversely affected by the higher contribution of lower-grade development ore from Mupani Mine and dilution from mining across geological structures.\n\nA total of US$81,6 million was spent on the replacement mines during the year, 12 percent less than the spend incurred inFY2023, with cumulative expenditure of US$407 million as at June 30, 2024.\n\nThe development of Mupani Mine, which replaces the depleted Rukodzi and Ngwarati mines, is progressing well and remains on schedule, with full production of 3,6Mt per annum planned for H1 FY2029.\n\n",

            "content": "Chronicle Writers\n\nTHE Government and farmers across the country have expressed excitement over the significant improvement in the state of crops and livestock in response to the good rains being received in many areas since last month.\n\nUnlike last year, when the agriculture sector was decimated by the El Nio-induced drought, the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, and Rural Development is convinced the 2025 farming season will be a huge success, especially for maize and other cereal crops, some of which are already at the flowering stage.\n\nAccording to the Meteorological Services Department (MSD), the country is forecast to receive intense rainfall in the coming days. The rains have not only rejuvenated crops but also improved pastures and water availability, offering a lifeline to livestock farmers.\n\nCommunal farmers have also expressed gratitude for the Governments input support, saying that most inputs were delivered on time this farming season.\n\nGiving an update on the crop and livestock situation in the country, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Lands, Professor Obert Jiri, said generally, the condition of crops and livestock was impressive nationwide. He stated that the country looks set to surpass targets in terms of land planted and yields.\n\nPermanent Secretary in the Ministry of Lands, Professor Obert Jiri\n\nThe country has been receiving some good rains nationwide, and we have seen a great improvement in crops and livestock. Generally, the condition of crops is now adequate and good across all provinces, and the livestock situation has also vastly improved, said Prof Jiri.\n\nThe bulk of the crop, more than 65 percent, is now at the late vegetative stage, and we have no doubt that maize will make it. The crop that was planted early in November is now also at the flowering stage, while the late-planted crop, which accounts for about 20 percent, is now at the early vegetative stage. All these crops are looking very good.\n\nProf Jiri said 85 percent of traditional grains, which were planted in December, were also looking very good, as were soya beans, cotton, and tobacco. He said the maize target is on 98 percent, according to reports from extension officers, and a crop and livestock assessment is underway.\n\nThis amounts to about 1,78 million hectares under maize across the provinces, based on what has already germinated.\n\nExperts have advised that the planting season for maize is over, but farmers can continue planting small grains and sunflowers.\n\nFarmers can also plant sweet potatoes and sunflowers, but they should spend more time now weeding, scouting for pests, and applying fertiliser. We have dispatched 60 directors to districts to ensure that they encourage farmers to implement the correct agronomics for every crop because what is left is to convert that crop into high yields, said Prof Jiri.\n\nHe said Zimbabwe was on course to meet targets and that as of yesterday, the Government was focused on conducting crop, livestock, and fisheries assessments, expecting the report to come in the first week of February.\n\nFor traditional grains, we are also on course to meet our target because they are still being planted, and as of today, we were sitting on more than 400 000 hectares of traditional grains, said Prof Jiri.\n\nHe said the target for tobacco has been surpassed, with more than 167 000 hectares now under tobacco.\n\nProf Jiri said the country is almost certain of a bumper harvest for maize and traditional crops, which will ensure food security, while tobacco, the leading foreign currency earner, is also on track.\n\nA thriving maize crop at Emganwini suburb in Bulawayo yesterday. (Picture by Nkosizile Ndlovu)\n\nIn the Midlands Province, communal farmers are celebrating the recent wet spell, which has renewed hopes for a bumper harvest this year. The province, known for its thriving crop and livestock farming, is expecting a bumper harvest of most crops.\n\nChief Ngungumbane of Mberengwa District expressed optimism about the prospects of the farming season, noting that early-planted crops are doing well.\n\nThe wet spell across the country has brought hope for a good harvest this year. Crops are at various stages, and the early-planted maize is at the tasselling stage, he said.\n\nChief Ngungumbane also commended the Government for the timely distribution of farming inputs, which has enabled many farmers to plant early. However, he highlighted challenges faced by those who delayed planting.\n\nSome farmers who were slow to plant are now struggling to do so because of the persistent rains, said Chief Ngungumbane.\n\nIn Gokwe South, Chief Njelele said his area has been receiving rainfall for the past two weeks.\n\nEveryone is happy. We now have water for livestock, and our pastures have improved. If the rains persist, dams will soon spill, he said.\n\nChief Njelele praised the Governments Pfumvudza/Intwasa smart farming initiative, which has gained traction in his area.\n\nMany farmers in my area have adopted smart agricultural techniques. They received inputs on time, and their fields are a marvel to watch. We are confident of a bumper harvest this year, he said.\n\nChief Chireya of Gokwe North shared similar sentiments, emphasising the importance of the rains in supporting irrigation schemes.\n\nWith water bodies filling up, we can fully utilise irrigation schemes to enhance food security and nutrition, aligning with Vision 2030, he said.\n\nSeedco sales manager, Mr Ronnie Chingome, highlighted the positive impact of the rains on crops and livestock.\n\nThe maize crop is doing well in many communal areas, and those farmers at irrigation schemes now have adequate water, he said.\n\nAgricultural and Rural Development Advisory Services (Ardas) acting director for Matabeleland North province, Mr Thulani Ndlovu, said livestock was now in good condition due to improved pastures. He, however, said leaching due to incessant rains was the biggest challenge facing crop farmers.\n\nWe are also encouraging farmers to scout for the fall armyworm and African armyworm, which are common when there is green vegetation. Once identified, farmers must use pesticides to kill the worms or seek guidance from local extension officers, said Mr Ndlovu.\n\nOn livestock, he said there is a high level of tick infestation, which may lead to an outbreak of tick-borne diseases, and encouraged regular dipping.\n\nZimbabwe Commercial Farmers Union (ZCFU) Matabeleland North provincial chairman, Mr Winston Babbage, said the crops were doing well and stressed the need to control weeds and scout for pests. He encouraged farmers to vaccinate their animals and ensure regular dipping to control tick-borne diseases.\n\n",

            "content": "Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu,[emailprotected]\n\nGwanda District is set to implement a comprehensive disaster risk reduction (DRR) training programme across its 24 rural wards as part of efforts to equip communities with the skills and knowledge needed to identify, mitigate, prepare for, and respond effectively to disasters.\n\nThe district revised its DRR plan last year to address the growing threat of climate change and to align with updated statistics and ward boundaries. The revised plan incorporates three key documents: the districts disaster risk profile, disaster risk mitigation and adaptation plan, and the emergency response plan.\n\nIn aninterview, Gwanda District Development Co-ordinator, Ms Nomathemba Ndlovu, said the training programme represents a critical step in empowering DRR committees at the ward level.\n\nWe now have a DRR plan at the district level, but implementation is done at the ward level, hence the need to train DRR committees within communities. All 24 wards will be covered. We will first train ward extension officers from various ministries and departments, as well as councillors, she said.\n\nThese ward extension officers will then train DRR committee members, who are made up of community members. The DRR committees are chaired by councillors, while the ward extension officers are also members of the committees.\n\nMs Ndlovu explained that the ward extension officers will play a crucial role in monitoring the implementation of DRR plans by communities.\n\nWe want this training to commence at the beginning of next month. The training, funded by Catholic Relief Services (CRS) to the tune of US$150 000, will empower ward extension officers to train DRR committee members. These committees will be pivotal in implementing and monitoring DRR plans at the community level, she said.\n\nDuring the training, participants will be equipped with knowledge on climate-smart agriculture, livelihoods, disaster mitigation and prevention, water harvesting, water-logging, and other disaster-related issues.\n\nEach ward will develop an active DRR plan to identify potential hazards and implement strategies to mitigate risks. These ward-level plans will feed into the districts overarching disaster risk mitigation and adaptation plan, as well as its emergency response plan.\n\nThe DRR initiative aims to enhance community resilience, enabling them to cope with and recover from disasters while steering the district towards a more sustainable and disaster-resistant future.\n\nGwanda District is particularly vulnerable to various hazards, including prolonged dry spells, floods, unpredictable weather patterns, public health emergencies, and environmental degradation. Technological hazards, such as mining accidents and road traffic incidents, also pose significant risks.\n\nPublic health emergencies, including epidemics, livestock diseases, and drug and substance abuse, further threaten community livelihoods and health.\n\n@DubeMatutu\n\n",

Ncube stated on his social media platforms.\n\nBruce Njube Giant Ncube\n\nWhy dont we tell their stories by bringing them together in one place to share ideas and get to know each other in a more intimate space?\n\nThe proposed show aims not only to celebrate the artistry of local personalities but also to introduce some drama, as Ncube plans to bring together individuals who may have existing feuds, adding a layer of controversy to the mix.\n\nI would pose a question to clear the drama and end the tension, he added, suggesting that the show could delve into the dynamics of relationships within Bulawayos creative scene.\n\nTo launch the show, Ncube is seeking financial support and has initiated a GoFundMe campaign.\n\nAwa Khiwe\n\nI need your help to raise 5,000 through GoFundMe, so we can make this a reality, he told his followers.\n\nIts important to celebrate people in the creative, sporting, entrepreneurial and fashion industries. Think about the filmmakers who could benefit from producing such a significant show and showcasing what Bulawayo can achieve when resources are available. Imagine the fashion designers dressing the cast  its an opportunity to spotlight incredible talent.\n\nPicture the drama and chaos, he continued, with everyone sharing their stories  how theyve reached this point in their journeys, their family dynamicsand their love lives.\n\nAwa Khiwe\n\nNcube revealed that he envisions one season of the show, consisting of around five episodes, featuring 18 of Bulawayos most influential movers and shakers. These could potentially include Lorraine Maphala-Phiri, Fadzai Chinyanga, Mzoe Seven, Awa Khiwe, Nitefreak, Leroy Waps, Ntandoyenkosi Moyo, Vuyo Brown, MJ Sings, Charmaine Mainey Mudau, Taboka Patience Nleya, Nkanyeziyethu Malunga, Novuyo Seagirl, Madlela Skhobokhobo, and Sipho Mercent Nyathi.\n\nThe idea has already garnered support from fellow artistes, including Germany-based rapper Awa Khiwe, who joined Ncubes live session on Facebook to express enthusiasm for the project.\n\nThis is an amazing idea. We dont have enough content to entertain ourselves and most of the time, social content creators from other countries are making it. We need to level up as well, said the Rap- Gandaganda hitmaker.\n\nAwa Khiwe\n\nReality television has been gaining traction in Zimbabwe, with shows like the Foodie Lovers Dating Show, airing on 3Ktv, demonstrating an appetite for local content. Ncubes proposed reality show could further contribute to this growing trend, providing a platform for personalities from Bulawayo to shine.\n\nNcubes recent work includes participation in major festivals and events, such as The Natural Voice Network Annual Gathering, Womad and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. His experience in these high-profile settings lends credibility to his vision for a locally-produced reality show.\n\n @MbuleloMpofu\n\n",
