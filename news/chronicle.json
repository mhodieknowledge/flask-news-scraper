You have to respect those players and the team in general, said Zemura.\n\nBoth teams are coming into the match buoyed by their successful qualification for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations finals.\n\nHowever, with Zimbabwe sitting at the bottom of Group C with just two points from four matches, this fixture is crucial if the Warriors are to keep their World Cup dreams alive.\n\nWith only six matches remaining in the campaign, the Warriors will need to secure as many points as possible, starting with this clash against Benin.\n\nThe Warriors have reason to be optimistic, especially with the return of former captain Knowledge Musona, who is rejoining the national team after a three-year hiatus.\n\nCoach Michael Nees will bank on the likes of Zemura, Marshall Munetsi, Tawanda Maswanhise, Prince Dube and Tawanda Chirewa for this difficult task.\n\nBenin, under coach Gernot Rohr, will provide tough competition. Despite missing key players like Aiyegun Tosin and Cdric Hountondji due to injury, they still boast a strong squad. Young talents such as 19-year-old Candas Fiogb, who has been in excellent form for Atalantas U-19 team, and seasoned players like striker Steve Mouni and midfielder Sessi DAlmeida, will be crucial for Benins push for victory.\n\nAfter this game, Zimbabwe will travel to Nigeria to face the three-time African champions on March 25.\n\nThe Warriors are counting on the support of their fans home away from home to help propel them towards a vital victory.Goalkeepers\n\nWashington Arubi (Marumo Gallants), Marley Tavaziva (Brentford), Martin Mapisa (MWOS FC)Imvimbi: Jordan Zemura (Udinese), Divine Lunga (Sundowns), Gerald Takwara (Al Minaa SC), Munashe Garananga (FC Copenhagen, Isheanesu Mauchi (Simba Bhora), Peter Muduhwa (Scottland), Godknows Murwira (Scottland), Emmanuel Jalai (Dynamos)MidfieldersMarshall Munetsi (Wolves ), Andy Rinomhota (Cardiff City), Marvelous Nakamba (Luton Town), Mihood), Tawanda Chirewa (Hudders filli TScottand), Knowledge Musona (Al-Okhdood), Tawanda Chirewa (Huddersfield Town)StrikersPrince Dube (Young Africans), Tawanda Maswanhise (Motherwell), Terrence Dzvukamanja (Supersport United), Tymon Machope (Scottland), Walter Musona (Scottland)-@innocentskizoe\n\n",

The policy will not only protect consumers but also hold businesses accountable for their actions.It aims to promote consumer welfare by ensuring that businesses are responsible for any malpractices.This proactive approach signifies a paradigm shift towards a more transparent and equitable market, he said.The Minister said the policy would serve as the cornerstone for Government efforts to enhance consumer rights and create a more profitable marketplace.We are dedicated to establishing a framework that addresses the diverse needs of consumers, that fosters competition, and that promotes innovation, Minister Ndlovu said.The ministry acknowledges the crucial role played by various sector regulators in ensuring consumer protection.The minister said organisations such as the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe, Consumer Council of Zimbabwe, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority, Environmental Management Agency, and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa had been instrumental in upholding high standards and enforcing regulations.Minister Ndlovu said success in protecting consumer rights would not be possible without the collaborative efforts of the various sector regulators.These organisations have all played a crucial role in ensuring that consumers are treated with fairness and with the respect they deserve, the minister said.\n\n",
