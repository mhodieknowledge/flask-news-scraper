The Speaker of Parliaments lawyers acknowledged the order.\n\nIn the declarator matter, the respondents are required to file their opposing papers by the end of Tuesday, 4 March 2025, while the applicants must file their answering affidavit and heads of argument by close of business on Monday, 10 March 2025.\n\nThe matter has been set down for hearing on Thursday, 13 March 2025. Senator Tshabangu has cited Mr Sesel Zvidzai, Ms Concillia Chinanzvavana, Mr Gilbert Kadogora, Mr Shepherd Mushonga, and the CCC as the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth respondents, respectively. The four individuals were members of the disciplinary committee that expelled him.\n\nThis interim order ensures that Senator Tshabangu retains his parliamentary seat pending the outcome of his legal challenge.\n\n",

Potential reforms to increase tax revenue efficiently and equitably include streamlining corporate tax incentives, strengthening mining, property and wealth taxation, aligning health excise taxes in line with international standards, and improving tax administration using digital technologies, said the bank.\n\nIt also called for improvement in the efficiency of public spending as essential for supporting fiscal consolidation and achieving long-term sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\nThere is potential to improve the Governments allocative efficiency to improve value-for-money in areas such as health care and capital investments.\n\nImprovements in procurement systems, including the use of e-procurement, also present significant opportunities for efficiency savings, said the World Bank.\n\nEfficiency in public services administration is also key, as the Government of Zimbabwes jobs evaluation report suggests there are opportunities to streamline the civil service.\n\nThe progressivity of expenditure policy can also be improved through more and better targeted spending on social protection. The operationalisation of a national social registry could help improve targeting of Zimbabwes current social protection systems and help improve climate resilience.\n\nThe PFR shows that fiscal policy can be a critical anchor for macro-economic stability that can ensure a credible and efficient national budget and assist a stable and competitive currency.\n\nJointly, this would lead to higher growth, major poverty reduction, and a major step toward achieving Zimbabwes development objectives, said the Bank.\n\n",

            "content": "Zvamaida Murwira, Harare Bureau\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) must tame the traffic jungle on the countrys roads through the implementation of the electronic management system and curb the road carnage which has been on the rise over the years, President Mnangagwa has said.\n\nThe Head of State and Government said this yesterday while delivering a keynote address during a police recruit graduation ceremony held at Mkushi Academy.\n\nThe high rate of indiscipline on our roads, which has resulted in the loss of countless lives due to road carnage, is disturbing. More worrisome is the fact that a total of 4 069 people were killed in road traffic accidents in 2024 compared to 2 104 in 2023, reflecting an astonishing 93% increase.\n\nThe ZRP is challenged to tame the traffic jungle by speedily implementing the Electronic Traffic Management System.\n\nI call upon all Zimbabwean citizens to respect the countrys traffic laws and cooperate with law enforcement agencies, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nMost urban roads have seen the heavy presence of pirate vehicles, commonly known as mushikashika and have been a menace for their notoriety in flouting traffic laws, thereby contributing to road carnages.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the recent handover of 500 vehicles for police operations showed Government commitment to ensure that they fulfil their constitutional mandate.\n\nOn its part, Government is fully aware that adequate human capital and material resources are a prerequisite for the ZRP to fulfil their constitutional mandate. Mindful of this, my Administration will ensure that the Force is well equipped with tools of the trade, he said.\n\nThe President said the recent purchase and handover of 500 vehicles for police operations is a clear testimony of the Governments commitment.\n\nIt is my sincere hope that the vehicles distributed across the country have enhanced the operational capacity of the ZRP, he said.\n\nModern ICT hardware and software are now of critical importance to an effective Force, said President Mnangagwa.Therefore, Government is committed to prioritising the deployment of ICT-enabled systems to address challenges and opportunities presented by the ever-changing environment.\n\nThe various high-impact innovations that are being undertaken by the Zimbabwe Republic Police such as the Automated Fingerprint System will aid investigations and subsequent convictions of both first and repeat offenders.\n\nMore innovations of this type should be encouraged to enhance efficiency in the justice delivery system, he said.President Mnangagwa called for discipline among officers, saying it was a cog to a security organisation such as the ZRP, serving as a compass that guides sound actions.\n\nTo that end, he called upon them to shun corruption.As officers in the field, you will encounter all forms and types of temptations that will test your character, judgment, resolve and indeed your patriotism. Remain resolute and demonstrate high levels of integrity.\n\nShun corruption by whatever name. The image of the country and indeed of the Zimbabwe Republic Police rests upon your shoulders. Guard it jealously, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe bemoaned the prevalence of armed robbery cases and urged the ZRP to account for all those committing crime and implored communities to render assistance on crime prevention.\n\nTurning to the renaming of Mkushi Police Academy from Morris Depot in July 2023, President Mnangagwa said that was in line with the deliberate and critical step taken by his administration to memorialise and immortalise the bravery of both living and departed heroes and heroines who fought against colonialism.\n\nThe name Mkushi Police Academy particularly honours the contributions of our gallant daughters who perished in 1978 at the Zipra Mkushi Girls Camp in Zambia.\n\nIt is my hope that the graduating class and indeed the police service as a whole will continue to be inspired and emboldened by the same spirit of courage and selflessness that characterised that generation of the youth at the Mkushi Camp, he said.\n\nThe President challenged the police academy to entrench the values that sustained the countrys liberation struggle, which is an indelible character trait of the nation.\n\nThe many young men and women who pass through these gates are called upon to serve our motherland with honour, dignity and distinction. Patriotism and a deeply rooted sense of nationalism should be fully embraced by police officers, who remain custodians of the peace, security and stability of our country, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa challenged the new Police Commissioner General, Stephen Mutamba to transform the Police Service so that it is best equipped to handle and manage the current security environment, dictated by the ongoing socio-economic developments of the country, and emerging new scenarios at regional and international levels.\n\nPolice recruits march during the ceremony yesterday\n\nHe said it was pleasing that the 907 recruits graduating were drawn from all the countrys ten provinces, in line with the Governments devolution and decentralisation programme.\n\nUnlike yesteryear where physical height and stamina were critical attributes for joining the Force, today policing is no longer a walk in the park. The challenges in this profession now require higher levels of knowledge and broader skills.\n\nHence, the importance of a deliberately designed training curricula that moulds competent and professional police officers. In this regard, it is commendable that the two-year Diploma programme undertaken by the graduating class incorporated an elaborate syllabi of contemporary policing courses, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nSome of the courses include Criminal Law (Codification and Reform Act Chapter 9:23), Police Duties and Investigation, Crime Investigations, Criminal Procedure and the Law of Evidence, Human Rights and Policing, Public Order Management, History of Policing and Civic Education, among others.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said contemporary policing dictates that the police academies leverage on synergies with established academic and training institutions, such as universities, among other stakeholders.\n\nHe hailed the ZRPs continued contribution to regional and global peace through participation in United Nations Peacekeeping Missions saying it was on account of good standing as a professional Force that upholds best practices in policing.\n\nYesterdays event was characterised by various police displays that entertained guests who included parents, spouses and guardians of graduates\n\nThe event was attended by Vice President Kembo Mohadi, Cabinet Ministers, Heads of Government departments, agencies, service chiefs and captains of industry, among others.\n\n",

We have been given 18 months\n\nwithin which to finish the road, said Eng Mbambo.However, the rainy season will also determine when we will start. There is no road work being done during the rainy season.\n\nIm sure all road construction in the country is on hold until after the end of the rainy season.Eng Mbambo said his company is taking a leaf from the Government, which contracted several companies in the construction of the Beitbridge-Harare-Chirundu Highway.\n\nHe said engaging multiple contractors will enable the company to complete the road within the shortest period with each contractor expected to do an average 20km.\n\nWe are finalising the contracts with the contractors. But at the moment it is almost cast in stone, which companies we will be working with. I can say on the main road we have seven companies, said Eng Mbambo.\n\nMost of the companies will be doing around 20KM, but there are two, which will have less. There is a stretch of 20km where there are two companies mainly because the baseline company can only do roadworks and cant do surfacing. So, because we wanted to work with that company, we had to work with another company to finish for them.\n\nHe said seven companies will work on the highway while another will rehabilitate feeder roads. Eng Mbambo assured the public that his company will produce a high-quality concrete asphalt road and contracted companies will only be paid after producing a project of satisfactory results.\n\nWe dont want to do a poor-quality road that will cost us a lot in maintenance. If we do a poor-quality road, it will hit us in our pockets. So, in terms of quality assurance there are several layers, said Eng Mbambo.The basic one is to make sure that we dont pay any contractor who has not done proper quality. We will be paying them in stages and if the stage is not up to quality, we will not pay them, said Eng Mbambo.\n\nHe said the company has also inserted a performance guarantee clause on the contract, which determines that contracted companies will be held accountable for the quality of the road they produce.\n\nOn top of that there will be an independent engineer who will be appointed by the ministry to ensure the quality is up to standard, said Eng Mambo. We are very sure that we will do a good quality road. Old Gwanda Road rehabilitation is a massive project, its the first of its kind in Zimbabwe where a private company is being awarded to upgrade from a dead road to highway and also manage for a 25-period depending on the payback period, he said.\n\nIn this project, we will be working hand in glove with the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development, to make sure that we deliver a quality project and ensure that different stakeholders are happy.\n\nThe road construction is expected to trigger local economic development while unlocking the tourism potential for Matabeleland South.\n\n",

If uncontrolled early enough, it can eat up whole fields, leaving farmers angry, hungry and poorer.\n\nIt is because of its capacity to cause total damage and spread so instantly that it is a notifiable pest in the country.Districts that have been affected include Umguza, Uzumba-Maramba-Pfungwe, Murehwa, Mudzi, Goromonzi, Shamva, Chipinge, Mutasa, Mutare, Chimanimani, Buhera, Chiredzi, Zaka, Bikita, Gutu, Masvingo, Mwenezi, Hwange, Hurungwe, Mazowe, Mberengwa, Guruve, and Zvimba.\n\nIn Mberengwa, an estimated 307 hectares of cereal crops and over 2 400 hectares of grazing land had been affected by Wednesday, we reported yesterday.\n\nThis saddens us a lot because we are losing significant amounts of maize and other grains to this pest. This, as we noted earlier, has significant food security implications. There is a risk that some farmers might not harvest anything in a season that gave us so much rain.\n\nWe recognise the work that the Government is doing to educate farmers on the need to always scout for the pest. If they identify it, they are encouraged to report to authorities given the worms designation as a notifiable pest.In addition, the Government is assisting some growers by spraying pesticide to control it.\n\nThese are important interventions.However, to expect authorities to have enough resources to buy the pesticide, move it to the areas of distress and to then actually have the equipment to apply the pesticide timeously is to expect too much.\n\nThat puts the ball squarely in the farmers fields. It is their ultimate responsibility to, not only scan their fields for the pest but to also raise adequate resources to act against it so that they reap the huge harvest they deserve after the 2024 disaster.We urge our farmers to take it all in their own hands because at the end of the season, the loss is totally theirs if they do not do as we suggest.\n\nIn saying this, we clearly appreciate that some farmers are so poor that the seed maize they planted, now being devoured by the armyworm, was a donation. As such they do not have money to spend on pesticides. We regret that.\n\nBut we have been advised that there are a few, more accessible alternatives to over-the-counter pesticides that they can use to be able to fight off the worm. Applying a bit of soil or cold ash at the heart of the maize crop, the exact spot where the pesticide is sprayed into, can help.\n\nWe have not tested this ourselves, but trying them is more responsible than just waiting for crops to be eaten up.\n\n",

One of my priorities will be the field of the sector of tourism. Greece, as you know, is a touristic country, she said.\n\nOur industry heavily relies on tourism. So, there is a lot of expertise there, and we are very, very happy to share it with our friends and partners. Just to show you an indication of what I mean about tourism in Greece, last year, 35 million people visited Greece.\n\nAmbassador Farrou added: 35 million is a lot of people, and Greece is a small, medium country, so you understand how important hospitality and tourism is for us and what kind of expertise my country has in this sector.\n\nThe Greece Ambassador to Zimbabwe said another area on which they will explore possibilities to enhance relations is agriculture. Ambassador Farrou said apart from that, they believe a lot in people-to-people contacts.\n\nSo, this is something which is also very high in my agenda, and this means that we will try to see how we can increase the number of scholarships that we provide to Zimbabwean students, she said.\n\nMs Meza said Zimbabwe and Cuba have very historical and strong ties.My task will be to strengthen them. We share a lot of values. We are very close. We also share some things, unfortunately, like the sanctions. We will fight, we will continue fighting against that, she said.\n\nWe think we can cooperate more with biotech and industry, also science and technologies, and also deepen the ties we already have in health and in education. We have to improve our economic relations at the same level as the political one.Cuba and Zimbabwe this year will celebrate 45 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations which are rock-solid.\n\n",

Dube denied the charges but was found guilty after overwhelming evidence was presented in court.The goods were stolen between August 2023 and March last year.\n\nHowever, five years of Dubes sentence were suspended on condition of good behaviour, meaning he will serve an effective 10-year jail term.\n\nIn passing the sentence, Mr Chikwekwe said Dube deserved a lengthy custodial sentence, which serves as a stern warning to potential offenders.\n\nThe prosecutor, Mr Milton Moyo, said Dube systematically targeted vehicles across Bulawayo, using various break-in methods to steal valuables, including mobile phones, laptops, cash, and vehicle accessories such as wheels.The thefts involved breaking into 43 separate motor vehicles, from which Dube stole various items. He used different techniques, including smashing windows and picking locks, to gain access, said Mr Moyo.\n\nDubes crime spree began in August 2023, with the first recorded theft involving property worth US$420, of which US$400 was later recovered. Between the second and 30th counts, he stole goods valued at US$83 590, though less than half was recovered.\n\nThe remaining 13 thefts, recorded from count 31 to 43, contributed significantly to the total stolen amount.His crimes came to light in March 2024 when one of the victims reported a break-in, prompting investigations that eventually linked Dube to the series of thefts.\n\n",

The money they have poured into the club will be used towards the welfare of the first team while we continue to negotiate with our principal sponsors, Sakunda Holdings over a new deal, said Mhlophe.\n\nDespite the positive news on sponsorship, Highlanders players are still owed two months salaries.However, Mhlophe assured fans that the club is doing everything possible to resolve the situation.\n\nWe are grateful to Kings Bullion for coming on board and we are hopeful the sponsorship will go a long way in assisting the team during the course of the season. We are doing all in our power to ensure our players are paid all they are owed and are ready to deliver positive results. Despite the tough situation we find ourselves in, I am happy the players have shown commitment to work while we resolve the situation said Mhlophe.\n\nHighlanders are also actively working on securing sponsorship for their womens and junior teams.We are doing our best to ensure our junior teams and ladies teams also get sponsorship.
