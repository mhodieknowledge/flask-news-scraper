Her performance, themed Shades of Blue, will delve into the complexities of mental health, addressing depression, anxiety, and the struggles of self-acceptance.\n\nThe upcoming performance promises to be an emotional journey as Sisa explores the realities of growing up with a creative mind.The audience can expect an intense and heartfelt experience, a journey through the good, the bad, and the ugly of mental health, she shared.\n\nI want to take them on a path of self-discovery, to help them see that they are not alone in their struggles.\n\nFor Sisa, poetry is not just about expression  its about connection.Performing never gets easier, no matter how many times you do it, she admitted.\n\nBut the challenge is something I embrace. Its a thrill that never gets old, and its what keeps me going.With Shades of Blue, Sisa aims to spark important conversations about mental health, self-acceptance, and the power of words to heal.\n\nHer poetry journey began at the age of 14 when she turned to writing as an emotional outlet.I started writing poetry as a way to express feelings I couldnt talk about. It was my escape, my sanctuary. Poetry allowed me to process my emotions and make sense of the world around me, she explained.\n\nOver the years, Sisa has refined her craft, competing in poetry slams and performing at various events. Her talent was recognised last year with the Outstanding Poet award at the Pumula Royal Arts and Community Awards (Praca).Winning the Praca was surreal. It validated all the hard work and dedication Ive put into my craft. It reminded me that my words have the power to impact others. Thats a responsibility I take seriously, and it drives me to keep creating poetry that is honest, raw, and relatable, she said.\n\n",

It was his first goal of the season, a moment of relief for the Warriors forward, who opted not to celebrate out of respect for his former side.\n\nBut Francis Mustafa struck back for Yadah before the break, ensuring the game ended with honours even.\n\nThe result leaves Scottland on 11 points from a possible 18  two behind early pacesetters Ngezi Platinum Stars, who stumbled to a 2-1 defeat away to TelOne.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the draw did not sit well with some of the clubs supporters, but Ndiraya called for calm, urging fans to give him time to build a cohesive unit.\n\nWe would have really wanted three points, but a point is still good for us. Out of a possible 18, we are on 11  for me, thats a good start, he said.\n\nThe championship-winning gaffer insists theres no need to panic.\n\nWe have a long way to go. Weve only played six games, so theres really nothing much to talk about. I think between now and Match Day 17, theres going to be a lot of movement in the top half of the log.\n\nNdiraya acknowledged the quality within his ranks, but emphasized that individual brilliance alone wont carry them far.\n\nOf course, weve got good players, but just having quality isnt enough if we dont play as a team. Were in the process of getting the group to gel. Probably after Match Day 10, well be talking about a different Scottland.\n\nYadah, despite facing a star-studded Scottland line-up that featured captain Walter Musona, Tichaona Chipunza, and the rock-solid Peter Muduhwa, held their own throughout the contest.\n\nThe Miracle Boys nearly snatched it at the death when Anotidaishe Gwatidzos corner kick was cleared off the line. Billiat had also missed a late headed opportunity just before that moment.\n\nIn the critical phase of the game, we conceded a goal we shouldve avoided. In the second half, we pushed for a winner but lacked sharpness. I felt we had two or three good chances that we didnt convert, reflected Ndiraya.\n\nHe admitted the substitutes didnt have the desired impact.\n\nIn the last 15 minutes, I thought we dominated midfield, but those who came on didnt give us what we were looking for.\n\nYadah coach Ikabort Masocha welcomed the point after a narrow 0-1 loss to Greenfuel in their previous fixture.\n\nIts a positive result for us, especially after the loss in Chisumbanje. We needed to add to our tally and try to move away from the relegation zone, he said.\n\nAs has become customary, the VIP enclosure at Rufaro was packed with celebrities and socialites. Among the crowd was Zimdancehall sensation Kevin Killer T Kusikwenyu, who added star power to a tense afternoon that ended in shared spoils.\n\n",
