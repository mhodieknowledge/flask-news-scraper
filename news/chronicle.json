            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza,[emailprotected]\n\nA BOY from New Lobengula suburb in Bulawayo was on Tuesday reportedly swept away by flash floods near his home.\n\nThe boy, believed to be between three and four years old, is suspected to have been carried away by strong water currents after falling into a storm drainage system.\n\nA team of firefighters from the Bulawayo Fire Brigade was deployed to search for the child in a small stream along Luveve Road, where his body is feared to be trapped. However, overgrown grass and thick vegetation hindered the operation as the team combed through the area at around 5pm yesterday.\n\nAccording to a local resident, the boys mother had sent him to the shops in the company of a young friend before the rains started. Concern grew when the children took too long to return home.\n\nThe boys took too long to return and the mother got worried and started asking around. When the other boy was questioned, he revealed that his friend had fallen into the storm drain, said the resident.\n\nResidents immediately formed a search party, scouring the vicinity where the child was last seen. Despite their efforts, they could not locate him, prompting an urgent call to the Fire Brigade.\n\nBulawayo chief officer, Mr Mhlangano Moyo, confirmed that a team was searching both the small stream and the drainage system that runs from New Lobengula into parts of Luveve suburb.\n\nWe received a call about a missing child who is believed to have been swept away by rainwater into a storm drain. Our team is on the ground conducting a thorough search. Further updates will be provided as soon as new information emerges, he said.\n\nFor now, we are treating this as a missing child case.\n\nThe childs mother was too distraught to speak to the news crew.\n\n",

            "content": "The nation is mourning following the death of the former Governor of Manicaland Province, Cde Tinaye Elisha Nzirasha Chigudu, on February 5.\n\nHe passed on at his home in Harare after a long battle with cancer. He was 82.\n\nHe was declared a national hero and was buried yesterday at the National Shrine.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn Elisha Nzirasha Chigudu, Cde Tinaye, was born on August 13 1942, in Chigudu Village, Makoni, in Manicaland to Lancelot Tafiramambo Chigudu and Naume Chigudu (ne Chinono). His nom de guerre was Cde Tinaye Mutete.\n\nHe was the fourth born in a family of seven children  Eva, Edgar, Cecilia, Aenias, Agatha and Agnes.\n\nIn 1953, young Elisha enrolled for primary education at Chigudu Primary School in Chiendambuya area, Makoni District.\n\nIn 1958, he transferred to Cyrene Mission in Matabeleland South. The school was established to cater for African boys and focused on practical agricultural education.\n\nIt was one of the first mission schools to offer art as a subject to young African learners during racial segregation.\n\nDuring this period, young Elisha developed a keen interest in politics.\n\nIrked by the rampant racial segregation which was synonymous with the then Rhodesian government, Elisha joined the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU) Youth League in 1959.\n\nIn 1960, he enrolled for secondary education at Harare Secondary School.\n\nPre-independence political life\n\nAs the impetus of the War of Liberation gathered momentum and the quest for liberation penetrated through all corners of the country, politics became a topical subject at several schools.\n\nAs was the norm, young Elisha and fellow students started attending political gatherings.\n\nIn 1963, he participated in a student protest against the oppressive laws which resulted in his expulsion from school.\n\nPolitical polarisation frenzied by racial discrimination brewed in young Elisha the zeal to join the liberation struggle.\n\nIn 1964, the youthful Elisha crossed the border into Zambia to join the liberation struggle.\n\nHe was among a group of 10 cadres who were selected to undergo military training in North Korea. The group included Cdes Lazarus Dhlakama, David Mongwa Moyo and others.\n\nUpon completion of training, Cde Chigudu returned to then Rhodesia in early 1965.\n\nHe was deployed as an intelligence operative in Salisbury.\n\nThe critical information he gathered regarding the modus operandi of the racist Rhodesian forces assisted the operations of freedom fighters and recruitment of youths for military training.\n\nIn May 1965, he was arrested and detained in Gonakudzingwa, Gwelo (now Gweru) and Whawha Prisons where he stayed for 12 years.\n\nCde Chigudu was released in early 1977 and later that same year he married his long-time sweetheart Esther Dumba.\n\nIn late 1977, he crossed into Zambia again to resume his duties of the armed War of Liberation.\n\nHe had taken advantage of his time in prison to complete secondary education. The party (ZIPRA) had made a decision to have educated cadres in its ranks who would assist in execution of the war.\n\nIn 1978, Cde Chigudu was selected to go and pursue a Bachelor of Laws Honours Degree in the United Kingdom at Exeter University.\n\nPost-Independence political life\n\nIn late 1981, Cde Chigudu returned to Zimbabwe and joined the civil service as under Secretary (Legal Affairs) in the Ministry of Transport.\n\nHe was later appointed deputy secretary for Home Affairs. In 1994, Cde Chigudu was appointed Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs, a post he held until 2004.\n\nIn the same year, Cde Chigudu was appointed Permanent Secretary for Mines and Mining Development. In 2005, he was appointed Governor for Manicaland until his retirement in 2008.\n\nCde Chigudu served ZANU PF in various portfolios among them Manicaland Provincial Chairman.\n\nHe also worked as a senior consultant under the United Nations Development Programme to structure the Ministry of Interior for South Sudan.\n\nHero status\n\nFollowing the death of Chigudu, President Mnangagwa said; Cde Chigudu was a principled cadre who served the ruling ZANU PE Party and the Government with unquestionable allegiance, loyalty and dedication. He was a fountain of wisdom who offered wise counsel and advice in conducting both Party and Government business, drawing from his vast experiences\n\nIn recognition if his illustrious service before and after Independence, the Politburo unanimously declared him National Hero.\n\nHe is survived by wife Esther Chigudu (ne Dumba), seven children namely Tafadzwa Tonderayi, Tatenda, Tsitsi, Tawanda, Tinashe, Rudo and six grandchildren.

The use of drones has allowed us to detect smuggling activities with precision and speed, ensuring that illicit goods never make it into the market, said the Commissioner General.\n\nSmuggling is not just about tax evasionits an attack on Zimbabwes economy, local industries, and the safety of our communities. Through this collaborative approach, we are sending a strong message: Zimbabwes borders will not be a playground for criminals.\n\nMs Chinamasa said the latest intelligence-driven operation targeted five notorious smuggling corridors, informally known as Valley 1 & 2, Proof, Godfather, and Thembani.\n\nAt these illegal crossing points, surveillance teams uncovered a fleet of inflatable boats strategically positioned on both the South African and Zimbabwean sides; vehicles on standby, ready to transport smuggled goods inland; and donkey-drawn carts, motor vehicles, and boats being used to ferry illicit goods across the border.\n\nThe Commissioner General emphasised that such smuggling operations threaten local businesses, flood the market with untaxed goods, weaken Zimbabwean manufacturers, and deprive the government of much-needed revenue for essential services.\n\nThis operation underscores the effectiveness of multi-agency cooperation in tackling illicit trade. Zimra, border security forces, law enforcement agencies, and local intelligence teams have intensified their efforts, working hand-in-hand to disrupt smuggling syndicates and uphold economic integrity, said Ms Chinamasa.\n\nShe added that the revenue collector will continue to intensify aerial patrols, deploy more drones, and increase joint border operations with security agencies to completely dismantle smuggling syndicates.\n\nFurthermore, she emphasised that the integration of AI-driven analytics and night-time drone surveillance will further bolster enforcement efforts, ensuring that smugglers have nowhere to hide.\n\nSmuggling is not just a crimeits economic sabotage, Ms Chinamasa stated. Those engaging in these illegal activities must understand that the net is tightening. We will find you, we will stop you, and we will ensure that Zimbabwes legitimate businesses and economy are protected.\n\nWe remain committed to facilitating legitimate trade while aggressively combating smuggling. The agency calls upon all citizens, businesses, and stakeholders to report smuggling activities and support ongoing efforts to secure the nations borders.\n\n",
