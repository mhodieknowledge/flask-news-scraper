            "content": "By Sam Matsekete\n\nOLD Mutuals interest in renewable energy has been established over a period now, and we continue that commitment. Firstly, within the Old Mutual operations themselves, we seek to uphold responsible business practices, and we are looking at how we can ensure that we are climate-friendly in the ways that we conduct business. One way is transitioning our sources of energy to renewable and clean energy.\n\nSo, we have invested in sources of renewable energy within the group, solar plants at our head office and other major offices. We can count up to 1.4 megawatts of power that is deployed within our buildings and our offices for the benefit of ourselves as the operators in those premises, or our clients who also occupy that space. And this is really what we are doing to demonstrate that commitment internally.\n\nThis is in addition to other initiatives to ensure that we will pursue the sustainability agenda strongly.\n\nThe second level is in terms of how we have supported investments in renewable energy. We have invested in hydro plants, in a hydro plant for example, in Manicaland.\n\nWe have invested in a solar plant in Hwange. We have invested in solar plants in Masvingo, in Matabeleland in the south, and some close to Harare.\n\nWe are counting now up to 43 megawatts over the recent past that we have delivered onto the grid or into microgrids as well. And we continue that agenda. We have a pipeline of projects.\n\nJust recently we have added another two to the pipeline of continuing work that we are embarking on.\n\nThe other level that I would like to talk about is the role that we seek to play as Old Mutual to assist in the gathering of funds or pooling of resources to deploy into infrastructure related to renewable energy. So, an example of that was the launch of the Renewable Energy Fund that we did last year.\n\nAnd in this fund, we have partnered with the government, and we have got private sector players, private investors, also coming on board.\n\nThis is a US$100 million fund, and we are also partnering with United Nations agencies in it.\n\nCurrently committed to the fund is about US$21 million, and we continue to mobilize more. We have got about US$10 million of that already allocated, and we are now seeking to make sure that we deploy the balance of whats been committed, even as we are growing the fund.\n\nIt is a blended financing structure if you like to call it that. Blended in the sense that we have got participants who are primarily looking for social impacts. And the nature of the funding in terms of returns, they are also placing a lot of emphasis on the social impacts.\n\nWe have got the Government coming in, and they are also seeking outcomes within the social impacts space as well as in terms of how they will support private sector investors to also come in and enjoy the blended rates that we get out of the fund.\n\nThen we have private sector players seeking economic returns, even as they are also conscious about the sustainability impacts r from this fund.\n\nIt is a fund that we are prioritizing very highly as one of the efforts we are undertaking over the next few years. And if we can get this one right, we believe it will catalyze the scaling up of the funds that will be channeled into renewable energy.You will also see us intervening in terms of how we promote startups in the renewable energy value chain.\n\nWe do have at Eight2Five Innovation Hub participants who come from the renewable energy value chain. And they are showcasing their ideas.\n\nWe profile their projects and we get them to start to access support in financial resources as well.\n\n",

The moment became overwhelming for Tshuma, who broke into tears, embracing her husband as music filled the air.\n\nMkandla and Tshuma began their journey on April 10, 2024, in South Africa. From there, they cycled through Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya, facing harsh weather, language barriers, and health scares along the way.We were discouraged by many who said cycling was for white people. But we stayed committed, said the couple.\n\nWe faced food poisoning, malaria, and even struggled to find camping spaces in highly populated areas, but we pressed on.Their love for travel was their biggest motivation.We discovered that we both love exploring, and that was the major inspiration behind this journey. We chose bicycles because they allowed us to interact with locals, explore remote areas, and truly experience each country.\n\nThroughout the journey, the couple immersed themselves in new languages, cultures, and currencies. They shared how this broadened their view of the continent.We learnt how Zambias currency works and appreciated the different lifestyles. While we share many similarities across Africa, each country also has its unique identity.\n\nThey also challenged misconceptions perpetuated by online sources.Malawi is often labelled one of the poorest countries, but we found it to be one of the most affordable places to live. The people are resourceful and navigate life with admirable strength.\n\nOne of their most memorable experiences was meeting the Maasai people in Tanzania.Tanzania was the highlight. We visited Lake Kosi, a volcanic lake shaped like the African map. Its a sacred place, no living creatures are found in it. The beauty of Tanzania and the warmth of its people left a lasting impression.\n\nThis journey was not just about travel, it was a celebration of love, resilience, and the unbreakable spirit of unity. Mkandla and Tshuma have proven that with passion and partnership, no dream is too far to chase, even by bicycle.\n\nThe couple has already hit the ground running, and those attending the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair will have a chance to meet them, as they are participating in this years exhibition.\n\n",

However, the term was reduced on condition he does not commit a similar offence within the next five years.\n\nBulawayo magistrate Mrs Eva Matura delivered the ruling on Wednesday, after Khumalo, of Pumula South suburb, was convicted on two counts of theft of trust property.\n\nProsecutor Mr Samuel Mpofu outlined the offences, which took place in 2024.\n\nThe first incident occurred on 26 April 2024, when Khumalo was entrusted with a Ford Ranger by his client, Mr Alec Chayukebawa. He was asked to sell the car for US$5 400 which he did but he did not give Mr Chayukebawa the money.\n\nThe second offence involved a Toyota Allion, valued at US$6 400, which he received from Mr Thadeous Ndlovu under similar terms. Once again, he sold the vehicle but did not surrender the money to Mr Ndlovu.\n\nMrs Matura said Khumalos conduct was a serious breach of trust, which soiled the reputation of car dealers in Bulawayo.\n\nShe said there was a need to pass a sentence that served as a warning to those who did notvalue integrity in business.\n\nTrust is the foundation of any transaction.
