This electrifying launch promises to captivate hearts and minds!\n\nThe launch event, held in August at the Filabusi Centre District Hall, drew a substantial crowd, marking a significant step in the fight against the rampant drug crisis in Zimbabwe.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Chronicle Showbiz, Masuku expressed his elation over the successful turnout, stating, It was heartwarming to see so many people come together under the theme Kasiphumeni kuzidakamizwaLets desist from drugs and substance abuse. This shows that our community is ready to engage in this crucial conversation.\n\nThe 202-page novel not only aligns with the governments zero-tolerance approach to drug abuse but also aims to resonate with readers on a personal level.\n\nMasuku, who serves as a Poultry and Piggery Supervisor at Gwanda State University, has ambitious plans to translate the novel into other languages, including Venda, Nambya, and Shona.\n\nThese languages are predominantly spoken in the border towns where drug abuse is most prevalent. I believe that translating this work will help reach a wider audience and make a more significant impact, he explained.\n\nHe, however, stated that his vision does not stop at the written word, adding that he is already in talks to adapt Mhla Zinhlanu kuLwezi into a thrilling movie.\n\nWhile there are no auditions yet for the film crew, Masuku is optimistic about starting the filming process early next year, pending the completion of translation discussions.\n\nI want to partner with donors to bring this story to the big screen. The idea is still on paper for now, as we are working on securing finances for the project.The film will be released in episodes, allowing us to engage viewers in a unique way. As soon as an episode is completed, well release it based on industry advice and audience feedback, he added with enthusiasm.\n\nAs the conversation around drug awareness continues to grow, Masukus novel and upcoming film promise to be powerful tools in the fight against substance abuse. Were not just telling a story; were igniting a movement, he concluded, embodying the spirit of change that is so desperately needed in todays society.\n\nStay tuned for more updates on Mhla Zinhlanu kuLwezi as it makes its way from page to screen, inspiring hope and resilience in the face of adversity. @TeamKarubwa\n\n",

The President expressed these sentiments during a festive Boxing Day gathering where he honoured the Mbare Chimurenga Choir for its invaluable contributions to Zimbabwes rich tapestry of culture and national identity.\n\nThe President also underscored the significance of the cultural creative industries, highlighting their role as engines of economic growth and innovation. He emphasised that these sectors not only foster artistic expression but also promote social cohesion and preserve Zimbabwes unique identity.\n\nAs you are aware, the cultural creative industries play a vital role in society by fostering economic growth through creative outputs such as music, art, design, fashion, and film, among others. They also contribute significantly to social cohesion, cultural identity, innovation, and individual well-being by nurturing creativity, expression, and engagement within communities.\n\nHonouring the Mbare Chimurenga Choir is appreciation, through them, of the many musicians and artistes who continue to use their artistic talents to defend the gains of our Independence and advance our national development identity, image, and culture.\n\nIt was in residential areas such as Mbare, Highfields, Makokoba, Mpopoma, Mtapa, and Sakubva, among others, where the flames for Independence were kept ablaze before and during our protracted war of liberation, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe said through song and dance, young people were mobilised to go for military training and subsequently to fight for the freedom of the country.\n\nIn the post-Independence era, said President Mnangagwa, it is groups and musicians such as the Mbare Chimurenga Choir who used their exceptional talent to promote cultural diversity and rally younger generations around the various national development periods.\n\nHe congratulated the Mbare Chimurenga Choir for the consistency with which it has utilised its musical talent for the good of the country and the ruling Zanu-PF party.\n\nYour music with its educating lyrics is a symbol of the hope and resilience that inspires countless individuals to remain patriotic and safeguard our beloved nation. The performance you have delivered over the years inculcates the values of unity, resilience, and love. Your revolutionary spirit is a beacon of light and hope.\n\nIt is also a reminder of our collective history, our shared struggles, as well as a celebration of our resilience and determination to build a better Zimbabwe. I applaud you for your current efforts and music compilations which highlight our ongoing national development agenda, vision, policies, and programmes. Through your efforts along with others in the creative cultural industries, the nation must remain galvanised towards the attainment of our vision of a prosperous and empowered upper-middle-income economy, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe also handed over gifts to the choir and encouraged them to carry the message of love, unity, and the need to accelerate development in the country, continuing to uplift one another and embrace the values being nurtured by the Second Republic.\n\nGoing forward, I urge you to continue infusing the new crop of musicians, particularly the youth, into your groups. It is equally important that you broaden the reach of your music, riding on the diversity of ICT platforms.\n\nAs I hand over these gifts, we acknowledge the tireless efforts of each and every one of you. Your dedication to Zanu-PF programmes is commendable and your performances have been a source of joy and entertainment for many, said President Mnangagwa.\n\n",

The second helicopter is anticipated to arrive in Bulawayo shortly.\n\nTogether, the two air medical rescue service helicopters will provide rapid medical assistance for serious incidents such as road traffic accidents throughout the Matabeleland region.\n\nThese helicopters are part of a larger fleet of six that will be dispatched across four stations, including Harare, Manicaland, Victoria Falls, and Bulawayo.\n\nThe helicopter will be based here in Bulawayo. This is a Presidential project and we are working on his instructions, said Rusanov.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa and the Government have embarked on a mission to modernise Zimbabwes healthcare systemto achieve the goal of becoming a modern, prosperous, and industrialised country by 2030.\n\nTo this end, the President visited Russia in June to seek investors to establish an air ambulance service.\n\nRussian HeliDrive Air Ambulance Medical Services promptly collaborated with Zimbabwe to establish an efficient air ambulance service equipped with highly skilled medical doctors, nurses, engineers, dispatchers, and pilots.\n\nThe Russian Air Ambulance Service has been in operation for nine years and has a fleet of over 100 medical helicopters, dedicated to saving lives throughout Russia.\n\nThe company has recruited and trained local personnel, including 40 pilots, 50 doctors, 100 nurses, 100 dispatchers, and 10 engineers, to handle the air medical services.\n\nAir ambulances are typically reserved for transporting patients from inadequate levels of care to higher levels of care or for patients who are unable to use commercial flights due to their medical condition.\n\nThese specialised aircraft are designed to overcome geographical barriers and provide the same level of medical care available in an intensive care unit.\n\nThe air ambulance service was launched in Zimbabwe in August in conjunction with the 44th SADC summit.\n\nThe helicopters are equipped with advanced medical facilities and staffed by trained medical personnel. One of the first successful missions was the transportation of a cardiac arrest patient from Chegutu to Harare in 20 minutes, which is significantly faster than the two-hour road journey.\n\nAlthough Winos Dube, chairperson of the Bulawayo Residents Association (Bura), recognised the significance of the arrival of the air ambulance, he emphasised the importance of providing equitable access to critical services.\n\nWe applaud the Government on this. We, however, hope that every person who needs emergency medical attention will access this. It must not be based on ones position in society but generally, we are excited as its presence will indeed save lives, said Dube.\n\n",

His century was brought up in style, with a six in the 135th over while batting with Trevor Gwandu.\n\nThe shot almost resulted in his dismissal, but the fielder stepped on the boundary rope while holding onto the ball.\n\nThis historic feat is not only a testament to Bennetts individual talent but also a milestone for the Zimbabwean team. Alongside captain Craig Ervine and Sean Williams, Bennett is part of a team that has made history by posting their highest-ever Test score, with three centurions in an innings for the first time.\n\nBennetts rise to prominence has been swift. He made his First-Class debut for Mega Market Mountaineers in 2022, scoring 28 runs in his first match. To date, he has played 12 First-Class matches, accumulating 725 runs, including two centuries and four half-centuries. His best score in four-day cricket is 264 not out, and he boasts an impressive average of 40.21.\n\nBennett made his Test debut against Ireland in Belfast in July and has been widely touted as Zimbabwes next big thing across all three formats.

Tourists enjoyed an array of experiences, from bungee jumping and gorge swings to the thrilling Flight of Angels helicopter ride. Others took in game drives, interacted with wildlife, or simply marvelled at the magnificent waterfall. Victoria Falls delivered something for everyone  whether it was adrenaline or relaxation.\n\nVictoria Falls proved once more why it remains a top destination for holidaymakers seeking both relaxation and adventure. The resort city welcomed a mix of visitors including groups, families, schools, and individuals. Home to one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, known locally as Mosi-oa-Tunya (The Smoke That Thunders), Victoria Falls boasts unparalleled natural beauty, wildlife, and adventure opportunities.\n\nIn recent months, misleading reports have circulated, claiming the waterfall is drying up. However, these claims dont reflect the true picture. The Zambezi River, which feeds the Victoria Falls, experiences seasonal fluctuations and while water levels are lower between October and January, this is completely natural. According to the Zambezi River Authority, water levels are expected to rise again in February, bringing Victoria Falls back to its thunderous grandeur just in time for the rainy season.\n\nThough water levels were lower this season due to the effects of climate change and El Nio, Victoria Falls remained a vibrant, thriving destination. Despite recent negative publicity suggesting that the Falls are dry, these claims are misleading, considering the Zambezi Rivers seasonal flow patterns and the influx of tourists.\n\nVisitors were undeterred by the reduced flow, continuing to flock to the area to enjoy the lush landscapes, abundant wildlife, and thrilling experiences. Victoria Falls continues to draw visitors year-round, offering unforgettable experiences that highlight its enduring magnificence.\n\nAccording to the Zambezi River Authority, the amount of water in the Falls is low between October and January as part of its natural cycle.\n\nThe Zambezi River, Africas fourth-longest, flows through Zambia, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.\n\nVictoria Falls, the worlds largest curtain of falling water, sees its flow down the waterfall dip below 1 000 cubic metres per second during the dry season extending between October and January, with levels expected to rise again by late February.\n\nThe worst seasons were 2016-2017 and 2023-2024 as a result of the devastating climate change and El Nio-induced drought, with this years levels in the same range. The 2008-2009 season had the highest low levels compared to other years during the period October to January. Water levels are expected to pick up next month and reach a peak at the end of February when the river will be full until May when it will start falling again. The long-term mean was highest in the 1961-1962 rainy season when water flowing down the waterfall between March and May reached a peak of more than 8 000 cubic metres per second. Every year there is less than 1 000 cubic metres per second of water falling down the waterfall between October and December.\n\nCurrent water levels on the Zambezi River are 475,83 metres compared to 477,16 metres last year during the same period, according to the Zambezi River Authority.\n\nThe dry season, which occurs annually, is a natural part of the Victoria Falls seasonal cycle which tourists flock to witness while enjoying the lush green landscapes and abundant wildlife within the Victoria Falls National Park. During the rainy season, the waterfall returns to its thundering grandeur, with its mist visible from miles away  an experience that continues to leave visitors in awe. Despite these natural fluctuations and the misleading reports, Victoria Falls remains a bustling hub of activity. Visitors have not been deterred as hotels and lodges on either side of the river reported steady bookings, and tour operators were busier than ever, showing that the destination offers much more than just its water levels.\n\nEphias Mambume, president of the Employers Association for the Tourism and Safari Operators, highlighted the surge in local and regional tourists during the festive season.\n\nWe have experienced a healthy percentage around 80 to 90 percent occupancy, he said, noting significant bookings in AirBnBs and a bustling Rainforest area with regional visitors. Popular activities included sunset cruises and tours of the Victoria Falls, with operators fully booked, said Mr Mambume. He implored the Government to urgently rehabilitate the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls highway for seamless travel.\n\nElephant and Cheetah Experience marketing manager Janice Ncube noted that the majority of clients this season were locals eager to interact and walk with cheetahs and elephants.\n\nThe local market has been awesome. If it wasnt for the local market, December would be a low season for us, she said.\n\nTourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Barbara Rwodzi, who spent nearly a week in Victoria Falls until Christmas Eve, affirmed that the influx of visitors was a result of vigorous marketing and President Mnangagwas policy of engagement and re-engagement.\n\nMinister Barbara Rwodzi\n\nIt shows that people love Zimbabwe and they have been waiting to hear whats good about Zimbabwe. The foreign policy that President Mnangagwa has been running with for the past seven years, Zimbabwe is Open to Business is paying dividends, she said.\n\nThe festive seasons vibrancy in Victoria Falls demonstrated the destinations resilience and enduring appeal, ensuring it remains a top choice for holidaymakers from around the globe. @ncubeleon\n\n",
