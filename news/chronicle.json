Its entertainment. I dont write with the aim of teaching a lesson, she said. But if people take something meaningful from it, then Im happy, she said\n\nHer writing, however, is anything but surface-level.\n\nIn Heart in Two 2, Maphosa dives deep into grief, betrayal, loyalty, the haunting weight of secrets and the power of forgiveness.\n\nHer characters wrestle with not just matters of the heart, but also generational trauma, hidden legacies and the burden of blood ties.\n\nThese stories are fiction, yes, but theyre also a mirror. They are a reflection of the emotional reality many people live in silence, she said.\n\nReflecting on her previous works, Maphosa discussed the themes explored in her different books.\n\nIn The Y in Your Man is Silent series, she delves into the intricacies of relationships marked by infidelity, offering a rare perspective on the experience of being the other woman.\n\nThrough the eyes of a young woman entangled with a married man, Maphosa examines the emotional tension, identity struggles, and battles with self-worth that unfold in the shadows of secrecy.\n\nThe Y in Your Man is Silent navigates the blurred lines between love, desire and deception, revealing how loyalty and morality are tested when emotions run deep.\n\nThe Grasping at Straws series explores the clash between tradition and progress within a rural village context. It highlights the challenges of navigating patriarchal systems upheld by tradition, while striving for agency, education and self-determination. Themes of gender inequality, cultural expectations, the spiritual weight of ancestral beliefs, forgiveness, piety, and the role of African Traditional Religion are tackled, illustrating the deep emotional and cultural conflicts faced by those attempting to break free from societal constraints.\n\nIn the Heart in Two series, Maphosa explores the emotional and psychological aftermath of trauma, focusing on how violence, family secrets, betrayal, grief, and unresolved pain affect personal growth and relationships. The series delves into the complexities of gang life and social unrest, weaving themes of forgiveness, redemption, and resilience. It also explores the emotional challenge of being torn between two relationships and how love can develop across social divides and defy expectations. Heart in Two offers a powerful exploration of the emotional endurance required to confront the past, heal and move forward.\n\nMaphosa is also a dedicated literary mentor and advocate for emerging voices, passionate about making literature more accessible and relatable. Through initiatives like the Luvone Writing Competition, masterclasses, and regular X (Twitter) Spaces, she nurtures new talent and champions authentic African storytelling.\n\nMaphosa is a recipient of the Outstanding Author Award at the Zimbabwe Achievers Awards and Outstanding Literary Work at the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards. These accolades recognise her compelling storytelling, cultural authenticity, and invaluable contributions to shaping modern African literature.\n\nOn the topic of adapting her books for the screen, she remains hopeful.Its still a dream at this point, but I have a good feeling. It will happen in due time, she said.\n\nCurrently, shes working on the third instalment of her acclaimed series: The y in your man is silent and on a non-fiction memoir reflecting on her childhood.\n\nMaphosas books are available in major bookstores in South Africa, online retailers such as TakeALot, Amazon and from book stores in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini (Swaziland).\n\nReaders can interact with Yvonne Maphosa on social media:Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook: @Yvonne_Maphosa.\n\n-@TeamKarubwa\n\n",

We are one!What a powerful statement echoed multiple times by Mozambican President Daniel Francisco Chapo in his keynote address at the official opening of the 65th edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) in Bulawayo yesterday.\n\nThe visiting Mozambican leader was the guest of honour at the countrys oversubscribed premier trade and investment expo.He emphasised that the two neighbouring states not only share a border, but also possess deep-rooted political, economic and cultural ties dating back to pre-independence era.\n\nSpeaking in Portuguese with the aid of an interpreter, President Chapo spoke at length about the relationship between the two countries, and urged further improvement to achieve mutually beneficial trade and foreign direct investment flows.Its a fact that co-operation with the Republic of Zimbabwe has great significance for Mozambique, not only because of the sharing of common borders, but also because of the deep historical ties of political, economic and cultural coexistence, which date back to the times of the national liberation struggle which, over the decades, have translated into active and mutual support in the defence and consolidation of our sovereignties and have crystallised in close co-operation at bilateral, regional and continental levels, said President Chapo.\n\nOur presence at this important fair represents our determination to boost and facilitate trade between Mozambique and Zimbabwe in particular, and with the world in general, as well as to attract foreign direct investment from Zimbabwe and the countries represented here in agriculture, industry, transport and logistics sectors, among other sectors.\n\nHe said the cordial bilateral relations between the two countries should stimulate higher commercial gains through economic complementarity and the creation of economies of scale leveraging available natural resources, existing infrastructure and logistical means, with emphasis on the Beira Corridor.\n\nPresident Chapo noted that the ZITF 2025 was being hosted just a few days after the celebration of the 45th anniversary of Zimbabwes Independence Day, similar to Mozambiques scheduled hosting of the 60th edition of the Maputo International Trade Fair, which takes place from August 25 to 31 this year in Maputo.\n\nThe neighbouring country will be celebrating 50 years of its independence, marking a point of intersection between the two countries.\n\nDespite the geographical proximity, the immense natural and strategic resources yet to be explored, and the historical political ties of friendship between our countries, our trade relations and investments are still incipient and consist of low value-added products, mostly commodities, and with no record of any notable change in their structure or composition over the last few years, as can be seen in the data we present below, in terms of the trade balance and foreign direct investment flows, said President Chapo.\n\nOur participation in this event has the central objective of gathering the experiences of the main stakeholders and interested parties in the industrial, agricultural, transport and logistics sectors, with emphasis on farmers, agribusiness operators, policy makers and international organisations, with a view to promoting economic recovery, innovation and the sustainability and resilience of the agricultural, industrial, transport and logistics sector for the benefit of our private sector, communities and the country in general, said President Chapo.\n\nHe revealed that Zimbabwe has been part of the traditional foreign investors in Mozambique for the last three decades, having reduced its participation in recent years, motivated by the well-known challenges that afflict not only Zimbabwe but most countries in the SADC region and the African continent in general.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2024, 37 projects were approved, which could create 1 649 jobs, involving private investors from Zimbabwe, for a total value of around US$120 million, of which the equivalent of around US$35 million was direct investment, said President Chapo.\n\nZimbabwes investment was directed at 31,7 percent in the aquaculture and fisheries sector, in second place, the tourism and hotel sector with 23,49 percent of the approved investment and, in third place, the industry sector with 21,1 percent.\n\nTherefore, in terms of private investment, between our two countries, we noted with satisfaction the presence of foreign direct investment from Zimbabwean companies in Mozambique, which, although modest, expresses the willingness of businesspeople from our countries to explore intra-African investment opportunities, said the Mozambican leader.\n\nHe further noted that the two nations had vast natural resources, which they could each exploit to boost their individual economies.\n\nZimbabwe has enormous reserves of natural resources, with emphasis on arable land, forests and wildlife reserves, known worldwide, such as Victoria Falls, strategic mineral resources such as gold, lithium, copper, among others that contribute to the positioning of its economy as an economic power and source of foreign direct investment in the region, without leaving aside the role of breadbasket of the region and the continent that it played in the past, said President Chapo.\n\nMozambique, like Zimbabwe, has immense reserves of soil and subsoil resources, including 35 million hectares of arable land, availability of water, natural gas, various types of minerals, a long coastline and logistical infrastructure that facilitates access to the sea for hinterland countries in the SADC region, he added.\n\nAll investors from Zimbabwe and other countries who decide to invest in Mozambique in the various sectors, particularly agribusiness, industry, energy, tourism and hotels, infrastructure, transport and logistics, benefit from the availability of untapped resources.\n\nTurning to the ZITF experience, President Chapo said the platform was critical in promoting opportunities for co-operation and exchange in key economic areas of agriculture and agribusiness, industry, transport and logistics.\n\nWe live in a globalised world, characterised by growing multilateralism in political and economic relations in the international arena, where economic diplomacy plays a fundamental role, he said.\n\nOur presence at this prestigious business event is part of this constant search to strengthen our economic diplomacy from a bilateral and multilateral point of view.\n\nOur participation in this event also aims provides us with a platform for promoting and facilitating business partnerships and investments for companies and investors from both countries, interaction between members of both Governments for the promotion and facilitation of cross-border trade and investment, as well as the creation of a platform for exchanging information on business between Mozambique and Zimbabwe, said President Chapo.\n\n",

I was so happy to see the President in real life for the first time. I shouted his name hoping he would notice me, and he did! When he gave me the money, I was surprised and happy. This will help my family. I will never forget this day.\n\nHer 13-year-old sister, Kemuso, was equally moved.I tried to hold her back when she shouted, thinking it wasnt safe with all the security around. But she kept going. We never expected the President to stop, let alone walk over and give her money. It was such a kind gesture; it touched my heart, she said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa is known for his warm connection with children, often demonstrated through his annual engagements with young people, particularly during the Independence Day Childrens Party.\n\nHosted together with the First Lady, Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa, the party celebrates the hopes and voices of the nations youngest citizens.\n\nAt these gatherings, the President is often met with cheers and affection, a reflection of the bond he has nurtured with the nations young citizens over the years.\n\n",
