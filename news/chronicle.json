For many women vendors, their businesses are the primary source of income for their households, enabling them to feed their families and pay school fees for their children.In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), the Womens Academy for Leadership and Political Excellence (WALPE) highlighted the importance of legal awareness among women vendors.\n\nThe organisation said understanding relevant laws empowers vendors to advocate for improved market conditions and safeguards their livelihoods.Last month, WALPE conducted transformative feminist leadership training sessions for 150 women vendors in Hatcliffe, Mabvuku, and Epworth. The training focused on equipping women with knowledge, skills, and practices to enhance their leadership capabilities and economic activities.WALPE is dedicated to empowering women leaders through training and support for small income-generating projects. The academy also provides technical and practical training for women aspiring to run for public office, aiming to increase womens representation in politics and decision-making.Despite significant progress in promoting womens participation in politics, Zimbabwe still faces challenges in achieving gender parity. Women remain underrepresented at various levels of decision-making, particularly in ministerial and local government positions.WALPE noted that patriarchal societal stereotypes, systemic inequities, and male-dominated political parties continue to hinder womens political participation. However, the organization remains committed to addressing these barriers by equipping women with the tools they need to succeed.As Zimbabwe strives for greater gender equality, initiatives like WALPEs programmes play a vital role in empowering women to take on leadership roles and contribute to the nations socio-economic and political development.Ends\n\n",

We are not relenting and wont condone excessive gambling activities that are harmful to society, especially children, he said.\n\nWe have arrested 16 offenders, who will be dealt with according to the laws of the land. Our team, along with enforcement officers from the Lotteries and Gaming Board, is firm on the ground and will continue until we restore sanity in our policing area.Chief Supt Ncube said the operation is expected to intensify in the coming weeks as authorities work to dismantle illegal gaming networks and protect vulnerable groups, particularly children, from the negative effects of gambling.\n\nResidents of Beitbridge have expressed frustration over the issue, describing it as a serious challenge for parents. In separate interviews, community members condemned individuals for exposing children to gambling at an early age, warning of the long-term social consequences.This is not just a matter of law enforcement; its about protecting our children and their future, said one concerned parent.\n\n",

            "content": "Mkhululi Ncube,[emailprotected]\n\nMXOLISI Mr Bones Ndlovu narrowly defeated Insimbi Zezhwane in the battle for the Song of the Year in one of the most intense voting contests run by Rhumba News Zimbabwe.\n\nThe two bands went head-to-head in a nail-biting voting system, with Mr Bones, Insimbi Zezhwane, and their fans campaigning vigorously to secure the coveted title. The standout tracks were Mr Boness winning song Bangihlangabeze nge case (popularly known as Faka Two) and Insimbi Zezhwanes Ingqinamba, which finished in second place.\n\nMr Bones garnered 50,956 votes, while Insimbi Zezhwane received 50,255 votes when WhatsApp voting closed. Other bands in the top ten trailed significantly, confirming that these two groups are the most beloved in the rhumba arena.\n\nHowever, it is unfortunate for bands like Amathonga Amahle and Mlambos Express Band, who also had strong albums in 2024 but struggled due to having fewer fans to support them. The votes received by Mr Bones and Insimbi Zezhwane far outnumbered those received in voting conducted by local radio stations.\n\nOn local stations like Khulumani FM and Skies Metro FM, Insimbi Zezhwane dominated, taking first place, but the votes they received were minimal compared to the competition run by Rhumba News Zimbabwe. For example, Insimbi Zezhwane secured first place on Khulumani FM with just 1,800 votes.\n\nThe voting patterns sparked debate and even led to some negativity that should not be allowed to fester in the music scene. As the campaign heated up, it became a Tsholotsho versus Plumtree rivalry, reflecting the origins of the two bands.\n\nIt is also disheartening that some social media influencers contributed to this negative atmosphere to promote their favourites. While there is no harm in supporting local bands, true music fans must rise above geographical biases and maturely recognise a good song, even if it is not from their locally cherished band.\n\nThose in charge of such competitions should consider how to refine the voting process for Song of the Year awards to ensure that the most deserving winners are recognised.\n\nWith the voting concluded, it is clear that the rivalry reminiscent of the Macheso versus Tongai Moyo Sungura debate, or the Messi versus Ronaldo comparison in football, has now emerged in rhumba music. The leaders of the two bands, Mr Bones and Meluleki Brema Moyo, along with their management, must take the lead in calming tensions among their fans.\n\nThis rivalry can be beneficial for the growth of music, as both bands will strive to outdo each other in the studio, ultimately benefiting fans and the music scene. However, if left unchecked, such competitions may lead to negative consequences.\n\nPerhaps Mr Bones encapsulated this sentiment maturely in his Facebook post after being declared the winner: To my fellow musicians abafowethu, let us continue working together and put rhumba music on the world map. To Insimbi Zezhwane, the game was good, brothers; it means we just did not have the ground to play on to make people happy, he said.\n\n@themkhust\n\n",
