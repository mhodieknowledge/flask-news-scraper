Of the US$99 million that we are seeking, we had expressions of interest of just over US$90 million which was an outstanding response.\n\nBut it can not be described as a pledge because there is considerable work that needs to be done to convert that interest into actual monetary commitments, said Cllr Coltart then.\n\nThe dam which has a two-year construction timeline and an estimated cost US$100 million has a projected holding capacity of 130 million cubic metres.\n\nIt is being constructed through a public-private partnership (PPP).\n\nThe dam is strategically located at the intersection of Gwanda, Umzingwane and Filabusi districts and is expected to boost bulk water supplies for local communities.\n\nPlans to construct the dam were mooted in 1988 but implementation of the project was stalled due to funding and other logistical challenges.\n\nA 32km pipeline will link the dam to the Ncema Dam pump station so that Bulawayo can access water from the dam.\n\nBulawayo residents continue to endure prolonged water cuts, sometimes more than a week in some suburbs at a time when some parts of the country are experiencing an outbreak of cholera and diarrhoea.\n\n",

            "content": "Donald Trumphas ordered the release of thousands of classified governmental documents about the 1963 assassination ofJohn F Kennedy, which has fueled conspiracy theories for decades.\n\nThe executive order the president signed on Thursday also aims to declassify the remaining federal records relating to the assassinations of Robert F Kennedy and the RevMartin Luther King Jr. The order is among a flurry of executive actions Trump has quickly taken the first week of his second term.\n\nMore than 50 years after the assassinations of President John F Kennedy, Senator Robert F Kennedy, and the Rev Dr Martin Luther King, Jr, the federal government has not released to the public all of its records related to those events, the executive orderstated.\n\nTheir families and the American people deserve transparency and truth. It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay, it added.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Trump said: Everything will be revealed.\n\nThats a big one, headdedas he signed the order.\n\nTrump had promised during his re-election campaign to make public the last batches of still classified documents surrounding Kennedys assassination in Dallas, which has transfixed people for decades. He made a similar pledge during his first term, but ultimately heeded appeals from theCIAandFBIto withhold some documents.Trump has nominated Kennedys nephew,Robert F Kennedy Jr, to be the health secretary in his new administration. Kennedy, whose father, Robert F Kennedy, was assassinated in Los Angeles in 1968 while running for president, has said he is not convinced that a lone gunman was solely responsible for the assassination of his uncle, John F Kennedy, in 1963.\n\nThe order directs the director of national intelligence and the attorney general to develop a plan within 15 days to declassify the remainingJohn F Kennedyrecords, and within 45 days for the other two cases. It was not clear when the records would actually be released.\n\nTrump handed the pen used to sign the order to an aide and directed it to be given toRobert F Kennedy Jr.\n\nSpeaking toNBC News, Kennedy Jr said that he was grateful to President Trump, adding: I think its a great move, because they need to have more transparency in our government, and hes keeping his promise to have the government tell the truth to the American people about everything.\n\nMeanwhile, Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of Kennedy, condemned Trumps latest executive order as a political prop.\n\nThe truth is a lot sadder than the myth  a tragedy that didnt need to happen. Not part of an inevitable grand scheme. Declassification is using JFK as a political prop, when hes not here to punch back. Theres nothing heroic about it, Schlossbergsaid on X.\n\nOnly a few thousand of the millions of governmental records related to the assassination of John F Kennedy have yet to be fully declassified. And while many who have studied what has been released so far say the public should not anticipate any earth-shattering revelations, there is still an intense interest in details related to the assassination and the events surrounding it.\n\nTheres always the possibility that something would slip through that would be the tiny tip of a much larger iceberg that would be revealing, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of The Kennedy Half-Century. Thats what researchers look for. Now, odds are you wont find that but it is possible that its there.\n\nKennedy was shot dead in downtown Dallas on 22 November 1963 as his motorcade passed in front of the Texas School Book Depository building, where the 24-year-old assassin Lee Harvey Oswald had positioned himself in a snipers perch on the sixth floor. Two days after Kennedy was killed, the nightclub owner Jack Ruby shot and killed Oswald during a jail transfer.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the federal government mandated that all assassination-related documents be housed in a single collection in the National Archives and Records Administration. The collection of more than 5m records was required to be opened by 2017, barring any exemptions designated by the president.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump boasted that he would allow the release of all of the remaining records on the presidents assassination but ended up holding some back because of what he called the potential harm to national security. And while files have continued to be released under Joe Biden, some still remain unseen.\n\nSabato, who trains student researchers to comb through the documents, said most researchers agree that roughly 3,000 records have not yet been released, either in whole or in part, and many of those originated with the CIA.\n\nThe documents released over the last several years offer details on the way intelligence services operated at the time, and include CIA cables and memos discussing visits by Oswald to the Soviet and Cuban embassies during a trip to Mexico City just weeks before the assassination. The former marine had previously defected to the Soviet Union before returning home to Texas.\n\nThere are still some documents in the collection, though, that researchers do not believe the president would be able to release. About 500 documents, including tax returns, were not subject to the 2017 disclosure requirement. And, researchers note, documents have also been destroyed over the decades.\n\n",

She claimed the insults were different from those recorded in the police statement.\n\nPrincipal Magistrate Fikile Nhlabatsi remanded Dludlu out of custody until March 10 for trial.This case has raised concerns about privacy and the evolving legal landscape in the digital age. It serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of unauthorised access to electronic devices and the importance of respecting digital boundaries.Section 3 of the Act provides that, a person who intentionally and without lawful excuse or justification or in excess of a lawful excuse or justification: Communicates, discloses or transmits any computer data, programme, access code or command to any person not authorised to access the computer data, programme, code or command; accesses or destroys any computer data, for purposes of concealing information necessary for an investigation into the commission or otherwise of an offence commits an offence and is liable, on conviction, to a fine not exceeding E5 000 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years or both.\n\nRecently, another woman was arrested and charged under this Act for allegedly intimidating, insulting, harassing and further causing emotional distress to another she suspected to be in love with her husband.Nontsikelelo Lebohang Gina of Mbikwakhe allegedly posted Sonto, whom she suspected to be in a love relationship with her husband, on a Facebook page titled Eswatini Ladies House, wherein she allegedly insulted, intimidated, harassed and further caused her emotional distress.It is alleged that Gina accused Sonto of causing her bad luck through the use of muti she called sicitfo and imbume.Sicitfo is muti that is used to separate a couple while imbune is used to harm mens manhood.\n\nForcefully\n\nIn an almost similar incident, an aggrieved baby mama was arrested after she purportedly forcefully undressed a woman and later proceeded to record a video which she later shared with several people on WhatsApp.The survivor, *Nosipho, was reportedly subjected to the horrific treatment by Hlengiwe Mathunjwa of Masekweni in the Manzini Region on July 25, supposedly as an act of revenge for Nosiphos alleged relationship with the father of Mathunjwas child. The terrified Nosipho was allegedly threatened with a sharp object and coerced into removing her clothes.\n\n",
