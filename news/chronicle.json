            "content": "SEOUL, Jan 20 (Reuters)  South Koreas impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol has spent his first night incarcerated as a pre-trial inmate at the Seoul Detention Centre after a court issued a formal detention warrant on Sunday to hold him for up to 20 days.\n\nHe became the first incumbent president to be arrested in South Korea last week and was detained for an initial 48 hours of questioning, over a probe into whether he committed insurrection with his bid to declare martial law on Dec. 3.\n\nThe following are some facts about the facility and what is expected to unfold for the former prosecutor-turned-president.\n\nAfter becoming a pre-trial inmate, he had photographs taken for identification and underwent a thorough physical inspection, a corrections service official said.\n\nIt doesnt matter if youre the president, everyone gets a photograph taken 100 percent of the time when youre entering the facility, said the official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nThe physical inspection is not only to check on health, but also on whether youre hiding something, said the official.\n\nKorea Correctional Service chief Shin Yong-hae told a parliament judiciary committee on Monday that Yoon had cooperated and the process went without any incident.\n\nInmates held in detention before trial such as Yoon are given a two-piece khaki-coloured uniform, while convicted inmates wear blue-grey uniforms.\n\nYoon spent the night well, Shin said.\n\nAfter he was processed, Yoon was moved to the general detention section where he was allocated a solitary cell measuring about 12 square metres (129 square feet), Shin said. That is larger than the usual 3.4 square metre single cell.\n\nThe Seoul Detention Centre, despite its name, is in the city of Uiwang, 22 km (14 miles) south of Seoul, and previously held high-profile figures including former President Park Geun-hye and Samsung Electronics\n\n(005930.KS), opens new tabChairman Jay Y. Lee.\n\nAs a pre-trial detainee, Yoon will rise with other inmates at 6:30 a.m. and lights out will be at 9 p.m.\n\nThe Korea Correctional Service, which operates the countrys prisons and detention centres, says in its regulations and menu section that it provides inmates with 2,500 calories of food per day at a cost of about 1,600 won ($1.09) per meal.\n\nFood is normally traditional Korean fare. Dinner on Wednesday when Yoon spent the first night there under arrest was bean sprout soup, barbecued beef and kimchi, according to information provided by the centre.\n\nBreakfast details for Monday were not immediately available.\n\nYoon was arrested last week under a warrant that allowed authorities to hold him for up to 48 hours, issued by a court when the suspect in a criminal case refuses to answer summons or cooperate.\n\nUnder South Korean law, detention is a separate process where investigators can hold a suspect for up to 20 days, for further questioning if deciding there are grounds to believe a suspect may try to tamper with evidence or witnesses or is a flight risk.\n\nIf an indictment is brought, the detention can last for another six months.\n\nThe criminal investigation against Yoon is led by the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) launched in 2021 to investigate high-ranking officials including the president and their family members.\n\nBut it does not have the authority to prosecute the president and must refer any case to the prosecutors office for further action.\n\nYoon has up to now refused to answer questions from the CIO and his lawyers have argued the arrest is illegal because the warrant was issued in the wrong jurisdiction and the investigating team had no mandate for their probe.\n\nInsurrection, the crime that Yoon may be charged with, is one of the few that a South Korean president does not have immunity from and is technically punishable by death. South Korea, however, has not executed anyone in nearly 30 years.\n\n",

            "content": "WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) Donald Trumpwill be sworn in as U.S. president on Monday, ushering in another turbulent four-year term with promises to push the limits of executive power, deport millions of immigrants, secure retribution against his political enemies and transform the role of the U.S. on the world stage.\n\nTrumpsinauguration completes a triumphant comebackfor a political disruptor who survived two impeachment trials, a felony conviction, two assassination attempts and an indictment for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss.\n\nThe ceremony will take place at noon (1700 GMT) inside the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol, four years after a mob of Trump supporters breached the symbol of American democracy in an unsuccessful effort to forestall the Republican Trumps 2020 defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. The swearing-in was moved indoors for the first time in 40 years due to the extreme cold.\n\nTrump, the first U.S. president since the 19th century to win a second term after losing the White House, has said he will pardon on Day One many of the more than 1,500 people charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.\n\nThat promise is among a flurry of executive actions concerning immigration, energy and tariffs that Trump intends to sign as soon as Monday after taking the oath of office. At a campaign-style rally on Sunday in Washington, Trumpvowed to impose harsh immigration restrictionson his first day.\n\nAs he did in 2017, Trump enters office as a chaotic and disruptive force, vowing to remake the federal government and expressing deep skepticism about the U.S.-led alliances that have shaped post-World War Two global politics.\n\nThe former president returns to Washington emboldened after winning the national popular vote over Vice President Kamala Harris by more than 2 million votes thanks to a groundswell of voter frustration over persistent inflation, though he still fell just short of a 50% majority. In 2016, Trump won the Electoral College  and the presidency  despite receiving nearly 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton.\n\nJeremi Suri, a presidential historian at the University of Texas at Austin, compared the present era to the late 19th century, when Grover Cleveland became the only other president to win non-consecutive terms. Like now, he said, that was a time of upheaval, as industrial advances transformed the economy, wealth inequality exploded and the proportion of immigrant Americans reached a historical peak.\n\nWhat were really talking about is a fundamentally different economy, a fundamentally different country in terms of its racial and gender and social makeup, and we are as a country struggling to figure out what that means, he said. Its an existential moment.\n\nTrump will enjoy Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress that have been almost entirely purged of any intra-party dissenters. His advisers have outlined plans to replace nonpartisan bureaucrats with hand-picked loyalists.\n\nEven before taking office, Trump established a rival power center in the weeks after his election victory, meeting world leaders and causing consternation by musing aloud about seizing the Panama Canal, taking control of NATO ally Denmarks territory of Greenland and imposing tariffs on the biggest U.S. trading partners.\n\nHis influence has already been felt in theIsrael-Hamas announcementlast week of a ceasefire deal. Trump, whose envoy joined the negotiations in Qatar, had warned ofhell to payif Hamas did notrelease its hostagesbefore the inauguration.\n\nTrump claimed during the campaign he would end the Russia-Ukraine war on his first day, but hisadvisers have acknowledgedany peace deal will take months.\n\nUnlike in 2017, when he filled many top jobs with institutionalists, Trump has prioritized fealty over experience in nominating a bevy of controversial cabinet picks, some of whom are outspoken critics of the agencies they have been tapped to lead.\n\nHe also has the backing of the worlds richest man, Elon Musk, whospent more than $250 millionto help get Trump elected. Other billionaire tech leaders who have sought to curry favor with the incoming administration, such as Amazons Jeff Bezos, Metas Mark Zuckerberg, Alphabets Sundar Pichai and Apples Tim Cook, will join Musk in attending Mondays ceremony, according to Reuters and other media.\n\nTrump said on Sunday he will travel to California on Friday to visit fire-ravaged Los Angeles County.\n\nThe inauguration will proceedamid heavy securityafter a campaign highlighted by anincrease in political violencethat included two assassination attempts against Trump, including one in which a bullet grazed his ear.\n\nFederal authorities are also on alert after the New Years Day attack in New Orleans, when investigators say a U.S. Army veteran inspired by the Islamic State drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers, killing 14. Last week, the FBIwarned of potential copycat attacks.\n\nEight years ago, Trump delivered a bleak inaugural address vowing to end the American carnage of what he said were crime-ridden cities and soft borders, a departure from the tone of optimism most newly elected presidents have adopted.\n\nForeign governments will be scrutinizing the tenor of Trumps speech on Monday after he waged a campaign laced with inflammatory rhetoric.\n\nThe traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue past the White House will now take place indoors at the Capital One Arena, where Trump held his victory rally on Sunday. Trump will also attend three inaugural balls in the evening.\n\nAmid the pageantry of the day, Trump will begin signing the first of what could be dozens of executive orders.\n\nSome actions will begin tightening immigration rules by seeking to classify drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations and declare an emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, among other moves, a source familiar with the planning said.Other ordersmay aim to scrap Bidens environmental regulations and withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, sources have said.\n\nMany of the executive orders are likely to face legal challenges.\n\nTrump will be thefirst felon to occupy the White Houseafter a New York jury found him guilty of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to a porn star. He escaped punishment at his sentencing, in part because the judge acknowledged the impossibility of imposing penalties on a soon-to-be president.\n\nWinning the election also rid Trump of two federal indictments  for plotting to overturn the 2020 election and for retaining classified documents  thanks to a Justice Department policy that presidents cannot be prosecuted while in office.\n\nIn a report released last week, Special Counsel Jack Smith said he had gatheredenough evidence to convict Trumpin the election case if Trump had reached trial.\n\nGet weekly news and analysis on U.S. politics and how it matters to the world with the Reuters Politics U.S. newsletter.

One president leaves the White House, and another moves in. But Trump also has pledged tosign a flurry of executive orderson subjects ranging from border security to oil and gas production on his first day in office.\n\nHere is what we know about Inauguration Day:\n\nTrump will take the oath of office, administered byChief Justice of the United StatesJohn Roberts, at 12 p.m. EST (1700 GMT). It was originally due to take place in front of the U.S. Capitol but will now take placeinside the congressional complexbecause of bitter cold.\n\nTrump will then deliver his inaugural address. In interviews, he has said he intends it to be uplifting and unifying. That would mark a departure from his first Inauguration Day speech in 2017, which detailed a broken country he described asAmerican Carnage.\n\nThe outgoing president, DemocratJoe Biden, has said he plans to attend the ceremony and witness the transfer of power, a courtesy Trump, a Republican, did not afford him four years earlier.\n\nCountry music starCarrie Underwood is scheduled to performat the swearing-in ceremony.\n\nTrump has broken with precedent and invited several foreign leaders to the ceremony. Historically, they have not attended the inauguration due to security concerns and have sent diplomats in their stead.\n\nArgentinas president, Javier Milei, a strong supporter of Trumps, has said he will attend, according to reports.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said she hopes to attend. Chinese President Xi Jinping is not attending, despite an invitation, but is sending a senior envoy.\n\nTrump adviserElon Musk, CEO of Tesla\n\n(TSLA.O), opens new taband SpaceX, Jeff Bezos, executive chairman of Amazon\n\n(AMZN.O), opens new taband Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms\n\n(META.O), opens new tab, are also attending.\n\nThe temperatures have also forced organizers to scrap a planned parade down Pennsylvania Avenue of military regiments, school marching bands, floats and citizens groups. The parade will now take place at the 20,000-seat Capital One Arena in downtown Washington.\n\nDuring arallyon Sunday, Trump said he would sign a number of executive actions on Monday covering a range of issues, from ending government programs aimed at ensuring gender and racial diversity in the workplace to securing the southern border with Mexico.\n\nA source familiar with the planning said Trump is preparing to sign more than 200 executive actions on Day One.\n\nThe actions will focus in large part on border security. Among them are directives to classify drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, declare an emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border and move toward reinstatement of theRemain in Mexico policywhich forces non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court dates.\n\nHe is expected to signordersthat give immigration officers more latitude to arrest migrants with no criminal records, send more troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and restart construction of a border wall.\n\nThe orders will include a drive to increase fossil fuel production and follow through on Trumps oft-stated campaign vow to drill, baby, drill.\n\nTrump said on Sunday he would issue awave of pardonsfor defendants convicted for their participation in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTrump also said he wouldrestore TikToksaccess to the U.S. market on Monday.\n\nThere will be at least 18 inaugural galas held throughout Washington over the weekend and Monday, three of which are considered official and which Trump is expected to attend.\n\nOn Sunday, the eve of the inauguration, Trump held a campaign-styleMake America Great Again Victory Rally at the Capital One Arena. It was Trumps first rally in the District of Columbia since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nOn Monday, Metas Zuckerberg will co-host a reception for billionaire Republican donors along with casino magnate Miriam Adelson and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, Trumps pick for ambassador to Italy.\n\nOil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm, a top Trump donor, will host an inauguration watch party on Monday on the roof of the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House.\n\nThe official events are financed by Trumps inauguration committee, which is chaired by longtime Trump allies Steve Witkoff, a real estate developer who is Trumps pick to be his Middle East envoy, and Kelly Loeffler, a former U.S. senator and Trumps choice to head the Small Business Administration.\n\nThe committee will be responsible for covering the costs of everything but the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol, which is borne by taxpayers.\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg pledged todonate $1 millioneach to the committee, as have Apple\n\n(AAPL.O), opens new tabCEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

The moving ceremony reflected the deep respect and gratitude for the contributions of the late national hero.\n\nThe body of the national hero, who passed on last Wednesday, arrived in Gwanda from Bulawayo aboard a military helicopter that landed at Nhwali High School. It was greeted by a large gathering, including Matabeleland South Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Dr Evelyn Ndlovu, Gwanda South legislator and Deputy Minister of Information, Publicity, and Broadcasting Services Dr Omphile Marupi, service chiefs, family members and the local community.\n\nAfter a farewell service at his homestead, the body was transported to Killarney suburb, Bulawayo, where it will lie in state.

            "content": "Innocent Kurira,[emailprotected]\n\nASPIRING Zifa board member Xolisani Gwesela says once elected, he will propose for the abolition of the six percent levy presently deducted from Premier Soccer League (PSL) clubs match-day revenues.\n\nThis bold initiative is at the heart of Gweselas comprehensive set of proposals, which aim to promote financial sustainability and development within the sport.\n\nBy scrapping the six percent levy, Gwesela believes that clubs will be able to invest more in player development, infrastructure and other essential areas.\n\nIn addition, Gwesela has pledged to engage in robust discussions with the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) to abolish the six percent deduction imposed on PSL clubs.\n\nThis move is expected to further alleviate the financial burden on clubs and allow them to focus on competing at the highest level.\n\nGweselas proposals also extend to the realm of governance, where he has advocated for the abolition of affiliation fees paid by ZIFA members and player registration fees paid by clubs.\n\nThis, he believes, will help to create a more inclusive and equitable football ecosystem in Zimbabwe.\n\nIn a gesture of leadership by example, Gwesela has proposed that the elected Zifa president forfeit the $50 000 annual payment deducted from the CAF grant.\n\nThis move is seen as a vital step towards optimising the use of resources and ensuring that funds are channelled towards meaningful development initiatives.\n\nFurthermore, Gwesela has emphasised the need to prioritise the welfare of Zifa staff, pledging to ensure that salaries and staff benefits are paid in full and on time. This, he believes, will help to boost morale and motivate staff, ultimately contributing to a more efficient and effective administration.\n\nFinally, Gwesela has proposed the establishment of a tripartite agreement involving ZIFA, local authorities and the Central Government. This partnership will focus on driving infrastructural development, with the aim of creating modern, state-of-the-art facilities that can host international matches and provide a fitting platform for Zimbabwean football to thrive.\n\nAs a passionate advocate for Zimbabwean football, I am committed to creating a more sustainable and equitable future for our beloved sport, Gwesela said.\n\nThese proposals are designed to unlock the full potential of our football ecosystem and I am excited to work with stakeholders to turn this vision into a reality.\n\nGweselas qualifications make him a strong candidate for the Zifa board.\n\nHe holds a Masters of Science in Media and Society Studies, a Postgraduate Diploma in Media and Society Studies and a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Administration.\n\nGweselas experience in football administration is impressive, having worked as a Caf General Co-ordinator, a Cosafa General Co-ordinator and a Zifa Administration Instructor. He has also held various positions within Zifa, including Chief Operations Officer, Communications and Competitions Manager and Acting CEO.\n\nWith his wealth of experience and qualifications, Gwesela is confident that he has what it takes to contribute to the success of Zifa.\n\nThe elections are scheduled for January 25.\n\nGwesela will face competition from several other candidates for the Zifa board member post, including veteran administrator Chris Mtungwazi, former Warriors manager Sharrif Musa, Alois Bunjira, Highlanders secretary Morgen Dube, former Warriors coach Sunday Chidzambga, ex-Zifa Southern Region chairperson Andrew Tapela, Tizirayi Luphahla and womens football administrator, Sibekiwe Ndlovu.  @innocentskizoe.\n\n",
