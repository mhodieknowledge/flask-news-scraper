Ever since our Company was founded, our focus has always been on people: our employees, their families and all the residents of the regions where we operate.\n\nThats why our operations are inextricably linked to our efforts in the social sphere.

And we allocated another RUB 14 billion for environmental activities, a 26% year-on-year increase.\n\nThis is the foundation that has enabled us to achieve new production records year after year. Last year, we produced 11.8 million tonnes of agrochemical products, and this year we expect to reach a new all-time high, producing over 12.5 million tonnes. This represents a substantial contribution on the part of PhosAgro to ensuring the countrys food security.\n\nWe intend to remain committed to balancing our efforts to increase production with our commitment to the social responsibility.\n\n",

The stolen goods were hastily loaded into their silver Honda Fit, bearing registration number AEY 4843, before they sped off into the night.\n\nOne of the victims managed to alert their employer, who quickly reported the crime to the police. Acting on the tip-off, law enforcement officers swiftly positioned themselves along the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Road, where they spotted the suspects vehicle approaching the tollgate. When ordered to stop, the gang responded by opening fire on the police, triggering a fierce shoot-out.\n\nIn the chaos, the suspects rammed their vehicle into the tollgates boom barrier in an attempt to escape. However, they were subdued by the responding officers and subsequently transported to the United Bulawayo Hospitals, where they were later pronounced dead.\n\nPolice recovered a cache of weapons from the suspects, including two pistols loaded with four live rounds, two gas-operated pistols, two knives, and an axe. Additionally, some of the stolen property, including the groceries, lithium battery, inverter, gas tank, and amplifier, was found in the vehicle.\n\nIn a firm warning to criminal elements, the ZRP reaffirmed its commitment to combating armed robbery syndicates across the country.\n\nThere is no going back in the fight against armed robbery. Any form of confrontation by criminals will be met with appropriate measures, the statement read.\n\n",

The reports highlighted a sewer blockage and overflowing sewers behind Mondela Beer Garden and a water leakage at the same place,The following day council sewer teams responded to a sewer blockage at 7529/25 Tshabalala.This fault was prioritised ahead of other faults as it was suspected to be linked with poor quality of drinking water in the area. Other blockages in the vicinity (64647 Tshabalala, Indlovu Youth Centre, Mondela Beer Garden) were also cleared in coordination with water teams who kept the water lines under pressure to avoid ingress of sewage into the water lines, said council.To maintain public healthy safety, council said its teams conducted inline chlorination in addition to monitored flushing of the system after completion of the repairs.The teams continue with investigation and close monitoring of the reported possible contamination cases, said the local authority, adding that water samples have been taken to a laboratory for analysis.Meanwhile, an exercise to identify system misusers is being carried out with backyard kitchens in the shopping centers being the probable culprits for throwing bones into the sewer system.Council has noted that the area has been enlisted as one of the hotspots to be attended by contractors under the ongoing Framework Agreement of clearing of sewer blockages.A total of 130 metres of pipes will be replaced after investigations conducted last year indicated ingress of silt showing an underground pipe breakage.A truck load of sand together with rags, bottles and bones were removed showing that there is also a high system misuse exacerbating the situation, said council.\n\n",
