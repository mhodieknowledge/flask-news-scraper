            "content": "Nqobile Bhebhe in Beitbridge\n\nCHINA has reaffirmed its unwavering support for Zimbabwes economic growth by injecting multi-million-dollar investments, particularly in the mining and industrial sectors, further strengthening bilateral relations between the two nations.\n\nZimbabwe has witnessed a surge in foreign investment with Chinese firms playing a pivotal role, particularly in mining, which remains the backbone of the economy. The sector contributes over 60 percent of the countrys export earnings and accounts for more than 50 percent of foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\nSpeaking at the groundbreaking ceremony of the US$3,6 billion Palm River Energy Metallurgical Special Economic Zone project in Beitbridge on Monday, Economic and Commercial Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy, Mr Huang Minghai said Zimbabwe has vast potential.\n\nZimbabwe is a nation brimming with potential, a land blessed with abundant natural resources, a vibrant cultural heritage, and a resilient, hardworking people. Under His Excellency, President Mnangagwas transformative Zimbabwe is open for business policy, the country has emerged as a beacon of opportunity, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nMr Huang noted that nearly half of the Chinese firms investing in Zimbabwe are in the mining sector.He said China and Zimbabwe share common interests in mining cooperation based on mutual benefit and win-win outcomes.Highlighting Chinas commitment to Zimbabwes development, Mr Huang referenced the Xintai Industrial Park, a project spearheaded by Shanxi Xinganglian Group.\n\nIt is this spirit of openness, coupled with Zimbabwes immense potential, which inspired Shanxi Xinganglian Group to establish the Xintai Industrial Park, which is a testament to our shared vision of progress, said Mr Huang.\n\nHe further explained that the project integrates cutting-edge technologies, promotes value addition, and enhances local value chains, aligning with President Mnangagwas economic policies.\n\nIn addition to creating jobs, the firm aims to expand production and export products, boosting Zimbabwes foreign exchange earnings.\n\nPart of the Palm River Energy Metallurgical Special Economic Zone and Industrial Park\n\nThe project also prioritizes education, healthcare, and infrastructure development, demonstrating corporate social responsibility.\n\nThis industrial park is more than an economic venture. It is a cornerstone for realising the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) and Vision 2030. Together, we are building a sustainable future where prosperity is shared and enduring, said Mr Minghai.\n\nMr Minghai said President Mnangagwas state visit to China last year and his participation in the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (Focac) marked a new milestone in bilateral relations.\n\nDuring the visit, President Mnangagwa and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to establish a five-star ironclad cooperation framework to enhance the China-Zimbabwe comprehensive strategic partnership.\n\nGuided by this vision, I am confident that our collaboration in the mining sector will unlock unprecedented opportunities and foster new drivers of growth for both countries, said Mr Huang.\n\nVice-President Dr Constantino Chiwenga highlighted the strategic importance of the Palm River Energy Metallurgical Special Economic Zone, saying it has the potential to serve as a regional hub for metallurgical and energy production across southern Africa.\n\nHe lauded President Mnangagwas efforts in improving the countrys investment climate, streamlining the ease of doing business and building investor confidence through engagement and re-engagement policies.\n\nIn doing so, the Government has laid a solid foundation for sustainable economic growth. Furthermore, the prioritisation of economic diplomacy highlights the importance of strengthening international relations and positioning Zimbabwe as a leading destination for investment, said Dr Chiwenga.\n\nThe project is structured in several key stages to ensure sustainable development. The first stage focuses on reviving Tuli Coal Mine, which will supply coal to the thermal plant. This step is crucial as it lays the foundation for the entire industrial park.\n\nThe second stage involves building the thermal plant, which is already progressing with key components being installed.This phase is essential for providing a stable energy supply to support subsequent industrial operations. The third stage includes the development of a smelting plant to produce ferrochrome and steel using raw materials sourced from nearby mines.The thermal plant will supply energy to this facility, ensuring an integrated production cycle.\n\nBy aligning these three stages of coal mining, thermal energy generation, and metal smelting, the project fosters a comprehensive and sustainable development strategy. The initiative is set to drive significant economic growth in Beitbridge and the surrounding regions.\n\n",

Upper Ncema dam gates were opened to release water into Lower Ncema, which had reached a critical low of 9,26 percent on Wednesday, 12 February 2025, reads the BCC statement.\n\nAccording to the latest statistics, the citys supply dams were 49,7 percent full as of Monday, compared to 42,8 percent in the same period last year. Umzingwane Dam, which had dropped to a critical 2 percent capacity leading to its decommissioning, has seen the highest cumulative increase of 52 percent. As a result, the dam was recommissioned on January 14 and now stands at 48 percent full.\n\nUmzingwane Dam\n\nUpper Ncema Dam has also recorded significant gains, with water levels rising to 54 percent after receiving a 50 percent inflow. During the same period last year, it was only 17 percent full. The dam was recommissioned on February 12. Insiza Mayfair Dam, which received a 22 percent inflow, now stands at 56 percent, although it remains 2 percent lower than last years levels.\n\nLower Ncema recorded a 20 percent inflow, bringing its levels to 26 percent. However, Inyakuni Dam has had the lowest inflows at 6 percent, leaving its water levels at 20 percent, 9 percent lower than last year.\n\nMtshabezi Dam has the highest water levels at 80 percent after receiving 28 percent cumulative inflows this season, 7 percent higher than last year.\n\nPosting on his Facebook page, Bulawayo mayor Councillor David Coltart said the water inflows were encouraging and urged residents to continue conserving water.\n\nWe have had some encouraging inflows to our City of Bulawayo dams but we need a considerable amount more before we get out of the danger zone. So please keep praying for more rain in March and April, he posted.\n\nCllr Coltart also revealed that the council will soon review the citys water-shedding programme, raising hopes that residents could experience some relief from the stringent water rationing measures that have persisted for years.\n\nThe citys water crisis has been exacerbated by limited investment in water infrastructure, climate change-induced droughts, and high evaporation rates from the dams.\n\nIn a statement, the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) also warned of potential flooding in low-lying areas as national dam levels have risen to 86 percent, with several major dams spilling.\n\nHeavy rains across the country have resulted in dams such as Tugwi-Mukosi and Lake Mutirikwi reaching full capacity. Some community dams have already burst their walls due to excessive inflows.Zinwa urged communities in flood-prone areas to remain on high alert.\n\nConsistent rainfall activity across much of the country has led to increased water levels in most dams and rivers, raising the risk of flooding in downstream and low-lying areas. In view of that, Zinwa would like to advise the public to be on high alert, read the statement.\n\nZimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa)\n\nThe agency also cautioned residents against crossing or driving through flooded rivers, fishing in swollen water bodies, or allowing children and livestock near flooded areas.\n\nDo not cross or drive through flooded rivers, do not fish from flooded rivers, monitor the movement of children and livestock and secure irrigation equipment. The public should also evacuate or move to higher ground when instructed to do so, read the statement.\n\nDrowning incidents have been recorded in various parts of the country, with more than 50 people reported dead due to rain-related accidents.@nqotshili\n\n",

The 2025 calendar of events and budget was proposed and adopted at the PSL EGM held on the 19th of December 2024, said the PSL thereby putting to rest fears that the leagues kick off may be delayed.\n\nThe league kicks off this Friday with new boys Scottland playing host to Triangle at Zimbabwes ceremonial home of football, Rufaro Stadium.\n\nScottland Football Clubs chairman Tonderai Pound Sakupwanya (left) shakes hands with Khama Billiat as the secretary general Fortune Bgwoni looks on\n\nAsked on the issue of promotion and relegation, the League, which relegated four teams last season Arenel, Bulawayo Chiefs, Chegutu Pirates and Hwange, said the status quo will stay.\n\nFour teams came on board and these are: MWOS who bought the ZPC Hwange franchise, Scottland from the Northern Region, Kwekwe United from Central Region and Triangle United from the Eastern Region.\n\nEighteen teams is the number that we are operating with and we will continue to relegate four teams and promote as many, said the PSL.\n\nThe PSL had 16 teams and the number was increased to 18 in 2017.The PSL emphasised that all resolutions made by the emergency committee will be ratified at the annual general meeting.\n\nThe emergency committee has been in charge following the expiry of the PSL term for chairman Farai Jere and his deputy Lifa Ncube in December.\n\nPSL said they had not yet received any information about changes to the remuneration of referees.There are no changes requested by the ZIFA Referees Committee on the fees and as such this is not an Agenda item for consideration at the PSL AGM, we continue operating using the present agreement. Registration fees including the budget for the 2025 season were discussed and adopted at the PSL EGM held on 19 December 2024, the League said.\n\nThe interim board that has been in charge consists of former Fifa panel referee Masimba Chihowa who is Manica Diamonds chairman, Dynamos boss Moses Maunganidze and defending champions Isaiah Mupfurutsa.\n\nAt the PSL EGM held on the 19th of December 2024, it was resolved that the Emergency Committee Members would oversee the Leagues affairs until elections are conducted. It was further agreed that the Emergency Committee members, Messrs Chihowa, Maunganidze and Mupfurutsa, would alternate in chairing board meetings during the transitional period. We await direction from Zifa on when the PSL elections will be conducted, added PSL in a statement.\n\n",

It will mine coal, use it to generate electricity and use that electricity to process coal into coke.\n\nAdditionally, the facility will produce ferrochrome and ultimately, steel.Through its five phases to be built over 12 years, the project will employ thousands.\n\nThis is a welcome development for the province which counts Blanket Mine and How Mine as probably its largest businesses. There is Vubachikwe and Shangani as well. Zulu Lithium and Tantalum Mine is inching up. There are multiple small-scale mines in the province too.\n\nAgriculture is impressive in Matabeleland South.However, Palm River Energy Metallurgical Industrial Park is changing the game given the money to be spent on building it, the diversity and weight of its operations and its potential economic and social impact not only around the project site, but also nationally.\n\nThe President praised a Chinese firm, Xinganglian Holding Group Co Ltd, for investing in the model of excellence which will drive national industrialisation and modernisation.\n\nLet us work hand in hand to ensure that the Palm River Energy Metallurgical Special Economic Zone not only succeeds but exceeds expectations, he said.\n\nTo the engineers and all who will work on this project to bring it to life, know that what you are building is a legacy. My Government is fully in support of this initiative and will move with you for shared success. Let it be a model of excellence, a beacon of innovation, and a driver of prosperity for generations to come.\n\nWe are hopeful that Palm River Energy will achieve its goals to produce 1 200 megawatts of thermal energy, two million tonnes of chromium-based material and one million tonnes of coke yearly.\n\nThe investors are urged to redouble their efforts for this to happen. The Government must keep an eye on Palm River Energy, ready to support it as requested.\n\nIts first phase has, so far, created 800 jobs for locals, but it is obvious that the head-count will grow into thousands over the next 12 years.\n\nOur people will be paid decently so they can look after themselves and their families well. They will pay tax, and spend elsewhere to help drive the economy forward.\n\nLocal public infrastructure will grow.It is possible that Palm River Energy will sell surplus energy to Zesa, helping it to meet demand. Yes, it is set in a special economic zone thus enjoys some incentives, but the investment will still contribute variously to the fiscus.Beitbridge Town, largely based on cross-border traffic and agriculture, will get a fresh impetus from Palm River Energy.\n\n",

This has prompted calls to enhance value addition as a strategic pillar aligned with the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) goals for re-industrialisation.\n\nAccording to CZI, cotton production in Zimbabwe has plummeted from 360 000 metric tonnes in 2011 to 13 000 metric tonnes in 2024, leading to a shortage for local industries and an increase in fabric imports.\n\nIn response, the Government, in collaboration with farmers and the private sector, is spearheading efforts to revamp cotton production through increased support for farmers and policy reforms.\n\nDespite a 750 000 metric tonnes ginning capacity, the sector operates at just 20 percent, with most cotton exported as lint while only 12 000 metric tonnes is processed locally, which becomes a missed opportunity for value addition and jobs, said CZI in a latest update.\n\nThis comes as experts have raised concern over the subdued lint processing level for an economy that is geared towards greater value addition and beneficiation.\n\nFollowing its recently held Cotton to Clothing value chain seminar, CZI has emphasised the need for the country to do more beyond exporting raw cotton.\n\nEach nod in the value chain presents numerous entrepreneurial opportunities as every player requires specialised supplies and services to succeed, said the industry lobby group.\n\nZimbabwe must move beyond exporting raw cotton to fully integrate value addition at every stage.The cotton value chain provides economic and livelihood synergies through vertical and horizontal linkages with the textile, apparel, yarn, fabric, oil processing, and stock feed among other industries.\n\nFrom 2013 cotton production declined due to inadequate inputs and agronomic support, which has led to low yields.In 2015, cotton hit the lowest production level of 28 000 tonnes leading the Government to intervene with the Presidential Input Scheme to boost production.\n\nProduction, however, rose to 142 000 tonnes in 2018 before tumbling to 70 00 tonnes in 2019 due to drought.Last year, farmers delivered the lowest production of 13000 tonnes, which was below the 42 000 tonnes that the Government had projected, attributable to the impact of the El Nino-induced drought\n\nNotably, in 2021 the value of exports from Zimbabwes cotton to clothing value-chain industry grew by 132 percent earning the country US$102,2 million in export revenue.\n\nThe sectors exports were mainly driven by cotton lint and yarn exports, which increased to US$85,7 million in 2021 from US$29,1 million the previous year.\n\nMeanwhile, Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Permanent Secretary, Professor Obert Jiri, is on record saying this year the nation has a notable hectarage of cotton and expects a good harvest.\n\n",

The condition of the countrys roads has also deteriorated since the rainy season began.\n\nRain-related incidents have resulted in the deaths of over 50 individuals countrywide. The Civil Protection Unit (CPU) and other emergency rescue services are urging the public to avoid crossing flooded rivers.\n\nMr Christopher Shumba, the director-general of the Rural Infrastructural Development Agency (RIDA), stated that the rains have damaged infrastructure in many parts of the country, leaving some communities isolated.\n\nHe added that the agency is currently assessing the extent of the damage to aid Government planning.The rains have caused extensive damage to infrastructure although I dont have the exact statistics of the damaged areas off hand. We have reports of damages in provinces such as Matabeleland South, Midlands, Masvingo, Manicaland and Mashonaland Central, he said.\n\nWe are not experiencing flash flooding but due to excessive rains, the impact is gradually excessive.We are in the process of conducting follow-ups to assess the impact in communities. We know that there are communities that have been cut off. So, we are compiling data so that we can respond to those areas.\n\nAuthorities have discouraged motorists from crossing flooded rivers after videos of public service vehicles risking passengers lives have gone viral.\n\nNkayi District Development Coordinator, who also chairs the areas CPU, Ms Matilda Mlotshwa, said two dams in the area burst their walls on Saturday.\n\nWe are assessing the damage but the situation is bad. Some roads have been cut off. The road leading to Sikhobokhobo area from Nkayi Centre has been cut off while some crops were washed away after Sombengo Dam in Ward Nine and Fako in Ward 26 in Somthanyelo Village burst, said Ms Mlotshwa.\n\nShe said communities are now forced to walk up to 30km to catch buses as the roads have become impassable.Matobo district development coordinator, Mr Obey Chaputsira, said rains have extensively damaged the Bulawayo-Maphisa Road and feeder roads to Maphisa from local business areas.\n\nHe, however, said the district has been fortunate that no bridge has been washed away. In some places, some bus operators plying rural routes have been recorded driving through flooded rivers, which raised concerns over public safety.\n\nTwo buses were recorded crossing a flooded Whovi River in Matobo District with one almost plunging into the river. This has attracted criticism from commuters.\n\nBulawayo Bus Operators Association chairman Mr Patrick Dube, who owns Green Horse buses, has bemoaned the calibre of drivers that are getting licenses describing some of them as irresponsible.\n\nHe said as owners they are concerned with the safety of the public.When we employ them, we also reaffirm that they should not cross flooded rivers. But when they are out on the job they do as they please.\n\nSome of them have been fired for crossing flooded rivers. But the unfortunate thing is that even after losing their jobs they will go to another company and be employed\n\nWe receive drivers who are tested for their competence by the Vehicle Inspection Department. They also undergo defensive driving tests before being allowed to drive public service vehicles, he said.\n\nOne of the things that they are taught in defensive driving and part of that training is that they should not cross flooded rivers.Even the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe also teaches them that. But when they get on the roads they do what is against the law.\n\nMr Dube appealed to road authorities to urgently fix the countrys roads as most of them have become untraffickable.He said bus crews are now travelling almost double the time they should due to the state of the roads.\n\nThe Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) has said due to rains, some of the countrys dams are now spilling and warned of downstream flooding.\n\nFollowing the spilling of water bodies and flooding of rivers, authorities have urged members of the public to be on high alert as crocodile attacks become highly possible as the reptiles can be swept away to new water bodies.\n\nIn 2023, an unsuspecting 53-year-old old woman survived a crocodile in Kana River, Lupane, in an area never known to harbour the dangerous reptiles.\n\nZimparks spokesperson, Mr Tinashe Farawo, said members of the public must always be on high alert whenever there are flash floods in their areas.\n\nWe are saying all water bodies must henceforth be treated with high suspicion. The authority has of late been receiving reports of crocodile attacks right across the country and these reports have been on the increase this time around due to increased rainfall activity, said Mr Farawo.\n\nOver the past two months, ZimParks has recorded over 20 cases of crocodile attacks, resulting in eight fatalities and three serious injuries.\n\nCrocodiles are known to pose significant risks to livestock, and recently ZimParks emphasized the need for caution and advised farmers to avoid leaving livestock unattended near rivers and lakes, as this can attract crocodiles and lead to devastating losses.\n\n",

            "content": "Peter Matika,[emailprotected]\n\nZIMBABWE has recorded a significant jump in the hectarage dedicated to staple cereals during the 2024/2025 farming season, which positions the country for improved yields.\n\nPreliminary assessments reveal that this years harvest could be one of the most productive. In his post-Cabinet media briefing yesterday, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, Dr Jenfan Muswere, said Cabinet was notified of the increase in the cereal area planted, which rose from a targeted 2520000 hectares to an impressive 2 540 385 hectares.\n\nThis marks an 8.1 percent increase from the 2 349 921 hectares planted in the previous season.In addition to cereals, Dr Muswere said the horticulture sector also saw growth, particularly in the area dedicated to perennials.\n\nWith blueberry, orange, and coffee plantations thriving, the total area planted under horticulture grew slightly from 11952 hectares in the 2023/2024 season to 11 957 hectares in the current cycle.The increases were achieved despite the negative effects of the El Nino-induced drought and the corollary false start to the 2024/2025 season, said Muswere.\n\nOn livestock, he said the national cattle herd has grown by 0,4 percent, rising from 5 718 523 in 2023 to 5 741 397 in 2024. Even more striking, Dr Muswere said the country recorded an increase in the national dairy herd, which surged by 8,7 percent from 60 98 to 65 659.\n\nHe said the boost in dairy production translates to a remarkable 15 percent increase in raw milk output, totalling 11699 440 litres compared to 9 823 775 litres in 2023.\n\nDr Jenfan Muswere, Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Servces.\n\nDr Muswere also highlighted the success of the Presidential Rural Poultry Scheme, which gained momentum in 2024.The initiative saw the distribution of 751408 four-week-old indigenous chicks to beneficiaries, a significant jump from the 200 161 chicks provided in 2023.\n\nDr Muswere said the Government will create a new institutional arrangement to optimise planning and coordination of cloud seeding activities for enhanced rainfall patterns in Zimbabwe, while also climate-proofing agriculture at household and national levels will be accelerated through the Pfumvudza/ Intwasa initiative.\n\nGovernment will accelerate irrigation development to increase functional irrigation from the current 217 000 hectares to the targeted 496 000 hectares, among others, through increased private sector participation, he said.Community participation in the Strategic Grain Reserve will be enhanced at a community level.\n\nThe Government has also pledged to accelerate the establishment of Ward Drought Mitigation Centres to create resilience of communities against future shocks. Plans are also in place to strengthen the local production of key farming inputs such as fertilisers.\n\nThe Presidential Tick Grease Scheme will henceforth be appropriately renamed to Household Tick Management Scheme. Government will accelerate the establishment of the five fingerling production centres at Henderson, Chipinge, Makoholi, Matopo and Lupane, said Dr Muswere.\n\nHe noted that the Rural Development 8.0 intervention will be accelerated to empower communities.Meanwhile, Dr Muswere said after winning the bid to host the COP15, Zimbabwe has already made significant milestones towards hosting the 15th edition of the Conference of Parties (COP15) from 23 to 31 July 2025 in Victoria Falls.\n\nThe Conference will run under the theme: Protecting Wetlands for our Common Future. Preparations for the Conference are at an advanced stage and suitable conference facilities have been identified while the COP15 website is now operational and registration of foreign delegates is already underway.\n\nThe registration of locals will commence in early March 2025. The conference is expected to showcase Zimbabwes tourist destinations, including the Victoria Falls, Zambezi National Park and the Kasibo Wetland, said Dr Muswere.He also briefed the media about the Virtual Southern African Development Community (SADC) extraordinary meeting of health ministers, which was held from 20 to 21 February 2025, and addressed critical health challenges facing the SADC region.\n\nKey highlights of the proceedings and outcomes included the ongoing health emergencies in the SADC region, such as Mpox Outbreak and Marburg Virus Disease. Member States were urged to share information on disease outbreaks timeously to effectively address cross-border transmission, said Dr Muswere.\n\nHealth ministers also endorsed the implementation of the SADC TB Strategic Plan, as well as to expansion of the E8 Malaria Elimination Initiative to all 16 SADC Member States under the auspices of SADC.\n\nIn addition, member states were urged to mobilise alternative funding through public-private partnerships and domestic resource mobilisation for critical health programmes, including HIV, TB and malaria prevention, treatment and control.\n\n",

Hwabaraty collaborated with dancers from La Compagnie de Danse in a powerful performance supported by the London Music Office. He also led a series of engaging drumming workshops with LArche London, immersing participants in the rhythms and traditions of African percussion.\n\nHwabaraty\n\nAdding to his list of remarkable performances, Hwabaraty took to the Grand Theatre stage at the London International Fringe Festival, starring in a one-man, self-conceptualised storytelling theatre piece titled I Am Jelimana. Written by Butshilo Nleya and produced by Nokuzola Zola Ncube, the play narrates a poignant tale set in 1960s Zimbabwe, following Jeqes journey through war, spirituality, and self-discovery. Hwabaratys dynamic performance brought this powerful story to life, extending the impact of his most recent album, Jelimana.\n\nHis dedication to accessibility in the arts was evident in his contribution to the Move Through Dance portal, where he showcased Zulu dance, offering a deeper understanding of its cultural significance.\n\nI conducted enriching workshops and educational sessions with Conscious Minds Camp, the Childrens Peace Theatre and the London District Catholic School Board, inspiring young learners through the power of music and movement. Collaboration remained a key theme throughout my tour, he said.\n\nHwabaraty worked with notable session musicians in London, Ontario  including Robin Henry and Derek & Shawn Durant to create a unique composition blending traditional African folk and Indigenous elements. The track they worked on, Thina Siyakhala, is set to be released in the coming months on all digital streaming platforms.\n\nThe song tells a story of triumph and connection, embodying the essence of cultural unity. I also collaborated on a separate track with Fiker, further expanding my artistic reach and showcasing the diversity of African musical influences, he said.Beyond performances, Hwabaraty engaged with influential community and arts leaders strengthening cultural ties and fostering meaningful discussions on the role of Indigenous African artistry in a global context.\n\nMy tour in Canada was not just a series of performances  it was a celebration of identity, resilience and cultural exchange. Through my music, dance and storytelling, I continue to inspire and connect communities across borders, he added.\n\n",
