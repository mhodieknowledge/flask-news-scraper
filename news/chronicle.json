Further investigations linked Dube to the series of break-ins, leading to his arrest and conviction.With his criminal record spanning 43 cases, Dubes 10-year prison term serves as a warning to would-be offenders.\n\n",

            "content": "By Sinokubonga Nkala,[emailprotected]\n\nTHE community of Hurungwe, Mashonaland West, has been left reeling after a 37-year-old man allegedly went on a brutal killing spree, killing his wife, the village head, and a neighbour with an axe and knife.\n\nTrymore Tore, of Mubairacheni Village, Chief Chundu, is accused of killing three people between 15 and 17 February 2025 in a gruesome crime that has shocked the nation.\n\nAccording to reports, Tore first attacked his wife, Moline Chibayanzara, hacking her to death with an axe following a heated domestic dispute. He then dumped her body in a pit latrine in a bid to conceal the crime.\n\nWhen the village head, Kuwesi Masau, attempted to get to the bottom of the matter, Tore allegedly turned on him, killing him with the same weapon before burying his body in a shallow grave (40cm deep).\n\nThe third victim, Anety Nabwalo, was stabbed with a kitchen knife. Her body was later found 60 metres from Tores homestead, hidden under tree branches.\n\nA blood-stained axe and knife, believed to be the murder weapons, were later recovered from the scene.\n\nBefore his arrest, Tore attempted to take his own life, stabbing himself six times, but he survived and was taken into police custody.\n\nThe National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) confirmed the incident in a statement on X, saying: he is hospitalised under police guard and has been remanded to 10 March 2025.\n\nAuthorities have also revealed that Tore, who has no family ties in the area, had been threatening villagers before the attack. Now, following his alleged crimes, his own life is at risk due to public outrage.\n\nThe case continues to send shockwaves through the community as residents demand justice for the victims.\n\n",
