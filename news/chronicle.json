            "content": "Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau\n\nTHE Department of Immigration has introduced the use of automated gate systems, commonly referred to as eGates, to allow travelers with new biometric passports to enter or depart Zimbabwe with minimal human interaction, enhancing both convenience and security.\n\nThis latest move is part of the Governments drive to modernize service delivery in line with the upgraded Beitbridge Border Post.\n\nUnder the new setup, the eGates enable travelers to scan their biometric passports and undergo automated identity verification, replacing the need for manual passport checks by border officials. This system is expected to significantly reduce waiting times and improve the efficiency of border control procedures.\n\nThe Regional Immigration Officer in charge of the Southern Region (Beitbridge, Masvingo, Sango, and Chiredzi), Mr. Joshua Chibundu, said the move was part of Zimbabwes broader efforts to modernize its ports of entry. It also aligns with global trends toward more streamlined and secure border management through the use of advanced technologies.\n\nWe have started with a test run effective 14 January and we are impressed so far with the effectiveness of these eGates, said Mr. Chibundu. Basically, we are embracing the ease of doing business and as such we have completed setting up the eGates and we expect them to be commissioned soon. In addition to the eGates, we have also upgraded the Online Border Management System (OBMS).\n\nHe said the new immigration system is complementary to the current automation system at the border where most services are now being digitized. The OBMS is able to capture travelers bio-data, picking flagged travelers, auto-generating days for visitorsfor example, allocating 30 days for those visiting on holidays, seven days for business travel, and three days for those transiting through the country.\n\nMr. Chibundu said the new electronic system eliminates a lot of bottlenecks that come with the use of manual systems at the port of entry.\n\nThe government, in a 17-and-a-half-year partnership with the Zimborders Consortium, upgraded the Beitbridge border post under a public-private partnership, where Zimborders is managing and maintaining the facility pending the handover to the government at the end of the concession.\n\nUnder the current setup, border authorities are now able to clear 60 percent of commercial cargo arriving at Beitbridge in under three hours.\n\nIn addition, authorities are also looking at adopting some of the AI technologies.\n\nAn estimated seven million travelers use the border annually, while nearly 1,200 commercial trucks, 200 buses, and 2,100 light vehicles pass through the same port on a daily basis, and the number is expected to increase fivefold with new efficiency systems kicking in.\n\nThe port of entrys transformation came with the automation of services and the separation of traffic into commercial, buses, light vehicles, and pedestrian traffic.\n\nAs the nexus of regional and international trade, the port of entry can now absorb increased traffic volumes with commercial cargo taking less than three hours and ordinary travelers spending less than 30 minutes to pass through the facility, provided they have all the necessary immigration and customs documents.\n\n",

This years commemorations were held under the theme Protecting Wetlands for our Common Future.\n\nZimbabwe is one of the 173 contracting parties to the Convention on Wetlands having ratified it in 2014.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the various measures that the Government has implemented to enhance wetland conservation include increasing the area under sustainable wetland management in alignment with the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), the Wetland Rehabilitation Rolling Plan (2021-2025) and the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP),\n\nThe National Wetlands Policy and the Environmental Management Act (Chapter 20:27) serve as key legal frameworks guiding wetland protection efforts.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said wetlands play a critical role in securing water sources and sustaining livelihoods.\n\nIn as much as there is a lot of work to be done to reverse the legacy implication of past actions which were detrimental to the integrity of our wetlands, our commitment for a transformative and progressive sustainable wetland management is evident in the policy and administrative direction were are taking.\n\nThe National Wetlands Policy outlines our aspirations to sustainably manage these vital resources and the Environmental Management Act (Chapter 20:27) remains our principal guiding legal instrument on wetland management in the country, he said\n\nZimbabwe is one of the 173 contracting parties to the Convention on Wetlands, having ratified it in 2014. This demonstrates our full commitment to ensuring that our wetlands remain pristine and capable of regenerating naturally.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa warned that wetlands globally face unprecedented threats due to rapid urbanisation, agricultural expansion, pollution, deforestation, and climate change. He stressed that these factors jeopardise the environmental services provided by wetlands, posing a risk to communities reliant on them.\n\nThe protection of wetlands for posterity remains unquestionable. No single individual, organisation, or government can tackle this challenge alone. It requires collective efforts from all sectors of society, including the public and private sectors, local communities, and international partners, he said\n\nThe President called for increased environmental education, particularly among young people, to cultivate a new generation committed to preserving these vital ecosystems.\n\nA major highlight of the event was President Mnangagwas official launch of the countdown to the 15th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Wetlands (COP15), which Zimbabwe will host in Victoria Falls from July 23 to 31, 2025. He expressed gratitude to the Ramsar Secretariat, particularly its Secretary General, Dr Musonda Mumba, for supporting Zimbabwes successful bid to host the prestigious conference.\n\nI want to promise you and the whole world that Zimbabwe will do its best to ensure that COP15 is successful, he said.\n\n",

A Summer mayoral gown would ensure comfort during the Citys civic functions held in hot months while a winter mayoral gown would also ensure warmth and comfort during the winter months, said Mr Dube.\n\n",
