Let me repeat, no more mobile bottle stores anymore. These people moving with their small cars, selling alcohol from their boot  no! That must stop.\n\nMinister Garwe highlighted the numerous problems caused by such activities, including the lack of ablution facilities, health scares, security threats, and rising criminal activities such as theft, pickpocketing, and drug dealing.\n\nWe are happy that this crackdown addresses the lack of ablution facilities, which speaks to modernity and affects everyone here, he said.The health scare affects everyone here. The threat to security affects everyone here. The level of theft and pick-pocketing affects everyone here. The level of drug dealing affects a relative of everyone here. So, the answer is to do the right thing  enforce the laws and stop that behaviour, said Minister Garwe.\n\nThe Governments directive comes as part of a broader effort to restore order, ensure public safety, and promote a clean and healthy environment.\n\nMinister also reiterated that the enforcement of these regulations will be strict and unwavering, with support from law enforcement agencies.We are committed to fostering a safe, clean, and orderly environment for all citizens. This is not just about enforcing laws; it is about protecting our communities and ensuring a better quality of life for everyone, he added.\n\n",

The accumulation of waste from these vendors has rendered some roads, sanitary lanes, and sidewalks impassable, exacerbating public health risks,Minister Garwe said.\n\nHe said the situation has been further complicated by vendors blocking drainage systems with their wares, leading to flooding during the rainy season.\n\nWhen it rains, our roads become flooded because the drains are blocked. This is creating serious problems for our infrastructure, said Minister Garwe.\n\nHe said in addition to health concerns, illegal vending has become a haven for criminal activities such as theft, robbery, and drug dealing.The lack of regulation and oversight in these areas allow criminal elements to exploit the situation, destabilizing communities and eroding public trust in law enforcement agencies, said Minister Garwe.\n\n",

Its named after that season, and the festival must take place during that period. Our hope is that every edition happens in September.

The initiative aims to raise US$20 from 50 supporters to empower young talents in poetry, hip-hop, dance, writing, and music. The funds will support innovative performances and provide emerging artists with exposure, confidence, and the opportunity to develop their craft.The Friends of Intwasa initiative is gaining momentum. People are coming forward, some supporting immediately, others asking for more information. Our community loves to support good causes, and they want to invest in something that benefits the less privileged, Baya shared.\n\nBaya shared the critical role of public support for the festival, especially given the economic challenges.Public support is vital. Supporting the festival will bring the community closer. Supporters can influence programming and other aspects because they will be investing in the brand. We want people to be part of the festival, not just as consumers but as investors in the event, he said.\n\nAs the festival continues to gain traction, Baya remains hopeful about its success.We are optimistic. We keep praying. Things are tough, but anything can happen. But we always say, Ithendele elihle ngelikhala ligijima. While we run and organise, we stay hopeful. We are a miracle that happens every year.
