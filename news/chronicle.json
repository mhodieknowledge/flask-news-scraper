I commend you all for your role in advancing this focus area.\n\nTogether, let us do more as we entrench a culture of dialogue within our international relations cooperation frameworks, he said.\n\nOn the subject of dialogue, President Mnangagwa further stated, Zimbabwe remains open for dialogue aimed at the total removal of illegal sanctions.\n\nThe illegal economic sanctions, coupled with the prevalence of climate change-induced natural disasters and weather phenomena, are negatively impacting our economy.\n\nHowever, domestic resource mobilisation, diaspora remittances, and inflows of Foreign Direct Investments are augmenting the national fiscus.\n\nOur people and the economy are demonstrating extraordinary resilience, unity of purpose, innovation, and resourcefulness, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nThe President then expressed gratitude to SADC and other partners for their continued support in advocating for the unequivocal removal of the illegal embargo.\n\nI extend gratitude to our SADC family and African brothers and sisters for their principled support and solidarity, as they amplify calls for the lifting of sanctions. We also acknowledge the support we are receiving from the Group of Friends in Defence of the United Nations Charter, the Like-Minded Group, and the Non-Aligned Movement, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the Government was committed to inclusive growth, democracy, constitutionalism and ensuring peace and stability for economic prosperity.\n\nThrough our multifaceted and people-centred development strategies, we are lifting more of our people out of poverty into prosperity. We look forward to journeying along this exciting path with you and the countries as well as organisations you represent. Together, let us navigate the complex challenges affecting our world and the immense opportunities presented before us, he stated.\n\nYesterdays gathering of ambassadors and international organisations fostered closer interaction between mission heads and the Government. The President encouraged them to submit objective and factual reports about Zimbabwe to their countries.\n\nMay you find satisfaction and pride in taking our relations to a new level. Our doors remain open and arms outstretched as we dialogue and work in harmony towards a shared prosperity and brighter future for our peoples, President Mnangagwa said.Zimbabwe, he stressed, maintains its stance as a friend to all and an enemy to none, reiterating that the country is very much open for business.\n\nZimbabwe is a friend to all and an enemy to none. We are open for business, and your nationals are welcome to pursue investments in our mining sector. Further, leveraging our strategic central location in the southern region, we are determined to work with our neighbours and investors to expand and modernise the North-South Corridor, to enhance global supply chains and logistics, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe is committed to multilateralism and the principles of the United Nations Charter, while seeking support for a non-permanent United Nations Security Council seat.\n\nThe principles of equality and respect for each others interests should always guide us in our interactions. There are no big or small nations. Zimbabwes candidature for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council for the term 2027 to 2028 has been endorsed by SADC and the African Union. Our candidacy is deeply rooted in our commitment to global peace and security, an inclusive, fair, and equitable international rule-based system, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the Second Republic is implementing comprehensive reforms to achieve an upper-middle-class economic status by 2030.\n\nThis has resulted in various political, economic and legislative reforms, as well as the implementation of a broad array of people-centred projects to guarantee household food security, improve incomes, and develop critical enablers to propel the modernisation and industrialisation of our economy.\n\nThe projected recovery in agricultural output is expected to drive economic growth to six percent, buoyed by the expected bumper harvest, following a successful summer season, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa informed the diplomats about the Governments initiatives to achieve national goals.Government introduced the concept of Village Business Units and Nutrition Gardens. Under the Presidential Drilling Programme, we are drilling boreholes in all our 35 000 villages. We, thus, invite your Missions to partner these initiatives from the perspective of training and capacity building as well as value addition and sourcing of export markets as we promote market-driven productivity.\n\nUnder our Agriculture Transformation Strategy and the Village Business Unit Concept, Zimbabwe envisions improved incomes and higher standards of living for our grassroots communities and to also contribute to global food security and nutrition.\n\nIn mitigating climate change, we are expanding dam construction, water conveyance, and resuscitating irrigation schemes. These initiatives provide scope for further partnerships, co-operation, and investments. The growth of the agriculture sector, as the bedrock of our agriculture-based industry, entails the need for retooling, expansion, and diversification of our manufacturing sector. I challenge you, Your Excellences, in your respective missions, to promote investments along related value chains.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa praised ambassadors for promoting Zimbabwe as a tourist destination. He noted that Africa, the SADC region, and Zimbabwe are focusing on modernisation, value addition, and industrialisation of their economies.Riding on our abundant natural resources, Science, Technology, and Innovation solutions, I exhort your Missions to deliberately promote co-operation from your capitals around these aspects, as we create stronger synergies for the Africa we all want.\n\nMeanwhile, my Government looks forward to positive outcomes of engagements with the international community under the Arrears Clearance and Debt Resolution Process, he said.\n\nMaize crop affected by intense El Nio-induced dryness\n\nRegarding last years El Nio-induced drought, the President expressed gratitude for the timely humanitarian aid, technical expertise, and moral support received from different countries and organisations.President Mnangagwa who is the chairman of SADC, said Zimbabwe will continue promoting innovation to unlock opportunities for sustainable economic growth and development towards an industrialised SADC.\n\nOn the peace and security challenges in the region, particularly in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, he said Zimbabwe is playing its part through SADC and East African Community initiatives to find lasting peace.\n\nOn his part, Dean of the diplomatic corps, Rwandan Ambassador James Musoni, said they will continue rallying behind President Mnangagwas leadership.\n\n",

            "content": "Innocent Kurira,[emailprotected]\n\nFOOTBALL has always been more than just a game; its a culture, a way of life, and a form of expression. But as the sport evolves, so does the relationship between fans and the teams they support. The loyalty, passion, and deep connections that have defined football fandom are now being tested like never before. Fans who once followed their teams through thick and thin are beginning to question their allegiance. Do they remain loyal when times are tough, or do they jump ship at the first sign of trouble?\n\nHistorically, the bond between fans and their clubs was built on unwavering loyalty. But as expectations rise and clubs struggle financially or face performance challenges, that bond starts to crack. In Zimbabwes local league, a surge in fan defections from traditional powerhouses to newly-formed clubs is a clear sign of changing loyalties.\n\nBoban, a long-time Dynamos supporter, recently made headlines when he publicly declared his split from the club in favour of Scottland FC, a newly promoted team. In a viral video, he explained his decision:\n\nThe traditional teams are abusing players by not paying them. That is why they hate Scottland FC. I have left Dynamos.The defections didnt stop there. Ogege, another die-hard Dynamos fan, was spotted attending matches for MWOS FC, a rival club. When confronted, he admitted to supporting both teams, sparking a debate about what loyalty truly means. Then came Richard Sande, known as CheMhofela, who made a dramatic switch to Scottland FC during a match at Rufaro Stadium.\n\nI am sorry, I no longer support CAPS United. I have a family to feed. I was the second-best supporter in the land last season, and I didnt get any recognition from CAPS United. What else do you expect from me?\n\nBoban and CheMhofela\n\nFor their moves to Scottland the duo of Boban and CheMhofela received cars from Scottland.The defections are not limited to local football. In 2021, South African fan favourite Mama Joy shocked fans when she left Orlando Pirates to join Royal AM, an unexpected move that highlighted the growing trend of supporters shifting their allegiances for personal or financial reasons. This shift in loyalty poses a challenge for traditional clubs such as Dynamos, CAPS United and Highlanders, which have long boasted large numbers of fans. But as financial struggles and a lack of recognition from these clubs take their toll, their once-steadfast supporters are increasingly drawn to newer, more ambitious clubs.\n\nThe trend reflects a broader, global shift in football fandom. Clubs that fail to offer what fans need  whether its financial incentives, recognition, or a sense of community  are seeing their support base dwindle. Newer clubs like Scottland FC, with their attractive fan packages, are gaining traction as they make a case for the shifting nature of loyalty.\n\nProsper Ndebele, a Bulawayo-based football fan, weighed in on the trend:Theres always a benefit to supporting a football club, whether its excitement, community, or even financial incentives. But for many fans, loyalty is becoming increasingly transactional. If the team cant offer what fans need, theyll look elsewhere.\n\nThe growing trend of fan defections raises important questions about the future of football. As financial pressures and changing expectations reshape the relationship between fans and clubs, the question remains: will loyalty survive, or will the sport evolve into something more transactional? Only time will tell.@innocentskizoe\n\n",
