Schools such as Kutama College, St Ignatius College, and Mbare Academy were able to showcase their hockey talents alongside top-tier institutions like St Georges College, Hellenic Academy, and Christian Brothers College from Bulawayo.\n\nThe tournament is significant towards the development of hockey in the country and is the only tournament outside of key national hockey matches and competitions, Kumundati added.\n\nOne of the key elements that made the tournament possible was the provision of perimeter boards by Stanbic Bank. These boards are crucial for the Hockey 5s format, as they allow the ball to rebound back into the court, keeping the game flowing smoothly without interruption.\n\nWe used to have two fields for Hockey 5s in the past, but thanks to Stanbic Banks support, we now have perimeter boards for four fields. This has allowed us to host more schools and teams, making the tournament even more successful and well-attended, said Kumundati.\n\nTariro Memo, Stanbic Banks acting head of Brand and Marketing, also expressed her enthusiasm about the banks role in promoting youth sports. Memo emphasized that supporting the tournament aligns with the banks broader Corporate Social Investment (CSI) strategy, which includes initiatives in health, education, the environment, sanitation, and sports.\n\nStanbic Bank is proud to play a pivotal role in promoting the skills of young and upcoming hockey players, said Memo. We understand the importance of nurturing talent at a young age, and through our sponsorship, we hope to contribute to the development of future national team players and competitive individuals in the sport.\n\nMemo also noted that the sponsorship of Hockey 5s is part of the banks ongoing commitment to supporting hockey at the grassroots level, with the goal of fostering a more competitive environment for the sport in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe tournament was attended by a wide array of schools, including Allan Wilson, Churchill, Convent, Eaglesvale, and Prince Edward. It has grown to become one of the most important events on Zimbabwes hockey calendar, providing young players with an invaluable opportunity to develop their skills and compete at a high level.\n\n",
