The duo was also handed an additional 20-year prison term for robbery.\n\nThe horrific crime, which sent shockwaves through the Entumbane community, took place along Emcwazini Road in the Figtree area, Bulilima district, Matabeleland South. Dama was viciously attacked with an axe, sustaining multiple head injuries, before his lifeless body was dumped in the bush. The two then fled the scene in his Honda Fit.\n\nDamas body was discovered the following morning by a villager, who immediately alerted a police constabulary unit. A manhunt was launched, leading to Nhanhas arrest on June 25 by detectives from CID Gwanda after he was spotted driving the stolen vehicle.\n\n",

            "content": "Prosper Ndlovu in Ouagadougou, BURKINA FASO\n\nTHE call to strengthen the capacity of the media in Africa to expose Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) and promote effective and efficient taxation has come under spotlight as the continent seeks leverage for ensuring sustainable development across the region.\n\nDuring the just-ended taxation conference for African media and tax administration communicators in Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso, delegates emphasized the need to scale up domestic resource mobilization (DRM) to move away from aid dependence.\n\nTo achieve this, the media has a critical role to play, especially in exposing rampant IFFs, which rob African states of nearly US$80 billion annually, according to official estimates.\n\nThese flows, in addition to facilitating money laundering and tax evasion, promote corruption and deprive African states of crucial resources for the implementation of ambitious public policies in the areas of health, education, infrastructure and economic development.\n\nA Burkina Faso senior government official, Mr Mamadou Sere, who was standing in for the Minister of Economics and Finance in the host country, said IFFs were a major drawback to Africas progress.\n\nThe figures are alarming. Every year, African countries lose billions of dollars to illicit financial flows, he said.\n\nIt is, therefore, imperative that we strengthen our mechanisms to combat these practices and work together to put in place effective strategies to stem this financial haemorrhage that is holding back our development efforts.\n\nIn this fight, the media and communication professionals play a key role. By informing the general public, raising awareness of tax obligations and denouncing fraudulent practices, you contribute to the formation of a conscious and committed public opinion.\n\nMr Sere further said the media are essential partners in promoting tax transparency and encouraging positive change in society.\n\nParticipants commended the conference theme: Strengthening the capacity of the media to cover issues relating to illicit financial flows, as it represented an opportunity to strengthen collaboration between tax administrations and the media in order to build an effective communication framework, based on trust and the exchange of information.\n\nIn his remarks, chairman of the African Tax Media Network (ATMEN), Mr Danicius Kaihenneh Sengbeh, said the media must be part of the tax revolution in the continent.\n\nToday, in Ouagadougou, we are not merely participants at a meeting; we are part of a movement. A movement to amplify the role of journalism in taxation, to bridge the divide between tax administrations and the media, and to ensure that African voices tell Africas tax story from an African perspective. This mission is urgent, and it is vital, said Mr Sengbeh.\n\nMr Mamadou Sere, Burkina Faso senior Treasury representative (left) accompanied by an official from that countrys revenue authority\n\nAs journalists, communicators, and advocates of tax justice, we are the messengers of change. Our pens, microphones, and cameras are not just tools; they are instruments of empowerment, fostering understanding between tax authorities and the citizens they serve.\n\nWe recognize that tax is not just about numbersit is about the lifeblood of our economies, the foundation of our infrastructure, and the catalyst for the Africa we all dream of, he said.\n\nTaxation is the lifeblood of any nations development, and our role in shaping the publics perception of tax policies, reforms, and obligations cannot be overstated.\n\nMr Sengbeh went on to highlight the journey of ATMEN, which he said was a Testament of Collaboration- born out of necessity to transform Africa.\n\nHe recalled how in 2018, over 70 journalists and communication officers met in Johannesburg under the auspices of ATAF, and saw the need for tax issues to be placed at the heart of media discussions.\n\nA year later, in Kigali, the same cause was reinforced and it was there that ATMEN took its first breath, an idea ignited by the shared commitment of journalists and tax communicators who understood that Africas tax narrative needed to be told by those who understood it bestAfricans.\n\n",

When tax policies are misunderstood or misrepresented, it leads to misconceptions, reduced compliance, and ultimately, revenue losses, which then directly impact on a countrys ability to grow its economy in order to take care of its people, said Mr Southgate.\n\nMr Eugene Southgate\n\nWe have seen across many of our member countries, when tax matters are communicated effectively, they foster trust, accountability, and voluntary compliance, which are key ingredients for sustainable domestic revenue mobilisation. So, what and how tax information is communicated is crucial.\n\nMr Southgate said journalists, in particular, have a very important role to play in keeping the public and citizenry informed about the truth, as well as exposing negative practices such as corruption and tax evasion.\n\nYou have one of the most powerful tools available  the word is mightier than the sword. Government communicators have an equally important role to play  not only in keeping the citizenry informed but to make information readily available in a simple and understandable way so that when the public engage with the revenue authority it is easy and pleasant, he added.\n\nThe paying of taxes can be traced backed thousands of years so there is general understanding of its place in society. But many seem to have forgotten that, the challenge to our communicators is how we communicate the message of DRM to the people.\n\nTurning to the significance of the regional media training programme, Mr Southgate said a well-informed media is an essential partner in explaining complex tax policies in a way that resonates with the public.\n\nHe commended the establishment of the African Tax Media Network in 2018 in Kigali, Rwanda, as a landmark step in this direction, creating a dedicated platform to support journalists and communicators in tax reporting.\n\nThis workshop builds on that vision, providing an opportunity to equip media professionals with the tools to engage effectively with tax issues, said Mr Southgate.\n\nEffective tax administration requires a collaborative approach. Tax authorities and the media share a common goal: to serve the public interest.\n\nWhile tax administrations work to implement fair and efficient tax systems, the media ensures that these efforts are understood and scrutinised by the public.\n\nHe noted inherent challenges and communication gaps such as limited access to information, and technical complexities, which often hinder productive engagement between tax officials and journalists.\n\nThe workshop sought to bridge these gaps by fostering dialogue, building mutual understanding, and developing strategies for effective communication. Through targeted discussions, it explored best practices for tax transparency, the role of digital media in tax awareness, and innovative storytelling techniques that can make tax matters more relatable.\n\nSince its inception, ATAF has been at the forefront of building strong, effective, and efficient tax administrations across Africa.\n\nIts work has contributed significantly to improving domestic revenue mobilisation. Over the past 15 years, ATAF has provided technical assistance, training, and policy support that has helped member countries increase their tax-to-GDP ratios, enhance compliance rates, and combat illicit financial flows.Beyond technical capacity-building, has also prioritised communication through media training programs, knowledge-sharing platforms, and stakeholder engagement initiative, which have empowered journalists and tax administrators alike to communicate tax matters more effectively. Through partnerships with international organisations and regional bodies, ATAF continues to champion transparency and accountability in tax governance.\n\n",
