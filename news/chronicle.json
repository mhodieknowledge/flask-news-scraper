            "content": "Online WriterTHE City of Bulawayo processed fewer housing cessions in November 2024 compared to the previous month, according to a report presented by the Director of Housing and Community Services on 5 December 2024.Cession refers to the formal giving up of rights, property, or territory.The report detailed activities across the citys 11 Housing Administration offices, which handle matters related to deceased estates, court orders, voluntary transfers, and home ownership conversions for properties under long-term leases or agreements of sale.It highlighted a total of 70 cessions processed in November, marking a decline from the 82 cessions recorded in October. The breakdown of Novembers statistics is as follows: Deceased Estates: 24 cessions processed, down from 33 in October. Court Orders: 3 cessions processed, compared to 4 in October. Voluntary Transfers/Resales: 42 transactions, slightly down from 45 in October. Conversion to Home Ownership: 1 cession recorded, up from none in October.The Pumula office recorded the highest number of voluntary transfers in November, with 12 transactions. Meanwhile, Cowdray Park handled the most deceased estate cessions, totalling 11.The report noted that the Housing Administration section is responsible for facilitating cessions for properties under various lease and sale agreements. However, the decline in cessions was not attributed to specific challenges or operational disruptions.Bulawayos Housing Administration offices play a vital role in regularising property ownership and ensuring smooth transitions in cases of inheritance, resales, and legal orders. The city operates 11 offices located in Nketa, Mpopoma, Mzilikazi, Lobengula, Entumbane, Tshabalala, Magwegwe, Pumula, Nkulumane, Luveve, and Cowdray Park.As the city continues to expand, these offices are essential in maintaining order in housing administration and addressing the growing demand for property regularisation services.The Housing and Community Services Department is expected to monitor the trends in cessions closely and address any factors contributing to fluctuations in the numbers. Residents are encouraged to approach their local Housing Administration offices for assistance with property-related matters.\n\n",

This initiative aims to ensure compliance with city planning regulations and improve living conditions in the area.Another significant resolution was the introduction of a social infrastructure levy on stand sales and subdivisions across Bulawayo. The levy is expected to generate revenue for the development of essential infrastructure, including schools, clinics, and roads. Implementation of this initiative is also ongoing.The report noted other items discussed during the meeting, primarily reports for information purposes, which were all approved by the Council.While the initiatives are underway, the report did not elaborate on specific timelines for completion or potential challenges. However, councillors have previously highlighted issues such as funding constraints and administrative bottlenecks as obstacles to efficient project implementation.The regularisation of stands in Cowdray Park comes as Bulawayo faces increasing pressure to address housing shortages and ensure orderly urban development. The social infrastructure levy, meanwhile, aligns with efforts to meet the growing demand for public amenities in the citys expanding suburbs.\n\n",

            "content": "Online writer\n\nBULAWAYOS healthcare facilities recorded an 11 percent decline in outpatient department (OPD) attendances in November 2024 compared to October, according to the latest data from the citys health department.\n\nThe total number of OPD visits dropped from 67 514 in October to 60 114 in November, with both new and repeat patients contributing to the decline. New patient visits decreased from 47 701 to 41 850, while repeat visits fell from 19 813 to 18 254 over the same period.\n\nAlthough the report does not explicitly state the reasons for the drop in outpatient attendance, health experts suggest several possible factors, including reduced seasonal illnesses, transport challenges, or financial constraints among patients. Novembers figures could also reflect improved health outcomes from Octobers surge, which may have included cases requiring follow-up visits that were no longer necessary in November.\n\nThe decline in OPD attendance comes against the backdrop of Bulawayos ongoing efforts to strengthen healthcare service delivery. Over the past months, the city has faced challenges ranging from disease outbreaks to operational constraints in various healthcare facilities.\n\nIn October, the city experienced heightened health activity, with a significant number of diarrhoea and influenza cases reported. This surge likely influenced the higher outpatient attendance figures in that month. The health department has since implemented targeted interventions, including community health education campaigns, which may have contributed to the reduced caseload in November.\n\nThe reduction in outpatient visits raises important questions about accessibility and the overall state of healthcare in the city. While a drop in attendance could indicate better public health outcomes, it may also signal underlying issues such as a lack of access to healthcare or public awareness of available services.\n\nBulawayos health department has consistently faced resource challenges, including staff shortages and equipment breakdowns, as highlighted in recent Council reports. These factors could also have indirectly impacted outpatient attendance, particularly in high-demand facilities.\n\n",

            "content": "Online Writer\n\nTHE Bulawayo City Council is facing a mounting crisis in cemetery operations as the continued breakdown of the JCB grave digger has forced cemetery staff to resort to manual grave production.\n\nThis situation, coupled with high demand during the festive season and soaring temperatures, has sparked concerns about staff welfare and operational efficiency.\n\nAccording to a report presented to the Council, a total of 118 tombstones were installed across Bulawayos cemeteries in November, generating $4 522 in revenue. West Park Cemetery recorded the highest number of installations at 49, followed by Athlone Cemetery with 28, Luveve Old Cemetery with 22, Luveve Extension with nine, Hyde Park with eight, and Umvutsha Cemetery with only two tombstones installed. However, a single case of non-compliance regarding headstone installation was noted at Athlone Cemetery.\n\nThe prolonged breakdown of the JCB grave digger, which has been out of service for nearly two months, has placed a significant strain on cemetery staff. Councillor K. Ndlovu commended the departments efforts in producing graves manually but highlighted the physical toll on workers.\n\nTemperatures are extremely high, and staff members are currently required to produce at least two graves per week manually. This condition needs to be reviewed, and more staff should be recruited to reduce the workload to one grave per week per staff member, she said.\n\nDeputy Chairperson Councillor S. Moyo expressed concern over the disparities in grave production between cemeteries. Luveve Cemetery had more graves produced compared to Umvutsha Cemetery, where residents have raised complaints about a lack of graves. She also pointed out that most cemetery staff have been working on contract since 2019/2020, and their permanent employment could improve motivation and productivity.\n\nThe Director of Health Services Dr Edwin Sibanda confirmed that hiring equipment was considered, but procurement challenges through the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) had delayed progress.\n\nIf repairs are not completed by January 2025, the Council will review cemetery staffing levels. Currently, one cemetery labourer is required to produce two graves per week. This may be revised to one grave per week, the Director said.\n\nThe Chamber Secretary, Mrs Sikhangele Zhou, assured the Committee that the Council is engaging the Procurement Regulation Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) to resolve procurement issues related to hiring plant equipment and purchasing spare parts. In the meantime, Councillors were encouraged to rally residents to assist Council staff with backfilling graves.\n\nCouncillors raised concerns about increased expectations from residents during the festive season, particularly regarding grave backfilling, which has traditionally been performed by Council staff.\n\nDespite the operational challenges, the installation of tombstones across cemeteries continued steadily, with West Park Cemetery leading in numbers. The $4 522 revenue generated reflects the ongoing demand for burial services in Bulawayo.\n\nCouncil has resolved to note the challenges highlighted in the report while continuing to explore solutions to the grave production crisis. Hiring additional staff, repairing the gravedigger, and improving procurement processes remain key priorities.\n\nThe festive season underscores the urgent need for a sustainable strategy to address the rising demand for burial services while ensuring the welfare of cemetery staff and adherence to community expectations.\n\n",
