            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza,[emailprotected]\n\nTOBACCO farmers in Marula, Mangwe District, have begun harvesting their crop, marking a significant shift from traditional subsistence farming to a promising commercial venture that is transforming livelihoods.\n\nIntroduced in 2023 at Syringavale Farm in Ward 11, the commercial tobacco farming initiative began with just 17 farmers. In its second season, the project has expanded to over 160 farmers across Marula, Figtree, Dawson, and parts of Bulilima District, demonstrating widespread acceptance of tobacco as a viable alternative in the drought-prone Matabeleland region.\n\nFor first-time grower Mrs Ellen Sibanda, the transition from maize farming to tobacco has been both challenging and hopeful.\n\nWe began harvesting about three weeks ago. Some leaves are already stored, others are drying on racks and the freshly picked ones are in the barn, turning from green to a golden colour, she said.\n\nMrs Sibanda, a widow managing over 8 000 plants on half a hectare, relies on weekly guidance from tobacco expert Mr Rodrick Musiiwa and his team. She hopes the harvest will help cover the college fees of her two grandchildren studying in Bulawayo.\n\nWe were provided with inputs such as seeds, fertiliser and chemicals. The cost will be deducted from our total harvest and the remainder is ours, she explained.\n\nYears of poor maize yields, due to erratic rainfall, have pushed many communal farmers into poverty, prompting a shift to high-value crops like tobacco. The golden leaf, traditionally associated with the Mashonaland provinces, is now gaining traction in Matabeleland South.\n\nTobacco farming requires a farmer to be hands-on daily, from planting the seasons seedlings and transplanting them to the field until the crop is ready for harvest. The experts meet with us every week to guide us through the next phase, said Mrs Sibanda.\n\nI have no idea how many kilograms I will harvest, but Ive been told the yields will be good, as Mangwe received good rains this year, she added.\n\nTobacco is primarily grown in the Mashonaland provinces, with only a few farmers involved in the Midlands Province. It is not widely cultivated in the Matabeleland region, which is traditionally focused on cattle ranching.\n\nMrs Molly Ndlovu from Figtree was inspired to take up tobacco farming after a field day last year, following a devastating drought that destroyed her maize crop.\n\nI planted nearly 15 000 tobacco plants on a hectare. The experts told us our sandy soils are ideal for the crop, so we seized the opportunity, she said.\n\nLast year, we lost everything due to the drought, but the first farmers who grew tobacco at Syringavale Farm managed to harvest the crop and earn money. I decided to try my hand at tobacco farming as well, she explained.\n\nWe were told that our area is suitable for tobacco farming, despite the sandy soil. Weve been growing maize for decades, but the yields have been decreasing year on year.\n\nTobacco farming specialist, Mr Rodrick Musiiwa, a former Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (Timb) official, said the project has now spread to Mangwe and Bulilima districts as local villagers embrace the lucrative crop.\n\nFrom the initial 17 farmers who joined the tobacco farming project in 2023, we have expanded to over 160 farmers, and the number continues to rise as more villagers show interest in cultivating the crop, he said.\n\nWe have farmers from Syringavale, Greenfield and even as far as Dawson villages, deep in Mangwe District. Some farmers are from Figtree, while others are in Bulilima District.\n\nMr Musiiwa also highlighted that, unlike in other areas where tobacco farming leads to widespread deforestation, the community does not face such issues here.\n\nThe problem of cutting down trees to cure tobacco is a sensitive issue in many communities, but we wont encounter that challenge here.\n\nThe tobacco is sun-dried for about three weeks after harvesting, so theres no need for tree cutting to cure the crop, he explained.\n\n",

The decision to amend the Zimbabwe School Examinations Council Act (Chapter 25:18) is intended to address challenges in the education sector, particularly exam leakages, registration anomalies, and fraudulent practices at certain examination centres nationwide,\n\nInformation, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, Dr Jenfan Muswere said yesterday.If approved, the law will also ensure Zimsec is fully equipped to prevent and deal with the malpractices, provide for de-registration of non-compliant examination centres and introduce tougher penalties on transgressors.\n\nMinister Dr Jenfan Muswere\n\nAuthorities have done well by initiating this process, which will ensure that the good reputation of our education system is maintained and further improved.\n\nIt will be a good idea if all the arms of Government involved in the law-making process, right to Parliament, fast-track this proposed piece of legislation so that it begins governing the examination system by the time this years September to November public examinations begin.\n\nIt will take a few months for the equipping of Zimsec to be done, but there will be no harm if the body and the Government itself begin the process now in anticipation of the enactment of the law.\n\nIn terms of the punishment that the law will provide for, we hope that it, indeed, would be deterrent. We have seen some school heads, teachers and other officials caught on the wrong side of the law being sacked for that.\n\nHowever, we think dismissal is not really tough enough given the seriousness of their offences.If the proposed law provides for a jail term for the culprits, in addition to obvious dismissal that would provide enough deterrence.\n\n",

On Saturday, the delegation, which included representatives from the Auditor Generals Office, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion, NRZ and Landela Safari Adventures, visited several NRZ properties in Victoria Falls. These included Victoria Falls Station, Victoria Falls Hotel, an 8 000-square-metre plot and the Landela Complex.\n\nPublic Accounts Parliamentary Committee tours Landela Complex\n\nThis marks Parliaments second visit to Victoria Falls to assess NRZs properties. During a similar tour last year, the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Transport and Infrastructural Development learned that NRZ was losing out on substantial revenue  estimated to be in the tens of thousands of US dollars  due to its failure to manage its extensive real estate portfolio effectively.\n\nAt the time, NRZ management acknowledged the issue and stated that the parastatals real estate department was in the process of identifying and reclaiming control of its assets to boost revenue and address its financial difficulties.\n\nThe Landela Complex, which houses over 30 shops, including a bank, two restaurants, two microfinance institutions and an airline office, has been at the centre of a long-standing dispute between NRZ and Landela Safari Adventures.\n\nNRZ is now seeking to terminate the relationship, citing a loss of potential income and a lack of transparency.\n\nThe partnership was established in November 1998 under a rent-based lease agreement. Landela Safari Adventures was to lease three NRZ staff houses and, at its own expense, convert them into lodges. In return, NRZ would retain ownership of the land and take over the lodges after 25 years, without any compensation.\n\nHowever, instead of lodges, Landela developed a commercial complex  now known as the Landela Complex  on the site. This deviation from the initial agreement led to a dispute and the signing of a new agreement in October 1999, under a joint venture company named Victoria Falls Trading Post.\n\nSince then, disagreements over shareholding, financial disclosures and general management have persisted. NRZ maintains that the partnership has not generated any returns and that delays in resolving the dispute have disproportionately benefitted Landela.\n\nNRZ\n\nBriefing the Public Accounts Committee, NRZ chief finance officer Mr Patrick Mwashita, revealed that no board meetings had been held since 1998, due to ongoing disagreements.\n\nThree of the houses were constructed, but one remains outstanding. In terms of sharing information, trading accounts and audited accounts, this has not been done, he said.\n\nMr Mwashita stressed that NRZ has not financially benefitted from the agreement since its inception in 1999.\n\nOver the years, NRZ has been following up and, we have extensive correspondence between us and Landela, requesting financial statements and formal board meetings. Unfortunately, to date, there has not been a positive response from Landela, and we are now pursuing legal action, he said. Landela Safari Adventures, represented by its lawyer Mr Garikai Sithole, acknowledged the committees concerns and requested additional time to compile written submissions.\n\nThe Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee had questions, they wanted us to address and we provided responses. They require further information, which we have committed to providing by next Friday, to the best of our ability.\n\nFrom the outset, since 1998, this has always been a business relationship, and I believe the intentions of the two partners should ultimately guide the resolution, he said.\n\nMr Hwende said that the purpose of the visit was to gather as much information as possible regarding the matter. He encouraged the parties involved to find common ground and resolve the issue, despite the ongoing court proceedings.\n\nWe have requested both NRZ and Landela to submit all necessary documentation by Friday. This will enable the committee to address the Auditor Generals findings effectively, said Mr Hwende.\n\n",

This event has played a pivotal role in shaping her illustrious career, establishing her as a beloved figure in Zimbabwean entertainment.\n\nAt these commemorations, Sandy has consistently wowed audiences with her electrifying dances and vibrant stage presence, with many considering the events incomplete without her.\n\nA seasoned performer with a global footprint, she has graced stages in India, Dubai, China, the United Kingdom, Russia, Canada and Japan. Her ever-growing brand continues to attract gigs and endorsement deals.\n\nWith a career spanning over two decades, Sandy says being invited to perform at galas remains an honour.\n\nIn an interview with Zimpapers Arts and Entertainment Hub, she revealed that she is hard at work preparing for her upcoming performance at the 45th Uhuru Gala, scheduled for April 18 at Mutora Grounds in Gokwe, Midlands Province.\n\nHer inclusion in the line-up comes as the Government decentralises national celebrations  a move Sandy applauds, particularly as it brings high-profile events to communities in remote areas.\n\nSandra Ndebele-Sibindi\n\nI cant wait to perform in Gokwe. The rural community has been yearning for such great events, and its always a marvel to see people in rural areas being exposed to big stages, lights and powerful sound, she said.\n\nI would like to commend the Government for this noble idea because people in rural areas were not used to this phenomenon. It also shows that we have the rural folk at heart, as national events are now being held across Zimbabwe.\n\nThese galas are more than just musical celebrations; they represent history in the making for our country.\n\nHaving last performed in Gokwe over a decade ago, Sandy is eager to reconnect with her fans.\n\nYou can imagine how I feel, being reunited with my fans. Were going to deliver our best performance of the night in Gokwe. We are promising fireworks, and we are busy with rehearsals.\n\nRunning under the theme Zim@45: Devolve and Develop Together Towards Vision 2030, the event promises to be a vibrant celebration of Zimbabwean culture and heritage.\n\nSandy will share the stage with a stellar line-up of artistes, including Sulumani Chimbetu, Mark Ngwazi, Jah Master, Andy Muridzo, Chief Hwenje, Tendai Dembo, Sasha Madhuve and Argatha Murudzwa.\n\nWhile Sandy has already promised fireworks, much is also expected from Sulumani Chimbetu, the galas headline act. Following in the footsteps of his legendary father, Simon Chopper Chimbetu, Sulumani is no stranger to State functions, with a reputation for delivering unforgettable performances. His Gokwe appearance coincides with the upcoming release of his much-anticipated album, Tsapo.\n\nChief Hwenje, a Midlands native and a regular favourite at national events, is expected to receive a heros welcome as he entertains his home crowd with his trademark energy.\n\nMark Ngwazi, known for blending humour and song, is set to light up the stage with his Njanja Express band. Despite keeping a low profile lately, he aims to remind fans that his star power remains undiminished.\n\nTendai Dembo, leader of Barura Express and son of the late Leonard Dembo, continues to improve with age, delivering nostalgic performances that keep his fathers musical legacy alive.\n\nSasha Madhuve, inspired by her late aunt Edna Mbuya Madhuve Chizema, will add a rich blend of culture and tradition to the event through her mastery of the mbira.\n\nAlso taking the stage will be Andy Muridzo and Jah Master, both renowned for their electrifying performances. For gospel music lovers, Argatha Murudzwa promises a treat. With over 20 years of experience, she remains one of Zimbabwes most consistent and creative gospel artistes.\n\n",

Dubbed the Substance Abuse Community Intervention Programme, the initiative is mobilising residents from various suburbs to take an active role in combating drug and substance misuse.\n\nSpeaking during one of the workshops, Bura programme leader, Mr Mthulisi Moyo, said that the initiative was introduced in response to the growing prevalence of drug abuse in Bulawayo.\n\nWhen you go to Ingutsheni Central Hospital, you will discover that 60 percent of cases are drug-related, he said.\n\nIngutsheni Central hospital\n\nMr Moyo highlighted that substance abuse is a major contributor to criminal activity in the city.\n\nSome children even go to the extent of stealing valuables from their homes to feed their addiction. Each day, police from the drugs and narcotics section conduct raids, he said.\n\nMr Moyo also expressed concern about the increasing number of schoolchildren attending Vuzu parties, where they engage in substance abuse and risky behaviour.\n\nAccording to Mr Moyo, studies have shown that the main drivers of substance abuse include peer pressure, idleness, stress and trauma.\n\nSince February, Bura has been conducting workshops in various suburbs, working in partnership with community leaders, churches and other stakeholders. Mr Moyo noted recent collaborations, including engagements with the Family of God Church and Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI).\n\nThe goal is to unpack basic knowledge for community leaders, so they can play an informed role in addressing this crisis. When communities are empowered, they are more motivated to act, said Mr Moyo.\n\nHe pointed out that commonly abused substances include crystal meth, dagga and marijuana, with alcohol being the most widely consumed.\n\nResidents follow proceedings during an anti-drugs awareness campaign held at Nketa Hall recently.  Picture by Lubelihle Mathe\n\nDuring a recent workshop held at Nketa Hall, Mr Moyo reiterated that 60 percent of admissions at mental health institutions stem from drug and substance abuse.\n\nWard 25 Councillor, Aleck Ndlovu commended the initiative, emphasising the importance of awareness.We have so many youths involved in drugs, many of them doing it in hiding. This is affecting their behaviour; they become disobedient at home and turn into bullies. The most important thing is educating them, he said.\n\nBura chairperson, Mr Winos Dube, said the programme is a direct response to President Mnangagwas call to action, following his declaration of drug and substance abuse as a national disaster.\n\nDrug and substance abuse is destroying our youth and some have even lost their lives. It is now the leading cause of murders in our country. We must take this seriously by creating awareness and taking corrective action, he said.\n\nMr Dube added that Bura is also assisting those already affected by referring drug-dependent individuals to mental health institutions.\n\nYoung people are the future and the seed of our country, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Fungai Muderere, Zimpapers Sports Hub\n\nITS only Week Six of the 2025 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season, but the stakes are already sky-high.\n\nOn Sunday, the countrys two most passionately supported football institutions, Highlanders and CAPS United reignite their fierce rivalry in the first instalment of the Battle of the Cities at Barbourfields Stadium.\n\nAlthough the season is still in its infancy, there is no downplaying the importance of this fixture. Both teams have endured frustrating starts and a victory in this high-stakes showdown could be the spark that reignites their faltering campaigns.\n\nFor Highlanders, it has been a stuttering start under the guidance of Kelvin Kaindu. From five outings, Bosso have managed just six points, courtesy of one win, three draws and a single loss, a run that leaves them sitting in ninth place.\n\nLast weekend, they were held to a 1-1 draw by struggling Triangle United, a side that had not registered a point this season.\n\nThe dropped points have raised alarm bells within the Bosso faithful, who expected the team to build on the momentum from last year.\n\nMakepekepe have fared even worse. The Green Machine have collected a paltry four points from a possible 15, with their only win coming early in the campaign.\n\nTheir last outing ended in a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Ngezi Platinum Stars at Baobab Stadium, a result that sent CAPS supporters over the edge. Furious fans barricaded the stadiums main exit, temporarily trapping the team bus and head coach Lloyd Chitembwes car, in protest over the teams underwhelming form.\n\nLloyd Chitembwe\n\nFor Chitembwe, a coach who knows better than most the weight of the CAPS badge, the pressure is mounting.\n\nIts a natural reaction, he admitted after the match. Ive been here long enough to understand what this football club is all about. Results are what matter at the end of the day. If they dont come, the people will demand them.\n\nThis clash could be a defining moment for both clubs. Last season, Highlanders triumphed 2-0 in the reverse fixture at Emagumeni, only for CAPS United to exact revenge with a thrilling 3-2 win in the return leg. These games are never short on drama and Sundays encounter is expected to be no different.\n\nWhile the quality of football from both sides has yet to reach the heights of previous seasons, the rivalry itself injects an intensity that often lifts performances. This is more than just a football match, it is a battle for pride, bragging rights and a chance to rewrite the early narrative of the season.\n\nFor Highlanders, its a chance to reaffirm Barbourfields as a fortress and assert dominance over a wounded rival. For CAPS, its about redemption, regaining belief and proving that they are more than the sum of recent results.\n\nWith thousands expected to pack into Emagumeni, the atmosphere will be electric. The players, coaches and fans know that no one wants to come out of this clash second best, not in a game where history, emotion and reputation collide so fiercely.\n\nOther Week Six Fixtures:Saturday: TelOne v Ngezi Platinum Stars (Ascot Stadium) Bikita Minerals v Triangle United (Gibbo Stadium) Yadah Stars v Scottland FC (Rufaro Stadium) FC Platinum v Greenfuel (Mandava Stadium) ZPC Kariba v Kwekwe United (Nyamhunga Stadium) Simba Bhora v Manica Diamonds (Wadzanayi Stadium)Sunday: Highlanders v CAPS United (Barbourfields Stadium) Herentals College v MWOS (Wadzanayi Stadium) Dynamos v Chicken Inn (Rufaro Stadium)\n\n",

Northerns set a target of 212, which Curran and Brian Bennett chased down with ease, sealing victory with an unbeaten opening stand. Curran ended with 105 not out and Bennett on 92*.\n\nZimbabwe, who have only ever won two Tests in Bangladesh, will be hoping their in-form players can lead a strong showing.

            "content": "Gibson Mhaka, Zimpapers Politics Hub\n\nFOR Mr Shepherd Madanhire (93) from Gokwe Norths Matambo Village under Chief Chireya, a former prison guard who served under the Rhodesia Prison Service and courageously risked his life to protect political prisoners, notably President Mnangagwa, during their time at Khami Remand Prison, the forthcoming Independence Day celebrations carry a profound meaning.\n\nHe views the upcoming Uhuru celebrations as a pivotal opportunity, representing a chance to finally fulfill his long-cherished wish: to reunite with his former inmate, now the President of Zimbabwe, after 53 years.\n\nMr Madanhire, born on March 9, 1932 and President Mnangagwa first met around 1967 when Zimbabwes first citizen was serving a life sentence at Khami Remand Prison. President Mnangagwa and other prisoners of his ilk were, at that time, classified by the regime as most dangerous terrorists.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nThey were isolated from other prisoners in a special section of single cells and automatically placed in the infamous D category.\n\nThey were the proverbial bad apples that the regime feared would spoil the bunch, if they were allowed to mingle with other prisoners.\n\nThe President had been arrested in Salisburys Highfield Township in 1965, for being part of the Crocodile Gang that carried out sabotage activities against the Rhodesian regime after receiving military training in China.\n\nAs preparations for the forthcoming Independence Day celebrations at Nembudziya Growth Point in Gokwe North gain momentum, Zimpapers Politics Hub delved into its archives, seeking hidden gems from the district and fortunately managed to contact Mr Madanhire, who is indisputably one of Gokwes unsung heroes.\n\nThis remarkable individual played a courageous role in the liberation struggle, by risking his life smuggling letters and vital information from political prisoners like President Mnangagwa during his time at Khami Prison.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Mr Madanhire expressed immense excitement upon learning that the Independence Day celebrations would be held at Nembudziya Growth Point, particularly because his former Khami Remand Prison inmate, President Mnangagwa, would be leading the national event.Despite his advanced age and difficulty in walking, he fervently prayed the commemorations would present the perfect opportunity to reunite with his erstwhile inmate.\n\nHe reminisced about their lighter moments behind bars, sharing anecdotes of their unlikely friendship, and expressed a long-held desire to meet the President since he became Zimbabwes number one citizen.It has always been my long-held wish to meet President Mnangagwa since he became President. I first met him many years ago, when he was an inmate at Khami Remand Prison in 1967, where he was incarcerated.\n\nWhen I heard that the Independence Day celebrations would be held at Nembudziya Growth Point, I was very excited.\n\nThis is something we have cherished and we never expected such an event to happen in Gokwe. Many thanks to President Mnangagwa for bringing the celebrations to Gokwe, which is often regarded as a backward district, said Mr Madanhire.\n\nHe said that despite his old age and difficulties walking, he believed that if he received assistance with transport to Nembudziya, he would consider it the perfect opportunity to meet President Mnangagwa again.\n\nI had been trying to engage some party officials (Zanu-PF) from the constituency to assist me in meeting him, but without success. However, I believe that since he is coming to Nembudziya Growth Point to lead the independence celebrations, if I manage to get transport, it will be a perfect opportunity to meet him.\n\nDespite the good relationship we had, it was unfortunate that I couldnt bid him farewell, as my job and life were at risk. I have not met him since the 1960s. My long-cherished wish is to meet him. It would be truly wonderful to meet him and reminisce, he said.\n\nIn an earlier interview at his rural home in April 2022, Mr Madanhire shared part of the story of President Mnangagwas long years behind bars, during which he served a life sentence for contravening Section 37 (1) (b) of the notorious Law and Order Maintenance Act.\n\nIt was around 1967 when I came face-to-face with a young Emmerson Mnangagwa. I was a prison guard at Khami Maximum Security Prison, where he was serving a life sentence. I met him through one of my relatives, Ishmael Dube, who was also a political prisoner there. The two  Emmerson and Ishmael were friends.\n\nWhen I first met the young Emmerson Mnangagwa, I was immediately taken by his ready smile and the gentleness in his eyes. He was down-to-earth and courteous, Mr Madanhire said then.\n\nAn elder with an encyclopaedic knowledge of all landmarks in the Rhodesia Prison Service, Mr Madanhire said he had too many stories to tell about President Mnangagwa, adding that the Presidents experiences at Khami Prison deserve to be in a book.\n\nNot many prison officers during that time can say they shook hands with him. Very few have encountered him personally since he was classified by the regime as most dangerous, he said with pain scribbled all over his face.\n\nI saw his suffering and near desperation when I used to stand behind him during the few visits his relatives were allowed, and I could also see the anguish in him each time I talked to him or delivered a letter from his relatives and friends. After a while, even though he was a political prisoner, a friendship grew between us. It was a friendship behind bars and I never dreamt that one day he was going to be the countrys President.\n\nHe also details how he came to do favours for President Mnangagwa, smuggling his letters from prison, which were demonising the colonial regime and posting them.\n\nMr Madanhire broke the rules to allow President Mnangagwa to communicate with relatives while he was behind bars.\n\nOne of the cruellest rules was that prisoners should never write or receive letters containing subversive statements. Inmates were initially prohibited from writing about prison conditions. But he (President Mnangagwa) could write and receive such letters through me. At times, he was worried that I would get caught and be punished.\n\nIt was quite a risky exercise, and I didnt want many people to know about this. It was also one of my main duties to censor the letters that were being written by political prisoners. I was also accommodating his relatives at my house whenever they came to visit him, explained Mr Madanhire.\n\nI would also smuggle newspaper cuttings into cells of these political prisoners so that they could read about the liberation struggle, he added.\n\nMr Madanhire said many ex-political prisoners who were serving their jail sentences together with President Mnangagwa remembered him from their time inside as one of those rare phenomena: a prison officer with a heart.\n\nKhami Prison\n\nOther political prisoners I remember very well who served during the same time with him (President Mnangagwa) are Boniface Madzimbamuto, John Mashakada, John Mukoko, Saunders Mahwite and Ishmael Dube who I said was his close friend, said Mr Madanhire.\n\nHe said he also connected a lot of political prisoners to some charitable organisations that helped them pay for their studies.\n\nMr Madanhire who retired in the late 70s, showed off a medal he was given upon his retirement from the Rhodesia Prison Service. It is one of his most prized possessions.\n\nHe said that before he retired, he had asked for a transfer from Khami Prison to Chikurubi Maximum Prison after one of the prison officers discovered that he was allowing letters from political prisoners to pass without being censored.\n\nTo show that he is a decades-long admirer of President Mnangagwa, Mr Madanhire also showed off the poster of President Mnangagwa for the 2018 Harmonised Elections, which was hanging on the walls of his living room.\n\nHe also narrated how the Smith regime was ruthless to political prisoners, with some being hanged in a barbaric fashion.\n\nPolitical prisoners like President Mnangagwa were ill-treated. The living conditions were terrible, the cells were too small and we would allow them outside early in the morning for very few minutes for exercise and bathing.\n\nDuring those few minutes, they were also expected to clean their toilet buckets. This is one of the reasons I risked my life smuggling letters for these political prisoners who were so determined that one day they will fight away white rule in the country, said Mr Madanhire.\n\nHe said that although he was a prison guard, he loved politics.\n\nMr Madanhire seemed to have resigned to the fact that life is a just a clock that is counted down until one finally gives up and breathes his or her last. His wife Herena died in 2005. Four of his eight children are also late.\n\nThe old man lives with his grandchildren.\n\n",
