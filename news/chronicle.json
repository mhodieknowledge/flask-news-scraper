For some, the first day at school signalled a new chapter in their young lives as they entered a classroom for the first time.Accompanied by parents and guardians, some of the children dressed in school uniform for the first time and began the experience of spending half the day at school compared to staying at home.ECD classes typically start early in the morning and end at noon.\n\nWe have enrolled 10 ECD learners for the 2025 class but expect more parents to bring their children as the week progresses although the class wont exceed 20 learners, said Growing Minds Academy marketing manager Miss Samantha Manyathela.The school has a strict teacher-to-pupil ratio that it adheres to where one ECD teacher and as assistant cater for 20 learners or less.Some of the kids cried when their parents dropped them off in the morning while the few brave ones were happy to stay behind and mingle with other learners, said Ms Manyathela.The school has entered into agreements with parents who cannot afford to pay the full school fees to pay in instalments until mid-March.At another ECD centre in Mzilikazi suburb, Mrs Angelina Ndlovu said the little kids will adjust to being dropped off at school by their parents and spending half the day in class as well as playing outside in the sports fields.Kids adapt to new environments very quickly and by the end of the week they will be looking forward to coming to school every day. Parents come to pick up the kids at 12:30PM and anyone whose name is not registered with the school is not allowed to fetch a child here, said Mrs Ndlovu.By noon on Tuesday afternoon, parents and guardians of kids in ECD had started arriving at various schools to pick them up.At Ingwegwe Primary School in Pumula East, parents had started trickling into the school to pick up the young ones around 12:15PM.\n\n",

ZANC remains steadfast in its mission to serve as a vigilant and constructive opposition party, said Mr Mncube.\n\nHe reaffirmed his partys commitment to holding the government accountable while supporting initiatives that promote Zimbabwes prosperity.\n\nOur commitment is to the nation and its citizens, ensuring that progress and development remain at the forefront of our agenda, he said.\n\nMr Mncube also clarified that ZANC is an independent party and not affiliated with the ruling Zanu PF.\n\nOur partys ethos is rooted in acknowledging and supporting initiatives that propel national development, irrespective of political affiliations. We firmly believe that opposition should be constructive, offering alternative solutions while recognising and applauding government achievements that benefit our nation, he said.\n\nHighlighting key projects under the Second Republic, Mr Mncube cited significant contributions to socio-economic growth:\n\nInfrastructure Development: Completion of over 7 000 high-impact projects, including dams, roads, airports, water pipelines, and border posts, which have significantly enhanced national infrastructure.\n\nEnergy Sector: Commissioning of the US$1.5 billion Hwange Power Station Units 7 and 8 expansion project, increasing national grid capacity and addressing power shortages.\n\nMining Industry: Launch of major mining operations, such as the US$1 billion steel plant by Chinas Tsingshan Holding Group, which began production in June 2024, positioning Zimbabwe as a key player in the global steel industry.\n\nMr Mncube also praised the recent introduction of 99-year leases on farms, describing it as a landmark development that will enable land to be used as collateral to secure funding from banks, thus boosting agricultural productivity.\n\n",

Ms Mpinga, who has been headmistress for nearly eight years, is accused of misusing funds and failing to cooperate with parents. Similar allegations reportedly forced her to leave four previous schools unceremoniously.\n\nOn 27 December and again last Wednesday, Ms Mpinga reportedly ignored scheduled meetings with parents. In response, parents locked the school, demanding her removal. She then reported to the police, claiming members of the Mthwakazi Republic Party (MRP) had invaded the premises and threatened her.\n\nHowever, an investigation revealed that the people she accused were actually parents and village heads sent on a fact-finding mission. This prompted a meeting on 8 January involving Ministry of Education officials, acting Chief Mabhikwa, local authorities, and other stakeholders. Ms Mpinga did not attend.\n\nParents claim Ms Mpinga misused school funds, including US$150 for personal purchases and US$800 claimed as an allowance for attending a conference. Community members are now calling for her immediate transfer and greater transparency in the schools administration.\n\nThe School Development Committee (SDC) chairperson, Mr Thabani Mavengele Sibanda, confirmed the parents grievances, saying:\n\nWe have a problem with the headmistress who doesnt respect parents and fails to cooperate. The school has seen no development during her tenure, and parents no longer want her to remain in charge.\n\nActing Chief Mabhikwa\n\nActing Chief Mabhikwa criticised Ms Mpinga for disrespecting the community and lying to authorities about being victimised on tribal grounds. He added that auditors had been sent to the school, and a report is expected shortly.\n\nParents locked the school, but we intervened to ensure lessons resume on time. We will convene a meeting on 14 January to address the issue and resolve it as stakeholders, said Acting Chief Mabhikwa.\n\nLupane District Schools Inspector, Mr Lovemore Ncube, confirmed the ongoing investigations and urged parents to allow Government procedures to take their course.\n\nI received a preliminary report from inspectors, and auditors are also preparing findings. A meeting is scheduled for Tuesday to determine the way forward, he said.As stakeholders prepare for todayss meeting, parents and authorities alike are hopeful for a resolution that prioritises the welfare of learners and the integrity of the school.\n\n",
