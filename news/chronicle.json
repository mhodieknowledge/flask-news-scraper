The use of drones has allowed us to detect smuggling activities with precision and speed, ensuring that illicit goods never make it into the market, said the Commissioner General.\n\nSmuggling is not just about tax evasionits an attack on Zimbabwes economy, local industries, and the safety of our communities. Through this collaborative approach, we are sending a strong message: Zimbabwes borders will not be a playground for criminals.\n\nMs Chinamasa said the latest intelligence-driven operation targeted five notorious smuggling corridors, informally known as Valley 1 & 2, Proof, Godfather, and Thembani.\n\nAt these illegal crossing points, surveillance teams uncovered a fleet of inflatable boats strategically positioned on both the South African and Zimbabwean sides; vehicles on standby, ready to transport smuggled goods inland; and donkey-drawn carts, motor vehicles, and boats being used to ferry illicit goods across the border.\n\nThe Commissioner General emphasised that such smuggling operations threaten local businesses, flood the market with untaxed goods, weaken Zimbabwean manufacturers, and deprive the government of much-needed revenue for essential services.\n\nThis operation underscores the effectiveness of multi-agency cooperation in tackling illicit trade. Zimra, border security forces, law enforcement agencies, and local intelligence teams have intensified their efforts, working hand-in-hand to disrupt smuggling syndicates and uphold economic integrity, said Ms Chinamasa.\n\nShe added that the revenue collector will continue to intensify aerial patrols, deploy more drones, and increase joint border operations with security agencies to completely dismantle smuggling syndicates.\n\nFurthermore, she emphasised that the integration of AI-driven analytics and night-time drone surveillance will further bolster enforcement efforts, ensuring that smugglers have nowhere to hide.\n\nSmuggling is not just a crimeits economic sabotage, Ms Chinamasa stated. Those engaging in these illegal activities must understand that the net is tightening. We will find you, we will stop you, and we will ensure that Zimbabwes legitimate businesses and economy are protected.\n\nWe remain committed to facilitating legitimate trade while aggressively combating smuggling. The agency calls upon all citizens, businesses, and stakeholders to report smuggling activities and support ongoing efforts to secure the nations borders.\n\n",

There will be performances from Intotal Band, Feli Nandi, Winky D and Iyasa on April 13.\n\nHowever, several men, who were commenting online after the announcement of the line-up of artistes, vowed that they would break with tradition and attend the show.\n\nIn an interview with H-Metro, one of the organisers said the event remains strictly for women only and they are going to make sure that no man will be allowed to enter the show.\n\nThey also addressed the issue of why male artistes dominate their stages.Feli Nandi will be the only female artiste for the show.We stand by our culture, the party is for ladies only and no man will be allowed to enter. Doek & Slay was created as a safe space for the ladies and that is why it is only held on Sundays.The issue of male artistes dominating our stages is because the ladies decide on who they want to perform. We noticed that most of the local shows happen at night and at that time most women will be at home taking care of children.So, we thought why not bring those artistes that they want during the day so that they, too, can enjoy the magic, he said.\n\nDoek & Slay will hit The Odyssey Kadoma on March 30 with Freeman and The Travellers Band entertaining the women. It will then move to Mutare Sports Club on April 6 with Freeman and Master H providing the entertainment.\n\nThe Bulawayo edition will be held at the ZIEC main arena and Master H, The Travellers Band and Iyasa will be the artistes on show.\n\nThe Doek & Slay party has become the biggest show, in terms of attendance, on the local entertainment scene. The Harare edition is always the prime show, attracting women from all over the country, and the last one to be held in the capital attracted a record-breaking crowd of over 23 000.\n\n",
