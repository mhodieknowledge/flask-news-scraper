New hostels have been constructed at the school, specifically for this event.\n\nAn Independence Gala is scheduled for the Independence Eve at Nembudziya Government High School. The main event on April 18 will be held at the Nembudziya Growth Point Open Ground, highlighted by President Mnangagwas address. Following the official proceedings, a football match between Simba Bhora and FC Platinum will entertain the crowds.\n\nCabinet was yesterday briefed about the smooth preparations with Government expressing excitement about the logistical readiness for the successful hosting of the event.\n\nInformation, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, Dr Jenfan Muswere, told journalists in a post-Cabinet media briefing that major preparatory works were almost complete, with significant infrastructural developments already transforming the outlook of the district.\n\nHe said construction of the football stadium and other facilities have been completed.\n\nOther key milestones include the completion of educational legacy projects at Nembudziya Government High School, Nyamuroro High School, Nyamuroro Primary School and Nyamuroro Vocational Training Centre. The completed projects include classroom blocks, ablution blocks, teachers houses, science laboratories, boreholes and facilities for School Business Units, said Dr Muswere.\n\nThe external ambience of the schools has been vastly transformed through re-painted walls, renovated buildings and improved water and sanitation facilities, he added.\n\nDr Muswere said road networks in the Gokwe North and South districts, as well as the surrounding districts, have since been rehabilitated.\n\nThese include the surfacing of Nembudziya Growth Point, re-gravelling and surfacing of portions of the Kadoma-Sanyati-Nembudziya Road, Gokwe Jahana Road and the Chakari, Hovani, Copper Queen and Jakani roads.\n\nAccessibility of the venue site from all major centres such as Gokwe Town, Chinhoyi, Binga, Kadoma and others have been enhanced. Other notable developments include the renovation of a mortuary at Nembudziya Hospital, installation and upgrading of 3G and 4G base stations; training of local communities in digital skills; refurbishment of computer laboratories and the establishment of a telemedicine clinic, said Dr Muswere.\n\nHe said a total of 132 graves across heroes shrines in the Midlands Province are being adorned with concrete slabs. At the same time, the construction of a field museum and a memorial plinth at the former Sikombela Restriction Camp was completed.\n\nOther places of significance to the countrys Liberation Struggle such as Connemara Prison and Mutapa Hall, have already been facelifted, said Dr Muswere.\n\nMeanwhile, all the necessary logistical arrangements, sporting and cultural performances are on course\n\nSpeaking in an interview from Nembudziya Growth Point, the venue for the Independence Day celebrations, where she was also assessing progress, Gokwe-Nembudziya Member of Parliament, Cde Flora Buka said the political leadership from the Midlands Province was working around the clock to ensure all works were completed timeously.\n\nShe said road works are in their final stages, with several roads already open and fully accessible to traffic.\n\nConstruction at the grounds where the main celebrations will be held is almost complete. Everything is in place: bucket seats have been installed, the lawn has been laid, and schoolchildren are busy with their rehearsals.\n\nThe infrastructure intended for the grounds is now ready and fitted for public use. There are a few final touches underway but everything is largely complete and in place.\n\nAs the Gokwe-Nembudziya constituency, we are now fully prepared and filled with electric anticipation to host the expected 60 000 people for the Independence Day celebrations. The mood is vibrant, and the entire community is ready to commemorate this significant day, said Cde Buka.Regarding transport and infrastructure, she said everything is now in place to ensure a smooth and successful Independence Day celebrations.\n\nThe rehabilitation of key roads, particularly the one from Kadoma to Nembudziya and all roads linking to Nembudziya, is complete, making previously inaccessible areas now reachable and ensuring a smooth flow of traffic to the venue.\n\nThe Hovano Road, connecting Gokwe South and Nembudziya, has also been rehabilitated, with contractors working on the final touches. We urge all drivers, local and those travelling to the celebrations, to exercise extreme caution on these newly improved roads to prevent any unnecessary loss of life during this celebratory time, she said.\n\nCde Buka said mobilisation efforts have been highly successful, with everyone eager to celebrate independence.\n\nWhile buses have been arranged to ferry people to the venue, the overwhelming response means that lorries will also be used to accommodate all those wishing to attend, including women, children and the elderly. The enthusiasm and readiness of the community are palpable.\n\nIn terms of entertainment, our talented schoolchildren, who will be providing performances, are putting the final touches on their rehearsals. Additionally, the schools designated to host the gala and childrens party have undergone construction, renovations, and repainting, ensuring a welcoming and festive environment for our younger attendees.\n\nBeyond the immediate preparations for the day itself, our broader community projects, such as borehole drilling and village business units, have also been established, demonstrating the ongoing progress and development within the constituency, said Cde Buka.\n\nCulturally, the traditional leaders in Gokwe are performing their rites in preparation for the Independence Day celebrations, underscoring the importance of our heritage in this national event. Church leaders have also actively engaged the community, encouraging widespread participation in the celebrations.\n\nFurthermore, the political leadership from the province is working tirelessly to ensure efficient and effective mobilisation.\n\nIn a departure from the four-decade tradition of hosting the national event in Harare, this year marks the fourth consecutive year the commemorations have been decentralised, having been previously held in Bulawayo, Mt Darwin and Murambinda.\n\nThe move underscores the Governments commitment to devolution and inclusive development.\n\nIn an interview on Friday, Local Government and Public Works Minister Daniel Garwe also confirmed that work at the main venue in Gokwe Nembudziya was progressing well.\n\nHe said beyond the main arena, significant infrastructure upgrades have been undertaken, designed to benefit the Gokwe North community long after the celebrations. These sustainable development projects include a new, fully equipped stadium capable of hosting Division One football matches.\n\nRenovations have been undertaken at the local district hospital, including the VIP ward and a new mortuary, while new boys and girls hostels have been constructed at Nyamuroro High School to accommodate visiting children.\n\nThere have also been extensive upgrades at Nembudziya High School, including new classroom blocks, renovated existing ones, new science labs and administration block improvements.\n\nEnhanced water supply has also been achieved through three new boreholes and water tanks, alongside secured electricity and backup generators.\n\nGokwe and surrounding areas have also seen road improvements managed by the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development.\n\nLogistical arrangements are being streamlined, with 369 buses mobilised to transport attendees from across the country.\n\n",

            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza,[emailprotected]The establishment of a water and sanitation utility in Bulawayo is intended to improve service delivery, attract funding and investment, enhance accountability reduce water shortages, and boost efficiency.\n\nIt is therefore not a move towards privatising water services.\n\nThis was clarified by the acting Director of Water and Sanitation, Engineer Kwanele Sibanda during a stakeholder consultative meeting held yesterday at the City Hall to discuss the proposed establishment of an independent water management utility.\n\nThe Bulawayo City Council (BCC) has proposed the formation of a Private Limited Corporate Organisation, aimed at unlocking external financing opportunities, with US$17 million earmarked to upgrade the citys water infrastructure.\n\nThe initiative seeks to tackle long-standing infrastructure challenges and is expected to benefit from the technical expertise and resources of partners such as the Veolia Environment Institute (VEI).\n\nThe proposed utility would function as a specialised, professionally managed entity wholly owned by the City of Bulawayo to improve operational efficiency and service delivery.\n\nThe consultative meeting drew participation from a wide range of stakeholders including residents, civil society organisations, human rights lawyers and business community representatives.\n\nAlso in attendance were the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Judith Ncube; Deputy Mayor Councillor Edwin Ndlovu; Town Clerk Mr Christopher Dube and the Permanent Secretary for Provincial Affairs and Devolution in Bulawayo, Mr Paul Nyoni.\n\nSome residents expressed concerns that the establishment of the Water and Sanitation Utility was tantamount to privatisation  a move they feared would result in increased tariffs and make water services unaffordable for vulnerable groups.\n\nMs Nomalanga Vundla from Makokoba asked whether or not water tariffs will increase under the new utility arrangement.\n\nWater is a public resource and the right to access it is enshrined in our Constitution. I would like to know if the proposed utility will make water accessible only to those who can afford it, she asked.\n\nIn response, Eng Sibanda explained that a financial feasibility study indicated that the utilitys viability does not depend on increasing water tariffs.\n\nResidents are encouraged to understand the need for a utility and the benefits it brings. Tariff hikes are not the basis for its sustainability, she said.\n\nAnother resident raised concerns about the impact on pensioners and the elderly, who are already struggling to pay their rates.\n\nOther attendees voiced strong opposition, claiming that the decision-making process has excluded the views of ordinary citizens.\n\nEng Sibanda insisted that the council is not privatising water services.\n\nThe proposed utility will be owned entirely by the people of Bulawayo, with 100 percent shareholding by the City of Bulawayo.\n\nIt will be professionally run to enhance service delivery and not to transfer ownership or control to private entities, she said.\n\nEng Sibanda further clarified that the council is not entering into a public-private partnership or creating a charter. Instead, a private limited company will be registered solely to safeguard the utility from external threats such as hostile takeovers or dilution of control.\n\nThis is not privatisation. The companys shares will not be tradable. It will not be profit-driven but focused on delivering efficient and affordable water and sanitation services, she said.\n\nAn eight-member board comprising public and council representatives will oversee the operations of the utility. A residents representative will also sit on the board to ensure public accountability.\n\nThe City of Bulawayo will retain ownership of the utilitys assets and will delegate the management, operations and maintenance to the 100 percent council-owned company, said Eng Sibanda.\n\nShe assured residents that the council will continue its pro-poor approach.\n\nResidents aged 70 and above can still approach the council for assistance. We offer discounted tariffs for vulnerable groups and that policy will not change with the creation of the new utility, she said.\n\nHowever, Eng Sibanda noted that setting up the utility may require tariff adjustments in line with prevailing economic conditions.\n\nIf not properly structured, the utility could face risks of mismanagement or inefficiency. Initial setup costs and loan repayments could place strain on council finances. However, as of February 2025, the water and sanitation department has no outstanding loans, she said.\n\nThe council continues to grapple with persistent water supply disruptions, ageing infrastructure, rising demand due to urban expansion and procurement delays, all of which make the establishment of a dedicated Water and Sanitation Utility a necessity, according to officials.\n\n",

This change follows the rehabilitation of the scheme and training in climate-smart agriculture and agribusiness management.\n\nThe schemes farmers have planted 2,5 hectares of maize, which is now ready for harvesting and two hectares of sugar beans. Plans are already underway to introduce wheat farming, with eight hectares prepared for planting this May.\n\nEstablished in 2019, the Midlo Irrigation Scheme comprises 47 farmers; 30 women and 17 men, including the elderly and people with disabilities.\n\nThe scheme was recently expanded from eight to 20 hectares, bringing relief to farmers who previously relied on labour-intensive methods, using hosepipes to water crops.\n\nIn the past, we would spend the entire day at the scheme, taking turns connecting hosepipes to taps to water our crops. It was exhausting and often forced our children to skip school to help. Now, with the new system, things have changed for the better, said Ms Hleziphi Moyo, a member of the scheme.\n\nThanks to the installation of a centre pivot and drag hose sprinklers, irrigation is now more efficient and less labour-intensive.\n\nThe system we have now is convenient. It doesnt require much labour or supervision. I can go home and attend to other chores while the machinery does the watering. We are excited about the potential to grow more crops and increase our income. This winter, well plant wheat for the first time since the scheme was established, said Ms Moyo.\n\nMs Moyo added that they were looking forward to improved yields that would help support their families.\n\nSpeaking during a recent visit to the scheme, Engineer Bezzel Chitsungo, the Director for Irrigation Development in the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, said the Government was promoting the Vision 2030 Accelerator Model, which aims to uplift communities into an upper-middle-income economy.\n\nUnder this model, irrigation farmers must form companies and become shareholders. The Arda scheme manager will assist in running the scheme as a business and developing a five-year business plan, he said.\n\nEngineer Chitsungo said that, with the guidance of scheme managers, farmers would have improved access to Government support, such as machinery and inputs.\n\nGovernment is moving to capacitate irrigation schemes, as they have a crucial role to play in enhancing agricultural production because they can produce year-round, he said.\n\nAmbassador Tadeous Tafirenyika Chifamba, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Environment, Climate and Wildlife, commended Midlo Irrigation Scheme farmers for embracing the project. He said irrigation farming is vital for food security, especially in the face of climate change.\n\nAmbassador Chifamba also announced that the farmers would be supported with a fish farming project to complement their crop production.\n\nMidlo Irrigation Scheme was rehabilitated under the Building Climate Resilience of Vulnerable Agricultural Livelihoods in Southern Africa programme, which is being implemented by the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development in partnership with the Green Climate Fund and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\n\nA solar-powered plant has been installed to pump water from Midlo Dam. The centre pivot irrigates 15 hectares, while the drag hose sprinkler covers the remaining five hectares.\n\nThe Government, in collaboration with development partners, is rehabilitating idle irrigation schemes in Matabeleland South as part of a broader national effort to enhance food and nutrition security in line with Vision 2030.\n\nTo support this transformation, farmers have received agricultural inputs and training on how to run their operations as businesses. These efforts are part of the Governments ambitious plan to rehabilitate and develop 350 000 hectares of irrigated land by 2025, thereby building resilience against climate change and boosting food security.\n\n@DubeMatutu\n\n",

            "content": "The developments taking place at Dinson Iron and Steel Company (Disco) in Manhize area near Mvuma town confirm that the countrys steel industry is back on track.\n\nThe company, which started producing pig iron and steel billets last year, is now producing steel bars. This is a major development in the countrys efforts to revive the steel industry, which is critical for Zimbabwes modernisation and industrialisation.\n\nThe country has been spending an estimated US$1 billion annually on steel imports, which are mainly steel bars, which are now being produced by Disco. The company is producing about 9 000 tonnes of steel products per month and has a target to produce 600 000 tonnes a year.\n\nWe are now producing 16mm, 20mm and 25mm bars, which are mostly used in the construction industry, said the companys public relations manager, Mr Joseph Shoko. He said the company was committed to meeting local demand for steel products thereby completely substituting imports.\n\nThe company has already created 2 000 jobs and has a potential to create 10000 jobs when operating at full throttle. Most of the employees are locals from Manhize and surrounding areas. What is very encouraging about Disco is that it is not only substituting imports, but is also a leader in upholding high occupational health and safety standards, that has seen the steel producer recording zero fatalities since its inception.\n\nThe company, a subsidiary of Chinese global investment group, Tsingshan Holdings, is one of the Second Republics signature projects that are transforming livelihoods of communities. The national Social Security Authority (Nssa), said for the past four years that Disco has been in operation, it has not recorded a single death at the workplace.\n\nSpeaking after the tour of the giant steel plant, by experts and engineers that were attending the annual Nssa Engineers Workshop in Masvingo recently, Nssa acting general manager Dr Charles Shava, commended Disco for upholding high occupational health and safety standards. He said Disco, which has the potential to be the largest steel plant in Africa, has done well in terms of occupational health and safety.\n\nThey have had only incidents where some workers have suffered some minor injuries, but I think overall, they have done very well because we are talking about a very big steel plant, said Dr Shava.\n\nHe said Nssa was happy that Disco has a very good medical team on the ground, a confirmation that they are on top of the game and are able to deal with the issue of diseases. The company is producing 50MW of electricity using coal but has very limited pollution. The coal is emitting very little pollutants in the air. What is obtaining at Disco should be emulated by other companies so that we reduce fatalities at the workplace. We want to applaud Disco for not just creating thousands of jobs, but also ensuring that its employees work under a conducive working environment.\n\nThe company has invested a lot of money in occupational health and safety hence it has recorded zero fatalities since it started operating. Disco has demonstrated that it is possible to drastically reduce fatalities at the workplace and as already stated, other companies should learn from this giant steel producer.\n\nOccupational health and safety should be a priority for all companies, if we are to reduce fatalities at the workplace. We want to once again applaud Disco for accelerating the revival of the local steel industry and saving the country the much needed forex by substituting imports.\n\n",

            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza,[emailprotected]THE National University of Science and Technology (Nust) has enlisted the assistance of the police to help deter the influx of illegal gold miners who have invaded its main campus in Bulawayo.\n\nThe university has recently become a target for illegal gold panners, who are increasingly encroaching on residential areas in suburbs such as Killarney, resulting in extensive land degradation.\n\nLast year, six Bulawayo men were arrested and brought before the courts for illegal gold panning activities on the Nust campus.\n\nThe panners were caught conducting illicit mining operations in pits located within the university grounds. The arrests followed a raid by the Zimbabwe Republic\n\nPolice (ZRP), which included officers from the canine unit who swooped on the site where dozens of illegal miners were digging for the precious mineral.\n\nThe majority of the miners fled but six were apprehended. They were each sentenced to six months imprisonment.\n\nDespite strengthening its internal security systems, Nust security personnel continue to clash with persistent intruders, known colloquially as Omakorokoza, who have escalated their operations in recent months.\n\nThe Nust campus was recently invaded by illegal artisanal miners from nearby Old Nic Mine and the Zimbabwe School of Mines area.\n\nTo address the issue, the university sought the assistance of the ZRP in addition to reinforcing our internal security to intensify patrols around the campus, said the universitys Vice-Chancellor, Professor Mqhele Dlodlo.\n\nHe was briefing the Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development, Dr Frederick Shava, who visited the university last week and toured key projects on the campus.\n\nDr Frederick Shava\n\nProfessor Dlodlo said although the university has applied for a special grant from the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development to legally undertake mining operations through its own company, the application has not yet been approved.\n\nWe applied for a special grant, and the ministry referred the university to the Bulawayo City Council for a letter of consent.\n\nThis was denied, but we will continue to seek the ministrys intervention for special mining rights, he said. Acting Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Nomalanga Msebele, confirmed that Nust has requested police intervention to rid its campus of illegal miners.\n\nThe illegal miners usually operate at night to avoid detection by Nusts internal security. At the universitys request, the police have been conducting regular raids to apprehend those involved in the illicit activities, she said.\n\nOn the issue of illegal mining in suburbs such as Mqabuko Heights and Killarney, among others, Assistant Inspector Msebele urged members of the public to report such activities to the police.\n\nInformation from the public regarding illegal mining operations in city suburbs is treated in strict confidence and greatly assists police in planning effective raids, she said.\n\nIllegal mining causes extensive environmental damage and often attracts criminal elements hence police will continue raiding the affected areas.\n\nGold panning has persisted for years despite repeated police efforts to clamp down on the widespread violence and environmental destruction associated with such operations.\n\nAt Mqabuko Heights, atop a hill that overlooks immaculately built homes, gold panners have wreaked havoc by digging deep pits and cutting down trees to use as timber in their illicit mining activities.\n\nConcerned residents in the suburb say the panners invaded the hill roughly a year and a half ago and fear their property values will plummet as a result.\n\nIn Killarney suburb, in an area known locally as the squatter camp, gold panners armed with compressors, picks and shovels have been operating for years.\n\nIn the area between Mahatshula and Queens Park suburbs, under electricity pylons, there are heaps of rubble and trenches confirming panning activities.\n\nAccording to the Chief Executive Officer of the Zimbabwe Miners Federation, Mr Wellington Takavarasha, mines must be located at least one kilometre away from residential areas, whether urban or rural.\n\nA blasting licence issued by the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development clearly stipulates that any mining activity must be conducted at least one kilometre away from human settlements to ensure safety during blasting operations, he said.\n\nAdditionally, miners must obtain the consent of the community in which they wish to operate. In extreme cases, some communities are relocated to make way for mining developments.\n\nNUST now joins a growing list of Bulawayo suburbs suffering from severe land degradation due to rampant illegal gold mininga destructive practice driven by gold panners who disregard both environmental regulations and legal mining requirements, engaging in both open-cast and, in extreme cases, shaft mining.\n\n",

            "content": "Nqobile Bhebhe,Senior Business Writer\n\nIN a major policy breakthrough poised to enhance Zimbabwes investment appeal in the oil and gas sector, the Government and Invictus Energy have agreed to consolidate the Petroleum Production Sharing Agreement (PPSA) and the Petroleum Exploration Development and Production Agreement (Pedpa) into a unified and streamlined legal framework.\n\nThis landmark decision was reached during a high-level in-country visit by the Invictus Energy Board of Directors at the end of March.\n\nThe delegation held extensive engagements with senior Government officials, the Mutapa Investment Fund, traditional leaders, local investors and key project partners.\n\nTheir discussions centred on accelerating progress in the Cabora Bassa Project, Zimbabwes flagship petroleum exploration initiative.\n\nFollowing in-depth legal and technical consultations involving Invictus Energy, external legal counsel to Zimbabwe and relevant Government ministries, all parties unanimously agreed that amalgamating the PPSA and Pedpa would provide long-term regulatory clarity and administrative efficiency.\n\nThe consolidated agreement is expected to streamline approval processes, reduce bureaucratic duplication and enhance governance as the project transitions from exploration to commercial production.\n\nWhile the move has prompted a slight revision in project timelines, it is viewed as a strategic step that positions Zimbabwe as a regional leader in petroleum regulation.\n\nSeparately, the consolidation of the Petroleum Exploration Development and Production Agreement and the Petroleum Production Sharing Agreement provides a clearer path forward and reflects the shared commitment to enabling a successful development, said Invictus Energy managing director, Mr Scott Macmillan in an update.\n\nOur recent site visit to Zimbabwe marks another important milestone in the development of the Cabora Bassa Project and reinforces the strong support from all levels of Government and the broader Zimbabwean community.\n\nDuring the visit, Invictus also confirmed Musuma-1 as the next high-impact exploration well, following the landmark Mukuyu gas discovery.\n\nThe selection of Musuma-1 as the next high-impact exploration well beyond the Mukuyu discovery, is a major achievement for Invictus. Musuma is a technically compelling prospect, underpinned by multiple lines of seismic evidence, including consistent flat spots across different surveys, which are indicative of hydrocarbons, said Mr Macmillan.\n\nThe well has been designed as a low-cost, low-risk vertical well to test a shallow target with significant upside.\n\nMr Macmillan added that success at Musuma could unlock a new play fairway, substantially expand the projects resource base and fast-track the transition from exploration to commercial development.\n\nThe unified agreement is also expected to unlock further investment opportunities in the Cabora Bassa Basin, sending a strong signal to global energy markets that Zimbabwe is committed to managing large-scale energy projects with transparency, professionalism and stability.\n\nIn 2023, Invictus Energy confirmed significant natural gas and oil reserves in the Cabora Bassa Basin in Mbire, Mashonaland Central Province.\n\nThese discoveries marked a substantial leap towards energy security, opening up new avenues for economic growth through the development of downstream industries, job creation, increased export earnings and higher Government revenue.\n\nThere is growing optimism that early monetisation of the oil and gas finds could offer meaningful relief to Zimbabwe, which faces a national power deficit, peaking at 2 200MW, especially during the winter months.\n\nThe deficit, often met through costly imports, has resulted in prolonged power outages that disrupt both business operations and household life.\n\nTo address the energy gap, Invictus has signed two separate agreements with Eureka Gold Mine and Mbuyu Energy for gas-to-power projects, initiatives expected to create further job opportunities beyond primary production.\n\nThe two gas-to-power projects will see Invictus supplying 12MW to Eureka Gold Mine, and this figure can be raised to 50MW, while a local firm in the energy space, Mbuyu Energy, signed an offtake agreement with Invictus for 500MW.\n\nThe agreement with Mbuyu Energy project holds the potential to scale up to 1 000MW, which would require approximately 1,4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThis level of power generation is expected to relieve pressure on Zimbabwes overburdened electricity grid and support the Southern African Power Pool, while also enabling better integration of renewable energy sources.\n\nIn a further vote of confidence, global petroleum research firm, Wood Mackenzie, classified the Mukuyu gas discovery as the second-largest petroleum find in Africa in 2023.\n\nThe estimated resource at Mukuyu stands at 230 million barrels of oil, equivalent to 1,3 trillion cubic feet of gas.\n\nWith a structural closure of over 200 square kilometres, independent estimates suggest the Mukuyu field could hold up to 20 trillion cubic feet of gas and 845 million barrels of conventional gas condensate.\n\n",
