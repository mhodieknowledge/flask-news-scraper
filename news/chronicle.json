We want our institutions to get involved with students who are in these universities across the country, use their talents. And we have seen quite a lot of innovative ideas, some which are in the initial stage, but some which are already at the finishing stage, almost ready to go for commercialization, Vice President Chiwenga said.\n\nHe said Government wants to see the industry going to the universities and technical colleges, with their problems, be it manufacturing or be it an industrial setup and present to the tertiary institutions.Industry must be able to say to these institutions, this is what I would want to achieve. And then give it to the students, rather than the students just to dream and have something on their own which maybe not fit in the current industrial setup and this is what we have been promoting, said VP Chiwenga.\n\nThe Vice President also challenged the private sector to be proactive and fund the innovations since they will be the major beneficiaries of the finished products.When I opened the business forum yesterday and went to the research council in Zimbabwe I said the private sector, the industry itself, must now come on board because they are the beneficiaries and they must sponsor, not for Government alone to carry the burden because it is them who are going to benefit, they must sponsor the talented students and then the students do what they are supposed to do, said VP Chiwenga.\n\n",

After confirming suspicious behaviour, the Executives immediately contacted the South African Police Service (SAPS) Detectives in Musina, the Limpopo Provincial Anti-Corruption Unit, and the Local Criminal Record Centre (LCRC) to process the case further.\n\nThe official said during the operation, the Executives observed a white Mercedes-Benz taxi parked near a shop at the port, where the two BMA Immigration officials were seen engaging with the facilitator and subsequently allowing it to pass through, allegedly after receiving a bribe.\n\nShe said the vehicle was intercepted shortly thereafter and was found transporting 18 passengers, 13 of whom held valid travel documents, while five were undocumented foreign nationals.\n\nA female passenger and the taxi driver, believed to have facilitated the illegal entry, were also arrested.\n\nAll nine suspects were charged with corruption and appeared before the Musina Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 23 April 2025. The five undocumented individuals face additional charges under the Immigration Act. The case has been postponed to Thursday, 24 April 2025 for a formal bail application, said Deputy Asst Comm Mogotsi.\n\nShe said the BMA has since suspended the two implicated officials, pending the outcome of both internal disciplinary processes and the criminal investigation.\n\nActing Commissioner of the BMA, Ms Jane Thupana, has commended the proactive involvement of the BMA Executive team on the ground and reaffirmed the Authoritys commitment to cleaning up the system.\n\nThis operation reflects the BMAs firm stance against corruption within its ranks. I applaud the Executive members for leading from the front and taking decisive action to restore integrity at one of our busiest ports. We are resolute in disrupting illegal facilitation networks and holding every official accountable to the highest standards of conduct, she said.\n\nThe operation strengthens the BMAs resolve to roll out Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs) across all ports of entry. This Easter period, 40 body cameras were deployed across various sites, enhancing monitoring capabilities and supporting real-time accountability.\n\nThe implementation of body cameras is not just about oversight  its about protecting both the official and the public and ensuring that every interaction at our ports is transparent, lawful, and traceable.\n\nThe Acting Commissioner said with increased movements expected during the return leg of the Easter travel period, the BMA continues to intensify its operational presence at ports and along the borderline, with a strong focus on intercepting illegal movement and dismantling facilitation syndicates.\n\nCases of corruption at South Africas borders have become rife, with that countrys Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber announcing recently that his ministry had, between July last year and February this year, fired 27 officials on corruption and fraud-related charges committed inland and at ports of entry as the fight against corruption gathers momentum.\n\n",

This follows a record 36,48 tonnes produced in 2024.\n\nMr Ben Turney, the groups chief executive, said central to its strategy in Zimbabwe was to promote local shareholder ownership that allows citizens to participate in their future success through long-term equity investment.\n\nThe transaction sends a strong message that Zimbabwe is open for business. We look forward to this investment acting as a cornerstone for our introduction to the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange a little later this summer, he said in a joint statement.\n\nMr Turney said the consortium was an influential group of individual pension funds in Zimbabwe that collaborate on investments.\n\nHe said the 28 consortium members had made the decision to invest in equities and indicated their intention to participate in the Kavango investment facility.\n\nAs part of a rigorous due diligence, several consortium members and members of the investment The committee conducted site visits to review Kavangos gold projects. It reflects the strong progress our team has made in less than two years of operations in Zimbabwe, that we successfully passed this process.\n\nWe now intend to use the Comarton funds for mine development and construction of our first gold processing plant, he said.\n\nMr Turney said Kavango planned to bring Prospects 1, 3 and 4 phases at the Hillside Project into production over the next 12 months, using modern mechanised mining.\n\nOperating through its Zimbabwean subsidiary, Kavango Zimbabwe, established in July 2023, the company is targeting several historically high-grade gold mines in the Matabeleland region, focusing on economic bulk mining.\n\nMr Richard Muirimi, the group managing director of Comarton Consultants (Private) Limited (Comarton), said the consortium was excited after securing a partner for its fourth investment, the mining sector, having already successfully executed on the targeted property sector, tourism and agriculture sectors.\n\nHe said the partnership with Kavango answered the key consortium investment focus of bedding the actual asset in hard currency, benefiting from potential capital growth and generation of long-term hard currency free cash flows, and contributing to the development of sustainable businesses that create employment and other benefits for Zimbabwean citizens.\n\nWith a firm focus on ensuring all four quadrants generate hard currency cash flows, this partnership will contribute to the enhancement of the payment of hard currency quarterly in USD pensions on the Comarton portfolio being implemented from 1 January 2025, he said.\n\nAccording to the convertible loan note structure, the convertible facility can be drawn down by the company over a twelve-month period in three tranches.\n\nTranche 1 entails at least US$500 000 payable in US dollars and to be drawn down immediately for mine development in Zimbabwe.\n\nOn Tranche 2, US$1,5 million equivalent was paid through conversion of Zimbabwe Gold, the official currency of Zimbabwe, into US dollars at the Bank of Englands exchange rate via the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to be drawn down over the next 12 months for the import of mining equipment for Kavango into Zimbabwe.\n\nFinally, tranche 3: US$3 million paid in US dollars will be drawn down over the next 12 months for mine development in Zimbabwe.\n\nAll the funds raised through the convertible will be used for mine development in Zimbabwe and the importation of mining equipment into the country.\n\nKavango is exploring for gold deposits in Zimbabwe that have the potential to be brought into production, and the company is targeting both open-pit and underground opportunities.\n\n",

China will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests as well as the common interests of the international community, in particular the Global South, said Amb Ding.\n\nSharing Chinas experience in sustainable industrialization and economic development, a story of transformation that stands as a defining case study, Amb Ding said China chose a development model fitting its own reality.After a century of foreign invasion and domestic upheaval, we rebuilt our industrial base in the 1950s-60s, launched the transformative reform and opening-up drive in 1978, and we have pursued high-quality development since 2012.The Communist Party of China (CPC) has consistently adapted strategies to our evolving national realities, and created a Chinese path to modernization, said Amb Ding.\n\nHe said Chinas journey shows that there is no universal blueprint for development as success comes from finding a model that fits a nations unique context while industrialisation requires visionary leadership that tailors strategies to local conditions, balancing ambitions with pragmatism.At the core of Chinese modernisation is the steadfast leadership of the CPC, which has provided strategic continuity and pragmatic governance to ensure stability amid complexity, said Amb Ding.\n\nHe said by integrating into global value chains they attracted investment, technology and talent transforming China into a manufacturing and innovation powerhouse, forming a manufacturing ecosystem unmatched in scale and versatility.Today, we take pride in being the only nation with all industrial categories listed in the United Nations industrial classification system, said Amb Ding.Furthermore, Amb Ding said Chinas success was the result of substantial and persistent investments in infrastructure, human capital and technology.\n\nHe said China has strategically upgraded traditional industries to be higher-end, smarter, greener and more sustainable, while driving digitised, Internet-based, and energy-efficient economic growth.In 2024, Chinas high-tech manufacturing sector grew by 8.9 percent, while energy intensity dropped by over 3 percent. From producing 13 million electric vehicles annually to developing DeepSeek, a high-performance, open-source Artificial Intelligence model, Chinas innovation-driven, eco-friendly growth is both robust and irreversible.Chinas story demonstrates that it is possible for a developing country to achieve development through strategic planning, active engagement in global trade and investment, and pursuit of innovation-driven growth, said Amb Ding.\n\nHe said every nations journey is unique with a no one-size-fits-all industrialisation model and as a true friend, China supports Zimbabwes efforts to forge its own modernisation path that harnesses Zimbabwes heritage, resources, and aspirations.@nyeve14\n\n",
