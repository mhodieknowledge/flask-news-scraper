This electrifying launch promises to captivate hearts and minds!\n\nThe launch event, held in August at the Filabusi Centre District Hall, drew a substantial crowd, marking a significant step in the fight against the rampant drug crisis in Zimbabwe.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Chronicle Showbiz, Masuku expressed his elation over the successful turnout, stating, It was heartwarming to see so many people come together under the theme Kasiphumeni kuzidakamizwaLets desist from drugs and substance abuse. This shows that our community is ready to engage in this crucial conversation.\n\nThe 202-page novel not only aligns with the governments zero-tolerance approach to drug abuse but also aims to resonate with readers on a personal level.\n\nMasuku, who serves as a Poultry and Piggery Supervisor at Gwanda State University, has ambitious plans to translate the novel into other languages, including Venda, Nambya, and Shona.\n\nThese languages are predominantly spoken in the border towns where drug abuse is most prevalent. I believe that translating this work will help reach a wider audience and make a more significant impact, he explained.\n\nHe, however, stated that his vision does not stop at the written word, adding that he is already in talks to adapt Mhla Zinhlanu kuLwezi into a thrilling movie.\n\nWhile there are no auditions yet for the film crew, Masuku is optimistic about starting the filming process early next year, pending the completion of translation discussions.\n\nI want to partner with donors to bring this story to the big screen. The idea is still on paper for now, as we are working on securing finances for the project.The film will be released in episodes, allowing us to engage viewers in a unique way. As soon as an episode is completed, well release it based on industry advice and audience feedback, he added with enthusiasm.\n\nAs the conversation around drug awareness continues to grow, Masukus novel and upcoming film promise to be powerful tools in the fight against substance abuse. Were not just telling a story; were igniting a movement, he concluded, embodying the spirit of change that is so desperately needed in todays society.\n\nStay tuned for more updates on Mhla Zinhlanu kuLwezi as it makes its way from page to screen, inspiring hope and resilience in the face of adversity. @TeamKarubwa\n\n",

The President expressed these sentiments during a festive Boxing Day gathering where he honoured the Mbare Chimurenga Choir for its invaluable contributions to Zimbabwes rich tapestry of culture and national identity.\n\nThe President also underscored the significance of the cultural creative industries, highlighting their role as engines of economic growth and innovation. He emphasised that these sectors not only foster artistic expression but also promote social cohesion and preserve Zimbabwes unique identity.\n\nAs you are aware, the cultural creative industries play a vital role in society by fostering economic growth through creative outputs such as music, art, design, fashion, and film, among others. They also contribute significantly to social cohesion, cultural identity, innovation, and individual well-being by nurturing creativity, expression, and engagement within communities.\n\nHonouring the Mbare Chimurenga Choir is appreciation, through them, of the many musicians and artistes who continue to use their artistic talents to defend the gains of our Independence and advance our national development identity, image, and culture.\n\nIt was in residential areas such as Mbare, Highfields, Makokoba, Mpopoma, Mtapa, and Sakubva, among others, where the flames for Independence were kept ablaze before and during our protracted war of liberation, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe said through song and dance, young people were mobilised to go for military training and subsequently to fight for the freedom of the country.\n\nIn the post-Independence era, said President Mnangagwa, it is groups and musicians such as the Mbare Chimurenga Choir who used their exceptional talent to promote cultural diversity and rally younger generations around the various national development periods.\n\nHe congratulated the Mbare Chimurenga Choir for the consistency with which it has utilised its musical talent for the good of the country and the ruling Zanu-PF party.\n\nYour music with its educating lyrics is a symbol of the hope and resilience that inspires countless individuals to remain patriotic and safeguard our beloved nation. The performance you have delivered over the years inculcates the values of unity, resilience, and love. Your revolutionary spirit is a beacon of light and hope.\n\nIt is also a reminder of our collective history, our shared struggles, as well as a celebration of our resilience and determination to build a better Zimbabwe. I applaud you for your current efforts and music compilations which highlight our ongoing national development agenda, vision, policies, and programmes. Through your efforts along with others in the creative cultural industries, the nation must remain galvanised towards the attainment of our vision of a prosperous and empowered upper-middle-income economy, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe also handed over gifts to the choir and encouraged them to carry the message of love, unity, and the need to accelerate development in the country, continuing to uplift one another and embrace the values being nurtured by the Second Republic.\n\nGoing forward, I urge you to continue infusing the new crop of musicians, particularly the youth, into your groups. It is equally important that you broaden the reach of your music, riding on the diversity of ICT platforms.\n\nAs I hand over these gifts, we acknowledge the tireless efforts of each and every one of you. Your dedication to Zanu-PF programmes is commendable and your performances have been a source of joy and entertainment for many, said President Mnangagwa.\n\n",

The second helicopter is anticipated to arrive in Bulawayo shortly.\n\nTogether, the two air medical rescue service helicopters will provide rapid medical assistance for serious incidents such as road traffic accidents throughout the Matabeleland region.\n\nThese helicopters are part of a larger fleet of six that will be dispatched across four stations, including Harare, Manicaland, Victoria Falls, and Bulawayo.\n\nThe helicopter will be based here in Bulawayo. This is a Presidential project and we are working on his instructions, said Rusanov.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa and the Government have embarked on a mission to modernise Zimbabwes healthcare systemto achieve the goal of becoming a modern, prosperous, and industrialised country by 2030.\n\nTo this end, the President visited Russia in June to seek investors to establish an air ambulance service.\n\nRussian HeliDrive Air Ambulance Medical Services promptly collaborated with Zimbabwe to establish an efficient air ambulance service equipped with highly skilled medical doctors, nurses, engineers, dispatchers, and pilots.\n\nThe Russian Air Ambulance Service has been in operation for nine years and has a fleet of over 100 medical helicopters, dedicated to saving lives throughout Russia.\n\nThe company has recruited and trained local personnel, including 40 pilots, 50 doctors, 100 nurses, 100 dispatchers, and 10 engineers, to handle the air medical services.\n\nAir ambulances are typically reserved for transporting patients from inadequate levels of care to higher levels of care or for patients who are unable to use commercial flights due to their medical condition.\n\nThese specialised aircraft are designed to overcome geographical barriers and provide the same level of medical care available in an intensive care unit.\n\nThe air ambulance service was launched in Zimbabwe in August in conjunction with the 44th SADC summit.\n\nThe helicopters are equipped with advanced medical facilities and staffed by trained medical personnel. One of the first successful missions was the transportation of a cardiac arrest patient from Chegutu to Harare in 20 minutes, which is significantly faster than the two-hour road journey.\n\nAlthough Winos Dube, chairperson of the Bulawayo Residents Association (Bura), recognised the significance of the arrival of the air ambulance, he emphasised the importance of providing equitable access to critical services.\n\nWe applaud the Government on this. We, however, hope that every person who needs emergency medical attention will access this. It must not be based on ones position in society but generally, we are excited as its presence will indeed save lives, said Dube.\n\n",
