            "content": "Gibson Nyikadzino,Zimpapers Politics Hub\n\nON Saturday, voters in the Glen View South constituency are going to the ballot to elect their National Assembly representative in a second by-election in nearly six years since the constituencys creation in 2008.\n\nThe first by-election, held on September 7, 2019, was necessitated by the death, on 10 June 2019, of Vimbai Tsvangirai-Java of the MDC Alliance. This time, the seat was left vacant following the death of legislator Mr Grandmore Hakata, who was from the opposition CCC.\n\nVoting patterns and the behaviour of the electorate in this constituency since 2008 have been unfavourable to ZANU PF candidates.\n\nHowever, by observing voting trends on the previous by-election and an electoral overview since 2008, ZANU PF stands a big chance of winning.\n\nFrom 2008, the opposition has metamorphosised; hence in the 2008, 2013, 2018 and 2023 elections, ZANU PF faced the opposition as MDC-T; MDC-Alliance and CCC.\n\nEach time the opposition has rebranded, its support base has been declining, giving room to ZANU PF.\n\nSince 2008, a closer analysis of the election results for this constituency shows that votes for the MDC declined between 2008 and 2013 before increasing in 2018.\n\nAlthough ZANU-PFs votes increased between 2008 and 2018, the opposition (as MDC-T or MDC-Alliance) continued to post victories with wide margins.\n\nThese big margins can be attributed to protest votes from urbanites who may have been swayed by the empty rhetoric of Mr Morgan Tsvangirai and the now retired Nelson Chamisa in the pre-and post-2018 era.\n\nIt appears rationality has somehow returned to the constituency to enable the electorate to vote based on issues.\n\nOf importance is to note that ZANU PFs electoral performance in Glen View South has been informed by its ability to organise and keep a presence in a constituency that traditionally has been an opposition stronghold.\n\nSince 2008, the constituency has been an opposition stronghold with Paul Madzore winning it twice in a row with wide margins of 9,158 votes in 2008 and 8,301 votes in 2013 against ZANU PF candidates 2,583 votes in 2013, for example.\n\nIn the 2018 harmonised elections, MDC-Alliance candidate Tsvangirai-Java won the constituency with 9,942 votes against ZANU PFs Dumisani Chipango who garnered 3,248 votes.\n\nHowever, following Tsvangirai-Javas death, her brother Vincent Tsvangirai won the poll with 3,474 votes against Offard Muchuwe of ZANU PF who polled 1,534 votes.Vincent Tsvangirais winning tally in the by-elections was 35 percent down from his sisters tally the previous year.\n\nThese results show that both ZANU PF and the MDC-Alliance were complacent in voter mobilisation. This might have been necessitated by the oppositions traditional enjoyment of victory in urban constituencies or ZANU PFs difficulties in penetrating these constituencies.\n\nThe turning point in Zimbabwes history of by-elections was experienced during the March 26, 2022, polls. Both ZANU PF and the opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) contested in 28 constituencies that were necessitated by the recall of opposition parliamentarians.\n\nOf the contested 28 seats, 21 seats belonged to the opposition while seven to ZANU PF. However, following the by-elections, ZANU PF successfully retained the seven seats it had won in 2018 and won an extra two seats in the Epworth and Mutasa South constituencies.\n\nIn that by-election, ZANU PF won 48,3 percent of the votes, while the CCC won 48,9 percent, with the MDC-Alliance taking home 2,6 percent. This was despite the fact that only eight of the constituencies were rural and 20 were urban seats where opposition parties tend to do better.\n\nIndications since the March 26 by-elections are that a non-complacent ZANU PF can fish in the oppositions pond. Of the total votes cast then, ZANU PF received 128,399 votes while the CCC had a total 129 799 votes. Between the two parties, there only existed a difference of 1,400 votes.\n\nPolitical changes are happening. ZANU PF now holds seven seats in the Harare Metropolitan Province, the largest since opposition inroads in 2000.\n\nThe Glen View South by-election now comes at a time when ZANU PFs popularity is surging nationally because of the absence of an organised opposition, the peoples sympathy towards the revolutionary party and the disappointments opposition followers have experienced with splits and backstabbing in their camp.\n\nDuring the 2023 harmonised polls, CCCs Hakata garnered 15,203 votes against ZANU PFs Muchuwe who garnered 3,112 votes.\n\nWith tomorrows race being contested by ZANU PFs Tsitsi Tawomera; National Constitutional Assembly (NCA)s Perpetua Mukanda, and independent candidates George Makwangwaidze, Tonderai Chakeredza and Tungamirai Madzokere, the hope is the ruling Zanu PF party will continue on its upward trajectory.\n\n",

Over the past decade leading up to last year, Zimbabwe has not made a significant impact internationally because we are producing half-baked models.\n\nHe went on to highlight a range of basic skills lacking in aspiring beauty queens.Its sad that the models we have now dont know how to sit, stand, or even answer questions. Most of them are making it to the international stage because of powerful connections and wealthy sponsors, rather than merit.\n\nRukato lamented Zimbabwes lack of consistent visibility and success at prestigious global events such as Miss World and Miss Universe.The quality of models we are getting from the current crop of instructors is quite shocking. As a seasoned modelling trainer, I often find myself wondering where some of these models are being groomed.\n\nCalling for change, Rukato stressed the need for the formalisation and regulation of the modelling sector in Zimbabwe to ensure higher standards and more credible representation on international platforms.\n\nAmong those Rukato has trained are Phoebe Monjane (Miss Zimbabwe 2022), Sakhile Dube (Miss Universe 2024), Greatmore Chatya (Nokia Face of Africa 2005 finalist) Jeferson Mselera a TV presenter and brand ambassador for major brands, Michelle Wallace (Zimbabwe Supermodel 2024), and Francina Katuruza (Miss Zambia Zimbabwe 2023).\n\n",

But thats not all  he tackles the complexities of marriage side-by-side with his formidable wife, Dr Angel Ndlovu.\n\nDr Ndlovus sermons and prophecies transcend the confines of the church, often venturing into the political arena. This has propelled him to international acclaim but also brought criticism. Dr Ndlovu holds firm that God cares deeply for the people and their leaders and that prophets are divinely chosen to address the leadership of their times.\n\nFrom the book of Genesis to the book of Revelations whenever a prophet was anointed by God to rise, he would speak to the leadership of that particular generation because God is concerned about His people, so he sends his prophets to offer guidance to leadership.\n\nWhen they asked Christ what the sign of his coming would be he said nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, what is that? Thats politics. From the book of Genesis to the book of Revelations whenever a prophet was anointed by God to rise, he would speak to the leadership of that particular generation, he said.\n\nDr Ian Ndlovu and his wife Dr Angel Ndlovu with Kenyan First Lady Rachel Ruto\n\nDr Ndlovu seems to have a special fondness for Kenya. He has prophesied many things about the Kenyan Government that have come to pass, and the Kenyan people have embraced him as a guiding voice.\n\nI started prophesying a lot of things about the Kenyan Government that came to pass and when the people there realised that God was using me to give direction in their country they contacted me. But I have spoken a lot of things about a lot of other countries including our own. We have three branches in Kenya but the reception we get across the entire nation is relatively good, he said.\n\nThis focus on national guidance is evident in the invitation that was extended to the Ndlovus to attend the inauguration of Kenyan President William Ruto in 2022, a cherished moment for Dr Angel Ndlovu.\n\nIt was my first time at the State House and introducing myself to the President was one of the cherished moments of my life. The most inspirational thing was his ability to strongly state his belief in God regardless of his elevated office. President Ruto is a very humble man, she said.\n\nDr Ndlovus academic journey is impressive. Born in Ntabazinduna in 1976, he attended Sihlengeni Secondary School and Mpopoma High School before earning his undergraduate degree in Economics with Education from Gweru Teachers College (now MSU). He then embarked on a teaching career, but his pursuit of learning never faltered.\n\nIn 2008, Dr Ndlovu started a prayer group in Nkulumane 5 with just four members. Today, his church, Divine Kingdom Baptist Church, boasts thousands of international members.\n\nWhile serving as a Teaching Assistant (TA) at the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) from 2008 to 2010, Dr Ndlovu continued his academic journey, obtaining his Masters degree. This dedication to education propelled him to a lectureship at Nust, a position he held from 2010 to 2022. He even expanded his teaching reach by becoming a part-time lecturer at the Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU).\n\nIn 2019, Dr Ndlovus hunger for knowledge remained insatiable, leading him to pursue a PhD from Unisa. Now, he serves as an external assessor at Unisa and a supervisor at Nust, truly embodying the spirit of lifelong learning.\n\nDr Ndlovus passion extends beyond academia. He met his wife, Dr Angel Ndlovu, who attributes her own academic success to her husbands encouragement and support.When I met my husband, I did have a degree, but he encouraged me to pursue my masters and then my PhD. If you look at the grades I obtained while doing my Masters and PhD they are so much better than the ones I got for my undergrad, she said.\n\nTogether, the Ndlovus have built a beautiful life, balancing their commitment to service with their dedication to family. They have two philanthropic organisations dedicated to helping the vulnerable, with Dr Angel Ndlovus expertise in development studies guiding their work.\n\nDr Angel Ndlovu with some young learners\n\nThe Ndlovus exemplify the perfect blend of academic excellence, faith and dedication to family and community. Their secret to maintaining a healthy family balance is to spend as much quality time as possible away from their busy schedules.\n\nTheirs is a story of faith, intellect and unwavering commitment. Dr Ian Ndlovu, the prophet with a global perspective, and Dr Angel Ndlovu, the doctor with a heart for her community, together inspire and empower, proving that love and purpose can go hand-in-hand.\n\n",
