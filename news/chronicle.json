Additionally, he condemned attacks on diplomatic missions, civilians, and peacekeepers, calling such acts a violation of international law.\n\n",

South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, who is close to Trump, has said that white South Africans have been the victims of racist ownership laws.\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa  who signed into law a bill last month aimed at making it easier for the state to expropriate land in the public interest  has defended the policy. He has said the government had not confiscated any land and the policy was aimed at evening out racial disparities in land ownership in the Black-majority nation. Ramaphosa said South Africa will not be bullied.\n\nAdvertisement  Scroll to continue\n\nWashington has also complained about the case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice, where it accused Israel of genocide over Israels military assault on Gaza that has killed tens of thousands and caused a humanitarian crisis.\n\nIsrael denies the allegations, saying it acted in self-defense following a deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Palestinian Hamas militants.\n\nThe White House cited that case as an example of South Africa taking positions against Washington and its allies.\n\nAdvertisement  Scroll to continue\n\nThe executive order signed by Trump will address human rights issues in South Africa, the White House said. Trump had threatened to cut off funding for the nation soon after taking office.\n\nThe question of land ownership is highly politically charged in South Africa, due to the legacy of the colonial and apartheid eras when Black people were dispossessed of their lands and denied property rights.\n\nWhite landowners still possess three-quarters of South Africas freehold farmland. This contrasts with 4% owned by Black people, who make up 80% of the population compared with about 8% for whites, according to the latest 2017 land audit.\n\n Reuters\n\n",

Rwanda stridently denies sponsoring renegades in its neighbouring country.\n\nYesterday, SADC Executive Secretary Mr Elias Magosi hailed the convening of the Joint Meeting of SADC and EAC as a vital step in the spirit of solidarity and collaboration between members of SADC and EAC in finding a lasting solution to the security situation in the DRC.\n\nThe Joint SADC-EAC Summit will be held in fulfilment of the decision of the Extraordinary Summit of SADC Heads of State and Government of January 31 in Harare, where the summit assessed the precarious and fast-evolving security situation in the Eastern DRC, and called for an immediate joint Summit of SADC and EAC to find the best way forward, and a collective approach to the security situation in the DRC.\n\nSilencing the Guns is a key initiative within the African Unions (AU) Agenda 2063, a long-term plan aiming to achieve peace and sustainable development across the continent by 2063, to end all wars and violent conflicts in Africa by addressing the root causes of conflict and promoting dialogue-based conflict resolution mechanisms; essentially, its a flagship project within Agenda 2063 focused on creating a peaceful Africa through conflict prevention and resolution.\n\nFurther, the summit urged political and diplomatic leaders engaged in the conflict to collaborate in a unified dialogue effort.\n\nThis includes backing the Luanda Process and the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) to help restore peace and security in Eastern DRC.\n\nBoth the African Union and the United Nations have called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in DRC, which threatens to throw the whole of the Great Lakes region into a wider conflagration.\n\nAhead of the joint summit, President Mnangagwa has said he is determined to ensure that guns are silenced in the region.\n\n",
