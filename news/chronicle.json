            "content": "RAYMOND JARAVAZA[emailprotected]IN light of the imminent arrival of Cyclone Chido in the country on Thursday, the Meteorological Services Department (MSD) has released an explainer on what is a cyclone and its effects in areas where it hits.Cyclone Chido, which made landfall in the Mozambican channel on Sunday, is expected to affect Bulawayo, Matabeleland South, Midlands, Masvingo, Mashonaland East and Manicaland provinces.The storm was named by a Zimbabwean.According to MSD, the word cyclone likely comes from the Greek words kklos (circle, wheel) or kukl (go around in a circle, form a circle, encircle).The term cyclone was adopted around 1840. Tropical cyclones are also known as typhoons or hurricanes, depending on where they originate.The Bad: Tropical cyclones are intense circular storms with heavy rains and sustained cyclonic (circulating) wind speeds over 119 kilometres per hour. They can cause significant damage to property and infrastructure, and multiple casualties and deaths on land and sea.The Good: Once they get out of the oceans, they lose strength rapidly [land is like their kryptonite], but as they lose cyclonic (circulating wind strength) they lose water as well. This becomes torrents in areas close to where they enter, and less as they go inland.The World Meteorological Systems explains how cyclones are named.The process of determining names for tropical cyclones is conducted by the relevant tropical cyclone regional body at its annual/biennial session. There are five tropical cyclone regional bodies, i.e. ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee, WMO/ESCAP Panel on Tropical Cyclones, RA I Tropical Cyclone Committee, RA IV Hurricane Committee, and RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee. These bodies establish pre-designated lists of names which are proposed by WMO Members National Meteorological and Hydrological Services. The selection of names is based on their familiarity with the people in each region, aiming to aid in the understanding and remembrance of cyclones. The naming procedures can vary, with some regions using alphabetical order and others using the alphabetical order of country names. It is important to note that tropical cyclones are not named after individuals.When selecting a new name, consideration is given to certain factors: Short in character length for ease of use in communication Easy to pronounce Appropriate significance in different languages Uniqueness  same names cannot be used in other regions.\n\nENDS/\n\n",

            "content": "Emergency workers sought survivors on Monday and struggled to restore services in Mayotte, Frances poorest overseas territory, where hundreds or even thousands are feared dead from the worst cyclone to hit the Indian Ocean islands in nearly a century.Cyclone Chido devastated large parts of the archipelago off east Africa over the weekend with winds of more than 200 kph (124 mph), strewing homes over hillsides, and cutting phones, power and drinking water.\n\nWith areas still inaccessible, Frances acting Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on arrival in the disaster zone that it would take days to find the full extent of damage and deaths.The images are apocalyptic. Its a disaster, theres nothing left, an intensive care nurse named Oceane at the main hospital in the capital Mamoudzou told BFM TV.Teacher Hamada Ali told Reuters that streets were covered in mud and trees, people were sheltering in schools and bottled water was being used for cooking.\n\nI saw someone injured by a sheet of metal  Houses with sheet metal roofs were swept away by the cyclone. There are precarious dwellings of which we cannot see the slightest trace, he added.Residents queued outside grocery stores in search of water and other basics.Communications were down in large parts of the territory, leaving relatives outside desperately enquiring on social media. I need an update from Chiconi please, my brother, my sister-in-law and my niece are there and Im without any news since Saturday, said one.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron was to hold an emergency meeting about Mayotte later on Monday. Acting health minister Genevieve Darrieussecq said Mamoudzous main hospital was maintaining operations after floodwaters had been cleared while a field clinic would be set up and 100 additional medics deployed.More than three-quarters of Mayottes 321,000 people live in relative poverty. According to 2021 figures from statistics agency INSEE, Mayotte has an annual median disposable income of just over 3,000 euros ($3,150) per inhabitant, roughly eight times less than the Ile-de-France region around Paris.\n\nBIGGEST STORM IN 90 YEARSThe islands, close to the Comoros archipelago, first came under Frances control in 1841. Mayotte is made up of two main islands over an area about twice the size of Washington DC.It has been grappling with unrest in recent years, with many residents angry at undocumented immigration and inflation.The territory has become a stronghold for the far-right National Rally with 60% voting for Marine Le Pen in the 2022 presidential election runoff.\n\nChido was the strongest storm to strike Mayotte in more than 90 years, French weather service Meteo France said.Extreme weather events have become more common around the globe, in keeping with global warming. Poorer nations often say they are bearing the brunt of the environmental crisis despite historically emitting far less CO2 than richer countries.It was evident that  when a cyclone hit  we would find ourselves in a situation, leftwing lawmaker Eric Coquerel told French broadcaster LCI, saying the destruction in Mayotte laid bare a failure to prepare for the impact of climate change.\n\nAround the territory, hundreds of makeshift houses were smashed and scattered, according to images from local media and the French gendarmerie. Coconut trees crashed through building roofs, boats were upended, rubble covered cars and people cowered under tables when the cyclone hit.I was screaming because I could see the end coming for me, John Balloz, who lives in the capital Mamoudzou, told Reuters.\n\nAfter Mayotte, Chido made landfall in north Mozambique where it quickly weakened and was reclassified as a tropical storm on Sunday but still destroyed several houses, authorities said.The prefect of Mayotte, Francois-Xavier Bieuville, said at the weekend that deaths would definitely be in the hundreds and possibly several thousand.Maritime and aerial operations were underway to transport relief supplies and equipment, including from Reunion Island, another French overseas territory, French authorities said.Mayottes main airport, however, remained closed to civilian flights on Monday morning, said Jean-Paul Bosland, the president of Frances national firefighters federation.

We are working closely with all stakeholders to manage operations efficiently and reduce waiting times, he said.\n\nThe BMA urges all travellers to plan their journeys carefully and arrive at the airport earlier than usual to allow sufficient time for processing. Arriving early will help ensure a smoother experience amidst the increased demand.\n\nOur teams on the ground are working tirelessly to manage the flow of people and to ensure that everyone is assisted as quickly as possible.\n\nThe official urged travellers to adhere to Ports of Entry requirements and ensure that all necessary documentation is ready to expedite processing.\n\nThe BMA appreciates the publics understanding and cooperation during this busy period.
