The move comes after renowned traditional attire specialist Zana Kay expressed her disappointment with the Namas treatment of fashion as an art form.\n\nZana Kay, who designed the cowhide suit worn by National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) executive director Napoleon Nyanhi at the 23rd Namas, called attention to the perceived oversight of fashion in the awards.\n\nIn her social media post, Zana Kay highlighted the cultural and creative value of fashion, pointing to Zimbabwean designs like the hut paintings of the Matobo women and Freddy Sozinio Jacksons Zimbabwean flag beading.Fashion is about creativity, aesthetic expression, and storytelling. Id have loved to see Miss Universe Zimbabwes famous National Dress (which she wore at the global contest) on the red carpet . . . it is wearable art and got the nation talking.\n\nIn response, NACZ communications manager Agga Nyabinde reassured that discussions are underway to introduce fashion as a stand-alone category in future editions. While the process may take time, Nyabinde stressed the NACZs commitment to elevating fashion as a recognised art form.We truly understand and appreciate the concerns, but as the NACZ, we cant decide what one wears to the award ceremony, he said.\n\nWe are not ghosting the fashion side of art. In fact, we are in talks with relevant authorities to have fashion as a stand-alone category in the future.\n\nThe recent Namas saw the addition of seven new awards, but the lack of a dedicated fashion category raised concerns. With Zimbabwes rich cultural heritage on display, the future of fashion at the Namas looks promising.\n\nFollow on X @MbuleloMpofu\n\n",

            "content": "Sinokubonga Nkala\n\nPOLICE in Bulawayo have arrested a man from Matsheumhlope suburb for possessing 1,9 killogrammes of Crystal Meth.\n\nTigors Tyron Seigfried (39), according to a police statement on X, was busted following a raid at his home along Chelsmford Road.\n\nCrystal Meth, short for crystal methamphetamine, is a powerful and highly addictive synthetic stimulant drug.\n\nIt belongs to the amphetamine class of drugs and is chemically similar to methamphetamine, a substance used in some medical treatments for conditions like ADHD and obesity.\n\nHowever, Crystal Meth is produced illegally and is far more potent, making it extremely dangerous.The drug typically appears as clear, crystal-like chunks or shiny blue-white rocks, which can be smoked, snorted, injected, or swallowed. Its street names include ice, crystal, glass, and Tik.Crystal Meth has profound and often devastating effects on the brain and body. Its impact can be both immediate and long-term, with severe consequences for physical health, mental well-being, and social functioning.\n\nShort-term effects include: euphoria and increased energy, increased heart rate and blood pressure, decreased appetite, hyperactivity and insomnia, aggression and paranoia.\n\nCrystal Meth can cause irritability, violent behaviour, and paranoid delusions, making users a danger to themselves and others.\n\nThe long term effects of taking the drug are life threatening and include; addiction, brain damage, physical deterioration, organ damage to the heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs, increasing the risk of chronic diseases and premature death.\n\nCrystal Meth abuse doesnt just affect individuals; it has far-reaching consequences for families and communities. It contributes to increased crime rates, strains healthcare systems, and undermines social cohesion. In Zimbabwe, where drug abuse is on the rise, the spread of Crystal Meth poses a significant threat to public health and national development.\n\nEfforts to combat the drugs proliferation, such as the recent arrest of Tigors Tyron Seigfried in Bulawayo, are critical in addressing this growing crisis. Public awareness campaigns, rehabilitation programmes, and stricter law enforcement are essential to curbing the spread of this destructive substance.\n\nThe arrest comes amid a nationwide crackdown on drug and substance abuse, which has become a growing concern in Zimbabwe.\n\nAccording to police statistics, drug-related arrests have surged in recent years.\n\nIn 2023, police reported over 5 000 drug-related arrests across the country, with a significant number of cases involving dangerous substances such as Crystal Meth, heroin, and marijuana. Bulawayo, Zimbabwes second-largest city, has seen a sharp rise in drug-related crimes, particularly among youths, prompting law enforcement agencies to intensify operations.\n\nThe Zimbabwean Government has adopted a zero-tolerance approach to drug abuse, with President Emmerson Mnangagwa declaring the fight against drugs a national priority.\n\nA National Drug Master Plan, launched in 2020, aims to curb drug trafficking, abuse, and related crimes through a multi-sectoral approach involving law enforcement, education, and community awareness campaigns.\n\nPolice have also called for collaboration with traditional leaders, religious institutions, and community organisations to raise awareness about the dangers of drug abuse. The hashtag #NotoDrugandSubstanceAbuse has gained traction on social media as part of a broader campaign to mobilise public support for the anti-drug initiative.\n\nA National toll-free number +263 714 647 002 has been established to assist those struggling with drug and substance abuse and for members of the public to report drug-peddlers.\n\nAs the country grapples with the drug menace, the arrest of Seigfried serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing battle against drug trafficking and the need for sustained efforts to safeguard the nations future.\n\n",

Over three transformative days, from Friday to Sunday, these talented individuals gathered at a private Airbnb, resulting in an astonishing 32 tracks being recorded  a feat that resonates deeply within the heart of the Bulawayo rap scene.\n\nThis exceptional event was not merely a recording camp; it was a movement, sparked by the powerful themes explored during the, Conflict Transformation: Hip Hop vs Community Indaba. The Kwela Initiative served as a platform for selected artistes to delve into the complexities of their narratives, igniting a creative fire that would fuel their music for years to come.\n\nFarai\n\nAmong the illustrious names present were Swazy, Stones Moyo, Fuel The Don, Curtis Dee Rovar, Nsizwa Black, TBK, Farai, Ghawdzilla, Israel, CMK, Mike the Future, Salem Bhebhe, KidThrill, Philo Cliff, Canvus Ports, Kereng, and Rayzon. Each artist brought their unique flavor to the mix, embodying the rich tapestry of Bulawayos hip-hop culture.\n\nThe gathering was a response to the long-standing challenges plaguing the local sceneissues of support, recognition, and unity. The Kwela Initiative not only fostered dialogue among stakeholders, media, businesspeople, and creatives but also laid the groundwork for a more robust and united hip-hop community. This collaborative spirit was palpable as artistes shared ideas, inspirations, and their collective vision for the future of Bulawayo hip-hop.\n\nAsaph Afrika, one of the driving forces behind the Kwela Initiative, reflected on the experience with a sense of pride and optimism.\n\nTheres so much to learn and grow from this experience. It was thrilling to see the artistes organise themselves, showing the world that they are ready to work hard. Now weve got the music; the next step is sorting and finalising the mixes before the release and concert, he shared.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/AyGK1opQUtE\n\nThe magnitude of recording 32 tracks in just three days is nothing short of magnificent. It speaks to an unparalleled work ethic and a hunger for artistic expression that many believed was dormant.\n\nTrap artiste, TBK articulated this sentiment vividly, stating, Being surrounded by a collection of individuals representing different subgenres of hip-hop was surreal. The unity was unmatched; people were hungry and cooking like crazy.\n\nShe added, I found myself in a Kwaito track alongside MK BEATS, Ganyaz Jr, Brintz, and Fuel the Dona combination I never foresaw. This effort is crucial in reclaiming Bulawayos position as Zimbabwes hip-hop capital.\n\nFor Kereng, the experience was a much-needed catalyst for change.\n\nThe recording camp was everything the city needed. We had a chance to link up as brands to uplift the music scene in Bulawayo. We worked day and night without sleeping, which showed how serious we are about our careers. It motivated me to keep my head high and gave me hope. I wish the city could have more initiatives like these, he remarked.\n\nPhilo Cliff echoed this sentiment, describing the camp as an incredible opportunity for personal and artistic growth.\n\nI was able to tap into my creativity, learn from other talented artists, and push myself to new heights. The insights gained from industry professionals were invaluable, and I cant wait to share the music we created, he said.\n\nMichy Zee, one of the organisers, captured the essence of the weekend perfectly: It was the most fulfilling beautiful experience Ive ever had. To think that by Saturday morning we had already recorded nine tracksit was crazy. These artistes werent sleeping, literally. It couldve been more if we didnt check out early.The success of the Kwela Initiative serves as a beacon of hope for the Bulawayo hip-hop scene. It showcased not just the talent and dedication of its artistes but also the potential for growth and transformation within the community.  Follow on X @MbuleloMpofu\n\n",

Set to take place at The Garden in Newlands, Harare, from 2pm, Harare Open Mic continues to provide a platform for artistes to experiment with the stage, build confidence, and network with other creatives.\n\nNow in its fifth edition, the event has grown into a key space, particularly for young artistes seeking exposure and opportunities in the industry.\n\nThis years line-up features a dynamic mix of talent, including rising poets Tadana Nakai and Yvonne Matanhire, who will share the stage with seasoned wordsmiths such as Shingirai Manyengavana, Takudzwa Goniwa, Khadijah Finesse, Tamika, Momo Size, and Tawanda Vombo.Adding a musical touch to the evening, young and talented mbira player Aripheleng Kwela is expected to captivate the audience with her powerful vocals. The line-up also includes hip-hop sensation D-Blok, AneUnhu Gwatidzo, Tendai Mhlanga, Nicole Livet, The Breeze, and several other fresh voices making their Harare Open Mic debut.\n\nHarare Open Mic organiser Batsirai Chigama described the events journey as a rewarding challenge.I remember a time when spaces like this were made available to us by the Book Caf. It was an environment filled with endless networking opportunities, collaborations, and a chance for young artistes to find their voice before stepping onto bigger platforms.It excites me to be able to create such a space for young artistes to grow. This year, we have partnered with The Garden, One Billion Rising, and over 32 artistes who will showcase music, comedy, poetry, dance, and theatre, said Chigama.\n\nShe also revealed that registration for the event was oversubscribed, showing the growing demand for such platforms among emerging creatives.It is encouraging to see young artistes hungry to perform. If resources allow, I hope to organise more regular sessions so more artistes can benefit from this initiative, she added.Encouraging people to attend, Chigama said Harare Open Mic offers a laid-back, family-friendly atmosphere where young and aspiring artistes can be inspired.If you know someone who could benefit from this space, bring them along.

            "content": "Thupeyo Muleya,Beitbridge Bureau\n\nTHE COMMUNITY in Ward 7 in the Mutetengwa area in Beitbridge has been thrown into panic mode after a 13-year-old boy poured a poisonous herbicide into a river, which supplies water to livestock and to people from at least five villages on Monday.\n\nThe name of the herbicide is still being verified by experts.According to Mutetengwas senior village head, Mr Nelson Mohadi, the fish in the stream have started dying and a donkey that drank water from the same river died on the same day.\n\nHe said through the local disaster risk management committee they had since notified people staying downstream of the river not to use water from the river or to ensure their livestock use another water source.\n\nMr Mohadi said the local civil protection committee was already on the ground carrying out tests of the water between the point where the herbicide was poured into the river, and at selected water points down the river.The community is in panic mode following this incident and we have since notified the police and the local civil protection committee about the incident, he said.In the interim, we advise villagers not to drink or use the water for domestic chores until tests from the civil protection committee confirm the extent of the damage.A village head from Tshambudzi area, Mrs Siphiwe Muleya, where the boy lives said they were working with the police to establish the motive behind the incident.She said she has advised all community members in the area to make use of the borehole water and to avoid fishing from the river.\n\nMrs Muleya said since Monday, fish were still dying from the river and that a donkey had started decomposing after drinking suspected contaminated water.We picked up the container of the herbicide, which we have given to agriculture experts to verify and will also help in investigations, she said.The police are now handling the matter and the parents of the same boy have since been notified about this shocking incident.Mutetengwa Village Health worker, Mrs Lucy Chibi, said working with health experts they are already educating those living along the river to be extra vigilant.She said the dead fish from the river had been buried in the soil and that some people were already on the lookout for the fish to destroy them before some children may pick them since the river is located near a school and the local business centre.We are already moving around villages warning people about the imminent danger from the herbicide that was poured into the river. At the same time, I want to strongly encourage community members to avoid drinking water or fishing from this river until it has been confirmed to be safe by technocrats, said Mrs Chibi.A communal farmer living in the La Tenis area, Mrs Nyelisani Sibanda, said she was shocked to see purple water flowing in the river on Monday.I was working in my field, which is just close to the river and when I came here to get water it had turned into a purple colour, said Mrs Sibanda.A few minutes later some fish were dying on their own. I immediately called the local traditional leaders who then informed the rest of the community leaders about this incident.
