Coventry also reflected on the election process, calling it an incredible race that has strengthened the Olympic movement.\n\nMs Coventrys election marks a significant milestone, as she becomes one of the few women to hold the prestigious position. Her leadership is expected to bring a fresh perspective to the IOC, with a focus on unity, innovation, and the continued growth of the Olympic movement.\n\nThe newly elected president concluded her speech by thanking the members for their trust, saying, Thank you very much for this moment, and thank you very much for this honour.\n\nIn her candidature document, IOC president elect Coventry listed five priorities: harnessing the power of sport; maximising collaboration and engagement; strengthening partnerships for mutual growth; championing sustainable development; and advancing credibility and trust.\n\nThe document ends with a quote in large font, centred on an otherwise empty page: I am because we are. As she explains elsewhere:\n\nMy mission to drive empowerment, strengthen engagement, and ensure we remain relevant, is guided by the Ubuntu philosophy: I am because we are. This principle highlights the combined strength of the Olympic community and our responsibility to uplift one another. It also underscores the close partnership we share with the International Paralympic Committee. Together, these events serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration, a symbol of human progress with limitless possibilities.\n\nPresident-elect Coventry will assume office after the handover from President Bach on Olympic Day, 23 June. President Bach, who remains in the role until then, will also resign as an IOC Member after the transfer of power and will then assume the role of Honorary President.\n\nThe President-elect will oversee the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 as her first Olympic Games, with under 11 months to go to the Opening Ceremony.\n\nOnline Reporter/Guardian/Telegram\n\n",

Accordingly, he is found not guilty and acquitted, ruled the magistrate.Prosecuting, Ms Mandrela Chisiiwa told the court that the alleged assaults occurred repeatedly between September last year and January this year.The alleged incidents began when the teenage girl visited Yusufs home where her friend resides.On an unknown date in September 2024, during the daytime, the accused called the complainant into his house. He then convinced her to allow him to fondle her breasts and touch her buttocks, said Ms Kufandikanwe.The court heard that Yusuf allegedly exploited the girls visits to her friend, turning what should have been innocent interactions into a pattern of abuse.Each time the complainant came to see her friend at the accuseds residence, he would take advantage of her presence and indecently assault her, said Ms Kufandikanwe.The court heard that the assaults continued unchecked for months, with the teenager initially too frightened or confused to speak out.The matter came to light under distressing circumstances. In January 2025, the girl went missing, prompting her frantic parents to file a missing person report with the police. After an anxious search, she returned home, and upon being quizzed on her whereabouts by her parents, she narrated her ordeal.The complainant disclosed that she had been at Yusufs residence. She revealed that he had been sexually assaulting her from September 2024 until January this year, said Ms Kufandikanwe. A report was made to the police, leading to Yusufs arrest.In his defence Yusuf said this was a fabricated story as he was dating the complainants grandmother.I was in a relationship with the complainants grandmother, so they have fabricated this story as a way of getting back to me.As for the complainant I know her since she was three years old and there is no way I could do that to someone who grew up around me, said Yusuf\n\n",

The driver presented a manifest indicating that the truck was empty, he said.\n\nHowever, a thorough search revealed that the truck was laden with pallets and several boxes positioned in front of the pallets. The vehicle was subsequently taken to the commercial ramp where it was opened, revealing it was loaded with 460 boxes. Each box, when opened, contained 100 cartoons of Remington Gold cigarettes. \n\nCol Ledwaba said following the discovery, the suspect was detained at SAPS Musina and charged with smuggling of illicit cigarettes.\n\nHe is scheduled to appear before the Musina Magistrates Court on Monday, March 24.\n\nSouth Africa has become one of the major destinations and conduits where mostly cigarettes are smuggled through Beitbridge border post or illegal crossing points along the Limpopo River.\n\nIt is understood that 30 percent of cigarettes in South Africa are from Zimbabwe, including Pacific, Remington gold, Mega, Dullahs, Branson, and Servilles.\n\n",
