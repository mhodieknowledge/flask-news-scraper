This workshop was born from that initiative, and we established it under our organisation, the Kwela Initiative, said Asaph.\n\nOn the first day of the workshop, artistes met with the community to discuss the divide between Hip-Hop and the community, aiming to uncover the reasons behind the lack of support for Bulawayo artistes.\n\nASAPHAFRIKA addressing artists during a conflict transformation indaba held at Bulawayo Art Gallery Picture by Lubelihle Mathe\n\nHe added, We want to hear both sides  the community and the artistes  and hope to plot a way forward.\n\nThe workshop has sparked an engaging conversation between artistes and community members. Asaph commented on the turnout, saying, The number of community members present proves that this is a conversation many are reluctant to have, but we appreciate those who showed up.\n\nOne of the major issues discussed was the societal perception of Hip-Hop. Many participants expressed that Hip-Hop is often seen as a career choice for non-Christians. Hip-Hop, according to most artistes, is not just music but a culture and a powerful tool for storytelling and self-expression.\n\nHip-Hop artiste Swazy shared her personal experiences, saying, Society doesnt understand Hip-Hop. For example, Im a Christian rapper, and whenever I express my thoughts about the God I serve, people react with skepticism. They question if Hip-Hop and Christianity can mix. I believe these attitudes contribute to the challenges Hip-Hop faces in Bulawayo.\n\nArtists following proceedings during conflict transformation indaba held at Bulawayo Art GalleryPicture by Lubelihle Mathe\n\nIn addition to the stigma surrounding the genre, such as associations with drugs and profanity, some artistes highlighted the lack of industry representation and financial constraints as key obstacles to progress.\n\nVeteran playwright Raisedon Baya, who was also present, offered words of encouragement and guidance: What youre doing right now is the right pathdiscussing the problems and working toward solutions. One of the biggest issues in our industry is assumption. We dislike each other without ever meeting. We need to stand together and take action. When we run events and an artiste is scheduled to perform, they often dont promote the show on their social media. Then they complain about low attendance. Whos responsible for bringing in the audience?\n\nBaya stressed the impact of low attendance on artistes future opportunities, explaining, If I book an artiste and only two people show up, I might not book them again. This leads to the assumption that Hip-Hop lacks an audience, and the genre is then sidelined.\n\nArtistes were further encouraged to embrace digital media and the internet as essential tools to remain relevant, promote their music, and build a larger audience base. As the workshop continues, the focus remains on building a more sustainable and supportive music scene for artistes in Bulawayo.\n\n",

Mbako died at Mpilo Hospital on Tuesday, Acting Bulawayo Police Provincial Spokesperson Assistant Inspector Nomalanga Msebele confirmed.\n\nA 13 year old Tawanda Mbako of Nketa 6 and he is a son to the deceased Monica Tichava aged 41 who died on the spot, said Assistant Inspector Msebele.\n\nAnother victim Loraine Ruvarashe Shoko (17), a female also from Nketa 6, died on Monday at Mpilo Central Hospital after succumbing to her injuries.\n\nThe driver of the Honda Fit, police said, is facing charges of culpable homicide after losing control of his vehicle.The victim who died on the spot was trapped underneath the vehicle and had to be extricated by members of the Bulawayo Fire Brigade, who arrived at the scene shortly after the tragic incident.\n\nOn 26th January 2025, at approximately 5:00 a.m., a 29-year-old male driver from Gwabalanda, Bulawayo, lost control of his silver Honda Fit while driving along Nketa Drive with three passengers. The vehicle veered off the road and struck 11 pedestrians walking in the same direction.\n\nThe accident resulted in two pedestrian fatalities and nine others being injured. One passenger from the vehicle was also injured, bringing the total number of injured to 10. The injured were transported to Mpilo Hospital for treatment, while the deceased were taken to the United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) mortuary for post-mortem examinations, said Assistant Inspector Msebele.\n\nShe said the accident was caused by speeding, and the driver is facing charges. The cause of the accident was due to speeding and the drivers failure to keep the motor vehicle under proper control; hence a charge of culpable homicide has been preferred against him, said Assistant Inspector Msebele.\n\n",
