My inspiration comes from our culture, especially in preserving isintu sethu and passing this knowledge on to the next generation.My journey wasnt easy when I decided to pursue art professionally in 2000. Growing up, our parents werent as open-minded as todays generation. I faced mockery at home, with people telling me to find a job that would guarantee me a paycheck at the end of the month. But I didnt listen to that. I pushed through until my art started to bring in some income, which was when I started getting full support, she said.\n\nZaza believes that performance has the power to heal.There are many challenges people face, but when someone watches a performance, they can relax their mind and focus on whats in front of them. If the performance is captivating, theyll always talk about it afterward.\n\nShe shared plans by Hloseni Arts to revive the group.Although I havent worked on my own projects exclusively, Im part of a dance ensemble.

President Mnangagwa said while the mission is being pulled out, SADC remains committed to monitoring the political and security situation in eastern DRC.The withdrawal of SAMIDRC notwithstanding, our august regional body will remain seized with the political and security situation in eastern DRC, President Mnangagwa said in his closing remarks.He called for the accelerated implementation of decisions made during the Joint SADC-East African Community (EAC) meeting, including the merger of the Luanda and Nairobi Peace Processes, which aim to foster dialogue and lasting peace in the region.The decision to withdraw comes after months of deliberation and reflects the complex challenges faced by the mission, including ongoing violence, resource constraints, and the need for a more sustainable approach to peacebuilding. The region has been plagued by armed conflict, with numerous rebel groups vying for control, displacing thousands, and creating a humanitarian crisis.President Mnangagwa expressed gratitude to the troop-contributing countries and all SADC member states for their support of SAMIDRC. He appealed for continued cooperation to ensure the safe withdrawal of troops and equipment from the region.As our Mission enters a withdrawal phase, we appeal for continued support to facilitate the safe withdrawal of all our troops and evacuation of our equipment, he said.The SADC Chairperson reaffirmed the blocs solidarity, saying, Our SADC solidarity is unshakable and must be upheld and safeguarded for generations to come. He declared the summit officially closed, marking the end of what he described as frank and productive deliberations.The SADC is a regional economic community comprising 16 member states, aimed at promoting socio-economic cooperation and integration, as well as political and security collaboration among its members.\n\n",
