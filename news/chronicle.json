            "content": "Sikhumbuzo Moyo\n\nPRESIDENT Mnangagwa has extended his condolences, joining global figures in mourning the death of Pope Francis, the spiritual leader of the Roman Catholic Church, who passed away yesterday at the Vatican City in Rome, Italy, at the age of 88.\n\nThe Pope had been admitted to the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital on Friday, February 14, 2025, after suffering from bronchitis. His condition deteriorated, and on Tuesday, February 28, he was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia. After 38 days in hospital, he returned to his residence at Casa Santa Marta in the Vatican, where he passed away.\n\nCardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, announced the Popes death.\n\nDearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow, I must announce the death of our Holy Father, Francis. At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and His Church. He taught us to live the Gospel values with fidelity, courage and universal love, especially towards the poor and marginalised. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend his soul to the merciful love of the Triune God, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nThe news of the Popes passing, which broke mid-morning, was met with shock and grief across the globe. In his condolence message, President Mnangagwa described the late pontiff, who led the Church for 12 years, as a man of humility who championed peace, compassion and justice.\n\nI join the world in mourning the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis, a man of profound humility, who stood for peace, compassion and justice. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the Catholic Church and Catholics across the globe. May his soul rest in eternal peace, he posted on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThe Apostolic Nunciature in Zimbabwe has announced that a condolence book will be opened at its Chancery in Mount Pleasant, Harare, from today until Thursday.\n\nAn Apostolic Nunciature is the official diplomatic mission of the Holy See, equivalent to an embassy, headed by a nuncio, an ecclesiastical diplomat with ambassadorial rank. In a statement, Apostolic Nuncio Janusz Urbanczyk said the book would be available from 10am to 1pm and 3pm to 5pm.\n\nLet us remain united in prayer, and we invite all Catholic faithful in Zimbabwe to offer prayers to Almighty God for the eternal rest of Pope Francis, he said.\n\nThe Archbishop of Bulawayo, Alex Thomas, said the city would host a memorial service for the late Pope, with arrangements underway.\n\nWe are saddened by his passing. A memorial service will be held in Bulawayo once plans are finalised, said Archbishop Thomas.\n\nThe Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar (SECAM) also paid tribute, saying Pope Francis was more than a shepherd to the global Church; he was an inspiration to the African faithful.\n\nHis unwavering commitment to social justice, peace, and the dignity of every human being resonated deeply with Africas struggles and hopes. He took the time to understand our realities, listen to our stories and amplify our voices, SECAM said in its message.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\n\nThe South African Council of Churches (SACC) praised Pope Francis for promoting interfaith dialogue and unity. It highlighted his 2019 signing of the Document on Human Fraternity with the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, Ahmed el-Tayeb, which condemned extremism and affirmed the sanctity of life and religious freedom.\n\nThis document rejected any interpretation of Gods teachings as a justification for violence or oppression, the SACC noted.\n\nRussian President, Vladimir Putin expressed his condolences, highlighting the Popes role in promoting dialogue between the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox Churches, as well as strengthening ties with the Holy See.\n\nIn this sad hour, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the Catholic clergy and faithful. Pope Francis was a tireless advocate for peace and co-operation, said President Putin in his message to Cardinal Farrell.\n\nGerman Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in his tribute on X, described the Pope as an advocate for the weak, a reconciler and a warm-hearted person.\n\nI valued his clear vision in addressing global challenges. My sympathies are with the faithful around the world, he wrote.\n\nWorld leaders, who also sent messages of condolence include French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Snchez, US President Donald Trump and his predecessor, President Joe Biden.\n\nBorn Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Argentina, Pope Francis underwent lung surgery in his 20s following a severe respiratory infection.\n\nIn later years, recurring respiratory issues plagued his health, including a cancelled trip to the United Arab Emirates in November 2023 due to influenza and lung inflammation.\n\n",

            "content": "Zimpapers Business Hub\n\nTHE Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) opened with great enthusiasm in Bulawayo yesterday, attracting a dynamic mix of local and international exhibitors who expressed optimism about unlocking significant business opportunities.\n\nThis years Sapphire Edition is running under the theme: Industrialisation: Crafting an Integrated Economic Landscape, a message that resonates deeply with Zimbabwes renewed push to revitalise its manufacturing base, expand value chains and drive export-led growth.\n\nThe ZITF continues to hold strategic national importance, as it aligns with Zimbabwes broader goals of industrialisation, economic diversification, and positioning itself competitively within the regional and global economy.\n\nAs one of Southern Africas premier trade showcases, ZITF has become a critical platform for showcasing investment potential, facilitating business-to-business linkages, and enhancing access to regional and global markets.\n\nThe 2025 ZITF serves not only as a major economic and trade exhibition, but as a bold expression of Zimbabwes industrialisation drive, its commitment to local production and regional integration, and its ambition to emerge as a manufacturing and trade powerhouse in Africa.\n\nIndustry and Commerce Minister, Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, speaking to Zimpapers Business Hub at the exhibition park, said exhibitors were ready to showcase a broad range of products that reflect the countrys industrial potential. He stressed that the theme reflects Zimbabwes economic priorities.\n\nWe can only achieve economic growth when we focus more on industrialisation. President Mnangagwa has called for us to develop our country, and its through industrialisation that we can create meaningful jobs and achieve economic growth. Thats why we have dedicated this edition to industrialisation, said Minister Ndlovu.\n\nHe added that 2025 marks a pivotal moment, being the final year of the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), and the outcomes of this years fair will help lay the foundation for NDS2, which will be firmly anchored in accelerating industrial growth.\n\nIt will help us to take stock of what has happened and also give us a firm foundation as we build NDS2, he said.Zimbabwes industrialisation drive, guided by the Governments Vision 2030 and NDS framework, seeks to rebuild the countrys productive capacity, modernise factories, encourage innovation and support local manufacturing for both domestic use and export. Minister Ndlovu also praised the private sectors growing engagement at ZITF, a vital ingredient in Zimbabwes industrial ambitions.\n\nI am happy that the private sector has taken heed of this. In the early 2000s, sanctions reduced participation, and Government came in to fill the gap. But the President has said we cannot complain about sanctions forever; let us work.\n\nWe want the private sector to tell the story of our economic development. We agreed last year that the 2025 edition should be more private sector-driven, and we are happy with the progress. We will continue encouraging both domestic and foreign private sector participation going forward.\n\nThis year, 28 countries are exhibiting, a strong signal of confidence in Zimbabwes economic prospects. Minister Ndlovu attributed the increase to intensified economic diplomacy and proactive global marketing by the ZITF Company.\n\nThis year, its an improvement from last year. The improvement can be accelerated; its more a matter of economic diplomacy that has to go into that. We are excited by the growing number of companies from outside our borders. It speaks to our goal of building a private sector-driven ZITF, he said.\n\nIn separate interviews, exhibitors highlighted their eagerness to clinch deals, access new markets, and contribute to Zimbabwes re-industrialisation goals.\n\nMs Bonakele Ndzinisa, a trade officer with Comesa, lauded Zimbabwes active participation within the regional bloc and emphasised the importance of trade information sharing to boost intra-African commerce.\n\nZimbabwe is performing well and actively participating in Comesa trade activities. Many businesses still lack comprehensive information about regional markets, and we are here to engage and bridge that gap.\n\nZimTrade Southern Region Manager, Mrs Jaqueline Nyathi, said the expo plays a crucial role in uniting public and private sector stakeholders around the countrys industrial agenda.\n\nShe said that ZimTrade was showcasing heritage-based products from across Zimbabwe, with a focus on empowering women, youth, and small businesses to scale up and access export markets.\n\nMrs Hildigard Mufukare, from the Matabeleland North Handcraft Cluster, said she hoped the exhibition would open international opportunities for artisans whose crafts contribute to local livelihoods.\n\nWe are exhibiting under ZimTrade because its a cluster focused on exporting hand-crafted artwork.What we produce is a livelihood earner for many women in the Matabeleland North region, and were confident that by showcasing here, we will attract more clients and expand our reach, she said.\n\nFrom the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia, Mr Hazmi Laksono said they had brought five companies with a strong interest in striking business deals with Zimbabwean counterparts.\n\nWe are here to do business and promote trade between Indonesia and Zimbabwe. These companies are involved in herbal medicine, tyre production, bath soaps, bio-fertilisers, among other things. We are expecting to find trade partners and markets for our products, he said.\n\nHe added that Zimbabwe and Indonesia, as developing economies, have significant potential to learn from and support one anothers industrial and trade growth.\n\nRepresenting the Limpopo Tourism Agency of South Africa, Mr Mashudu Ramudzuli said the ZITF platform facilitates critical stakeholder engagement across multiple sectors.\n\nWe are looking forward to networking and engaging to see how best we can collaborate to promote tourism in South Africa and Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nAnother standout exhibitor is BiSON Agro Machinery, a Belarusian agricultural equipment manufacturer, which is displaying a range of machinery, including small-scale mini tractors suited for Zimbabwean farmers. The showcase supports the countrys push toward agricultural industrialisation and mechanisation.\n\nThis comes as Zimbabwe intensifies its farm mechanisation programme, under a landmark deal with Belarus, involving 800 pieces of equipment, including over 700 tractors, 80 combine harvesters and 30 grain carriers.\n\nWe are introducing small tractors from 12 and 15 horsepower, and we also have 112 horsepower tractors. They are suitable for farmers with about 50 hectares of land. Many small-scale farmers here in Zimbabwe need this kind of equipment. This year at ZITF, we brought smaller equipment that includes a trailer and a plough, enough to complete a full land preparation cycle.\n\nWe are confident the equipment is right for Zimbabwean farmers, and we look forward to growing our presence here, said Mr Andrei Kloeinov, Sales Director of BiSON Agro Machinery.\n\n",

His words, delivered during the solemnity and spiritual significance of the Easter gathering, served as a powerful reminder of the foundational values that underpin our nationhood.\n\nThe Presidents emphasis on cultivating a culture of love, extending the hand of forgiveness, and collectively focusing our energies on the crucial task of socio-economic advancement struck a profound chord, demonstrating a keen understanding of the Zimbabwean spirit  a spirit that, despite its challenges, remains resilient and hopeful.\n\nThe assertion that Zimbabweans possess a remarkable capacity for peace and togetherness is not merely a platitude; it is a fact seen through the lived experiences of a people, who have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to unite in the face of adversity. Throughout our shared history, we have witnessed the nations capacity to bridge deep divides, to transcend past grievances, and to forge a path towards reconciliation.\n\nThis inherent characteristic, this profound yearning for harmony, forms the bedrock of our national identity. The Presidents commendation of these qualities resonates authentically because it reflects the enduring spirit of our communities, where the bonds of kinship and shared experience often supersede political or ideological differences.\n\nOur collective ambition for the socio-economic upliftment of Zimbabwe acts as a powerful unifying force, a common purpose that transcends the boundaries of background, belief, or social standing. This shared aspiration fuels our collective determination to build a more prosperous, equitable and just society for all our citizens.\n\nThe Presidents call to harness our combined strengths for national development is particularly salient at this critical stage in Zimbabwes journey. By embracing the principles of unity and forgiveness, we can create an environment conducive to progress, innovation and sustainable growth. When we are truly of one mind, focused on our shared goals and committed to the common good, the possibilities for advancement are limitless.\n\nPresident Mnangagwas speech not only serves as a timely encouragement but also as a clear articulation of the path forward  a path paved with mutual respect, genuine understanding and a collective commitment to the betterment of Zimbabwe. It is a call to action, reminding us that true progress is achieved through collaborative effort, and that the strength of our nation lies in the unity of its people.\n\nFurthermore, this call to unity should be a catalyst for sustained, constructive engagement, fostering a sense of shared ownership in the nations future. It is a reminder that the responsibility for building a prosperous and peaceful Zimbabwe rests on all of us, and that by working together, we can achieve a future that reflects the best of our collective aspirations.\n\n",

In terms of our sectors contribution to the economy, we are doing well, said Deputy Minister Mnangagwa.\n\nZimbabwe Tourism Authority\n\nTourism is still in the number one spot contributing to the fiscus. This is mainly because people are travelling widely, domestic tourism is on the rise and this will help build Zimbabwe.\n\nDeputy Minister Mnangagwa urged industry players to take full advantage of high-profile events like ZITF to market their products, connect with international partners and position Zimbabwe as a premier travel and investment destination.\n\nPlatforms such as ZITF provide invaluable exposure for local players to connect with international markets, forge partnerships and promote Zimbabwe as a competitive travel destination, he said.\n\nBeyond promoting national tourism, the Deputy Minister said ZITF brings immediate economic benefits to the host city, Bulawayo.\n\nThe economic contribution to Bulawayos economy by ZITF cannot be overemphasised. Thousands of people have converged, seeking accommodation and restaurants. There will be a lot of trade happening, and this means the city of Bulawayo will immensely benefit this week, he said.\n\nZimbabwes tourism industry has been on a steady recovery path following the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Government-backed campaigns promoting domestic tourism, strategic infrastructure investments, and renewed international interest in Zimbabwe as a destination, have led to increased arrivals and hotel occupancy rates in recent years.\n\nFlagship initiatives such as the ZimBho campaign, regional marketing partnerships, and the introduction of community-based tourism models have further boosted the sectors visibility.\n\nThe rise of Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (Mice) tourism, anchored by events like ZITF, has also created new economic opportunities, particularly for small and medium hospitality enterprises.\n\nThe Government has also prioritised tourism under the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), viewing it as a key pillar in efforts to achieve a US$5 billion tourism economy by 2025.\n\n",

We could have kept it for ourselves, but we saw a greater need. Children here were struggling to access the internet. So, we opened our home, said Mr Bhebhe.\n\nLearners do their research at Jennifer Bhebhe Community Learning Centre located in Thandabantu village, Insiza District\n\nThat single act of generosity has since snowballed. As word of the initiative spread, a private school owner in Mawabeni, moved by photos of the children using the facility, donated five laptops: Two outright, and three more on loan for two years, with the promise that if well maintained, they would become permanent gifts.\n\nAlready powered by solar energy, the Bhebhe household has transformed into a hospitable learning hub, welcoming children and curious adults eager to explore the world beyond their village. Ward 5 Councillor, Ngobe Masongo, praised the initiative as a game-changer.\n\nThis is what community-driven development looks like. The centre is now a model we want to replicate in other areas. Were also engaging Government departments to support the communitys earlier request for a library and dedicated community centre, he said.\n\nVillage Head, Mr Thembelani Mthunzi, echoed the sentiment, highlighting the initiatives impact on local education.Our children can now compete academically with their peers from elite urban schools. Even we, the adults, are benefitting. We research farming techniques, remedies for illnesses and even new recipes. It has changed our lives, he said.\n\nRecently, the centre hosted Mr Melulwazi Dlamini, founder of ZimInclusive Learning, an online education platform. For two weeks, he has been delivering lessons via Google Classroom, teaching basic ICT skills, and offering tutoring in Mathematics and Science.\n\nThe energy from these students is amazing. All they needed was access, he said.One of the beneficiaries, Form Four pupil Sicecisiwe Maphosa, also shared her gratitude.\n\nIm so happy the learning centre was opened for us. Buying data used to be a big challenge, but now I can research all my subjects without stress, she said.\n\nIn a ward where only one of five primary schools and just one of three secondary schools have functional computers, the need for such grassroots initiatives cannot be overstated. Local residents have rallied behind the Bhebhe family, applauding their selflessness. One of them, Mr Qhubani Sibanda, highlighted the wider benefits of internet access.\n\nThis isnt just for students. There are online courses and even job opportunities for adults. We are grateful to the Bhebhe family for opening our eyes to a world we didnt think was within reach, he said.\n\nThe learning centre is named in memory of Mr Bhebhes late sister-in-law, Jennifer Bhebhe, a woman remembered for her staunch dedication to her childrens education after losing her husband soon after independence. Starlink has proven to be a transformative force in rural connectivity, offering affordable and reliable internet access in areas where traditional options are limited or non-existent. As the Government prepares to roll out the Presidential Internet Scheme  aimed at equipping all 2 400 administrative wards with high-speed internet  such community-led projects perfectly complement national efforts to build a connected, inclusive digital society.\n\nThis initiative, aligned with the Smart Zimbabwe Master Plan, will leverage advanced Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite technology and fibre-optic infrastructure to expand access to essential services such as schools, clinics and community centres, ensuring that even the most remote areas benefit from a truly digital society\n\n",

From personal growth to advocating for causes close to my heart, every moment has been a stepping stone towards empowerment and self-discovery, she said.\n\nHer reign was not just about glitz and glamour. Dube championed causes through two impactful initiatives, the Zibusiso Charity Foundation, which supports underprivileged communities and Zie The Label, a fashion brand that merges style with social good.\n\nSakhile Dube\n\nThe Zibusiso Foundation focuses on education, healthcare and empowerment, while Zie The Label channels fashion into a force for change. A portion of all proceeds supports charitable efforts, she said.\n\nRecently, Dube was on the other side of the runway, serving as part of the selection panel during the Miss Universe Zimbabwe 2025 auditions held in Bulawayo. And she was deeply impressed by what she saw.\n\nI was blown away by the quality of the contestants. The auditions went very well, and Im grateful to every girl who took the time to show up. Theyre all beautiful, confident, and determined. Zimbabwe is certainly on the right path when it comes to presenting world-class models, she said.\n\nDube said seeing the next generation of beauty queens reminded her of how far the country had come in embracing diverse expressions of beauty and individuality.\n\nOne of the most exciting things about representing Zimbabwe internationally is how our pageant embraces inclusivity. Beauty is not just appearance, its about the mind, body and soul,and the desire to uplift others.\n\nTo the 2025 hopefuls, Dube had this advice: Confidence and authenticity are everything. Be proud of your uniqueness, and dont try to replicate what youve seen on TV or from previous queens. Your story matters. And remember, your hair is your natural crown, and your smile is your superpower. She closed with a heartfelt message for her successor: Connect with others, stay resilient, and use this platform to uplift and inspire. Enjoy every moment, and most of all, have fun.\n\nAt the 72nd Miss Universe pageant last year, Dube made history by placing in the Top 30, a milestone for Zimbabwe. That year, Denmarks Victoria Kjaer Theilvig, 21, took the crown, with Nigerias Chidimma Adetshina and Mexicos Maria Fernanda Beltran placing second and third, respectively.\n\nThe journey opened many doors and challenged me in the best ways. If you win the title, know that you carry the country on your shoulders  but youre never alone. The organisation stands by you every step of the way, Dube told hopefuls.\n\n",

Ms Virginia Sibanda, who is currently bedridden at her Sunnyside home in Bulawayo, recently underwent surgery at a cost of approximately US$14000. The family managed to raise US$5000 but is still struggling to clear an outstanding hospital debt of US$9 000.\n\nFamily spokesperson, Mr Isaac Sibanda, said his sister has been unwell for some time and continues to require medical attention.\n\nThe doctors ran a series of tests, and we expect the results after the public holidays to determine whether further surgery is needed. We are already battling to pay off the outstanding hospital bills amounting to US$9,000. If the results indicate she needs another operation, that will mean even more expenses, funds we simply dont have as a family, said Mr Sibanda.\n\nHe said that the family had been hit hard by last years drought, which wiped out their herd of cattle, assets they would have otherwise sold to cover the medical expenses.\n\nWe are appealing to individuals who worked with Rahman Gumbo in Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Botswana during his long coaching career to lend a helping hand and support his widow in this difficult time, said Mr Sibanda.\n\nRahman Gumbo passed away in November 2023 in Botswana, where he was coaching a local football club. He was a celebrated defender for both Highlanders and the Zimbabwe national team, the Warriors. After retiring from playing, Gumbo embarked on a long coaching career, leading teams such as FC Platinum in Zimbabwe, as well as several clubs in Botswana and Malawi.\n\nThose who wish to assist Ms Sibanda can contact the family on: 0774 143 085 or 0772 742 117.\n\n",
