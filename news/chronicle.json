President Chapos plane touched down four hours later just after 7pm and he was welcomed by a high-profile delegation led by Zimbabwes Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Professor Amon Murwira, several other ministers, service chiefs, and senior Government officials.\n\nSpeaking to the media soon after arrival, President Chapo said Zimbabwe and Mozambique share a lot common interests and will utilise the visit to strengthen bilateral relations and address various challenges affecting the two nations.\n\nWe are very happy to be here. You know that Zimbabwe is Mozambique and Mozambique is Zimbabwe. That is why we are here, to be together, he said.\n\nThis is very important to be together, in unity in order to be closer and stronger together. We have the same culture, we have the same challenges, be it political, economic or trading challenges.\n\nWe want to be together to talk about business, to talk about trading, to talk about the political challenges and to talk about our economic challenges, said President Chapo.\n\nHe emphasised the need to strengthen trade riding on the already existing infrastructural networks.\n\nGuests at the State banquet held in honour of the Mozambican President at State House in Bulawayo last night\n\nWe are here to talk about trading, about commercial relations, political and economic relations between our people and between our countries. I think its very important to be here, said President Chapo.\n\nYou know that we have a Maputo-South Africa Corridor and we also have a Beira Corridor and the Beira Port, which are critical to our trade.\n\nPresident Chapo was escorted to the State House where President Mnangagwa hosted a State Banquet in his honour. The event which was attended by Cabinet ministers, diplomats, and business leaders, served as a platform for discussions on enhancing bilateral co-operation in trade, investment, and regional security.\n\nThe two Heads of States will have a hectic schedule today at the ZITF where they are scheduled to interact with scores of local and foreign exhibitors whose increased participation has seen the hosts extend space with 29 countries participating.\n\nAmong the foreign countries is; Afghanistan, Angola, Austria, Belarus, Botswana, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union delegation, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, German, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Netherlands, Pakistan, Rwanda, South Africa, Sweden, Tanzania, theUnited Kingdom, the United States of America, United Arab Emirates and Zambia.\n\nZimbabwe and Mozambique enjoy cordial bilateral relations dating back to pre-independence times and have blossomed over the years on the socio-economic and political front.\n\nAs described by Zimbabwes Ambassador to Mozambique, Victor Matemadanda, the new Mozambican President is a development-oriented leader who has had some educational training in Zimbabwe, making him multilingual as he is conversant in English, Portuguese, Shona, and his native language.\n\nHe is a pan-Africanist because we talked a lot about the region. He is very clear on where Africa should be.\n\nWhen we were talking, I couldsense that he is a regional leader interms of operation and his appreciation of issues affecting the SADC region, said Ambassador Matemadanda.\n\nMeanwhile, the exhibition centre has been a hive of activity since commencement of the expo on Monday with intense sideline conferences and business to business engagements. Yesterday morning the two Vice-Presidents, Dr Chiwenga and Cde Mohadi separately conducted a tour of stands and expressed their enthusiasm and excitement particularly on innovative exhibits.\n\nThe two VPs earlier led engagements with delegates at the ZITF International Business Conference and the ZITF Africa Connect Symposium where they challenged industry players and stakeholders to embrace innovation and technology to accelerate economic development.\n\nThe increased participation at the ZITF confirms the Second Republics positive impact in transforming the economy and leading industrialization in line with the National Development Strategy (NDS1), which builds the momentum towards Vision 2030.\n\nAccording to the ZITF Company, over 600 exhibitors are participating at the expo, which runs under the theme: Industrialisation: Crafting An Integrated Economic Landscape.\n\n",

            "content": "Sikhumbuzo Moyo\n\nAFRICA must break away from its historic role as a raw material supplier and boldly step into the future as an industrial powerhouse that produces high-value products and is able to sustain itself economically, Vice-President Kembo Mohadi has said.\n\nAddressing delegates at the 2025 Connect Africa Symposium held on the sidelines of the 65th Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) in Bulawayo yesterday, VP Mohadi urged African nations to champion industrialisation anchored on value-addition, innovation and intra-continental collaboration.\n\nThe time has come for Africa to stop exporting its potential and start exporting value. We must transition from a resource-dependent model to one driven by high-value manufacturing, technology and robust regional supply chains, he said.\n\nThe symposium, which ran under the theme Industrialisation and Economic Integration: Strengthening Africas Resilience, was attended by senior Government officials, regional policy experts and industry leaders.\n\nFor decades, African economies have been heavily reliant on the export of raw materials such as minerals, tobacco and agricultural products, often at the expense of domestic value addition and job creation.According to the African Union, the continent contributes only two percent of global manufacturing output, despite being home to about 17 percent of the worlds population and vast reserves of natural resources.\n\nEfforts to change this trajectory have gained momentum in recent years, with initiatives like the African Unions Agenda 2063, which prioritises industrialisation as a key driver of sustainable economic growth.\n\nThe establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in 2021 marked a positive step towards dismantling internal trade barriers and creating a single African market of over 1,4 billion people.\n\nVP Mohadi said Africas continued reliance on exporting unprocessed raw materials has left it vulnerable to global market shocks and external dependency.\n\nHe said a transformative shift lies in embracing beneficiation, agro-processing, renewable energy and digital innovation.\n\nVP Mohadi said industrialisation is not just about expanding factories, but economic complexity, diversifying economies, creating employment and unlocking Africas full potential.\n\nIndustrialisation fuels economic complexity, allowing nations to expand production capacity, create employment, reduce dependency on volatile global export markets and increase export revenue or returns, he said.\n\nCiting Ethiopia and Rwanda as examples, the Vice-President pointed out how strategic investment in textiles and technology has transformed their economic profiles.\n\nFor instance, Ethiopias commitment to textiles and garment manufacturing has generated over 200 000 jobs, showing how targeted investments in specific sectors yield significant outcomes. Similarly, Rwanda has emerged as a technological hub, demonstrating that investment in innovation can redefine a nations global stature, he noted.\n\nVP Mohadi said Africas fragmented trade systems, regulatory bottlenecks and tariff barriers continue to undermine its collective potential.\n\nA fragmented Africa, constrained by regulatory barriers, tariffs and logistical inefficiencies, weakens its ability to assert its position in global commerce and negotiate favourable trade terms, he said.\n\nHe hailed the AfCFTA as a turning point, offering a blueprint for eliminating tariff walls and boosting intra-Africa trade.\n\nBeyond the African Continental Free Trade Area, regional industrialisation policies also play a critical role in building Africas industrial architecture and resilience through networks such as SADCs industrialisation strategy which provides a roadmap for expanding manufacturing sectors, developing beneficiation industries and modernising infrastructure across Southern Africa, said VP Mohadi.\n\nHe also commended regional policies such as SADCs Industrialisation Strategy and Comesas integration frameworks, which support shared industrial growth and cross-border investments. These initiatives, VP Mohadi said, lay the foundation for a competitive African manufacturing ecosystem.\n\nHe called on African governments and private sector players to align efforts and turn industrialisation into a continental movement with deeper economic integration to fortify resilience against external shocks.\n\nHistorically, African nations have exported raw materials while importing finished goods at disproportionate costs, leaving economies dependent on external value chains and vulnerable to price fluctuations. This cycle must end, said VP Mohadi.\n\nLet us foster unity, celebrate our diversity, and build a continent that rises above its challenges. Through industrialisation, integration, and resilience, Africa can become a global powerhouse, self-reliant, innovative, and prosperous, with our people enjoying happy lives, he said.\n\nVP Mohadi said the symposium serves as a launchpad for Africas industrial and trade revitalisation.\n\nThrough collaboration, investment and policy alignment, we will secure economic resilience, strengthen Africas competitiveness and build an integrated market capable of thriving amid global uncertainties, he said.\n\n",

This initiative ensures that imports comply with both national and international standards relating to quality, safety, health and the environment before they enter the local market.\n\nIn an interview during the ongoing preparations for the 2025 edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF), Bureau Veritas contracts manager for Zimbabwe and Botswana, Mr Tendai Malunga, said the company is committed to safeguarding local industries.\n\nOur presence at ZITF is not only to showcase our capabilities, but also to engage with stakeholders, hear their concerns, and identify opportunities for improvement. Together with the Government of Zimbabwe, we are committed to continually refining the CBCA programme to make cross-border trade smoother and safer, he said.\n\nMr Malunga emphasised that the programme is designed to protect consumers from hazardous or substandard goods while also shielding local producers from unfair competition.\n\nThrough the CBCA programme, a wide range of products are subjected to pre-export verification and are required to meet strict conformity standards before importation into Zimbabwe. These include food and agricultural products, building materials, petroleum items such as LP gas containers, electrical and electronic devices, body care products, motor vehicle parts, clothing and textiles, as well as packaging materials.\n\nMr Malunga said Bureau Veritas operates in over 140 countries worldwide, and this global presence enables the organisation to effectively implement Zimbabwes conformity assessment programme and promote trade compliance.\n\nThe firm also works closely with the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra), whose customs officials enforce compliance at border posts by ensuring shipments are accompanied by the requisite Certificates of Conformity (CoCs).\n\nThey do the enforcement at the border posts, check that shipments that are coming through accompanied by a certificate of conformity, a document that attests that the consignment has been verified according to the standards and it meets the requirements, said Mr Malunga.\n\nHe said platforms such as ZITF offer a valuable opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the CBCA programme, identify gaps and collaboratively chart a path forward in improving trade facilitation and regulatory compliance.\n\nIn February last year, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce revealed that since the inception of the CBCA programme in 2015, over 155 million units of substandard products had been intercepted and rejected from entering Zimbabwe. This has significantly reduced the risk of hazardous goods flooding the market, thereby protecting consumers and promoting industry standards.\n\n",

How do we define a cyber-terrorist from a media practitioner? How do we generate content that does not violate other peoples rights?\n\nDr Muswere said freedom of expression is enshrined in the Constitution but that right cannot be used to violate people rights to dignity and privacy.\n\nSection 61 and section 62 of the Constitution reflect on the freedom of expression and the freedom of the media but the same sections relate to the exclusion, in terms of Subsection 5 when they violate other peoples rights in terms of dignity, values, integrity and privacy, he said.\n\nDr Muswere emphasised the importance of a media industry that tells positive stories about Zimbabwe and foster progressive nation building.\n\nThe New Dispensation is transparent, we have nothing to hide. We are open. We want a future that allows the media industry to be able to flourish and a future that allows all media practitioners to be free to protect their sources, he said. We want a media industry that reports on facts but not on mirages and shadows.\n\nDr Muswere said Zimbabwe will not support cyber terrorism hence authorities have taken a stand to protect unsuspecting citizens.\n\nThe Government will not support cyber-terrorism as it incites violence. We have a nation to build, one that has a media industry whose role is to raise awareness about terrorism, he said.\n\nWe want a media industry that raises awareness about the growth of the economy, inform and educate the nation.\n\nSpeaking at the same occasion, Deputy Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Dr Omphile Marupi, said the media must not be used as proxies for external political machinations and a vehicle for sponsored narratives, which undermine Zimbabwes national values.\n\nHe said with the well-known sponsors of fake news in Africa withdrawing their funding, an opportunity had risen for the Africa story to be told and protected.\n\nThe media resides at the centre of producing ideas and impressions, which enhance or may have the capacity to dismantle a nations reputation, said Dr Marupi.\n\nThe media and Government must be able to find points of mutual convergence in the positive image construction of the nation.\n\nThe ZITF Media Indaba was held under the theme: Growing the Media Sector for Zimbabwe Industrial Development and attended by diverse stakeholders.\n\nLast year, the Zimbabwe Media Commission announced that the process of amending the ZMC Act, which is the main law that governs the commission and its functions, had begun.\n\nThe amendment is aimed at providing for media governance, registration and accreditation provisions that will remove impediments that affect the media industry.\n\nZMC is one of the five Chapter 12 Independent Commissions, whose purpose is to foster a democratic society driven by respect for the Constitution, rule of law, democracy and human rights, among other objectives.\n\nIts main focus is on the promotion and protection of freedom of expression and the media and the promotion of accountable governance, through facilitating public access to information held by public entities for transparency, accountability and protection of human rights.\n\nLike other independent commissions, ZMC is expected to monitor compliance with constitutional provisions across the public and private sectors, to receive complaints from thepublic and to take appropriate action where necessary.\n\n",

Yes, and having said that, we have to admit that the planned investments between our companies were doubled.And so, by the end of 2025, the total investments will be doubled compared to the previous agreements, said Alrosa Joint Stock Company chief executive officer, Mr Pavel Marynichev.\n\nWe acknowledge that mining exploration is a meticulous and time-consuming undertaking which also needs significant financial and technical resources.We are encouraged that this elaborate exercise is underway and urge Alrosa Zimbabwe to quicken things up so it declares commercially viable finds, secure funding to develop mines and begin producing so that the economy can derive maximum benefit from its mineral wealth.\n\nWe see massive potential in the Alrosa Zimbabwe joint venture contributing to a jump in national output.\n\nWe call on other companies to invest in the diamond sector as well. In calling for more investment in that industry, we dont mean just extraction and selling of roughs but, more critically, investment to move the economy up the value chain to processing as well as jewellery making.That is where the cash is.\n\nTo get to the top, however, we need greater commitment and resources at every stage of the diamond pipeline  from miners, educational institutions, processors, to Government among other stakeholders.\n\n",

Seven players from various clubs, including TelOnes own Tapiwa Chilenga, will be sidelined due to an accumulation of yellow cards. Others missing out include Mpumelelo Bhebhe (Chicken Inn), Lawrence Mhlanga (Manica Diamonds), Tanaka Shandirwa (CAPS United), Ansa Botchway (Scottland FC), and Matthew Murambiwa (MWOS).\n\nBosso, on the other hand, will be without only captain Andrew Mbeba, who continues his recovery. Head coach Kelvin Kaindu provided a positive update at the clubs weekly press briefing.\n\nWere away again after our Ngezi draw. Save for Mbeba, everyone trained well. His injury isnt serious, but hell sit out another week, said Kaindu.\n\nBossos attacking hopes lie with Brighton MaNinja Ncube, Melikhaya Ncube, Mason Mushore, the relentless Never Rauzhi, Reason Sibanda, and Archford Faira, who is back to full fitness.\n\nBut the looming figure of Washington Navaya casts a long shadow. With seven goals in seven matches, the former Bosso man is the WiFi Boys ace. And with the Player of the Month award in his pocket, hes coming in hot.\n\nHis coach Herbert Maruwa is urging calm.\n\nNavayas doing great. But he mustnt let the emotion of facing Highlanders get to him. He should focus on the teams goals, said Maruwa.\n\nIts a crucial encounter. TelOne (11 points) are just one ahead of Bosso (10 points), making this a six-pointer in the race for early supremacy.\n\nTelOne, who finished 10th last season, are targeting a top-eight berth. With new recruits like Frank Makarati, Bruno Mtigo, Gerald Bero, and Tawanda Macheke, they are a more mature and ambitious outfit.\n\nBossos backline will be sternly tested, and fans from both Bulawayo and Gweru are expected to flock to Bata for what could be a cracker.\n\nAlso this week, Herentals take on GreenFuel today at Rufaro. MWOS travel to Wadzanayi to meet Simba Bhora, while Chicken Inn go to Mutare for a date with Manica Diamonds. Scottland FC head north to take on ZPC Kariba.\n\nDynamos, limping after a slow start, will meet Kwekwe United on Sunday at Rufaro in a must-win.\n\n",
