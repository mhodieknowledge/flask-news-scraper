            "content": "Duduzile Lupahla and Annita Mukahiwa\n\nIn the digital age, social media has become a double-edged sword, offering unprecedented opportunities for communication and information sharing at any given time while serving as a fertile ground for the spread of disinformation at the same time.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, social media has also emerged as a powerful tool for shaping public opinion and influencing election outcomes. However, its role as a catalyst for digital disinformation has raised serious concerns about the integrity of the democratic process.\n\nOver the past decade, Zimbabwe has witnessed a significant increase in internet penetration and social media usage. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube and TikTok have become integral to the daily lives of millions of Zimbabweans. According to recent statistics, over 60% of the population now has access to the internet, with a substantial portion of users relying on social media for news and information. This digital revolution has transformed the way political information is disseminated and consumed. Political parties, activists, and ordinary citizens alike have embraced social media as a means of engaging with the electorate, mobilizing support, and holding leaders accountable. However, the same platforms that empower citizens have also been weaponized to spread false information, manipulate public opinion, and undermine trust in democratic institutions.\n\nDisinformation, defined as the deliberate spread of false or misleading information, has become a prevalent issue in Zimbabwes digital landscape. During election cycles, social media platforms are flooded with fabricated stories, doctored images, and misleading videos designed to sway voters in favour of or against particular candidates or political parties. These campaigns are often orchestrated by politically motivated actors, including foreign entities seeking to influence Zimbabwes political trajectory. One of the most notorious examples of digital disinformation in Zimbabwe occurred during the 2018 general elections.\n\nIn the lead-up to the vote, social media was overflowing with false claims about the health of one leading candidate. These narratives, amplified by fake accounts, created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. Ahead of the 2023 elections, disinformation campaigns targeted key issues such as the economy, corruption, and national security. For instance, the alleged involvement of political leaders in illicit activities has been widely circulated on social media. These narratives are often designed to delegitimise political opponents.\n\nThe spread of digital disinformation in Zimbabwe is not a random phenomenon but a coordinated effort. Political actors have accused each other of using social media to spread falsehoods. Foreign actors, particularly those with vested interests in Zimbabwes natural resources and geopolitical positioning, have also played a role in shaping the countrys digital information ecosystem.\n\nThe spread of digital disinformation poses a significant threat to the integrity of Zimbabwes electoral process. By distorting public discourse and eroding trust in credible sources of information, disinformation undermines the ability of citizens to make informed decisions at the ballot box. This, in turn, weakens the legitimacy of election outcomes and worsens political instability. Moreover, the spread of false information often incites violence and social unrest. Disinformation campaigns have been linked to incidents of intimidation, harassment, and even physical violence against perceived opponents. This not only undermines the democratic process but also threatens the safety and well-being of citizens.\n\nTo effectively tackle this issue, the government must prioritise the development of policies and legislation that promote transparency and accountability in the digital space. This includes regulating the activities of social media platforms, holding perpetrators of disinformation accountable, and safeguarding freedom of expression. Civil society organisations and media outlets also have a critical role to play in countering disinformation. Additionally, technology companies must take responsibility for curbing the spread of false information on their platforms by investing in advanced detection algorithms and collaborating with local stakeholders.\n\nAs Zimbabwe prepares for future elections, the role of social media in shaping political outcomes cannot be ignored. While the platform offers immense potential for fostering democratic engagement, its misuse as a tool for disinformation poses a grave threat to the countrys democratic aspirations. To safeguard the integrity of the electoral process, it is imperative that all stakeholders work together to create a digital environment that prioritises truth, transparency, and accountability.\n\nDuduzile Lupahla and Annita Mukahiwa are students at Africa University.

Another ground-breaking innovation they developed a multi-nutrient block for ruminant animals the frass blocks are being given to goats and sheep.Speaking at a recent familiarisation tour to gain an appreciation of the specialised institutes innovation, Ministry of\n\nLands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Permanent Secretary Professor Obert Jiri commended the work being done by scientists.What we have seen here for the feed trials and all the experiments that they are doing, it is very fantastic. This is the base of our agriculture, from here we know that we can have new feed formulations and we can then commercialise from this, he said.\n\nOf course some will fail at the commercialisation stage so not all this will go to commercialisation but some will succeed and that is the nature of science. When something succeeds from science we know that its tried and tested also proven and we will have confidence on it.He said such feed formulations were critical considering periods such as the El Nio-induced drought where most of the livestock was lost due to lack of feed.\n\nMatopos Research Institute principal research officer, Ms Primrose Nkomboni who is a nutritionist said it was their mandate to formulate feed using locally available resources.\n\nThese are resources the farmers can easily access. When we identify the resources we take them to the laboratory for testing. We would be testing for crude protein, fibre and other nutrients, after that we then formulate our feed for example lucerne, mopane or black soldier fly based pallets.\n\n",

It is a fantastic opportunity for us to not only showcase what we do but also to educate people about various conditions and disabilities that affect so many lives, she said.The booth was filled with engaging demonstrations, informative pamphlets, and a warm team eager to connect.\n\nThe clinic aims to break down barriers of understanding around physiotherapy and its vital role in recovery and rehabilitation. Many people are unaware of the benefits of physiotherapy. Whether its recovering from an injury, managing chronic pain, or improving mobility, we want to spread the word about how we can help, said Kwahla.\n\nWhile ZITF typically highlights a variety of sectors, Kwahla said their presence underscored the importance of the often-overlooked field of physical health.By sharing their expertise, they hope to spark conversations that foster greater acceptance and understanding of physiotherapy as an essential component of healthcare.\n\nWe are excited to meet new faces and share our passion for helping others. Lets start a conversation about health and wellness. We are ready to embrace this opportunity at the ZITF  a chance not just to showcase our services, but to ignite awareness and support for a healthier community, she said.Specialist Paediatric Physiotherapist Precious Madzimbe, who co-runs the clinic and possesses over a decade of clinical and academic experience, said exhibiting at ZITF was truly inspiring and awe-inspiring, adding that it is a chance to create new dimensions in the field while also creating new opportunities for those in the field.\n\nWe are truly inspired and joyed at the opportunity to be exhibiting at the ZITF. This assists us as medical experts to interact with the public to show and educate them on various conditions. Some of which are associated with witchcraft, he said.\n\nMadzimbe said his services and academic engagements across Africa, including his current research work, reflect the fruit of independence and the continuing transformation of Zimbabwes health sector.He said these platforms have allowed him to contribute not only as a clinician but also as a researcher, mentor, and advocate for inclusive, culturally relevant rehabilitation.\n\nSpecialised services such as physiotherapy are unknown in rural areas. Children with congenital conditions like cerebral palsy or clubfoot were often hidden from society, their needs unmet and their dignity disregarded, Madzimbe said.Rehabilitation, as I have stated in my previous engagements, is no longer a foreign luxury; it has become a national priority. I am a proud product of that transformation. Allowing health services to be exhibited shows that we are in the right direction.\n\nWe are no longer limited to reactive care; we are shaping futures through preventative and developmental health. We are proud to see our Government leading the way and allowing us to practice, said Madzimbe.He noted that people living with disabilities in Zimbabwe have long suffered under the weight of stigma. But through community education, inclusive policy, and the mobilisation of local leaders, this narrative is changing.He said exhibiting at ZITF facilitated international collaborations.\n\nI have contributed to the development of Zimbabwe-specific paediatric physiotherapy guidelines and educational materials now in use at training institutions and rehabilitation departments across the country, he said.Most recently, Madzimbe authored a book on prostate cancer and family support systems in Africa, reaffirming that healing must engage the emotional, spiritual, and psychological dimensions of care.\n\nOne of the greatest honours of such events is to be given the chance and ability to teach and be taught. I have had the privilege of shaping the future of physiotherapy through my engagements at a local university and nationwide workshops, and now I can engage the public, he said.\n\n",
