Renowned cultural expert Ellen Mlangeni, who is the director of Thandanani Womens Ensemble led engaging sessions, teaching children poetry, storytelling, and traditional dances.\n\nThe celebration was a resounding success, offering young learners a magical introduction to the world of theatre.\n\nTopasi Ndlovu, director of Shaba Arts, stressed the importance of nurturing young minds to preserve culture and heritage.\n\nWere happy to commemorate this day in schools, especially with youngsters, as it makes it easier for them to learn heritage studies, Ndlovu said.\n\nHe highlighted the significance of introducing theatre to young children, explaining that the approach was tailored to their level.\n\nWe decided to focus on basic activities rather than core theatre elements since theyre still young. This makes it easier for them to understand and relate, he noted.\n\nNdlovu also stressed the power of theatre in engaging young minds.\n\nTheatre has a unique way of captivating children.\n\nIts essential to tap into their creativity and imagination from an early age, he said.\n\nFollowing the success of the initiative, Ndlovu expressed a desire to expand it to more schools.\n\nThis was a success, and we hope to visit more schools, teaching both young and older children to help preserve our culture.\n\nChildren can pass it down to the next generation. Growing up, we had no television and relied on theatre, so it remains a vital tool for storytelling and cultural preservation.\n\nMiss Sibanda, the ECDs headmistress, thanked the city council for supporting the initiative.\n\nIt shows they havent neglected the younger generation.\n\nYou can see the joy on the childrens faces  thats what makes it all worthwhile. Through experiences like these, they are nurtured into theatre and grow with the values they learn, she said.\n\nAs the global community marked World Theatre Day, Entumbane ECDs children walked away inspired, their imaginations ignited by the power of storytelling and performance.\n\nThe initiative was also aligned with the new curriculum, specifically under Heritage Studies.\n\nSource: The Herald\n\n",
