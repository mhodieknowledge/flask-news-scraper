The video will drop this week, and Im confident our fans will love it, Brema said.\n\nWere also using this video to introduce our team to our audience.\n\nBrema spoke on the importance of preserving ones heritage saying: We should never lose who we are as a people.\n\nIn December of last year, the band dropped Ingqinamba, their first full album following the heart-breaking death of the beloved Elvis MaEli Mathe. The album came on the heels of an EP that introduced the bands new vocalists, Frank High Tower Masuku and Luke Ergan Mathe, who took over as the fresh voices of the group.\n\nOne of the biggest moves surrounding the single was the bands decision to switch studios. The group made the bold move from KB Studios, where they had recorded all their previous projects, to TM Records. This change was led by Rhumba artiste Nkosikhona Ngwabi, who has been praised for his exceptional sound quality, most notably for his work on the Mlambos Express Bands album Mambuluza Mbonwe, which was widely acclaimed for its production quality.What made us change the studio is the fact that our fans have always been clamouring for a new sound, and we wanted them to have a comparison. Weve been with KB Studios since our first project with the late MaEli, but were switching things up. We may even record our next album at TM Records, said Brema Moyo.\n\nAfter missing the chance to hit one million views on their first video due to it not being posted on the official channel, Brema urged fans to watch their upcoming video on the bands official platform on YouTube.

This is critically important. There are so many children of the same age, same school, but those who find their way to this place should feel privileged. Most importantly, it is because they have performed well, that is why they are able to come and meet the Head of State; I congratulate them, he said.\n\nThe Minister of Primary and Secondary Education, Torerayi Moyo, highlighted the significance of the awards, emphasising the richness of Zimbabwes Heritage-based Education and the milestones achieved in the sector.\n\nMinister Torerayi Moyo\n\nThe importance of this competition is that education should be meaningful. Education that does not produce goods and services that our people need is useless and is not important. Through the Heritage-based curriculum, we want to identify talents in our students. Those who are good in law, so be it. They were competing as lawyers. A moot court is like a mock court session, where we have judges as adjudicators and they have won.\n\nSo the Heritage-based curriculum ensures that they have identified their career pathway. On completion of A-level, I can envision that these students will proceed to university and study law and become lawyers.\n\nThat is the advantage of Heritage-based education that our President has approved, and we are implementing it very well, said Minister Moyo.\n\nMinister Moyo also commended President Mnangagwa for creating an educational environment that allows good students to excel.\n\nI want to appreciate and thank His Excellency, the President, Cde Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, for affording our students an opportunity to interact and engage with others. I want to congratulate the students for performing exceptionally well.\n\nThey managed to come first out of 19 schools, and there were seven countries that participated in the moot court competition. So, Zimbabwe will represent the Southern region in the next competition to be held in Ghana in August, and we wish our students very well, he said.\n\nTheir coach, Ms Bernadette Mazambani Chigwida, attributed their success to sheer hard work.\n\nIt is a competition, which is a simulation of court proceedings. We had seven countries and 19 schools and out of those 19 schools, our Team Zimbabwe managed to come out first. We have the best speaker from the competition from Zimbabwe; we also have the best female speaker, and I was voted the best adjudicator, said Ms Chigwida.\n\nThe best student speaker, Simbarashe Mujuru, expressed his delight at meeting President Mnangagwa, saying it will spur him to continue working hard.\n\nThe competition was difficult, but through sleepless nights and hard work, we managed to win. The exposure itself and the chance to represent the country is something we will not forget. The opportunity to meet the President; this is the person who runs the country and for him to take his time to meet us, is something we appreciate, he said.\n\nThe best female speaker, Kimberly Chamboko, echoed similar sentiments.\n\nIt was very tough  there were many schools, many countries, but we managed to push through many sleepless nights. It was a learning experience, trying to learn about the laws and everything, but we managed to come through, and we brought the trophy back home to Zimbabwe, said Chamboko from Heritage School in Borrowdale.\n\nOther students who participated are James Charumbira, Samuelson Kapingidza and Munotida Foya from St Georges College and Trish Kadenhe and Beverly Chifeya from Heritage School.\n\n",

We have moved from a small to a medium-scale operation, he said. Investing in cutting-edge mining equipment has significantly boosted our productivity, creating over 2 500 jobs in Matabeleland South and across the country.\n\nBeyond job creation, mechanisation is unlocking new levels of efficiency and profitability in the mining sector. To date, we have seen numerous changes and developments. We previously only had stamp mills, but today we have bore-mills that can crush between five to ten tonnes an hour.\n\nMr Moyo said the objective is to increase output and contribute to mining sector growth, aligning with President Mnangagwas Vision 2030 for an upper-middle-income economy. He affirmed the businesss commitment to ongoing community partnerships for sustainable livelihood improvements.\n\nWe have transitioned from a small-scale mining company to a medium-scale one. What we look forward to is that, in five to six years, we will have scaled up to a large-scale mining operation. Currently, we are focusing on sinking more shafts. The one we are working on is 54 metres wide, and we have installed a headgear. We expect to produce 100 to 150 tonnes, said Mr Moyo.\n\nTour of Stella B Mine in Maphisa\n\nHe added that they hoped to complete some of the projects by years end, with the crushing circuit at 95 percent completion, able to crush between five and ten tonnes of ore per hour.\n\nThis will allow us to generate revenue to upgrade our system and income. We also aim to be counted as those who are positively contributing to the mining industry and the countrys economic growth.\n\nWe urge everyone to take up responsible mining, as the sector is open to all Zimbabweans to help sustain their livelihoods and contribute to national development, he said.\n\nMr Moyo encouraged miners and others to raise the Zimbabwean flag high and be proud of the country, aligning with President Mnangagwas philosophy: Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo / Ilizwe lakhiwa ngabanikazi balo.\n\nMachinery and equipment at Stella B Mine in Maphisa\n\nWe have between 20 to 50 claims and are calling upon the community and various stakeholders, including investors, to join us. Together, we can empower everyone by using proper channels to sell our minerals directly to Fidelity Gold Refinery. We also commend Fidelity Gold Refiners for establishing gold-buying centres across the country, making it easier for miners.\n\nArtisanal and small-scale miners are the primary contributors to national gold production, accounting for over 65 percent, highlighting the positive effects of formalisation.\n\n",

            "content": "Robin Muchetu, Lifestyle, Health and Gender Editor\n\nZIMBABWE is facing a significant financial strain as it is allocating thousands of US dollars monthly to secure third-line Antiretrovirals (ARVs) for 603 individuals.\n\nThis escalating expenditure is occurring against a backdrop of dwindling global donor support, placing immense pressure on the nations healthcare resources.\n\nThe exorbitant cost of drug resistance tests, required to determine suitable third-line treatment, further exacerbates the financial strain.\n\nWhile first-line treatment remains relatively affordable, rigorous adherence is crucial to mitigate the catastrophic expenses associated with advanced regimens, which divert funds from other vital treatment programmes.\n\nDr Owen Mugurungi, Director of Aids and Tuberculosis (TB) Unit in the Ministry of Health and Child Care, underscored the substantial financial burden of third-line treatment.\n\nThe challenge with third-line treatment is that it is expensive to manage. First-line costs US$6 to US$8 per month, while the third line goes into hundreds of US dollars and even thousands per month per person.\n\nIt means you have to go by resistance; if you are now resistant to the drugs that we use on you in the first and second line and that drug is not registered here in Zimbabwe or it is not available here, it means we have to source it for you.\n\nConsidering the three-in-one combination (TLD) that we use for first-line treatment is US$8, treatment for the third line is US$86-US$90 per month, which is 10 times higher and thats expensive. So, we try as much as possible to limit or reduce the chances of people getting to the second line and third line of treatment, said Dr Mugurungi.\n\nDr Mugurungi said that while it is easy to determine the cost of treatment for those in the first and second line of therapy, it is not the same for the third line.\n\nWe have a standard cost for ARVs because it is a three-in-one combination for the first line, but for the third line, they are separate treatments. The biggest cost is with the drug resistance testing; it entails that we test, which drugs you are resistant to and, which drugs your infection is sensitive to and so on. So, it is not standard and it is very expensive to do these processes that can spill into thousands.\n\nDr Owen Mugurungi\n\nDr Mugurungi said the 603 patients on third-line medication is too large a number, considering the associated costs of their treatment, and noted that the availability of the drugs is also a challenge and is not always guaranteed.\n\nIt is important to note that the less a drug is used, the less it is also produced, making it extremely expensive to buy. If we had one million people on a particular drug, manufacturers also lower costs as there is a huge demand, but producing special drugs for a very small population also increases the costs significantly, and that is why third-line drugs are very expensive to buy. Their availability is also not guaranteed, always looking at small numbers required, he said.\n\nDr Mugurungi revealed that people are developing resistance to first and second lines of treatment due to myths and misconceptions.\n\nOne of the most obvious reasons is knowledge and behaviours. We have had people who have been told it is not HIV they are suffering from but something else to do with spiritual and traditional things. They are told to stop taking their ARVs. That misinformation is dangerous, and we know that the media can assist in addressing some of those myths and misconceptions, which will make it difficult for people to continue taking their medication, he said.\n\nDr Mugurungi further revealed how resistance to ARVs comes about.\n\nIf you have a headache or malaria, which you are supposed to get treated for, get treated. However, in a few days, some people stop taking medication because they have side effects or they forget or they have challenges in getting medication.\n\nFor people with diabetes, hypertension and others, there are days that one can forget and you can be forgiven because once you take your medication for diabetes your sugar levels go normal. But for HIV, when you forget or are unable to get your medication or the medication gets lost, the virus changes its morphology. At the end of the day, the virus becomes resistant to the medication that you are taking, he said.\n\nOther people naturally become infected with a drug-resistant strain of HIV, which may not respond to the initial lines of treatment, prompting the need for a third line of intervention, which is very expensive.Dr Mugurungi said in terms of trying to address the challenge of people having to go on third-line treatment, they were working with the media to make sure they reduce myths and misconceptions around HIV and people adhere to their medication.\n\nWe are also advancing medication to the patient for six months so that people do not have an excuse as to why they could not collect their medication on time. Even if you are unable to travel to the health centre to access your medication, you can ask your colleague or even your neighbour to collect medicines for you so that at least you are always in constant supply of medication, he said.\n\nARV therapy was introduced in 2004 but did not include a third line of treatment, which was later developed. According to the Guidelines for HIV Prevention, Testing and Treatment of HIV in Zimbabwe, adherence to treatment regimens and schedules is critical to the success of therapy and without high adherence rates, viral resistance to the medicines emerges readily.\n\n",

The ZMTi, with its focus on practical, industry-relevant training, will play a vital role in elevating the quality of journalism across the nation.\n\nOne of the most pressing challenges facing Zimbabwean media is the need to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and the realities of contemporary newsrooms. In an era of digital disruption, where multimedia storytelling and data-driven journalism are paramount, training must extend beyond traditional print-centric models. The ZMTi will provide crucial hands-on experience in areas such as digital content creation, social media management and verification techniques.\n\nFurthermore, the institutes potential to complement existing training providers is undeniable. Rather than competing, a collaborative approach could foster a more robust and diverse training ecosystem.\n\nZMTi, with its access to Zimpapers extensive resources and industry connections, will offer specialist modules and workshops that supplement the broader curricula of other institutions. Joint initiatives, such as guest lectures, mentorship programmes and shared research projects, will create a synergistic effect, benefitting the entire journalistic community.\n\nThe success of ZMTi hinges on several critical factors. Firstly, the institute must seek to uphold the highest ethical standards and promote critical thinking, which are essential for producing journalists who can serve the public interest with integrity. Secondly, continuous professional development for existing journalists is equally vital. The ZMTi should offer refresher courses and specialised training to help seasoned practitioners adapt to the changing media landscape.\n\nFinally, the institute should strive for accreditation and recognition from reputable international bodies. This will not only enhance its credibility but also ensure that Zimbabwean journalists are equipped with skills that meet global standards.\n\n",

            "content": "Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau\n\nTHE Government has begun implementing digitally inclined measures aimed at streamlining operations to enhance the movement of cargo and travellers at ports of entry.\n\nThis latest initiative is part of a comprehensive drive to align service delivery with the modernisation of the Beitbridge Border Post.\n\nSo far, the Department of Immigration has introduced automated gate systems commonly known as eGates as well as an online border management system.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) is already using fast cargo scanners, drones, the Zimbabwe Single Window platform and the eTIP (electronic Temporary Import Permit), which have contributed to improved services.\n\nSpeaking during an oversight visit to the border by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Defence, Home Affairs and Security, Assistant Regional Immigration Officer at Beitbridge, Mr Lucky Joe Matyora, said that eGates were introduced in October last year.\n\nZimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra)\n\nUnder the new setup, the eGates allow travellers to scan their biometric passports and undergo automated identity verification, replacing the need for manual passport checks by border officials, he said.\n\nThis system is expected to significantly reduce waiting times and improve the efficiency of border control procedures. It forms part of the Governments broader efforts to modernise its ports of entry.It also aligns with global trends towards more streamlined and secure border management through the use of advanced technologies, Mr Matyora added.\n\nWe expect to use the same system, which we are piloting, to efficiently clear the anticipated surge in traffic during the forthcoming Easter holidays.\n\nThe new immigration system is capable of capturing travellers biometric data, flagging certain individuals and auto-generating durations for visitors  for example, allocating 30 days for those on holiday, seven days for business travellers and three days for those transiting through the country.We are piloting the project and so far, we are pleased with the situation on the ground, said Mr Matyora.\n\nWe are also collaborating with other border agencies to tighten security through the use of CCTV cameras and drones. This has enabled us to detect and eliminate undesirable individuals at the border and its periphery.\n\nMr Matyora said through collaboration with other agencies, they have managed to reduce the smuggling of unaccompanied minors across the border.\n\nIn 2023, authorities intercepted over 300 minors and last year, they successfully detained 149 minors.Zimra Manager at Beitbridge, Mrs Winfred Chiyangwa, said they were using the Zimbabwe Electronic Single Window (ZESW) initiative, which was introduced in 2022, to enhance the ease of doing business.Zimra is the lead agency responsible for co-ordinating and harmonising clearance processes at the countrys ports of entry.\n\nThere are 22 border agencies at major port authorities, including Beitbridge, whose operations will be harmonised and streamlined under the ZESW.\n\nUnder the new system, clients and stakeholders will no longer need to move from one agency to another, as all regulatory and transitory services, processes and payments will now be conducted online through a single platform. This will result in faster, more efficient and transparent operations, she said.The key benefits of the Single Window include improved compliance among agencies, more efficient and productive use of resources and enhanced collection of fees, duties and penalties.\n\nWe are tightening security along the border in response to an increase in smugglers using floating boats to cross into the country from South Africa, said Mrs Chiyangwa.\n\nShe said when the river is dry, smugglers use the riverbed, but now that the river is flooded, they are using floating boats.\n\nWe have strengthened security with drones both inside and outside the border, which has helped us reduce crime, she said.\n\nIn some cases, we have dismantled shacks at illegal crossing points where vendors were supplying goods to smugglers. It is encouraging to note that through integrated border management, we are succeeding in securing the border.\n\nParliament has acknowledged the operational challenges at Beitbridge Border Post and its periphery, which are hindering the effective reduction of illegal activities and irregular migration.\n\nActing Chairperson of the visiting joint Parliamentary Committee, Cde Albert Nguluvhe, said the committee was touring all major ports of entry.\n\nHe said at Beitbridge, they observed challenges related to lack of a security fence, the absence of a border inspection road on the border flanks and issues regarding manpower of certain Government agencies.So far, we are impressed with the operations at this border, which is now more secure following its upgrade by the Second Republic, said Cde Nguluvhe.\n\nWe have seen drone surveillance, fast cargo scanners, canine units, e-gates, biometric services and the separation of traffic.\n\nIn addition, the security forces have been addressing issues related to touts and other individuals, who had become a menace at the border.\n\nThe team is scheduled to visit Plumtree and Mulambepele ports of entry on a similar mission, on Tuesday.\n\n",
