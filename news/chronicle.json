Indeed, this is what the rule of law is all about, the President said.\n\nIn the October elections, Cde Chapo won by a massive landslide; his party, Frelimo, also improved its parliamentary majority in the 250-seat legislature.\n\nHowever, the opposition led by Mr Modlane has refused to accept defeat, leading to sporadic protests in the gas-rich southern African country, concentrated mainly in the urban centres.\n\n",

As the supreme electoral body undertook its arduous task, the opposition in that country was staging violent protests, alleging without providing any evidence, that the election was flawed. A number of people have died in the disorder while business has suffered too.\n\nThe suspense ended on Monday when the council finally pronounced itself on the poll. It declared Frelimo candidate, Cde Daniel Chapo the victor with a 65 percent mandate. In second place is Mr Venancio Mondlane, a pastor-turned-politician who contested as an independent candidate and got 25 percent of the vote.\n\nCde Daniel Chapo\n\nIn parliament, Frelimo, in power since 1975, secured 195 seats versus Podemos, an opposition party which backed Mr Mondlane, which got 31. Renamo, a former rebel movement, came third with 20 constituencies, a 40-seat decline on its 2019 performance.\n\nGiven the suspense, and the disorder that accompanied that period, we hope that the Monday statement by the council has closed Mozambiques 2024 electoral contest. All the energies will now be channelled towards Cde Chapos inauguration and his formation of a new government to govern our sister republic for the next five years.\n\nMozambique, like Zambia and Tanzania, occupies a special place in the hearts of every Zimbabwean. Without Mozambique and Zambias support, our liberation war would most likely have struggled, even failed. The two countries served as trusted rear bases for our freedom fighters. They provided material and moral support as well. For that magnanimity towards our liberation movement, they actually suffered military retribution from the Rhodesian army.\n\nBecause of this formidable shared history and the fact that communities along our border with Mozambique have blood relatives on either side, we urge our brothers and sisters to find each other, shun violence, talk and practise peace for greater national development.\n\nMozambique is a massive country with abundant natural resources. From rubies to natural gas; from wildlife to a high-potential blue economy. She has ports that serve as vital links for her landlocked neighbours such as our country, Malawi and Zambia to global export markets.\n\nThese resources and geographical advantage will only bring tangibles to our sister republic if it enjoys peace.We are optimistic that, indeed, with the Constitutional Council having spoken, our brothers and sisters in Mozambique will listen and unite to build their great country.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nWe cite Sadc Chairperson, President Mnangagwa elsewhere on these pages noting the same.\n\nThe ruling by that countrys top electoral court, which upheld Frelimo Partys victory, completes and thus exhausts all lawful processes on determining election results, in line with that countrys national laws, and in keeping with Sadcs Election Guidelines and expectations, he said.\n\nSadc thus expects all parties to the electoral process, both individually and collectively, to abide by the decision of the Council which should provide a constitutional way forward for the country, and facilitate the way to greater peace, normalcy and stability in the interest of all Mozambicans.\n\n",

It handed over the donation on December 5.\n\nThis donation was made at Mpilo Central Hospitals radiotherapy centre and the aim is that every time a woman with cervical cancer comes through, she is given a packet of pads so that even though a packet of pads is just a dollar this time she doesnt have to worry, on top of her bills, about buying these pads, she said.\n\nFrom right: Dr Tatenda Chingonzoh, Mr Phineas Sithole who is Mpilo Central Hospital Principal Nursing Officer, Mrs Cheryln Young, Mrs Soneni Dube, Ms Precious Mpofu and Sister Buyiswa Sithole at the sanitary pads handover event\n\nShe urged the public to assist cervical cancer patients.\n\nNobody chooses to have cancer, so it can happen to anybody, anyones mother, anyones sister, anyones child, daughter can be affected by cancer. Whatever we give can impact, be it for this campaign was pads so a dollar would actually help a woman with pads but there is a lot more that can be done to support these women.\n\nLIFT hopes to mobilise more support for cervical cancer patients by providing them with regular food hampers and supportive medication.\n\nThe public can also assist by paying private laboratories so patients can undergo relevant tests at subsidised cost.\n\nWe hope to do more, not only for cervical cancer, said Dr Chingonzoh.\n\nEach month of the year has a cancer that is dedicated to it, so we hope for 2025, every month we can do something for whichever cancer is covered that month and we hope also, we are not just focusing on the women, its just this particular pad drive was for gynaecological cancers, but we hope to do more for all cancers, cancers in men, cancers in women, cancers in children however much we can.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.chronicle.co.zw/the-transformative-power-of-parole/",
            "content": "Innocent Mujeri, Correspondent\n\nThe intended introduction of a comprehensive parole system in Zimbabwe marks a pivotal moment in the countrys approach to justice and correction.\n\nUnderpinned by the Prisons and Correctional Service Act, this initiative reflects a shift from a punitive model of incarceration to one focused on rehabilitation and reintegration. As Zimbabwe takes these critical steps, it joins a growing list of nations that recognise the transformative potential of parole in fostering personal growth, reducing recidivism, and enhancing public safety.\n\nParole, fundamentally, is about second chances. It allows individuals to re-enter society before completing their prison sentences, provided they demonstrate good conduct and readiness to reintegrate. This conditional release is not granted lightly. Parole is tied to strict eligibility criteria, such as meritorious behaviour, self-discipline, and a demonstrable commitment to becoming law-abiding citizens. The process in\n\nZimbabwe will be overseen by the newly established State Parole Board, which ensures that societal safety remains paramount.\n\nFile picture: Khami Maximum Prison School external students headmaster Shadreck Katsholo (raised hand) with members of staff and Form Two student, 36-year-old Zandile Ndou (far right)\n\nThe Zimbabwean Governments commitment to this initiative, as highlighted by President Mnangagwa and Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi, underscores its belief in rehabilitation over retribution. By shifting the narrative around incarceration, the country aims to reduce the stigma associated with imprisonment, while addressing systemic challenges such as overcrowding in correctional facilities.\n\nOvercrowding has long been a pressing issue, not only straining resources, but also undermining the effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes. Through parole and the establishment of community correctional centres, Zimbabwe seeks to create a more humane and sustainable correctional system.\n\nThis move aligns with global best practices. In countries such as Norway, parole plays a central role in their correctional philosophy, which prioritises rehabilitation and reintegration. Norwegian inmates nearing the end of their sentences transition to halfway houses or supervised release, where they gain the skills and confidence needed for a successful re-entry into society. This approach has contributed to Norways remarkably low recidivism rate  around 20 percent compared to the global average of 50 to 60 percent.\n\nSimilarly, Canada employs a phased parole system that allows inmates to engage in community-based activities, while remaining under supervision. Such gradual reintegration builds trust and fosters a sense of responsibility among parolees.\n\nSouth Africa, too, offers valuable lessons for Zimbabwe. As a neighbouring country with shared socio-economic challenges, South Africa has used parole effectively to combat prison overcrowding. Their system is supported by halfway houses and community service programmes, ensuring that parolees contribute positively to society, while being held accountable. This blend of compassion and accountability is key to the success of any parole system, including Zimbabwes.\n\nHowever, the introduction of parole is not without challenges. Public perception often poses a significant hurdle. Many people view parole as a lenient option that compromises public safety. This misconception needs to be addressed through transparent communication about the rigorous conditions and oversight involved in granting parole.\n\nMinister Ziyambi Ziyambi\n\nEducating the public about the societal benefits of parole  such as reduced recidivism, economic savings, and the successful reintegration of former inmates  can help shift attitudes.\n\nEqually important is the need for robust post-release support. Reintegration is a complex process that extends beyond the prison gates. Former inmates often face significant barriers, including social stigma, limited job opportunities, and mental health challenges. Providing access to counselling, vocational training, and employment programmes is crucial to ensuring that parolees do not revert to criminal behaviour.\n\nZimbabwes plan to establish a foundation aimed at supporting reintegration initiatives is a commendable step in the right direction. By involving stakeholders from various sectors, the government can mobilise resources and create a support network that addresses the multifaceted needs of parolees.\n\nRegional collaboration also holds promise. Minister Ziyambis call for African correctional services to work together through the African Correctional Services Association highlights the potential for shared learning and resource optimisation. Neighbouring countries can exchange expertise, develop standardised policies, and strengthen reintegration programmes, creating a unified approach to parole across the continent.\n\nThe economic benefits of parole cannot be overlooked. Incarcerating an individual is costly, placing a significant burden on State resources. Parole offers a cost-effective alternative, allowing governments to redirect funds towards other pressing needs, such as education and healthcare.\n\nMoreover, reintegrated individuals contribute to the economy through employment and entrepreneurship, breaking the cycle of dependency and crime. This dual impact  reducing State expenditures, while enhancing economic productivity  makes parole a pragmatic solution for addressing the challenges facing correctional systems.\n\nThe planned Zimbabwes parole system is not just about alleviating overcrowding or saving costs; it is about recognising the potential for redemption and growth in every individual. By focusing on rehabilitation, the country is building a justice system that upholds human dignity and prioritises public safety.\n\nThe establishment of community correctional centres further reinforces this vision, offering low-risk offenders an opportunity to serve their sentences in environments that promote learning and personal development.\n\nAs Zimbabwe embarks on this journey, it has the opportunity to tailor its approach to its unique socio-economic context, while drawing inspiration from successful models worldwide.\n\nThe commitment of the Government, as evidenced by the support of President Mnangagwa and the active involvement of the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service, is a promising start. However, the success of the parole system will ultimately depend on its implementation. Clear guidelines, effective oversight, and the active participation of communities are essential to ensuring that the system achieves its intended goals.\n\nIn the broader context, Zimbabwes embrace of parole reflects a growing global consensus that punitive justice alone is insufficient. Societies are increasingly recognising that meaningful rehabilitation and reintegration are the keys to reducing crime and building safer communities. By giving individuals a second chance, parole embodies the belief that people can change, grow, and contribute positively to society.\n\nZimbabwes parole system represents a forward-thinking approach to justice. It is a testament to the countrys commitment to balancing accountability with compassion, punishment with rehabilitation, and societal safety with individual redemption.\n\nAs the system takes root, it has the potential to transform not only the lives of parolees, but also the broader community, creating a justice system that is fair, effective, and humane.\n\nBy learning from countries such as Norway, Canada, and South Africa, and addressing its unique challenges, Zimbabwe can build a model parole system that serves as an inspiration to other nations.\n\n",

We want learners to have a deep understanding of their heritage, and their surroundings so that they can identify challenges they face at home, schools, and communities, he said.\n\nThey can then do research based on the problem and try to proffer solutions through the power of digital tools.\n\nMinister Moyo highlighted that the Government is committed to enhancing educational experiences through the establishment of innovation hubs in schools. These hubs are aimed at equipping students with 21st-century skills necessary for innovation and technological advancement.\n\nMinister Moyo said the Heritage-based curriculum, coupled with the establishment of innovation hubs, is expected to redefine Zimbabwes educational landscape, nurturing a generation of learners equipped to thrive in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.\n\nWe have established innovation hubs in several schools across the provinces. In Victoria Falls, for instance, three schools now have innovation hubs, and more are in Harare and other areas, he said.\n\nWe want our students to dream big, discover new knowledge, and address real-world challenges. The goal is to inculcate critical thinking and problem-solving skills, enabling learners to invent new technologies and solutions pivotal for development, he said.\n\nMinister Torerayi Moyo\n\nThe Heritage-Based Curriculum integrates local culture and history with modern educational practices, encouraging students to research community-specific challenges and develop solutions.\n\nThis approach aligns with Zimbabwes broader National Development Goals and Vision 2030, which prioritise innovation and sustainable development.\n\nThese initiatives are part of a larger national strategy to promote innovation in education. By preparing our students to think critically and solve problems creatively, we are positioning Zimbabwe to achieve its developmental aspirations, said Minister Moyo.\n\nThe Government is also keen to overhaul vocational training programmes so that students have the skills needed for their future careers.\n\nThe Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education has pointed to schools like St Columbas High School in Bulawayo as an example of the practical benefits of this educational model.\n\nLearners at St Columbas are not only acquiring valuable skills but also learning to monetise these abilities even before completing Form 4.\n\nThe objective is to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to embark on their careers immediately upon completing their education, thereby transforming them from job seekers to job creators.\n\nMinister Moyo said several schools have already begun producing learners who possess problem-solving skills, which is proof to the effectiveness of this new educational approach.\n\n",
