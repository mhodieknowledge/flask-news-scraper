She subsequently made additional payments totalling US$4,950, and they signed a sales agreement for the stand.\n\nIn a statement, Inspector Nomalanga Msebele said that on 25 January, the complainant visited the stand she had purchased and discovered a foundation already dug there. A neighbour informed her that the stand actually belonged to someone in South Africa.\n\nAfter confirming with the real owner, she questioned the accused, who provided an unsatisfactory response. A police report was filed, but the accused has not yet been arrested. The total loss is US$6,350, with no recovery.\n\nPolice urge the public to verify the authenticity of agents before making transactions to avoid financial loss and to seek any information leading to the accuseds arrest, said Inspector Msebele.\n\n",

            "content": "Lubelihle Mathe,[emailprotected]\n\nIn the world of spoken word, a new voice is making waves  meet Bradley Nsukuzokuduma Moyo. At just 21 years old, this talented and creative poet is leaving audiences captivated with his compelling verses and profound storytelling.\n\nBorn in September 2003 at Alexandra Clinic in South Africa, Moyo, the eldest of three siblings, relocated to Zimbabwe, where he was raised by his grandparents in Sizinda suburb in Bulawayo.\n\nHis creativity was nurtured early by his grandfather, a railway worker who introduced him to painting. Tragically, his grandfather passed away when he was still young. Reflecting on his childhood, Moyo shared, I grew up in Sizinda under the care of my grandparents, and my grandfather, a cultured man, taught me painting. His passing was a huge loss.\n\nBradley attended Intunta Primary School in Sizinda, where he was part of the school choir and discovered his love for music. He later moved to Ihlathi High School, where he joined the debate club and continued singing tenor whenever there were opportunities to form a choir. Raised in a Christian home, he actively participated in the Scripture Union Club and eventually became its president. Additionally, he captained the first aid team while excelling academically.\n\nGrowing up, I transitioned from being a naughty kid to a reserved and outspoken one, he said.\n\nThis newfound confidence allowed him to participate in workshops like those hosted by the Higher Life Foundation. These experiences broadened his perspective on the arts, especially as he struggled with science subjects like Chemistry and Physics.\n\nI used to love Biology, but numbers were not my strength, so I shifted to Arts, he explained.\n\nMoyo sought to explore other creative outlets beyond music, experimenting with unique art forms such as writing extracts, short stories, and poetry.\n\nMusic has always been a part of me, but because it was what everyone was doing, I wanted something different, he said.\n\nAfter completing his O-levels, Moyo pursued A-levels at Milton High School, where he discovered a passion for literature, particularly poetry. A turning point in his life came when he lost his best friend, a tragedy that inspired him to channel his grief into poetry. This led to the creation of his first book, Thalitha Koumi: The Prayers We Never Say.\n\nSince then, Moyo has remained steadfast in his poetry journey, achieving numerous milestones in 2024. He was nominated twice in the Third Edition of the Poetry Red Carpet Awards for Best Page Poet and Best Promising Poet. Additionally, he secured second runner-up in the Dreams Discovery Publishers Awards under the Best English Poetry category. These accolades motivated him to publish Thalitha Koumi, which is now available on the market.\n\nThe artist envisions a future where his work amplifies the voices of Africans, particularly the black majority, Ndebele people, and youth.\n\nI address a lot of issues. What I can say is I am a conscious writer passionate about telling the stories of Africans, blacks, Ndebele people, and young people, he explained.\n\nHe is now focused on creating more poetry and short stories that highlight these narratives.\n\n",
