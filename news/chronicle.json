We remain anchored on our national philosophy, Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatirwa nevene vayo/ Ilizwe, lakhiwa, libuswe likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said through the theme of this years National Thanksgiving and Dedication Service, the Church in Zimbabwe is rallying the nation to progressive, Godly and Biblical patriotism.\n\nIndeed, the land, Zimbabwe, which the Lord has given us, is an exceedingly good land. We are thankful to the Almighty God.\n\nFurther, development initiatives and programmes for the upliftment and prosperity of our people, have become the solid foundation upon which we are building our country brick by brick and stone upon stone, he said.\n\nThe President said the people of Zimbabwe are their own liberators and using their indigenous resources, skills and talents, they will uplift the nation while others are welcome to assist them.\n\nIn the agriculture sector, as a Government and a people, we are not folding our arms and surrendering to the vagaries of climate change. Numerous dams are being built and boreholes sunk to mitigate the impact of climate change.\n\nIn relation to the current uneven rainfall patterns, Let us ask for rain from the Lord, for it is the Almighty God who makes storm clouds and gives showers of rain to everyone (Zachariah Chapter 10 verse 1), he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the nation also thanks the Almighty God for the rapid modernisation and expansion of the infrastructure and increased inflows of economic investments, diaspora remittances, which are having transformational impacts on economic growth.\n\nIn his address to the last Cabinet meeting of 2024, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe had achieved many milestones in various areas such as infrastructure development, stabilising the local currency and developing the mining, agricultural and manufacturing sectors.\n\nIt is expected that more achievements would be recorded this year as the country moves towards attaining Vision 2030 of an empowered upper middle income society.\n\n",

            "content": "Chronicle Writers\n\nSCORES of traders operating at Haddon and Sly Building and Amaya Mall in Bulawayos central business district were locked out yesterday after the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) closed the premises as part of a nationwide blitz targeting smuggled goods and counterfeit products.\n\nThe operation, part of a multi-agency initiative, aims to curb smuggling and unethical business practices to safeguard local industries and consumer welfare.The Government has undertaken the exercise to safeguard local industries and promote consumer welfare.\n\nThe multi-agency operation, which began two weeks ago, targets entertainment spots, liquor vendors and businesses trading in contraband, counterfeit products, or engaging in unethical practices.\n\nRetail outlets and sprouting lettable shops are also subjected to impromptu inspections, where shop owners are asked to provide documentation proving their stock was imported legally.\n\nThose failing to comply face steep fines and seizure of merchandise. Last week, KidsMart, a popular retail outlet in Bulawayo was closed by authorities only to resume operations days later.\n\nSeveral night spots have also been temporarily closed.\n\nYesterday, a Chronicle news crew observed scores of Haddon and Sly traders milling outside the building with several security guards manning entry points.In interviews, traders said they have lost considerable business while their clients have been inconvenienced.\n\nThey indicated they are in talks with Zimra officials to map a way forward.\n\nThe building houses mobile and accessory shops, gaming, electricals, salons, gift shops, clothing stores, and a restaurant.\n\nI trade in mobile phones and related accessories. I had clients who were meant to collect their handsets today (Tuesday) but when I came this morning, I found the building closed, said one trader who declined to be named.\n\nWhile some clients understand the situation others are demanding their gadgets back. One trader said she had to refund some of her clients who had booked for hairdos.\n\nI was alerted by other traders that the building has been closed. So, I had to make arrangements to refund some of my clients. We have not yet been told when the building will be re-opened, she said.\n\nMs Regina Chinamasa\n\nZimra Commissioner-General Ms Regina Chinamasa said the ongoing initiative is meant to create an even playing field for economic players.\n\nThis is an ongoing initiative, which we have just started. The minister of finance mentioned that all imported products will be deemed smuggled if they dont have proper documentation.\n\nWhat we are doing is engagement to make sure that everyone complies with tax and duty requirements, she said. In terms of counterfeit products, Ms Chinamasa said there is an inter-ministerial task force that has been set to tackle the issue.\n\nThere are fake medicines, fake beer, fake lotions, and fake clothes among other things. The task force is being led by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. If those goods find their way into the country, we will get there and demand our dues in terms of tax and import duty, she said.\n\nWhen we seize counterfeit products, we destroy them. This crackdown is meant to create an even playing field for economic players.\n\nEdgars Stores chief executive officer, Mr Sevious Mushosho, lauded the crackdown, saying it supports formal businesses while boosting Government revenue.This action by Zimra is welcome as it allows formal businesses to thrive while the Government earns more revenue. The informal sector is killing real business and not helping the Government fund development, he said.\n\nNational University of Science and Technology (Nust) economics lecturer, Mr Stevenson Dlamini said the initiative reflects the Governments commitment to enforcing tax laws.\n\nThis initiative sends a strong message about the Governments commitment to combating smuggling and tax evasion. This approach is likely to deter defiance of tax laws and encourage greater adherence to legal obligations, he said.\n\nIn a recent statement, Industry and Commerce Minister, Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, said the task force was geared towards promoting ethical business practices and safeguarding the economy.\n\nGovernment, through this task force, is utilising a whole-of-Government approach to address the rampant business malpractices, which have a negative impact on consumer welfare, he said.\n\nSuch malpractices also pose a very serious threat to the viability of our local manufacturing industry, thus affecting employment levels and job creation.\n\nMinister Ndlovu said the primary objective of the compliance inspections is to ensure businesses operate following established laws, regulations, and industry standards, thereby safeguarding consumer welfare and maintaining a level playing field for all business players.\n\nPresenting the 2025 National Budget, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube, decried the proliferation of smuggled goods in the market.\n\nSpeaking during discussions on the 2025 National Budget, Prof Ncube highlighted the adverse effects of smuggling on local production and revenue collection.\n\nHe said non-declaration of goods constitutes a criminal offence in Zimbabwe, encompassing items purchased abroad, personal belongings, and goods intended for commercial purposes.\n\nThis national programme is targeting businesses engaging in practices such as using parallel market exchange rates and selling counterfeit, underweight, or unlabelled goods, said Prof Ncube.\n\nHe said smuggling considerably hampers local production initiatives, disrupts value chains, and creates an uneven playing field between locally produced and smuggled foreign products, ultimately undermining Government revenue collection mechanisms.\n\nHe said as part of the crackdown, 24-hour roadblocks will be mounted along major highways leading into major cities, with multi-agency teams inspecting vehicles suspected of transporting smuggled goods.\n\nConfederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) president, Dr Denford Mutashu, commended the crackdown as a measure to protect consumers and local industries.We are working with security services to make sure that sanity prevails. These smuggled goods are harmful to consumer health, he said.\n\nAs an association, we warn businesses that smuggling is an offence, they have to abide by the law. Any businesses found on the wrong side of the law must face the consequences.\n\nDr Mutashu said smuggled goods such as electronics, detergents, and foodstuff, among others, are negatively affecting local industries.\n\n",

            "content": "AS we bid farewell to 2024, we stand in awe of the resilience and fortitude of the Zimbabwean people. The past year has been a challenging one, with droughts and water shortages making life harder for all of us.\n\nThroughout it all, Zimbabweans have endured with patience and stoicism, a testament to the strength of our national spirit.\n\nOne of the major challenges that we faced in 2024 was the shortage of water. Prolonged droughts had led to a significant reduction in the water levels of our main supply dams, causing a crippling water shortage in many areas.\n\nThis shortage affected not only our daily lives, but also businesses and industries that rely on water to function. The agricultural sector, which is a major source of income for many Zimbabweans, suffered greatly, with crop yields falling due to drought.\n\nDespite these difficulties, however, Zimbabweans remained undeterred. Another challenge that we had to face was the issue of load shedding.\n\nThe low water levels in Kariba Dam, which supplies much of the countrys electricity, meant that there was little water to generate power.\n\nThis led to prolonged load shedding, where power cuts were implemented to conserve energy. This was yet another obstacle that Zimbabweans had to overcome.\n\nDespite this disruption to our daily routines, we continued to soldier on, finding ways to adapt and make the best of the situation.\n\nWe must applaud the Government for its efforts in mitigating the impact of the drought and water shortages. The Government sunk boreholes in affected areas.\n\nAs we welcome the new year, we do so with a sense of optimism. We are hopeful that the rainfall forecast for 2025 will be good and that we will be able to avoid the water shortages and load shedding that plagued us in 2024.\n\nWe also hope that the various sectors of the economy that were affected by the drought will be able to bounce back quickly and that we can move forward with renewed vigour and positivity.\n\nBut as we look ahead to the brighter days that 2025 may bring, let us not forget the lessons that we have learned from the challenges of the past year. Let us continue to be resilient and to face any difficulties that come our way with grace and determination.\n\nLet us work together as a nation to overcome any obstacles that may arise, and to build a brighter future for ourselves and for future generations.\n\nMay 2025 be a year of renewed hope, prosperity, and good fortune for us all.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\n",

They completed a second league and cup double for the club in 2001 after the 1990 one in which a Peter Ndlovu, Rahman Gumbo, Mercedes Sibanda, Alexander Maseko, Benjamin Mpofu, Dumisani Nyoni, Andrew Shue and Peter Nkomo-inspired Bosso shot down all before it to write itself a piece of history.\n\nIt was the first Bosso league title since 1974. Yesterday afternoon turned out to be a great reunion as the boys went down memory lane and reminded each other of their playing days incidents on and off the field.\n\nThere were quite some light moments where they would occasionally burst into laughter. Emmett Ndlovu who gave the club 25 years of service and is now in church ministry, chaired the proceedings.\n\nHe emphasised that the meeting was just a get-together organised by the players who wanted to catch up and find out what each one of them went on to do after retiring.\n\nIntelligent and skillful former striker with 12 plus goals per season over four years at Bosso, Thabani Masawi, took everyone by surprise when he said he had not been active in the game since retiring in the later stages of the millenniums first decade.Masawi said he would love to be Highlanders chairman.\n\nMaybe the problem is I dont know why we are gathered here. I have not been active in football but I want to be Highlanders chairman one day, said Masawi.\n\nThe convenor, Ndlovu said if his dream is to become a reality, Masawi has to get club membership first.\n\nYou have to be a life member. You need to buy a life membership card and carry it in your pocket until the right time. You played for the club and you are popular, said Ndlovu.\n\nThe former players also spoke of their times on the field when Zenzo Moyo would be upfield and calling for the ball and shouting at players like Mubariki Chisoni to play the ball forward.\n\nIn one instance Moyo shouted at the defenders and when Chisoni in the next move pumped the ball forward, Moyo scored.\n\nIn yet another incident Moyo shouted at Bekithemba Ndlovu: You are keeping possession at the back yet you do not even have the skill.\n\nIt was all laughter, a great time to connect attended by even the club chairman Kenneth Mhlophe, his deputy Fiso Siziba and committee member, Kindman Ndlovu.\n\nOf the class of 1998 were Moyo, Masawi, Siza Khoza, Melusi Ndebele, Melusi Sibanda, Noel Cele and Ndumiso Vundla, who has since lost his sight.\n\nWhat surprised many was that he could still identify some of his teammates and this writer from their voices. He also reminded them how Dazzy Kapenya used to chop their legs at training making it hard for them to break into the first team.\n\nMoyo and Emmett encouraged their mates not to concentrate on coaching jobs but to consider other jobs as well. Kindman, the committee member, said the club is grateful to have such a thoughtful group.\n\nHe said Highlanders stands to benefit from them and encouraged some even to assist in player recruitment as they have a fair appreciation of the clubs expectations and culture.\n\nAt the end of the catching up, the players presented the club with five match balls for the juniors, bought out of contributions made by the Bosso players of 1998.\n\nAmong some of the players who did not make it were Simon Sibanda, Alexander Phiri, Methembe Ndlovu, Thamsanqa Vundla, Noel Kaseke and Pope Moyo.\n\nSpeaking after the formalities and lunch, Highlanders chairman Mhlophe said it was good to see players, remembering where they came from.\n\nThis is good to see our sons returning to regroup within the institution and giving us some cheer. They are very much part of the teams legacy and they will always be welcome. It is an honour to have them remember us as an institution, said Mhlophe.\n\n",

With the capital secured, we are equipped to accelerate the next phase of our exploration and development activities at the Cabora Bassa Project.\n\nWe remain committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders and contributing to Zimbabwes energy independence and economic growth, he said.\n\nThe second tranche of the placement raised US$3,5 million, with Invictus issuing 53 030 303 new shares. Due to strong demand, the company accepted an additional US$2,065 million in over-subscriptions and issued 31 298 025 additional shares under the same terms.\n\nParticipants in the placement will also have the option to acquire one additional share for every four shares subscribed, exercisable at AUD$0,30 over two years.\n\nThe first tranche of the placement, partially underwritten by Mutapa Investment Fund, was completed in August 2024.This historic investment enables Zimbabwean investors to hold and trade securities in Invictus Energy through its secondary listing on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Cabora Bassa Project is expected to play a critical role in addressing energy supply challenges in the SADC region.Beyond achieving energy self-sufficiency, the project positions Zimbabwe as a potential exporter of excess electricity.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has highlighted additional benefits from the oil and gas discoveries, including the production of liquefied petroleum gas, fertiliser and petrochemicals. These developments align with Zimbabwes broader economic growth and industrialisation goals.\n\nFollowing the successful exploration drilling conducted at Mukuyu-1 and Mukuyu-2 wells in Mbire, Invictus is continuing further test drilling at its Musuma prospective area in Dande this year.\n\nIt is believed that the ongoing investment will yield significant new employment opportunities in the petroleum sector and overall jobs will be created once extraction commences in primary production, midstream (pipelines and storage) and downstream (gas-to-electricity, gas-to-fuel) industries.\n\n",

            "content": "Sikhumbuzo Moyo,[emailprotected]\n\nPOLICE in Bulawayo have sounded the alarm on the wrongful use of firecrackers during the New Years celebrations.\n\nBoth the police and the citys fire brigade have highlighted safety concerns and the potential legal consequences of mishandling these explosive devices. Residents have been reminded that firecrackers come with strict regulations aimed at preventing accidents, injuries,and fires.\n\nAlthough fireworks have gained traction in Zimbabwe over the years, the authorities have maintained careful regulations to ensure safety. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where fireworks are primarily associated with Guy Fawkes Night celebrated on November 5, in Zimbabwe, theyre mainly linked to New Years Eve celebrations. However, authorities have voiced anxieties over the safety of individuals, particularly children, who are often left unchecked with firecrackers, unaware of the dangers they pose.\n\nBulawayo chief fire officer, Mr Mhlangano Moyo, has warned that firecrackers can cause fire outbreaks due to improper handling. He has urged the public to be responsible and use fireworks with great caution, mindful of the potential hazards.\n\nFireworks are explosive devices that are inherently dangerous. They require careful handling to prevent accidents. According to the Urban Councils Act (Chapter 29:15) Third Schedule, combustible materials and explosives are prohibited in public spaces. Additionally, Section 9 of the City of Bulawayo Fire Brigade bylaws specifically prohibits the discharge of fireworks in public areas, he said.\n\nMr Moyo said individuals wishing to use fireworks must first obtain approval from relevant authorities and ensure that their use is limited to designated areas.In cases of large-scale celebrations, the chief fire officer must inspect the premises and surrounding areas before authorising fireworks displays.\n\nSection 9 of the bylaws also prohibits the discharge of fireworks in ways that could endanger people, animals, vehicles, property, or the environment. It further bans the public display or sale of fireworks in unsafe locations.\n\nIn 2019, the Bulawayo fire brigade responded to an incident in Hillside East, where fireworks caused a house fire after the flying embers landed on the roof of a neighbouring home.\n\nMr Moyo said people must refrain from using fireworks without permission.\n\nNever use fireworks while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and avoid carrying fireworks in your pockets. They must also avoid purchasing fireworks packaged in brown paper, as this often indicates they are intended for professional displays, which increases the risk of danger, he warned.\n\nMr Moyo also stated that children should never be allowed to play with or ignite fireworks, highlighting tragic incidents such as the death of a 13-year-old boy in Masvingo in December 2012 after he was injured by a firecracker and a similar incident in Gweru in 2011 where a 10-year-old boy suffered eye injuries.\n\nIn another tragic event, a toddler from Harare lost his eye in 2011 when a firecracker exploded in his face. These incidents underscore the inherent dangers of fireworks, particularly when mishandled or used irresponsibly.\n\nThe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) has also raised concerns about the distress fireworks cause to pets and wildlife. The SPCA urged people to consider the impact of fireworks on animals, which can suffer from extreme anxiety due to the loud noises.\n\nPlease be mindful and secure your pets before the New Years celebrations. They need comfort and safety. Plan ahead and be responsible. Fireworks have devastating effects on animals. Please lets work together, the SPCA said in a statement posted on their Facebook page.\n\nFor pet owners, the SPCA recommended creating a safe and comfortable space for pets, such as a crate or a quiet room, and leaving them with a trusted person if they plan to attend celebrations.\n\nThey also advise closing doors and windows to dampen the noise and using soothing music to counter the loud bangs from fireworks. Close doors and windows to muffle loud sounds and remove visual stimulants. Use soothing music to cancel out the loud bangs coming from fireworks and always clear your house and the yard from any fireworks debris, reads the SPCA statement.\n\nBulawayo provincial police acting spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Nomalanga Msebele, advised residents to report any illegal sale or use of firecrackers. She also assured residents of increased patrols to enforce the regulations during the festive period.\n\nAsst Insp Msebele said anyone wishing to use fireworks must obtain permission from the appropriate authorities, such as the council.\n\nFailure to comply with the law will result in police intervention. Past incidents, particularly involving children, have shown the dangers of firecrackers, including fires and injuries, she said\n\n",

Most people have high hopes as they look forward to achieving better and greater things in the new year.\n\nIn the arts sector, Chronicle Showbiz spoke to some significant figures who have shared their plans for 2025. Among these is playwright and director Raisedon Baya, who shared that 2025 will be about ensuring that their works reach more people:As we enter the new year, we aim to reach out to more people through our stories. We also plan to bring back the Bulawayo Arts Awards, which we did not have in 2024.\n\nThe reason we stopped is that we did not have enough resources, as we wanted to deliver work that matches the standard. Without resources, we cant do anything; we cannot present poor quality, such as changing to a cheaper venue. We have to keep moving upwards instead of downwards. So, from tomorrow, we start running around chasing our 2025 targets, he said.\n\nMusician, Vuyo Brown also shared that she will be very busy in the coming year:I am releasing a new song in the first days of January. I also have a lot planned, which I can only reveal as the year progresses. I will surely send press releases in due course, said Vuyo.\n\nThaluso Da Poet said that the coming year will be an interesting one:Starting the year with the 21 February Poetry Album launch, even though this year it will be slightly different and more powerful and interesting than the previous two years.\n\nMany collaborations are on the cards with different artistes and groups. I have also started making poetry videos, just like musicians do. I would like to promote poetry through visuals. Ive made professional poetry videos so far, so there will be more poetry videos from Thaluso Da Poet in 2025. Already, there is a poem video before we get to the February 21, Annual project.\n\nThere is already a new style of writing, which includes different languages that will fit the targeted audience for the end-of-year poem. I recited some lines in Shona, targeting a wider audience with my performance, and I have already started putting lines in Kalanga, Venda and Sotho. The aim is to have everyone feel incorporated into the art.\n\nIm also focusing on poetry from all corners of life: economically, socially, religiously and politically.\n\nRaisedon Baya\n\nPastor Barak also highlighted that he is releasing something new for the year ahead:\n\nI am working hard in the studio, preparing my fifth album, which will be released by March.\n\nThe album, Uphakeme, follows up on a string of my notable works, including Jerusalem, Yimi Lo, Wavuma, Bayethe and Hlala La.\n\nUphakeme features tracks such as Chidadiso, Zungikhumbule Nkosi, Jesus is Mine, Rudo rwaJesu, Uphakeme, Hell Make a Way, Hlala La and a wedding track, Sizobashadisa.\n\nIt has taken me some time to release this powerful compilation, as all the songs are a response to my personal life experiences, said Pastor Barak.\n\n",

Ervine and his Afghanistan counterpart Hashmatullah Shahidi decided to shake hands on day five with the Chevrons on 142/4.Ervine was full of praise for his teams good performance.\n\nThe way the guys batted was very good. The intent was there. There are bad balls that the guys put away so there was never really a moment where we felt like guys were getting lazy on the field. We fielded for 200 overs and today we saw Sean Williams diving.\n\nThe energy that everybody had throughout the five days was exceptional. And the bowlers showed a lot of patience on a surface that didnt offer a great deal. A lot of credit has to go to them. Blessing Muzarabani was leading from the front, bowling 20-odd overs for 52 runs was outstanding, said Ervine.\n\nThe skipper also showered 21-year-old Brian Bennett who picked up five wickets and scored a 100 runs.\n\nTheres a lot of positives to take out. Brian Bennett getting a hundred in his second Test, the way he batted was really good. The guys batted really well, kept things nice and simple, keeping the good ball out and put the bad ball away, he said.\n\nZimbabwe played day five without Blessing Muzarabani and Newman Nyamhuri. Ervine said the fast bowling duo was rested for the final day as they were unwell and they had to try and manage them for the New Years Day Test.\n\nThey are all fine. Blessing was struggling with a bit of flu and a bit of dizziness so we didnt want to push them too much, especially knowing that we have two days between now and the next Test match. Newman was struggling with his stomach for a few days.\n\nBowling out there really takes so much energy and when youre not 100 percent fit, it drains a lot of energy from you. We thought those guys may just as well rest and make sure that when it comes the next Test they are fresh and energetic, said Ervine.\n\nHe also confirmed that Richard Ngarava, who was rested for the Boxing Day Test will be available for the second one.\n\nRichard Ngarava will be back for the second Test and the guys that played the first Test, over the next day or two, have to manage how they recover and we will make that decision on the match day, said Ervine.\n\nPrior to the recently ended game, which was a draw, the country had hosted only one Boxing Day Test, when Zimbabwe faced England in 1996 in a drawn match severely affected by rain at Harare Sports Club.\n\nSince then, Zimbabwes only other Boxing Day Tests have been played away from home  against New Zealand in Wellington in 2000 and against South Africa in the inaugural pink-ball, day-night, four-day Test in Port Elizabeth in 2017.\n\nZimbabwe also played Sri Lanka in a Test that started on December 27, 2001, in Colombo.
