            "content": "Sikhumbuzo Moyo,[emailprotected]\n\nA TRUCK carrying Presidential Input Scheme seeds meant for Ward Seven in Tsholotsho district, Matabeleland North province, has been missing since last week.\n\nAn extension officer from the Agriculture and Rural Development Advisory Services (ARDAS) and a Grain Marketing Board (GMB) employee are reportedly on the run.\n\nAuthorities believe the incident is part of a seed diversion scam involving a police officer who accompanied the consignment when it departed from the GMB Tsholotsho depot earlier this month.\n\nA memo from the intelligence unit, seen by this publication, indicates that Ward Seven extension officer Ms Kwanele Dube and GMB contract employee Mr Langton Ncube disappeared after the truck, loaded with 400 bags of 50kg Urea fertiliser, 30 bags of 10kg sunflower seeds, and 100 bottles of 200ml Imidacloprid chemicals, failed to reach its destination after leaving the GMB depot on 4 January 2025.\n\nThe Presidential inputs, which were supposed to be distributed in Ward Seven, Patalika, on 4 January 2025, were diverted to an unknown destination and were not delivered. The consignment comprised 400 x 50kg Urea fertiliser, 30 x 10kg sunflower seeds, and 100 x 200ml Imidacloprid chemicals.\n\nThe main suspects are Kwanele Elena Alanna Dube, Ward Seven Agritex extension officer, and Langton Ncube, a GMB contract employee. Both are on the run. Additionally, Abisinjo Mpofu, a police officer stationed at ZRP Tsholotsho, is implicated.\n\nNo arrests have been made so far. Investigations revealed that the inputs were not recorded in the provisional dispatcher book because it was full. Consequently, the inputs never reached their destination. The suspects flight and the unsigned dispatcher book present challenges in recovering the inputs, while the police officer appears to be distancing himself from the case, the memo states.\n\nTsholotsho district development coordinator, Mr Aaron Gono, confirmed the matter but stated that he was yet to receive a full briefing.\n\nIt is reported that on 3 January 2025, ARDAS officer for Ward Seven, Kwanele Dube, booked GMB for the collection of the inputs for her ward the following day. The GMB manager agreed.\n\nOn 4 January, she arrived to collect the inputs, and the truck was loaded and cleared by acting GMB supervisor Langton Ncube. It is also reported that an unidentified police officer was present to accompany the truck. The truck departed on the same day.\n\nThe GMB depot manager received a call from the Presidents Office on Monday, 6 January, informing her that the truck never reached its destination. Investigations by ZRP began shortly thereafter. The whereabouts of Ms Dube and Mr Ncube remain unknown. Investigations are ongoing, reads a memo from Mr Gono addressed to Matabeleland North Acting Director of Local Government Services, Mr Tapiwa Zivovoi.\n\n",

            "content": "Nqobile Tshili,[emailprotected]\n\nCHIEF Justice Luke Malaba has called for enhanced collaboration among stakeholders in the justice delivery system, emphasising that the judiciary alone cannot build public confidence without the support of the entire criminal justice value chain.\n\nSpeaking at the historic official opening of the 2025 legal year in Bulawayo yesterday, Chief Justice Malaba highlighted the establishment of the National Council on Administration of the Criminal Justice System as a critical step towards expediting criminal trials and fostering co-operation.\n\nFor the first time, the opening ceremony was held outside Harare, marking a significant shift in the judiciarys approach to inclusivity and decentralisation. This aligns with the Governments National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) and the Second Republics commitment to devolution.\n\nThe event, held under the theme: Building Public Confidence in the Judiciary through Multi-Stakeholder Participation, began with the inspection of the quarter guard, followed by Chief Justice Malaba addressing members of the bench, service chiefs and other key stakeholders.\n\nChief Justice Malaba stressed that an effective justice system requires the seamless co-operation of various stakeholders, including the police, prosecutors, witnesses and correctional services.\n\nWhile the judiciary plays a central role in the administration of justice, it must be acknowledged that there are various other stakeholders who play critical roles in the proper functioning of the justice delivery system, he said.\n\nA breakdown in any part of this chain, whether its a failure to arrest suspects, lapses in prosecution, or the absence of witnesses, can derail the entire process and erode public confidence in the judiciary.\n\nThe newly established council, chaired by Judge President, Justice Maria Zimba-Dube, and including Prosecutor-General, Justice Loice Matanda-Moyo, aims to address these gaps by expediting criminal trials in both magistrates and high courts.\n\nChief Justice Malaba also called for the revitalisation of community service and pre-trial diversion committees, emphasising their importance in reducing case backlogs and improving access to justice.\n\nThe Chief Justice reaffirmed the judiciarys commitment to accountability, noting that the performance of courts and judicial officers is closely monitored through the JSC performance management system.\n\nAchieving this goal requires a shared commitment to fulfilling our constitutional obligations that underpin the administration of justice. The active participation and collaboration of the judiciary and its stakeholders is essential, as without this collective effort, fostering public trust in the judiciary will remain unattainable, he said.\n\nThe judiciary must remain exemplary, not only in its professional duties but also in the personal conduct of its officers. Judicial misconduct, if left unchecked, can undermine the public trust that is foundational to our justice system.\n\nChief Justice Malaba said public confidence in the judiciary hinges on its efficiency, impartiality and adherence to constitutional principles.\n\nThis means that the judiciarys overall performance is subject to the evaluation of the people of Zimbabwe. As a judiciary, we acknowledge that we cannot build public confidence and trust in isolation.\n\nAchieving the delivery of quality justice is possible only through collaboration and partnership with all stakeholders within the justice sector, said Chief Justice Malaba.\n\nHe said the conduct and manner in which each public institution carries out its mandate directly influences the level of confidence in the public sphere.\n\nThe principle of public confidence is, therefore, a broad constitutional principle that governs the actions and conduct of all public officials, including judges, magistrates and other individuals presiding over courts established under Zimbabwean law, said Chief Justice Malaba.\n\nThe public confidence in the judiciary is reflected in the publics belief in the efficiency, fairness and impartiality of the courts, in adherence to the rule of law, and in the protection of human rights and freedoms.\n\nThe Chief Justice said JSC will continue to implement policies and measures that safeguard judicial independence in decision-making while ensuring accountability to the public for its rulings.\n\nHe said the measures include the rigorous monitoring of court and judicial officer performance through JSCs performance management system.\n\nChief Justice Malaba said while it is impossible to entirely prevent misconduct, given human fallibility, JSC has established mechanisms to ensure that its errant members are held to account.\n\nIt is for that reason that the commission has taken a firm stance against corruption and judicial misconduct. If it is not nipped in the bud, judicial misconduct has the potential to undermine the very fabric upon which the public trust exists between the judiciary and the citizens is created, said Chief Justice Malaba.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction with the judiciarys integrity, noting that no misconduct charges were brought against judges in the previous year.\n\nChief Justice Malaba concluded by reiterating the judiciarys dedication to safeguarding judicial independence while fostering partnerships to deliver quality justice.\n\nThe active participation and collaboration of all stakeholders in the justice sector are indispensable for building public trust and ensuring the effective delivery of justice, he said. @nqotshili\n\n",

The AU Assembly aims to bolster transparency and meritocracy in the leadership selection process, prioritising equitable regional representation, gender parity and recruitment of top talent from across the African continent.\n\nMr Odinga said he had been touring many countries in Africa to garner support for his candidature and after Zimbabwe, he will visit other Southern Africa countries.\n\nHe stressed that African countries are facing similar challenges that should be tackled collectively.\n\nWe have shared experiences with other nations, we know where we are coming from, where we want to go. But Africa will only be developed by Africans themselves. We must have a clear roadmap and blueprint on how to develop Africa.We have 55 States in Africa, we are looking at how these countries can be integrated so that we benefit from the resources that we have in our continent, said Mr Odinga.\n\nHe added that the continent has a young population, which could drive transformation of the continent. The new AU Commission chair will be elected by the AU Assembly via a secret ballot on February 25 at the 38th AU Summit set for Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\nPast chairpersons of the AU Commission have come from the AUs western, central and southern regions, hence the AU Executive Councils intervention to assert the right of the East African region to produce the next chairperson while North Africa will fill the deputy chairpersons post.\n\n",

The JSC has resolved that the process will commence in January 2025. Given the size of the magistrates department, a phased approach will be adopted, starting with Mashonaland Central and Matabeleland North provinces, said Chief Justice Malaba.\n\nHe noted that the system, already operational for case reviews, appeals, civil and criminal matters in superior courts, has significantly improved efficiency and increased public confidence in the judiciary.\n\nChief Justice Malaba urged the public and stakeholders to embrace the electronic management of cases, aligning with global trends. He announced the establishment of an IECMS review committee to assess the systems efficiency and address any challenges.\n\nThe successful implementation of the IECMS has attracted interest from neighbouring countries, including Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and Namibia. Namibia has gone a step further by signing a memorandum of understanding with Zimbabwe to adopt the system.\n\nWe also wish to extend the judiciarys gratitude to all stakeholders in the justice delivery system, including members of the public, for their unwavering support during the rollout of the IECMS in the superior courts.\n\nAs expected with a project of such national significance, challenges arose, but through co-operation and resilience, we overcame them, he said.\n\nChief Justice Luke Malaba greets Judges during the official opening of the 2025 legal year in Bulawayo yesterday\n\nChief Justice Malaba said over time, public confidence in the IECMS has grown, and more litigants now rely on the system.\n\nStakeholders are therefore encouraged to maintain this positive momentum as we expand the IECMS to the busiest courts, the magistrates courts, he said.\n\nThe JSC has made strides in decentralising courts to improve access to justice in remote areas. In 2024, five new regional courts were established in Kwekwe, Mutoko, Zvishavane, Mbare, and Guruve.\n\nTen resident magistrates courts were also opened in Triangle, Kotwa, Shamva, Banket, Beatrice, Mabvuku, Chinamora, Nembudziya and Wedza.\n\nSome of these courts are already operational, while others will open in the first term of the legal year. In Matabeleland South, a new resident court was designated for Brunapeg, and land has been secured for its construction, said Chief Justice Malaba.Additionally, circuit courts were set up in Lusulu and Siabuwa in Binga and Cashel Valley, Mahusekwa.\n\nIn total, the JSC established five regional courts, 10 resident magistrates courts and four circuit courts in 2024. Furthermore, two new courthouses were commissioned to enhance access to justice, said Chief Justice Malaba.\n\nChief Justice Malaba highlighted the JSCs achievements in 2024, including the commissioning of new courthouses in Chiredzi and Triangle, reducing travel distances for residents. Chegutu Magistrates Court was renovated, adding an extra courtroom and three offices.\n\nIn the coming months, the JSC anticipates considerable progress to be attained on the following construction projects: Judicial Training Institute of Zimbabwe, Training Centre, Gwanda Court Complex, Mutawatawa Magistrates Court, Mbare Magistrates Courts, Cowdray Park Magistrates Court and Kwekwe Magistrates Court, said Chief Justice Malaba.\n\nHe said the ongoing developments demonstrate the JSCs commitment to improving justice delivery across the country. @nqotshili\n\n",

Non-compliant traders face heavy fines and the seizure of merchandise.\n\nThis blitz will cover every shop, so all traders must regularise their operations. The operation is here to stay, said Mrs Kuture.\n\nShe outlined the procedures for importing and exporting goods, explaining that commercial imports by road must be pre-cleared before arriving at the border. Rates of duty are listed in the Tariff Handbook HS 2022 SI 203 of 2022.\n\nWhen importers complete their purchases and have consignments ready, they should liaise with their clearing agents, who will handle the clearance and duty payment. At the border, we expect the clearing agent to have all the necessary paperwork ready for processing, she explained.\n\nMrs Kuture added that traders must retain their import documentation, such as bills of entry, for at least six years. Failure to provide these documents during post-clearance audits could result in penalties, including shop closures or confiscation of goods until duty is paid.\n\nShe also advised traders to familiarise themselves with customs duty rates, which vary depending on the nature of the goods. Some products, such as blankets, second-hand clothing, agricultural items and certain furniture, require import licences.\n\nBefore importing goods, consult Zimra to understand the necessary requirements. Some products, like expired or hazardous items, skin-lightening lotions and certain medicinal products, are restricted to protect public health and the economy, said Mrs Kuture.\n\nStakeholders follow proceedings during a Gwanda Business Association breakfast engagement meeting on Friday\n\nThe breakfast meeting, held under the theme Unlocking Business Opportunities in Gwanda in 2025: Trends, Insights, and Strategies, provided a platform for traders to raise concerns.\n\nGwanda Business Association chairperson, Mr Thomas Gwatida, said the meeting was crucial in addressing issues such as Zimras new systems, including TaRMS, FDMS, QR Code and HS Code, as well as the ongoing raids.\n\nMany traders were worried about confiscated goods and needed clarity on trading rules and regulations. This engagement allowed us to gain insights and ensure our members are well-informed to avoid losses, he said.\n\nMr Gwatida added that the association is committed to ensuring its members adhere to regulations to foster a compliant and thriving business environment.  @DubeMatutu.\n\n",

The Chief Justice emphasised that the judiciary derives its mandate from the people and must therefore report on its performance and outline measures to address any challenges in justice delivery.\n\nWe applaud the decision to move the main proceedings to Bulawayo, decentralising justice has been a major goal in the Second Republic.\n\nDecentralisation has significantly improved access to justice in several ways, chief among them is proximity to legal services. By holding judicial proceedings and services in various regions, people no longer need to travel long distances to the capital for legal matters. This makes it easier for individuals to attend court sessions and access legal assistance.\n\nDecentralising courts helps distribute cases more evenly across the country, reducing the backlog in major cities. This leads to quicker resolution of cases and more efficient justice delivery.\n\nBringing justice closer to the people fosters greater transparency and accountability. When citizens see the judiciary actively working in their communities, it builds trust and confidence in the legal system.\n\nLocalising judicial services can reduce the costs associated with travel and accommodation for litigants, witnesses and legal professionals. This makes the legal process more affordable and accessible.\n\nIn a diverse country like Zimbabwe, decentralised courts can better understand and respect local customs and languages, ensuring that justice is administered in a culturally sensitive manner.\n\nThe opening of the legal year is not just a ceremonial event but a platform for the judiciary to explain how it has administered the courts and performed over the past year.\n\nThe decision to host the event in Bulawayo is a significant step towards decentralising public services and ensuring that justice is not confined to the capital but is accessible to all Zimbabweans.\n\nThis move is a testament to the judiciarys commitment to transparency, accountability, and service to the people.\n\n",

            "content": "Nqobile Bhebhe,[emailprotected]\n\nRECENT gold production figures from Fidelity Gold Refinery (FGR) illustrate a robust sector in Zimbabwe, defying expectations and solidifying the countrys position on the global market.\n\nGold is Zimbabwes single largest export earner, averaging US$3 billion annually over the past few years.\n\nIn 2016, miners delivered 21.4 tonnes to FGR, up from 18.6 tonnes in 2015.\n\nDeliveries increased to 24 tonnes in 2017 and 33.29 tonnes in 2018. In 2019, the total was 27.66 tonnes, rising to 30.1 tonnes in 2020 and reaching 29.7 tonnes in 2021.\n\nAccording to FGR, Zimbabwes sole buyer of the precious metal, 35.3 tonnes were realised in 2022.However, the countrys gold production reached a record 36,48 tonnes in 2024, a 21 percent surge from 30.1 tonnes recorded in 2023. The government had set a target of 35 tonnes.\n\nThis achievement comes despite numerous challenges, including economic fluctuations and global market pressures.\n\nThe intermittent power supply also significantly affected mining companies, which rely heavily on consistent electricity supply to operate machinery.\n\nPower challenges not only disrupt production but also drive up costs. Many mines rely on diesel generators as a temporary solution, however, high fuel prices and increased maintenance expenses add to their financial burdens.\n\nMines without access to dedicated power lines are facing severe and ongoing outages, which hinder their ability to meet production targets.\n\nAs a result, mining companies are increasingly relying on more expensive energy sources, such as diesel.\n\nThe rising costs associated with procuring these alternatives have created significant operational challenges for mining entities.\n\nDespite the challenges faced by authorities and industry players, however, gold production surpassed expectations.\n\nArtisanal and small-scale miners delivered a significant 23.7 tonnes of gold, while primary producers contributed 12.7 tonnes.\n\nThe mining sector is vital to Zimbabwes economy, accounting for approximately 60 percent of the countrys export earnings and making a substantial contribution to the Gross Domestic Product.\n\nThe government has been focusing on diversifying energy sources by investing in new infrastructure.\n\nA noteworthy development is the recent construction of the Hwange Thermal Power Station Units 7 and 8 Project, which has successfully added 600 megawatts to the national grid.\n\nThe gold sector carries huge potential for the countrys economy with small-scale miners producing about 60 percent of gold receipts, which has necessitated consistent efforts to support their production.\n\nIndustry experts credit this increase in production to the dedication of local miners and the governments efforts to improve the mining environment.\n\nStreamlining licensing procedures and supporting small-scale miners has resulted in higher output and investment.\n\nAdditionally, new technologies and enhanced mining practices have increased efficiency, enabling small operators to optimise their yields.\n\nMr Payne Kupfuwa, Chief Executive Officer of the Young Miners Foundation, asserts that the rise in gold production, primarily from small-scale miners, is beneficial for the economy and strengthens Zimbabwes position in the global gold market.\n\nAs demand for gold increases, local producers are well-positioned to take advantage of favourable conditions. He noted that reaching the 36-tonne milestone is just the start, paving the way for even greater achievements in the future.\n\nThe sector could produce between 40 to 50 tonnes annually with sufficient and readily available energy supply, he said.\n\nThe young miners family was thrilled by the delivery of 36.48 tonnes of gold in 2024, a 21 percent increase over 2023. This significantly contributes to Zimbabwes economic growth, as it is tied to gold production. We believe we can achieve annual outputs of 40 to 50 tonnes, he said.\n\nPower is essential throughout our gold production process. If power remains available, we can boost gold output. We are optimistic as young miners and are preparing for 2025, he said.\n\nMr Kupfuwa is optimistic that investors are likely to respond positively to the production levels, potentially increasing foreign direct investment in the sector.\n\nChief executive officer of the Zimbabwe Miners Federation (ZMF), Mr Wellington Takavarasha said several factors contributed to the growth in 2024, including the implementation of supportive policies, advantageous pricing and strengthened regulatory frameworks.\n\nIncreased mining activities by artisanal and small-scale miners, timely payments to miners and favourable gold prices are other factors, said Mr Takavarasha.\n\nThe introduction of a five percent gold incentive for artisanal and small-scale miners who sold 10kg of gold or more also significantly boosted deliveries, he said.\n\nMiss Precious Ndimande, a small-scale miner in Filabusi, emphasised that the growth of the mining sector is vital for attracting foreign investment and stabilising the economy.\n\nShe said exceeding 35 tonnes of gold production in 2024 signals an upward trend for Zimbabwes gold sector.\n\nWith collaborative efforts from the government, miners and stakeholders, a promising future lies ahead. The coming years may bring further advancements, reinforcing Zimbabwes role in the global gold market and significantly aiding the nations economic recovery.\n\nThe resilience and determination shown so far indicate a bright future, where Zimbabwe can truly excel on the world stage, she said.\n\nAdditionally, Miss Ndimande said women in mining are eager to contribute significantly to production levels.\n\nLarge-scale miners also significantly increased their output.\n\nDallaglio, the gold division of Padenga, produced 2 025kg in the nine months ending September, representing a 22 percent increase compared to the same period in 2022.\n\nOn the other hand, Caledonia produced 1 610 kg by September and has projected a full-year output of approximately 2 200kg for 2024.\n\nFigures from FGF show that the October 2024 output reached 4.3 tonnes, while in December, 4.2 tonnes were produced.\n\nThe fourth quarter production increased to 12.2 tonnes, representing the highest quarterly production of the year. This was followed by a production level of 10.4 tonnes recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nGovernment has indicated plans to set up additional gold centres across provinces to boost deliveries to FGR and promote mineral beneficiation and local value-addition.\n\nFGR operates 17 gold buying centres strategically located across all mining provinces in Zimbabwe.The government has identified gold centres as among the key intervention strategies needed to bridge the gap between small-scale miners and some of their legacy challenges largely centred on a lack of machinery and technical know-how on modern mining methods.\n\nIn the 2025 National Budget statement, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube, noted that the initiative will be financed through collaboration between the Government and the private sector.\n\nAccording to the Mining Industry Prospects for 2025, mining executives are optimistic that the sector will register a strong rebound in 2025 with mineral revenue, employment levels and capacity utilisation projected to increase.\n\nSurvey findings show that average capacity utilisation for the mining industry is expected at 90 percent in 2025 up from 84 percent in 2024. Key sectors anticipated to drive the improvement in capacity utilisation are gold, ferrochrome and PGMs, reads part of the report.\n\n",

However, the Bulawayo auditions will be different, as we will be conducting physical auditions.\n\nFounded in 2023, Misters of Zimbabwe has quickly become a leading national male pageant. Our debut at the Man of the World competition in the Philippines earned multiple awards and in 2024, we secured the Mister Tourism World and Mister Tourism Africa franchises.\n\nWe also achieved accolades such as Best National Costume. With new franchises lined up for 2025, including Mister Earth International, we are a fast-growing, nationally recognised platform representing Zimbabwe on the global stage, he shared.\n\nThe judging panel includes award-winning model Royce Gavi, who is a fashion designer and the reigning Mr Tourism Africa Zimbabwe; Ben Chest, a multi-talented, award-winning model, actor, brand ambassador and influencer; and Victoria Ncube. Hosting the auditions will be Zibusiso Mzolisi Mtshayisa.\n\nBen Chest\n\nZibusiso further emphasised that the competition is seeking individuals who embody the values of confidence and community spirit.\n\nIf you think you have what it takes to be crowned, dont miss the opportunity to showcase your talent, make new connections and represent the country on a global stage.\n\nI personally requested the physical audition in Bulawayo as I wanted to create an opportunity for Bulawayos male models to participate. This was after realising that we have very few male models from Bulawayo, he said.\n\nParticipants are expected to arrive dressed in black T-shirts and jeans.\n\nThe pageant was created to provide opportunities and empower male models, as most pageants, such as Miss Universe and Miss Environment, traditionally focus on empowering young women.\n\nThe Misters of Zimbabwe also holds contracts with international pageants, including Mr Global, Mr Manhunt, Mr Grand International and Mr Tourism World.\n\n",
