Similarly, the non-attendance to Cabinet Committee meetings by some Ministers of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution in 2024 was glaring.\n\nAs a result, Cabinet committee submissions missed vital input from Provinces. This anomaly must be adequately addressed. I expect provinces to emerge stronger, dynamic and competitive economic hubs, with marked growth across all sectors, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the primary task of Ministers of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution was to improve the peoples living standards and achieve shared prosperity, as is envisaged in his development philosophy of leaving no one and no place behind.\n\nAs such, the President said the ministers should be unrelenting in attending to challenges, taking necessary risks to overcome obstacles by implementing solutions that benefit the people.\n\nHesitation, the dragging of feet and fence-sitting are not acceptable dispositions under my administration. Additionally, increased momentum to achieve our national development aspirations requires leaders who are bold, focused, hardworking and prepared to make the requisite personal sacrifices for unprecedented results.\n\nIndividually and collectively decide to be counted as those possessing these traits. This is the spirit that saw us realise our independence, freedom and peace to become masters of our own destiny, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said Zanu-PF under his leadership always has people at heart with Devolution a critical pillar for national unity, social cohesion and safeguarding the indivisibility of Zimbabwe as a sovereign-unitary State.\n\nZANU-PF\n\nAs Provincial Ministers, you are directed to demonstrate the leadership capability, integrity and humility that rallies all our communities, across all districts, within provinces, around the common national vision, and the indivisibility of our country, he said.\n\nYou have a duty at the grassroots level to ensure that our society has vitality and hope, living in unity, peace and harmony. It is under such environments that we can realise sustainable development and prosperity for our motherland for both present and future generations.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said he is now shifting paradigms, transforming Ministries of Provincial Affairs and Devolution from being merely administrative or ceremonial to championing economic development programmes at sub-national level.\n\nThe President said the consistent implementation of a provincial fiscal performance analysis dashboard and monitoring of the socio-economic performance of provinces must be prioritised in the co-ordination of the offices of Ministers of State for Provincial Affairs.\n\nIt is commendable that Provincial Economic Development Plans have since been validated for alignment with our National Development Strategy.\n\nNational Development Strategy 1 (NDS1)\n\nThe implementation of the National Development Strategy 2 must give impetus and greater focus on building modern, sustainable and resilient Provincial economies, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said all the 10 provinces are blessed with God-given natural resources and the communities must remain good custodians of such endowments and be active players in their transformation into bankable, life changing investment opportunities and projects.\n\nIn the face of natural disasters including the El-Nino induced drought last year, President Mnangagwa urged the Ministers of State for Provincial Affairs to continue ensuring the timely delivery of assistance across districts and wards within provinces.\n\nThe President also took a swipe at some private voluntary organisations that tend to advance clandestine agendas.\n\nI call upon provincial structures to shun and expose any machinations and underhand activities that seek to reverse the progress we have achieved as the Second Republic, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the supremacy of the ruling party, Zanu PF, over the Government remains an enduring and integral principle to their work.\n\nProvinces should continue to work with traditional leaders and party structures, so that our people participate in decision-making and also take ownership in the implementation of Government projects and programmes.\n\nJoint meetings and seamless co-ordination with the party and development committees at appropriate levels, should be improved. Programmes and projects being undertaken within the provinces must be clearly articulated, including their overall impact on the livelihoods of our people.\n\nI urge ministries, departments and agencies at provincial level, including councils, to remain duty bound and committed to the realisation and protection of our national interests and development aspirations, he said.\n\nThe President said as the nation builds resilience and adaptive capacity for sustained economic transformation, the business-as usual approach and narrow turf wars should be decisively dismantled.\n\nUnity of purpose, dedication, and innovation coupled with efficient co-ordination in the implementation of Government policies, programmes and projects, the President added, are critical building blocks for the realisation of Vision 2030 and must be key priorities.\n\nMinister of State for Masvingo Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Ezra Chadzamira, said the meeting was vital as it pushes them to work harder in achieving vision 2030.\n\nDuring the meeting with the President we talked about vast achievements gained under the Second Republic. We also talked about some challenges faced, he said.\n\nWe are happy that the President emphasised that we should prioritise all the uncompleted projects so that they add value to citizens while Devolution funds will continue to be disbursed on time. We are grateful to the President for the meeting.\n\nMinister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Mashonaland East Dr Apollonia Munzverengwi said infrastructural development was now the new norm in her province courtesy of the Presidents guidance.\n\nWe are happy that we have been given the opportunity to meet His Excellency, updating him on what is happening in our respective provinces. l am glad to say Mash East is working together with other provinces.\n\nWe have benefitted from construction of a number of projects including dams. We are the custodians of Muchekeranwa Dam where 75 households are directly benefitting through irrigation, she said.\n\nMinister Munzverengi also said her province has Chivhu Dam which is now moving to ease water shortages for Chivhu town.\n\nThe benefits of the water are going towards the people so we are happy for the ongoing developments, she said.\n\n",

Saturday will see the ground-breaking ceremony, marking the start of the construction of the 42 homesteads for the affected families.\n\nBesides building them better homes, we dont want to promise too much, said Eng Mbambo.\n\nWe will team up with an institution of higher learning along the corridor to assist in training and giving certificates to local builders who will be engaged in the construction of homes.\n\nMost homesteads should be complete by the end of June.\n\nMatabeleland South Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister, Dr Evelyn Ndlovu, will preside over the ground-breaking ceremony.\n\nCommunity leaders expressed excitement over the projects transformative impact.\n\nNtunjambili village head Mr Nkosana Moyo welcomed the redesign, stating how farmers needed to have reliable road access.\n\nThe existing road is in an untraffickable state due to lack of grading, hindering local business.\n\nMr Moyo praised Zwane Enterprises transparency and communication with the community.\n\nThe community has been informed of the new models that will be constructed, and we are satisfied with how the project will be implemented, said Mr Moyo.\n\nIn 2022 they came to tell us about the project but they disappeared for some time. But last year they came again to tell us that the project was on track and earlier this year they called for a meeting where they informed us that some of the homesteads in the community will be moved to pave way for the construction.\n\nWhile the gravel road passes through Matopo High School, the new road will pass behind the school. Thats how some homesteads will be affected, he said.\n\nVillage development committee member, Mr Micah Moyo, stressed the need for a reliable road network to access markets and facilitate business growth.\n\nMrsTendaiMoyo one of the villagers whose homestead will be relocated for the construction of the Old Gwanda Road\n\nWith a better road network, we expect more development as more people use the road, which is good for business, said Mr Moyo.\n\nMatopo High School head Mr Gardson Sibanda welcomed the road construction project, citing the challenges posed by the current gravel road.\n\nWe are very excited that the Government is putting a tarred road passing through our school. The road we are using is very bad. When it rains, it is usually severely damaged, and its a mammoth task to drive on. We are incurring serious expenses repairing our vehicles, he said.\n\nWith the new road, it will be quicker to have access to the resources that we need for our boarding here. We have now diverted the route as we believe that it is a better one.\n\nInstead of connecting the school through Old Gwanda Road, Mr Sibanda said they now use Matopos Road, turning at the Matopos National Park road and reconnecting on Old Gwanda Road at Fort Usher turn, which increases the distance travelled to the school.\n\nHe said the school is sometimes forced to buy fuel for the Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (RIDA), formerly the District Development Fund, to grade the road leading to the school.\n\nWe are using our own resources meant for buying textbooks and boarding food, and sending it to another department. This shows that we really need the road. Because it is very difficult to get to Bulawayo using this road, he said.\n\nThe new road is also expected to significantly enhance the cellphone network coverage.  @nqotshili\n\n",

            "content": "THE situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remains a great concern, not only for the countrys people but also for the entire regions stability.\n\nThe ongoing conflict in the Eastern DRC has led to the loss of countless lives, widespread displacement, and untold damage to the economy and infrastructure of the region. The Eastern DRC has been in a state of war for over two decades, with well-armed militias causing untold suffering to the local population through rape, displacement, and murder with no end in sight.\n\nWhile the Kinshasa government has consistently claimed to be working towards a lasting peace, its efforts have not yielded significant results. The DRC governments lack of control over the mineral-rich eastern region has only made things worse, as armed groups continue to operate largely unchallenged.\n\nHowever, with the recent rise of the M23 rebels, who overran Goma and established their own administration, the situation has become even more complex. The M23 threat to march on the capital, Kinshasa, represents a clear and present danger to the entire country, and indeed, the entire region.\n\nTherefore, it is urgent and essential that SADC and the East African Community (EAC) address the ongoing conflict and the underlying issues behind its formation at their joint summit to be co-chaired by President Mnangagwa and Kenyan President William Ruto in Tanzania tomorrow and Saturday. The joint summit presents an opportunity to discuss a wide range of solutions that would help bring lasting peace and stability to the DRC and the region.\n\nOne of the root causes of the conflict in the DRC has been the exploitation of its rich natural resources by multinational companies and countries that sponsor wars to secure these resources. The SADC and EAC must work together to stop this exploitation and hold companies and countries that fuel the war in the Eastern DRC accountable.\n\nKenyan President William Ruto\n\nIt is time to make it clear that the natural resources of the DRC belong to the Congolese people and must be managed in their best interests.\n\nAdditionally, the summit must address the involvement of European mercenaries in the conflict, resulting in the killing of Africans on African soil. It is unacceptable for Europeans to be fuelling conflicts and killing Africans on African soil, no matter the circumstances. Every effort must be made to put an immediate end to this practice.\n\nSADC Chairperson President Mnangagwa\n\nThe solution to the conflict in the DRC must also take into account the human rights violations that have been committed by all sides in the conflict. It is crucial that SADC and EAC prioritise the protection of civilians and address the issue of impunity for those responsible for crimes against humanity.\n\nThe summit must address the issue of governance in the DRC. Corruption, lack of state capacity, and weak institutions have long been contributing factors to the conflict. The SADC and EAC must work together to promote good governance in the DRC, which includes fighting corruption, strengthening institutions, and promoting accountability.\n\nWe urge the SADC and EAC summit to seize this opportunity and address the ongoing crisis. The people of the DRC have suffered enough and deserve peace, stability, and security so that they can live their lives without fear of violence and displacement.\n\nThe instability in the region has led to the influx of refugees into neighbouring countries, destabilising those countries economies and creating a humanitarian crisis. The SADC and the EAC summit should emerge with a firm comprehensive stance that will ensure that all parties involved in the conflict are brought to the negotiating table to find a lasting solution.\n\nFailure to find a lasting solution will only prolong the conflict and cause more suffering to the Congolese people which will continue to have devastating consequences for the entire region.\n\n",

After I was given the keys to the car I asked to be escorted to town as I am not familiar with the neighbourhood.\n\nWe then passed through Bradfield and poured fuel in the vehicle at a certain garage. Thereafter, I was escorted to Harare Road and given instructions as to what to do when I arrived in Harare, said Mr Moyo.\n\nThe prosecutions case relies on WhatsApp chats between Chipunza and the supposed buyer, as well as his accomplice in Harare.\n\nThe vehicle was recovered from Chitubhus yard in Harare with the help of a vehicle tracking company and police detectives. Its front and rear number plates were missing and the engine chassis number ground off.\n\nA grinder, stencils, acid, and spray paints were found in the vehicle, linking Chitubhu to the crime.\n\nMembers of the Vehicle Theft Squad (VTS) checked the car wash and found that the CCTV at the facility had been deactivated.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue on February 11.\n\n",

            "content": "Nqobile Tshili,[emailprotected]\n\nTHE Bulawayo City Council (BCC) has resolved to terminate Terracotta Trading Private Limiteds US$60 million Egodini Redevelopment Project citing prolonged implementation failure as only 11 percent of works have been done since the signing of the deal in 2015.\n\nThe South African contractor won the tender to redevelop Egodini 10 years ago culminating in the closure of the Basch Street Bus Rank and the relocation of vendors in 2016.\n\nThe closure of Egodini has been blamed for the congestion in the citys central business district and chaos caused by illegal taxi operators and unregistered traders.\n\nWhile a section of Egodini was re-opened last year, this has failed to arrest the situation as more public transporters resist using the facility citing business viability concerns, amid stiff competition with illegal operators who intercept passengers from undesignated points in the city centre.\n\nCouncil and key stakeholders have expressed frustration over the lack of substantial progress in the development of the project.\n\nThis has prompted the local authority to seek to cancel the lease agreement with the contractor, which was signed on October 5, 2015, forthe upgrading of the Egodini into a modern transport hub and shopping mall.\n\nThe tenant, Terracotta, was expected to develop properties on the basis proposed in their tender submission at a cost of sixty (60) million United States dollars sometime in 2023.\n\nCouncil issued a warning for notice to terminate the contract due to the non-performance of the contractor, Terracotta, who had been on site for a period spanning nine years, said the council in its latest minutes issued yesterday.\n\nThere was no development by then besides advance preparatory works and demolishing.\n\nThe council said after issuing the warning Terracotta moved in towork on the taxi rank portion of the redevelopment, termed Phase 1A leading to BCC cancelling the notice to terminate. It said this led to the rank being commissioned last year in January, with the contractor committing to proceed with the works and move to phase 1B.\n\nThe developer, however, abandoned the site in February 2024 with works reaching an abrupt stop. There were still development adjustments to be undertaken by the contractor to efficiently operationalise phase 1A, and these had remained unattended to by the contractor, which was primarily the public transport taxi rank and 400 vending bays, said the local authority.\n\nThe project remained at 11 percent as there had been no work at all.\n\nDespite efforts made to communicate with Terracotta on the non-activity at the site and adherence to contractual obligations, council said the contractor has not responded.\n\nThe local authority said it was then forced to issue a second termination of notice, which still stands to date.\n\nThese issues had been deemed as operational issues, which would not warrant the contractor to abandon the site. The contractor was still adamant to return to the site leaving council with no option but to re-issue the Notice of Termination to Terracotta Trading (Pvt) Ltd, said the local authority.\n\nDuring the month of December 2024, the department proceeded to request the legal office to start processes for the issuance of the termination notice.\n\nAccording to council, the contractor had submitted drawings for Phase 1B, which include the bus rank, fuel station, extension of the taxi rank and some anchor shops, and the department reviewed these and issued comments for Terracotta to attend to.\n\nThe notice to cancel the Lease Agreement had since been issued to the developer, Terracotta Trading (Pvt) Ltd, said the city council.\n\nMeanwhile, during the discussion councillors requested that information be shared pertaining to the project in order for them to be able to respond to residents accordingly. One of the councillors further suggested that a meeting should be held between councillors and Terracotta.\n\nIn response, the Town Clerk Mr Christopher Dube advised that a notice to cancel the lease agreement had been issued according to the conditions of the agreement.\n\nTerracotta is part of the 14 companies that had tendered to redevelop Egodini but has failed to get the project rolling leaving the city congested.\n\n",
