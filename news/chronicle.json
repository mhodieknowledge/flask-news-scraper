The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina.\n\nVarious strains of the human papillomavirus, also called HPV, play a role in causing most cervical cancers. HPV is a common infection that is passed through sexual contact. When exposed to HPV, the bodys immune system typically prevents the virus from causing harm. However, in a small percentage of people, the virus survives for years. This contributes to the process that causes some cervical cells to become cancer cells.\n\nMs Barbara Kembo-Nyathi, the founder of Bold Dialogue, an organisation that raises awareness about cervical cancer, said the event is open to everyone, including men.\n\nShe said people do not often talk about cervical cancer because society still believes the only way a woman can get it is by being promiscuous.\n\nCervical cancer is such a scary topic in our societies, and people still believe the only way a woman can get it is because they have been sleeping around, which is not true. That is why we are hosting this teal brunch. Its going to be a space for everyone to talk about everything related to cervical cancer and look for possible solutions on how best we can eliminate it. This brunch is not meant for women only but is also going to be a great space to teach men about cervical cancer and how they are also potential carriers of the virus that causes cervical cancer, said Ms Kembo-Nyathi.\n\nShe said the event will feature a number of panellists, including medical professionals and cervical cancer survivors, who will all share insightful information.\n\n@flora_sibanda\n\n",
