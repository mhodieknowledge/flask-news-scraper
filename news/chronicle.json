Mr Moyo, however, stressed the importance of deterrent measures to combat the rising trend of physical abuse and theft.\n\nPhysical abuse is becoming a common issue, and it is essential to send a strong message to prevent further occurrences. The implications extend beyond the individual offender, potentially affecting the relationship between the two, he said.\n\nThe magistrate further explained that the sentence was intended to deter both Dube and others from engaging in violent and theft offences, reinforcing the legal consequences of such actions. He noted that the court aimed to send a clear message that abuse will not be tolerated in the community.\n\nProsecuting, Mrs Ellen Matenga, told the court that the physical abuse incident happened on 22 January at around 7am when Dube started to assault Miss Yolanda Dube (21) who is his sister for no apparent reason.\n\nDube came home that morning and Ms Dube was sitting outside where they stayed together. He became violent for no apparent reason and threatened to kill her, she said.\n\nDube then allegedly went to the gate and took the chain that was on the gate and used it to strangle his sister.\n\nTestifying in court Ms Dube told the court that she was sitting outside when her brother came from wherever he was.\n\nWithout even greeting me he started to threaten me saying that he will kill me. He then went to the gate and took a chain that was there and strangled me with it. I did not sustain any injuries, she said.\n\nOn the other count the court heard that Dube stole his sisters property and sold it.\n\nOn the day in question Ms Dube left the house after a misunderstanding with her brother. She came back after a few days and found her property stolen, said Mrs Matenga.\n\n",

He noted that at the time of preparing and approving the budget, the 2019 tariffs were in US dollars, as the multi-currency system was still in operation.\n\nFollowing an outcry over the level of tariffs charged from July 2022, it was proposed that the current USD tariffs be reviewed downwards, using the gazetted 2019 tariffs (USD) as the baseline. An increase of 51 percent on the 2019 tariffs (i.e., on the US$110.76) was expected to cover the increases in the cost of providing the service since 2019 to date. This would reduce the lowest shop licence fee by 30 percent, from US$238.11 to US$167.01, said Mr Mpunzi.\n\nHe added that the council had also considered residents concerns over the proposed cemetery and community facility fees for 2025.\n\nThe 2025 proposed budget reverted its proposed tariffs for cemetery and community facility fees to the gazetted tariffs, thereby lowering the cost of burial.\n\nIt was recommended that (i) business licence fees for 2025 be reduced by 30 percent, (ii) sports and social clubs property rates be reduced by 30 percent, while the rest of the proposed tariffs and charges for 2025 remain unchanged as proposed in the 2025 budget, said Mr Mpunzi.\n\nBulawayos initially proposed 2025 budget was declared null and void following the intervention of the Chief Secretary in the Office of the President and Cabinet, Dr Martin Rushwaya.\n\nHe instructed the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works, Dr John Basera, not to approve the budget until all objections raised by stakeholders, particularly the business community, were addressed.\n\nA special budget committee was subsequently established to revise the 2025 city budget, and it is yet to present the final document.\n\n",
