Mnangagwa on the 16th of July 2025, said Dr Muswere.\n\nThe event will provide a platform to harness investment dividends and other collaborative opportunities, as the President will be engaging both international investors and the Diaspora community in Japan.\n\nA 12-member delegation led by Commissioner-General, Mr Allan Majuru, who is also ZimTrade chief executive officer, will represent Zimbabwe at this high-profile international event.\n\nDr Muswere said plans to establish the Zimbabwe Pavilion are well-advanced, with both public and private institutions set to showcase opportunities in tourism, mining, education, innovation and agriculture.\n\nPavilion construction, commercial space development, and website creation are also underway.Prof Murwira has emphasised the significance of the event as a unique chance for Zimbabwe to engage with the global community saying preparations are in full swing and a first container with exhibits has already left for Japan.\n\nHe said it is a unique opportunity for the country to engage with the outside world.\n\nWe have already engaged the private sector and our preparations are basically for departure and for showcasing at that event.\n\nIt is important to note and be aware that this is an event where we are promoting trade between Zimbabwe and other countries, he said.\n\nTherefore, it is in the interest of Zimbabwe in total, basically both the public and the private sector to participate in this event.\n\nSo, I am happy to report that we are working already with the private sector and we will be there from April to the time that it finishes together as Zimbabwe both the public and private sector.\n\nWe are working in three main areas, the area of tourism, the area of investment, the area of trade, and these are the main issues that well be dealing with.\n\nRecently, Mr Majuru said Zimbabwe would look at various avenues as well as push for increased co-operation with Japan.\n\nTrade volumes (with Japan) are quite low but as much as it is a challenge, we want to turn that into an opportunity using Osaka, he said.\n\nAnd they have got a lot of interests, especially in the arts and crafts that we want to explore. The reason why the arts and crafts sector is so important to us is the livelihoods that can be changed.\n\nThrough participation at the Expo 2020 Dubai, Zimbabwe garnered several milestones, which include the signing of a US$250 million joint venture agreement between Arda and the NV Group of India to establish a brewery in Masvingo.\n\nAnother milestone was the MoU between the Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement and the Private Office of Sheikh Ahmed Bin Faisal Al-Qassimi, among several other deals initiated during the expo, which are under discussion with respective ministries and institutions.\n\n",

For Harare, we have had 75 cases this year, comprising 60 adults and 15 children, eight of whom were under the age of one, said Helidrive Zimbabwes chief medical doctor, Dr Evgenii Kibakin.\n\nHeliDrive Zimbabwe air Ambulance technicians airlift a patient to Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare from United Bulawayo Hospitals recently\n\nTwo cases from United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) required airlifting to the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in Harare.\n\nOne case involved a five-year-old boy diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, while the other was a nine-month-old male infant suffering from bilateral retinoblastoma.\n\nSeven months ago, with the support of President Mnangagwa, our air ambulance service made its first flight. To date, 267 people, including 76 children under 18, 21 of whom are infants aged from a few hours to one month, have been evacuated, said Dr Kibakin.\n\nThree helicopters operate daily in Harare and Bulawayo, ensuring swift medical interventions.\n\nAt any moment, Russian doctors, together with their Zimbabwean colleagues, doctors, and nurses are ready to provide emergency assistance, said Dr Kibakin\n\nDr Kibakin said air ambulance evacuation is a crucial link in the emergency medical services chain for both adults and children.\n\nHe said Helidrive Zimbabwe, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Child Care, is assessing existing challenges in emergency healthcare services.\n\nPresently, the most pressing issue is the accessibility of intensive care beds for children and adults in hospitals in Harare and Bulawayo, said Dr Kibakin.\n\nRecently, health ministers from Russia and Zimbabwe signed an inter-governmental agreement on comprehensive cooperation in the field of healthcare.\n\nWithin the framework of this agreement, we plan to continue our joint efforts in organising all links of emergency medical care for the population, including the establishment of specialised emergency medical departments in hospitals, said Dr Kibakin.\n\nThe Second Republic under the stewardship of President Mnangagwa is modernising the health sector as part of deliberate efforts to create a modern, prosperous, and highly industrialised country by 2030. In June last year, the President was in Russia where he scouted for investors to help set up the air ambulances.\n\nRussian Helidrive Air Ambulance swiftly responded, bringing in expertise to set up a highly efficient emergency medical service. The operation is staffed by skilled medical doctors, nurses, engineers, dispatchers, and pilots. The air ambulance service boasts a fleet of over 100 medical helicopters, which have been saving lives across Russia for the past nine years.\n\nLocal capacity building has been a key component of the initiative. Helidrive Zimbabwe has recruited and trained 40 local pilots, 50 doctors, 100 nurses, 100 dispatchers, and 10 engineers to operate and manage the service.\n\nAir ambulances play a vital role in transporting patients requiring higher levels of medical care or those unable to travel commercially due to medical conditions.\n\nThese aircraft are specifically designed to navigate geographical barriers while offering intensive care comparable to that available in hospital settings. Equipped with cutting-edge medical technology and staffed by highly trained personnel, air ambulances are an essential component of emergency medical response systems worldwide.\n\nThe launch of Helidrive Zimbabwes air ambulance service in August last year coincided with the 44th Southern African Development Community (SADC) Heads of State and Government Summit, marking a major milestone in the countrys healthcare advancements.\n\n",

For Mr Wurayayi, it was a constant source of discomfort, stigma, and emotional distress.\n\nEach day was a battle against fatigue and persistent headaches, which had become an integral part of his life. The lump had taken a toll on his self-esteem, making him feel ashamed and embarrassed about his appearance.\n\nThis is a new beginning for me, I feel much lighter. The lump on my neck had been constantly growing. I couldnt afford surgery, and the pain was becoming unbearable, but these doctors changed my life, said Mr Wurayayi, fighting back tears of joy.\n\nNo longer burdened by pain and self-consciousness, he looks forward to returning to his normal life with a renewed sense of confidence and gratitude.\n\nNow, I can finally look at my grandchildren without feeling ashamed, and for that, I am grateful, said Mr Wurayayi.\n\nMr Leonard Wurayayi\n\nHe was one of dozens of patients who benefitted from an ongoing five-day surgical outreach programme conducted at United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) by a delegation of specialist surgeons from South Korea.\n\nThe initiative, a partnership between the Seventh Day Adventist (SDA), South Korean medical volunteers and local health professionals, focused on providing life-changing surgeries to patients who could not afford expensive procedures\n\nThe programme, which was launched on Monday, offers free plastic surgery to patients suffering from various ailments, including cleft lip, and facial reconstruction as well as lumps and bumps.\n\nBoth young and old people are benefitting from the programme.\n\nThe programme has already provided hope and healing to several patients, including 51-year-old Ms Save Moyo, who has long lived with a large lump on her arm.\n\nA Chronicle news crew caught up with the woman as she waited patiently for her turn in the hospital waiting area.\n\nIn an interview, Ms Moyo reflected on the challenges her condition caused in her life.\n\nFinding clothes that fit is a struggle, and it has affected my confidence. I am so thankful for this opportunity and looking forward to life after surgery, she said.\n\nMs Moyo said the surgery would mark the beginning of a new chapter in her life.\n\nBulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube visited UBH yesterday to witness the impact of the initiative first-hand. She lauded the collaboration between UBH and the SDA.\n\nBulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube\n\nThis skills transfer programme is a demonstration of the hospital and the churchs commitment to complement Government efforts in providing quality healthcare. It also reaffirms that Zimbabwe is a friend to all nations and an enemy to none, she said.\n\nThrough such skills transfer programmes, no one is left behind. I would like to commend the team spirit here at UBH.\n\nThis is the fifth time we are witnessing a programme like this, and such dedication and teamwork are truly commendable.\n\nSDAs Bulawayo East church elder Thabani Moyo said the programme aligns with the churchs mandate to promote health and well-being.\n\nOur health expos and initiatives like this are crucial for promoting collaboration with different countries and promoting a healthy nation.\n\nThe initiators of this programme, Dr Felix Nhoro and Mrs Nomathemba Nhoro are also products of a skills transfer programme in Michigan, United States of America, he said.\n\nOne of the Korean surgeons, Dr Shin Yong Kyu said they are happy to partner and share knowledge with local doctors while helping people in need.\n\nThis is my fifth time in Africa, and Im happy to be in Zimbabwe sharing knowledge and skills with local doctors while helping patients in need of the services we are providing here for the next three days, he said.\n\nDr Kyu said they had planned to do 40 surgeries. However, due to the overwhelming response, they are likely to increase the number.\n\nUBH chief medical officer, Dr William Busumani said: We are fortunate that this is a skills transfer programme, meaning our doctors are also gaining valuable experience.\n\nThe surgeries are free, which is a great advantage for the entire community.\n\n",

This indicates a promising year in the relays, should the athletes qualify for Japan.\n\nFemale sprinter Vimbai Maisvoreva, born on January 25, 2000 is ranked 26th in the world in the 400m. She timed 51.55 seconds in Texas last Friday when she finished second in heat five of a very competitive championships.\n\nTapiwanashe Makawaru\n\nShe remains a hopeful for the World Championships, provided she carries her form to the outdoor tracks in a few weeks time.Nyamufarira, a prospect for the future in the 100m and 200m, is a valuable consideration for one of the legs in the 4x100m relay. He set a new 60m dash record of 6.57 seconds on January 17 of this year.On the same day, Simusialela clocked 6.65 seconds, a warning shot as to what can be expected of the Bulawayo lad.\n\nChiyangwa obliterated Makarawus national record of 33.01 seconds set on January 10 in the 300m when he ran the distance in 32.38 for a new national mark.\n\nTakudzwa Pahuwa has the third best 300m time indoors of 33.42 seconds, which he set on January 24.It is the 400m that Zimbabwean runners have had a shaky start, with Pahuwas 46.89 seconds, the best so far possibly an upper 45 seconds in outdoor season.\n\nAll things being equal and fair to early season promise, Zimbabwe athletes will have a big shout in the 100, 200 and 4100 relays this year.\n\n",

They face Kwekwe United in their first home game of the season at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday.\n\nWith the Brito and Torres debt now cleared, thanks to a generous intervention by businessman Wicknell Chivayo, Bosso are now waiting for the path to be cleared by Fifa for them to register their new signings.\n\nTorres himself confirmed the payment through social media, expressing his gratitude to Chivayo for stepping in to resolve the situation, ensuring the club could make new additions to their squad.\n\nThe timing of the ban had been particularly challenging for the club, coming on the back of the departure of key players such as Peter Muduhwa, Lynoth Chikuhwa, Godfrey Makaruse and Marvelous Chigumira who all joined newly promoted Premier Soccer League side Scottland.\n\nNew Faces at Bosso\n\nAmong the new faces set to join Highlanders once the ban is lifted are several key players who will help strengthen the team for the 2025 season. Defender Marlvern Hativagoni, who belongs to Bulawayo Chiefs and registered several Warriors caps last season, will join Bosso on a one-year loan deal.\n\nMarlvern Hativagoni\n\nHis experience at the top level will be a valuable asset to the defensive line. He was on loan at Ngezi Platinum last season and played in the CAF Confederations Cup.\n\nStriker Never Rauzhi, also from Bulawayo Chiefs, will return to Bosso despite strong interest from TelOne. Rauzhi, a pacy and skillful attacker, has been plagued by injury since joining Bosso but has since recovered.\n\nHe will be looking forward to rediscover his top form.\n\nNever Rauzhi\n\nWinger Tendai Muvuti, who played for Hwange FC last season and previously turned out for Bulawayo Chiefs, will add further depth to the Bosso attack.\n\nMidfielder Hubert Ncube from ZPC Hwange will also join the ranks, bringing much-needed energy and creativity to the midfield.\n\nFurther bolstering the strike force is former Chegutu Pirates striker Panashe Mushonga, who joins Bosso in a bid to provide more options up front.\n\nThe 26-year-old Mbonisi Ncube, who has played for BDF XI in Botswana, is another exciting attacking signing.\n\nIn a nod to the clubs future, Highlanders are also promoting 19-year-old left-back Luckmore Mutumbi from their development Side to the First Team.\n\nMutumbis promotion is a testament to the clubs commitment to nurturing home-grown talent, and the young defender will be eager to make his mark in the 2025 season.\n\nAnother exciting young talent joining Bosso is 19-year-old winger Mafious Junior Chiweta, who has been impressive for Ajax Hotspurs in the Zifa Southern Region Division One League. His dribbling skills have caught the eye of Highlanders coach, Kelvin Kaindu.\n\nChiweta will be looking to make an impact at the top level .  @innocentskizoe\n\n",

His presence in the resort city attracted many people including Manchester United fans who hold him in very high esteem.\n\nSir Alexs name is etched in football history having transformed Manchester United into a global powerhouse during his 27-year tenure.\n\nHis impressive legacy includes 13 English Premier League titles, five FA Cups and two Uefa Champions League trophies. The challenge to the tourism and hospitality industry is to ensure that these celebrities come back because repeat visits are crucial for the growth of our tourism industry.\n\nWe have no doubt that these celebrities who have been to different tourist destinations across the country are now our ambassadors assisting us to market Zimbabwe as a tourist destination of choice.\n\nThe country can only derive maximum benefits from its world class tourist attractions such as the Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe Ruins and other such attractions if it is able to attract large numbers of foreign visitors from big markets such as America and China.\n\nA few years ago Zimbabwe played host to 10 chief executives of big corporates in America who spent three days in Victoria Falls. The country should therefore continue to attract such high profile tourists and this is only possible if our visitors enjoy our services and hospitality.\n\n",

This trend started improving in January 2025, which is positive given that both January 2024 and 2025 had the same level of imports in the market, the firm said.\n\nDuring the period under review, PPC Zimbabwe continued to remain debt free and held US$13 million in unencumbered cash.PPC Zimbabwe also increased its free cash-flow generation, leading to an increase in total dividends declared and paid, of US$13 million year-to-date compared to the US$11 million paid in the comparable period.\n\nThe solid cash generation in the period, highlighted by record dividends from PPC Zimbabwe and healthy cash flow generation in South Africa, has positioned the company to potentially reward its shareholders further.\n\nThe board is set to consider a dividend in line with its distribution policy, which allows for the flow-through of dividends received from PPC Zimbabwe to shareholders.\n\nFollowing the strong cash generation in the current period, resulting in record dividends from PPC Zimbabwe and the healthy cash flow generation in South Africa, the board will consider a dividend in terms of its distribution policy, which, amongst other things, provides for a flow through to shareholders of any dividends received from PPC Zimbabwe.\n\nIn terms of revenue, PPC Zimbabwe faced a 12 percent decline in rand terms.\n\nThe drop was primarily attributed to the strengthening of the rand in the current period compared to the previous comparable period.\n\nDespite the revenue decline, PPC Zimbabwe achieved a six percent increase in Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA), showcasing the effectiveness of its stringent cost control measures.\n\nThe companys margins also improved significantly, rising by 4,4 percentage points from 21,6 percent to 26 percent.Revenue declined by 12 percent in rand terms due to the rand strengthening in the current period compared to the comparable period, said the company.\n\nPPC Zimbabwe Limited managing director, Mr Albert Sigei\n\nDespite the lower revenue, the EBITDA grew by six percent relative to the comparable period and margins grew by 4,4 percentage points from 21,6 percent to 26 percent due to the strict cost control measures.\n\nPPC Zimbabwes performance underscores its resilience and financial discipline.The companys ability to generate strong cash flows and improve profitability, even in the face of revenue and volume pressures, demonstrates a robust operational strategy that continues to deliver value to shareholders.\n\nAs a leading cement producer, PPC continues to play a significant role in uplifting the living standards of the countrys citizens through infrastructural development projects that include roads, housing and dam construction.\n\nThis is in line with the objectives of Vision 2030 where the country aims to attain an upper middle-income society underpinned by the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS 1), the Governments five-year economic development programme that comes to an end next year and will be replaced by a similar blueprint  NDS 2.\n\nGovernment has prioritised infrastructure development as one of the 14 key pillars to the attainment of the national vision.Zimbabwes biggest cement maker can produce a combined 1,4 million tonnes per annum from its two factories in Bulawayo and Harare.\n\nMeanwhile, the group noted that following the appointment of Mr Matias Cardarelli as chief executive officer and changes to the executive leadership team just over a year ago, PPC embarked on a transformative journey to reposition the group for sustainable profitability and long-term growth.\n\nThe Awaken the Giant turnaround plan was developed to work on the opportunities identified to improve the performance of the group while scoping strategic opportunities.\n\nThe first key steps implemented included key strategic personnel changes, the simplification of the previously complex organisational structure and the realignment of the organisational culture to ensure the appropriate results orientated focus, cost discipline and a sense of urgency.\n\n",

Were looking at having SADC officers participating in this foundation, said Comm Gen Chihobvu.\n\nHe said the objective of the foundation was to source resources for reintegration of prisoners.\n\nYou might have realised that when we were doing our rehabilitation in the past, we were concentrating on rehabilitation. We were not concentrating more on reintegration. Now that the ACT allows us to do rehabilitation up to reintegration, we are also now looking at how best we can do reintegration of our inmates, said Comm Gen Chihobvu.\n\nWhen we do a proper reintegration it will assist in recidivism to be maintained. We will then achieve that prisoners should not come back to prison in what we call recidivism, he said.\n\nComm Gen Chihobvu said ZPCS cannot go it alone in the rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates back into society. He said society plays a major in the reintegration of prisoners.\n\nThe prisoner comes from the community and has to go back to the community. So, the community should make sure that they also accept the person who also comes from prison, he said.\n\nThis person would have been rehabilitated and is prepared for reintegration. So, they should make sure that they also participate. They need to participate from rehabilitation to reintegration.\n\nCom Gen Chihobvu said the training they are undertaking through the guidance of the SADC secretariat is aimed at educating senior prison officers on the management of prisoners.\n\nHe said at the end of the training exercise they hope to have streamlined the rehabilitation programmes.\n\nWe are moving from prison to a correctional institution. We want all these senior officers to know that we are moving in the direction of correction and we should move away from the old way of doing things and we should concentrate on rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates, said Comm Gen Chihobvu.\n\nWe are very happy that we managed to get support from SADC. We have SADC senior officers here working together as it enables us to learn new ways of running a correctional facility, he said.\n\nWe seek to achieve a proper way of conducting rehabilitation activities and how to manage our provinces in a co-ordinated effort.  @nqotshili\n\n",
