            "content": "For the past five years, about130 000 adolescent girlshave given birth in South Africa each year  it meansone in every seven babiesare born to teenagers.\n\nThis challenge crosses South Africas borders.\n\nIn East and Southern Africa, a quarter of young womengive birth before theyre 18, with the teen pregnancy rate in the region at92 per 1 000 girls, twice the global average. Moreover,six in ten girlsare not in school.\n\nOther social issues add to this: close to80-million girls experience sexual violence before they turn 18, and about3 100 in the age group 1524 acquire HIV every week.\n\nResearch shows one of the best ways to help adolescent moms build a life for them and their babies is to keep them in school  and most importantly, help them to finish secondary school.\n\nBecause when young moms finish school, they tend to havemore job opportunities, and better health  forthemselvesand their children.\n\nBut restrictive policies, stigma and discrimination, and financial hardships can stop mothering learners from going back to school. In fact, in sub-Saharan Africaover 6-millionpregnant and parenting girls are out of school  with many not going back after giving birth.\n\nThe African Union (AU) declared 2024 theyear of education in Africa, with the continents leaders vowing to make girls and womens schooling a priority.\n\nAdolescent moms  an often overlooked group  need specific support, say thesignatories to an AU-backed set of recommendations, declared at the1st African Union Pan-African Conference on Girls and Womens Education.\n\nHaving a baby before 18 can put both young mothers and their children at risk. Such moms aretwo to five times more likely to die during labourthan women in their 20s, maydrop out of schoolandfall pregnant again soon, andcan facemental health challenges. Their babies may alsodie at a young ageorstrugglewith physical and cognitive development and haveworse educational outcomes.\n\nWhat can help fulfil adolescent moms right to education  and unlock their potential for a continent with a brighter future?\n\nSet policies to help girls go back to school\n\nAccording to a 2022 Human Rights Watch report, at least 38 African countries have adopted laws or policies that ensure pregnant girls can stay in school and go back after giving birth.\n\nKnowing about these rights might be protective. For instance,in Zambia, young moms who knew about their countrys re-entry policy were almost 90% less likely to leave school because of teasing or bullying and said they felt less stigmatised when they came back after giving birth.\n\nBut just knowing that girls should be able to go back to school without shame is not enough  especially among school administrators responsible for implementing these policies.A 2015 study from Kenyafound that while teachers were aware of the countrys re-entry policy, they chose not to implement it, to preserve the image of the school.\n\nHaving support from their school could influence how easy  or difficult  it is for adolescent mothers to return to school,studies show. Teachers can make or break this, especially with evidence from several countries showing that these moms report being treated badly by their educators.\n\nHowever, properly trained and empowered teachers can create an inclusive and welcoming environment through, for example,being more empathicand introducing more flexible teaching methods, such as helping withcatch-up plansfor missed schoolwork. Anevidence-informed training toolkitplanned to be field tested in South Africa to help educators meet the needs of mothering learners was co-developed in South Africa with teachers and school managers, governing bodies, community organisations, government stakeholders, and young moms themselves.\n\nMake it easier for girls to keep on learning  and be moms at the same time\n\nMalawis Zomba Programme, which paid tuition fees for school-going girls in the rural Zomba district in an effort to combat HIV, not only lowered HIV rates (by 64%) but also delayed early marriage and pregnancy and encouraged girls who dropped out of school to go back to their classes. Barriers such as long commutes to school or money worries are more pronounced in the case of school-going mothers, because they need to organise  and sometimes pay for  someone to look after their babies.\n\nWhen childcare services are available, young moms report experiencing greater autonomy in theirdecisions about continuing with school. In South Africa, research has shown that making use of childcare is linked withhigher oddsof moms being in school or having a job, passing to the next grade, having positive plans for the future and showing a healthy parenting style. Their children also tend to score better on thinking, language and motor tasks as they get older than when they were not in childcare.\n\nBut schools alone cant meet all the needs of adolescent mothers; other sectors need to provide support too.\n\nFor example, an analysis of child welfare outcomes in Ethiopia (20022013)showed thatthe health extension programme, which addressed health education, child vaccination and family planning, helped to reduce child marriage and adolescent pregnancy, increased school enrolment, and improved childrens skills in reading and working with numbers.\n\nFindingsfrom a study with adolescent girls in the Eastern Cape, including those whove had a baby, show that having enough to eat is linked with fewer of them engaging in transactional sex, sex while on substances and sex with an older partner  and at the same time supports school enrolment.\n\nHelp girls tap into peer support\n\nHavingsupport from friends(including other young moms), parents or teachers can help girls continue their schooling. For example, in a2022 studyin Malawi, young mothers reported that all-women groups from the community worked with school staff and parents to encourage them to come back to class after giving birth.\n\nAcrossseveral eastern and southern African countries, peer providers  other young moms from the same community  offer mental health and social support, such as for accessing cash grants and findingalternative routes to keep learning(like vocational training) and other ways to earn their own money.\n\nSello Matsoso, programme director ofHelp Lesotho, a non-profit organisation that runs life skills and social support projects in the country, says theyve seen many positive outcomes when such support is in place, such as young mothers feeling markedly more hopeful and confident in seeking health services, more using condoms during sex, and intimate partner violence dropping by almost half.\n\nThe intersecting challenges that adolescent girls and mothers may face  such as HIV and violence  highlight the need for interventions that address a combination of issues, rather than just one.\n\nFor example, in South Africa,findings showthat this approach is linked to positive educationandhealth outcomes among these young women: staying in school during pregnancy, feeling self-confident, getting friendly and respectful health services and the use of formal childcare services are linked with more condom use (5566%)  thus lowering the chance of getting HIV and falling pregnant again quickly  more mothering girls progressing to the next grade (3779%) as well as more going back to school after giving birth (4090%).\n\nInvesting in girls education  also for those whove had a baby  and helping them stay in school can unlock their potential, help them break out of poverty and build healthier and better educated future generations.\n\nBut for this to happen, harmful social and gender norms that infringe on these girls rights need to be broken down so that they can be part of shaping their own future.\n\nThe AUs commitment to inclusive education is an important step towards giving young women a brighter future, but only swift, accountable action will ensure that every girl can learn, thrive and contribute to a healthier, more equitable society.\n\nAuthors: Shanice Kasura, Itumeleng Senetla, Chiedza Chinakwetu, Alice Armstrong and Jane Kelly\n\n",

The two are facing a separate charge of possessing the copper cables without a licence.\n\nThe apprehension of Ntonga and Chamhudze led to the discovery of the theft they committed with the other accused persons at the Richmond substation.\n\nThe eight briefly appeared before Bulawayo Regional Magistrate Mr Joseph Mabeza, charged with violating The Electricity Act. They were remanded in custody until tomorrow.\n\nFor the State, Mr Dominic Moyo stated that on 25 January, the eight accused hatched a plan to steal the copper cables from the ZETDC Glenville substation in Richmond.\n\nAt around 8 PM, they proceeded there and, upon arrival, used a ladder to break into the station. While inside, they used a hacksaw and a bolt cutter to cut the 60 metres of 185 mm three-core armoured copper cable that was installed to distribute electricity from the substation to Richmond suburb, said Mr Moyo.\n\nThe eight dragged the cables out of the substation and made off with them.\n\nOn the morning of 27 January, Ntonga and Chamhudze were caught with burnt armoured copper cables after police requested to search their Toyota Hilux at Ages Industrial Solutions near Kelvin West.\n\nThe cables weighed 198 kilograms at Zimpost. An engineer from ZETDC discovered that the cables were the companys property used in the distribution of electricity.\n\nThe total cut and burnt armoured copper cables are valued at US$283,000, said Mr Moyo.\n\nThe police recovered the overhead cables, the car, a makeshift ladder, and a bolt cutter, which will be presented in court as evidence.\n\n",
