The new campus, to be situated in Gwanda, will replace the universitys temporary base at the Epoch Mine Campus in Insiza, marking a significant step forward in the institutions expansion and development.\n\nThe approved masterplan outlines a state-of-the-art campus that will occupy 90 hectares of land and feature high-rise buildings, a medical school, an industrial park, and a multipurpose sporting facility designed to meet Olympic standards. Additionally, the campus will include a student services centre and a 5-megawatt solar plant, which will not only power the university but also supply excess energy to local communities.\n\nGwanda State Universitys Vice-Chancellor, Professor Bernard Nthambeleni, described the approval as a transformative milestone for the institution and the region. This development will not only enhance the quality of education we offer but also contribute significantly to the socio-economic development of Gwanda and surrounding areas. The inclusion of a medical school and industrial park will create opportunities for research, innovation, and job creation, he said.\n\nThe new campus is expected to bolster the universitys capacity to attract students and faculty while providing cutting-edge facilities for teaching, research, and community engagement. The industrial park, in particular, is envisioned as a hub for collaboration between academia and industry, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nGwanda Mayor, Councillor Thulani Moyo, hailed the project as a game-changer for the town.The construction of the main campus will bring immense benefits to Gwanda, including job creation, infrastructure development, and increased economic activity. We are excited to see this vision come to life and look forward to the positive impact it will have on our community, he said.\n\nWhile the main campus will be established in Gwanda, the Epoch Mine Satellite Campus will remain operational, ensuring continuity for current students and staff. The universitys leadership has assured stakeholders that the transition will be seamless, with minimal disruption to academic activities.\n\nThe project is also expected to contribute to sustainable development through the construction of the 5-megawatt solar plant. This initiative aligns with national efforts to promote renewable energy and reduce reliance on traditional power sources.\n\nAs Gwanda State University prepares to break ground on its new campus, the development is being hailed as a testament to the governments commitment to expanding access to quality education and driving regional development. The project is set to position Gwanda as a hub for education, innovation, and economic growth in Matabeleland South Province.\n\nMore to follow\n\n",
