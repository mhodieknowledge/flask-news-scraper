            "content": "Online ReporterFINANCE, Economic Development, and Investment Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube has reiterated the need for reforms in the global financial architecture saying Africa requires cheaper, long-term and concessionary commercial capital.Prof Ncube made these remarks on Wednesday in Cape Town, South Africa where he is attending the G20 Finance Ministers meeting.\n\nAlthough Zimbabwe is not a G20 member, it is representing the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in its capacity as the current chair.He chairs the Committee of Finance Ministers for SADC.In addition to participating in the main sessions, Prof. Ncube is expected to attend other strategic side events, including bilateral meetings.South Africa assumed the G20 Presidency from December 1, 2024, to November 2025.In a message posted on the Treasurys X account, reflecting on the first day of the meetings, Prof Ncube said, We are here because Zimbabwe is the chair of SADC this year, and I chair the Committee of Finance Ministers for SADC.\n\nWe are here to add the voice of SADC as we think through the critical issues that are bedeviling the world, be it climate response, disaster response, or reforms in the global financial architecture.He further noted that discussions also covered ways to strengthen multilateral development banks and multilateralism in general.But also, how can Africa exploit its critical energy minerals to develop? Can Africa get a just transition in terms of greening our economies? That is also a critical issue that is being discussed here.When you look at issues such as the global financial architecture reform, Africa needs a cheaper capital, a commercial capital, that is long-term, that is concessionary, as I have already said, that has got terms that Africa cannot afford, added Prof Ncube.He stressed that some of this capital must be blended with commercial capital to encourage greater private-sector investment.The concessionary side of it is able to guarantee the commercial capital, he explained.The G20 was originally established as a meeting of Finance Ministers in response to the Asian financial crisis of 1997-99, with the aim of coordinating policies to promote international financial stability.This initiative was later elevated to a Heads of State and Government Leaders Meeting in 2008 following the global financial crisis of 2007.As a key global economic forum, the G20 plays a crucial role in shaping international policy and fostering economic stability.\n\n",

When I came here in 2019, our trade volume was only US$60 million. But now, as of last year, our figures show that it is US$93 million.\n\nThe good thing about this, is that it is more exports from Zimbabwe to Indonesia, this is happening that way because we import a lot of tobacco from Zimbabwe, said Amb Sastrawan.\n\nHe said Zimbabwe also exports cotton to Indonesia.The product we import the most from Zimbabwe is tobacco. And we use the good quality of tobacco from Zimbabwe to blend our cigarettes. So, this is a very significant achievement that we have made, he said.\n\nThere is also co-operation on cement and fertiliser production between the two countries, with Zimbabwe using Indonesian technology.\n\nWe also would like to develop cooperation in lithium mining. We will soon be holding discussions on how we can cooperate in processing lithium. The reason why we would like to cooperate on processing lithium with Zimbabwe is because we, in Indonesia, have already started producing electric car batteries and also motorcycle batteries, we have nickel, but we dont have lithium.\n\nSo, thats why we would like to have this cooperation, said Amb Sastrawan.Indonesia -Zimbabwe relations were established in 1986 and both countries are members of the Non-Aligned Movement.\n\nOn her part, Amb Munyi said she registered several achievements during her tour of duty, the most important one being the high-level reciprocal visits by President Mnangagwa to Nairobi and her principal, Kenyan leader, President William Ruto coming to Zimbabwe.\n\nShe said the fact that Zimbabwe and Kenya chaired the Joint Sadc and East African Commission to discuss conflict resolution in the Democratic Republic of Congo is because of the good relations between the two countries.\n\nI have managed to achieve what I came here to do. Our bilateral relations with Zimbabwe are excellent. I have managed to build them through the years I have been here. I had our Joint Permanent Commission for Cooperation, when I came here, the last one had been done in 1989. But during my tenure, we had the third session in 2021 and 2024. And now I am looking forward to a midterm review this year, said Amb Munyi.\n\nShe said trade between the two countries has increased buoyed by Kenyan Airways, which increased its flight frequency between Nairobi and Harare and Nairobi to Victoria Falls.\n\nI have also promised His Excellency, President Mnangagwa that I will be your ambassador. I told him that I have been to Victoria Falls, I think, more than 15 to 20 times. I have also managed to go around the country, including to Great Zimbabwe, and also to Kariba, but the magnificent Victoria Falls has been a place to be.\n\nAnd I think I will continue visiting. I will also be your champion. I have also talked about the issue that we are there to champion the complete removal of sanctions by the West, as well as the readmission of Zimbabwe into the Commonwealth.Zimbabwe and Kenya are both members of Comesa and the African Union.\n\n",

Strong Government policies, improved regulatory frameworks, and rising global demand for minerals have positioned the industry as a cornerstone of the countrys economic transformation.\n\nPart of the Palm River Energy Metallurgical Special Economic Zone and Industrial Park\n\nSpeaking at the ground-breaking ceremony in Beitbridge on Monday, Mines and Mining Development Minister Winston Chitando underscored the projects role in achieving Vision 2030. In terms of the milestones, there was a reference to the contribution to Vision 2030 of transforming the country into an upper-middle-income economy. At that stage, this project envisages 500 000 tonnes of ferrochrome, 500 000 tonnes of coking coal, at least 250 MW of power, and one million tonnes of carbon steel production, he said.\n\nWhich means that by 2030, this project will be generating about US$1,7 billion.Minister Chitando further highlighted how the initiative aligns with the Zimbabwe is open for business mantra and its broader economic development agenda. President Mnangagwas 2030 vision and the Zimbabwe is open for business mantra is what is being implemented here. And as you have said, brick by brick, we are building the country and leaving no place and no one behind, he said.\n\nMinister Chitando expressed satisfaction with the steady progress of the project across all phases.There are defined work plans towards the achievement of the targets. In terms of those business objectives, on the power station, there is a 50 MW power plant ready to put power into the grid, he said.\n\nThe shell structure that has been constructed will facilitate the speedy construction of an additional 50 MW of power production. Minister Chitando also revealed that a 100 000-tonne high-carbon ferrochrome production plant is already in place and is set to become operational by March.\n\nThe mining and metallurgical project represents a significant step toward Zimbabwes industrialisation and economic transformation, reinforcing Governments commitment to sustainable development.\n\nZimbabwe has over 60 recorded mineral types, but only 10 are being actively extracted. Further mining of the remaining resources depends on adequate exploration and resource definition.\n\nThere have been growing calls within the sector to incentivise exploration activities as unlocking new mineral discoveries is essential for the mining industrys contribution to sustainable socio-economic development. Exploration data is considered critical for attracting investors and determining the resources needed for mineral exploitation.\n\nInfrastructure development, particularly in energy and transport plays a crucial role in mining sector growth.The Government, in collaboration with private investors, is working to improve electricity supply, road networks, and rail transport to facilitate efficient mineral extraction and export. The adoption of modern mining technologies, such as automation and environmentally friendly extraction methods, is also boosting productivity and sustainability in the sector.\n\nAccording to the Chamber of Mines 2025 mining industry prospects report, mining executives expressed optimising on spending on capital projects this year.\n\nAbout 56 percent of the respondents executives indicated that they would spend more capital in 2025 compared to 2024 while 13 percent are planning to inject the same level of capital as in 2024, reads part of the report.A World Bank report titled Improving Resilience to Weather Shocks and Climate Change, noted that Zimbabwes mining sector continues to exhibit strong growth.\n\nThis expansion is supported by rising gold prices and new investments expected to boost lithium production as well as iron and steel manufacturing.\n\n",

Her story is one of resilience, passion, and determination  qualities that she hopes will lead her to success in the competitive music industry.\n\nBorn on September 13, 1995, at Shangani Mine, Black Diva spent her childhood in eNsango Village 2, Insiza. She attended Shangani Mine Primary and Secondary School, where she walked 20kms to and from school daily.\n\nI did my A-level at Gloag High School in Bulawayo, but my childhood and education were disrupted by my parents divorce. I had to step up and become a parent to my twin sisters, who were only six months old at the time. While other children played, I worked on farms to provide for my siblings, she shared.\n\nFinancial struggles meant that well-wishers often stepped in to cover her school fees and provide food, as her grandparents struggled to make ends meet.\n\nBlack Divas passion for music began at an early age. She always stood out in school choirs, where she was a leader in both primary and high school. However, her difficult background affected her confidence.\n\nI always loved music, but I had low self-esteem and feared rejection. My music journey began in 2022 when a friend encouraged me to pursue my talent. I started writing and recording songs, though my first track, Ama2000, was low-budget and low-quality, so I never released it, she recalled.\n\nHer first successful project was a Dancehall track titled Why, sung in Shona as part of her efforts to reach a wider audience. She has since built on that success with several other releases in Afro, Hip-Hop, Dancehall, and Amapiano genres including Why, Badgyal, Ngilombuzo (2023), and Kamuendero Kawakazoita, Ndozvandinomudira, Moses, and the hit Mntanami (2024).Her latest track, Thilo Lilo, was released on Sunday and is accompanied by a video.\n\nI have eight songs on YouTube, including Thilo Lilo, where I featured Slim Vevo and Rebo Dee. I also have an EP coming out in April or May titled Uhambo Lwami. I have now committed fully to music, quitting everything else to follow my passion, she said.\n\nNow a mother of one, Black Diva relocated to South Africa in 2016 in search of greener pastures. Her main focus is now on music, as she hopes to make a name for herself and support her grandmother, who played a crucial role in her upbringing.\n\nHer heartfelt plea to fans is simple: Please support your artistes, especially female artistes. Ill make you proud, and I want to raise the Matabeleland flag high. @themkhust\n\n",

            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza and Patrick Chitumba, Chronicle Writers\n\nCOMMUNAL farmers in Matabeleland North and the Midlands provinces are battling an outbreak of African armyworm and fall armyworm, threatening their crops and national food security.\n\nIn response, the Government has intensified efforts to distribute essential chemicals to curb the spread of these destructive pests before they reach other parts of the country.\n\nThe African armyworm and fall armyworm, which typically emerge following good rains, can be effectively controlled if farmers detect infestations early and apply appropriate pesticides.\n\nHowever, delayed intervention can lead to widespread destruction of crops, impacting household food supplies and national agricultural output.\n\nEarlier this week, the Government announced that an outbreak of African armyworm had affected 25 districts across seven provinces, with Matabeleland South remaining one of the few provinces yet to record cases.Farmers in Umguza District, Matabeleland North have reported severe crop losses, with entire maize fields decimated within days.\n\nMrs Siphathisiwe Ngwenya of Village 2 resettlement area in Ward 9, Umguza District, said her one-hectare maize crop is under attack by the fall armyworm.\n\nIm battling an outbreak of fall armyworm that started over a week ago, and every day I wake up to find more maize stalks damaged. The pest targets young maize cobs before they mature, at this rate, I will be lucky if I harvest two tonnes of maize this season, she said.\n\nLike many small-scale farmers, Mrs Ngwenya cannot afford the chemicals needed to control the pests. A snap survey of agro-chemical outlets in Bulawayo showed that pesticides for fall armyworm cost between US$22 and US$25 per hectare when applied using a foliar spraying method. For subsistence farmers, such costs are prohibitive.Another farmer, Mr Bukhosi Nxumalo, said his half-hectare maize field was completely destroyed by African armyworm within a few days.\n\nUnlike the fall armyworm, which attacks plants individually, African armyworms move in swarms and can clear an entire field in no time. I first noticed a section of my field under attack last week, and before I could act, the entire maize crop, which was a month old, was gone, he said.\n\nAgricultural and Rural Development Advisory Services (Ardas) provincial director for Matabeleland North, Mr Mkhunjulelwa Ndlovu, confirmed that the outbreaks are widespread across the province and beyond.\n\nOutbreaks are prevalent in grazing areas, and we have observed infestations spreading beyond Umguza into other districts. Government is working swiftly to supply affected farmers with pesticides to contain the spread of both African armyworm and fall armyworm, he said.\n\nMr Ndlovu urged farmers to consult their local Agritex officers to access Government-supplied chemicals and receive training on proper pesticide application.\n\nThese chemicals can be harmful to livestock if they contaminate water sources, so our officers are monitoring application processes closely to prevent environmental damage, he said.\n\nFarmers who can afford pesticides are encouraged to purchase them and act swiftly to prevent further losses. However, many believe a coordinated approach is necessary.\n\nSince our maize fields are close to each other, controlling the pests individually is difficult. We need a collective effort where all farmers in an area spray their fields simultaneously to halt the infestation, said Mr Mthandazo Nyoni of Ward 11, Umguza District.\n\nFall Armyworm\n\nThe African armyworms rapid spread is not unique to Zimbabwe. Neighbouring countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana are also experiencing outbreaks. The situation is exacerbated by the moth form of the pest, which is carried by strong winds across borders.\n\nAgricultural experts note that the African armyworm originates from regions such as Zambia, Uganda, and Tanzania, where humid conditions enable it to thrive and reproduce rapidly. The moths, characterised by dark brown wings with black spots, can travel long distances, increasing the risk of recurring outbreaks.\n\nThe armyworms ability to reproduce quickly means that even small infestations can escalate into large-scale problems if not controlled early. Daily vigilance is critical, as early detection makes control more manageable, said Dr Mark Ndou, an agricultural expert.\n\nArdas Midlands provincial director, Ms Busiso Olga Mavankeni, confirmed reports of African armyworm infestations in Chirumhanzu, Zvishavane and Mberengwa districts, with Mberengwa being the hardest hit.\n\nIn Mberengwa, an estimated 307 hectares of cereal crops and over 2 400 hectares of grazing land have been affected. Government has availed pesticides for application in affected areas, she said.\n\nMs Mavankeni urged farmers to notify their nearest extension officers immediately upon spotting the pests so that interventions can be made before infestations spiral out of control.\n\nAbove 95 percent of the 307 hectares of affected crops are still at an early vegetative stage, meaning we can still save some of the fields with timely pesticide application, she said.\n\nOther affected districts across the country include Uzumba-Maramba-Pfungwe, Murehwa, Mudzi, Goromonzi, Shamva, Chipinge, Mutasa, Mutare, Chimanimani, Buhera, Chiredzi, Zaka, Bikita, Gutu, Masvingo, Mwenezi, Hwange, Hurungwe, Mazowe, Guruve, and Zvimba.\n\n",

They gave us US$300 000. There is a possibility of a renewal at the end of the season, said Maphosa.\n\nFradreck Kunaka, the chief executive officer of the company, presented the US$300 000 cheque to his Highlanders counterpart, who is in his first major deal for the club in that position.Kunaka was accompanied by his companys chief operating officer Nyasha Hamadziripi.The sponsorship is renewable, we will review as we continue to do business and see programmes that help players, said Kunaka.\n\nThe sponsorship could not have come at a better time than this when the whole administrative arm was under fire for throwing an SOS into public space on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Highlanders fans on social media did not take kindly to the clubs move to ask for donations from supporters as the club seeks to find solutions to its financial difficulties.\n\nSakunda Holdings and BetterBrands have been the clubs sponsors in recent years. Many believe without the two companies, the club would have folded as the teams owners  the supporters  have failed to rescue the club financially over the years yet they will be the first ones to criticise when the likes of Wicknell Chivhayo come on board to save situations.\n\nIn the Tuesday announcement, the club advertised: IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT, BALANDELI BE BOSSO! We have an exciting update for you! You can now support your beloved Highlanders FC from ANYWHERE in the world!

Pay in USD or ZWL and help drive our clubs growth! Remember, ubuhle beBosso ngabalandeli bayo! Lets unite to make our club UNSTOPPABLE.Here are some of the responses to the post from Bosso fans:\n\nKhulekani Mazibuko Hlambelo: Yes, we understand donations, but why not leverage the vast network of Highlanders supporters around the globe by making membership accessible online? You could use this online donation platform as a membership registration vehicle. Im willing to pay for my membership, but Im reluctant to return to the club offices. Were willing to donate to our beloved club, but we cant sustain such a huge institution through donations alone. Have you looked at how Orlando Pirates or other top clubs do it?\n\nNorbert Muleya: A big club like Highlanders should not be asking for donations all the time. Provide a digital membership platform for Bosso fans to join from anywhere in the world. Thats a low-hanging fruit.\n\nBrown Fush: Youve now normalised mediocrity. Bosso is a big brand and could make millions of dollars if competent people were in charge.\n\nXoilsani Moyo: I raise my hands in surrender. Other teams are coming up with packages to entice membership, while were sending out a begging bowl. Surely, we can do better than this.\n\nPatrick Ndlovu: You want our donations, but you say those not residing in Zimbabwe are not eligible to be elected. You want our donations, but you hide debts from the AGM. You want our donations, but the accounting for funds has been terrible.Pro Ndebele: So Bosso is now a charity case? We want to register and pay online for membership, but instead, youre asking for donations. The Bosso Xhegu supporters should leave the team and focus on farming back home.\n\n",

            "content": "Nokuthaba Brita Ncube,[emailprotected]\n\nPARLIAMENTARIANS have called for reforms at the Womens Microfinance Bank to ensure women can access loans without being excluded due to stringent collateral requirements and high interest rates.\n\nA recent credit registry database revealed that men overwhelmingly outnumber women across nearly all eligible age groups seeking loans from financial institutions. Legislators, while applauding the establishment of the Womens Microfinance Bank, expressed concern that many women, particularly those in the informal sector, are struggling to secure funding.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament, proportional representation legislator for Bulawayo Dr Thokozani Khupe emphasised that while Zimbabwe has made notable progress in womens empowerment, significant challenges remain.\n\nThere is notable progress on the empowerment front of women in Zimbabwe but at the same time we still have a long way to go in terms of womens empowerment, I applaud the establishment of the Womens Microfinance Bank, a bank which is supposed to uplift women who are in business, she said.\n\nDr Khupe noted that about 80 percent of people in the informal sector are women, yet many have never had an opportunity to borrow from the bank.\n\nDuring last years budget consultations, women expressed concern that the bank was charging 10 percent interest per month, an amount they found excessive given the small scale of their businesses.Many also lamented the short repayment periods, which do not allow them to generate enough profit before repayment is due, she said.\n\nOther women, Dr Khupe added, cited lack of collateral as a major barrier, a problem rooted in primogeniture practices that favour male inheritance, leaving women without assets to use as security for loans.\n\nThere is a need for Parliament to enact laws that address the plight of women affected by inheritance laws that prioritise males. Many women are left destitute and unable to meet collateral requirements, she said.\n\nDr Khupe further argued that if women were given access to capital without stringent conditions, they could produce their own goods instead of relying on imports from neighbouring countries.\n\nTo address these challenges, the legislator proposed that collateral requirements be redefined to accommodate womens circumstances, emphasising trustworthiness as an asset in business.\n\nDr Khupe also recommended the introduction of group lending schemes, with financial literacy training provided beforehand.Other legislators concurred, stressing that the current requirements at the Womens Microfinance Bank were locking out many women from financial services. They called for flexible measures to ensure women, who are vital contributors to economic growth and development, are not left behind.\n\nSunningdale legislator Ms Maureen Kademaunga said stringent requirements within the Womens Microfinance Bank are excluding many women from accessing financial services.\n\nTo promote access to loans for women in Zimbabwe, I propose that the Womens Microfinance Bank must start to offer affordable interest rates that cater to the needs of women entrepreneurs, particularly those in the informal sector, she said.\n\nMs Kademaunga urged the Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development and the Womens Micro-Finance Bank to partner with womens organisations, business associations that are pro-women and communities to promote access to loans and provide support services for women.\n\n",

            "content": "THE recent news that Bulawayos supply dams have reached 50 percent capacity is a significant development for the city and its residents. This milestone brings a sense of relief and hope, especially with the anticipation of more rain in the coming months.\n\nAchieving 50 percent capacity in the dams means a more reliable water supply for Bulawayo. This is crucial for a city that has faced severe water shortages and rationing in recent years. It reduces the immediate risk of water scarcity and ensures residents have better access to clean water.\n\nA stable water supply is essential for economic activities. Industries, businesses, and agriculture all depend on water. With the dams at 50 percent capacity, there is a reduced risk of disruptions in these sectors, which can help stabilise the local economy.Bulawayo remains under a 130-hour weekly water-shedding programme as part of measures to conserve water. Expected rains will bring about multiple benefits to Bulawayo.\n\nThe expected rains bring hope that dam levels will continue to rise, potentially reaching even higher capacities. This would further secure the water supply and provide a buffer against future dry spells.\n\nAdequate rainfall and water storage can significantly benefit agriculture, which is a major livelihood for many in the region. Improved water availability can lead to better crop yields and livestock health, contributing to food security and income for farmers.\n\nWith better water levels, there may be opportunities to invest in and improve water infrastructure. This includes repairing and upgrading dams, pipelines, and water treatment facilities, which can enhance the efficiency and reliability of the water supply system.\n\nReliable water supply is a key factor for industrial operations. Industries that rely on water for manufacturing processes can operate more efficiently, potentially leading to increased production and economic growth.\n\nImproved water infrastructure and agricultural productivity can create jobs. From the construction and maintenance of water facilities to increased agricultural activities, there are numerous opportunities for employment.\n\nA stable water supply can make Bulawayo more attractive to investors. Businesses are more likely to invest in areas where essential resources like water are readily available, leading to economic development and diversification.\n\nAccess to a reliable water supply improves the quality of life for residents.It means less time spent fetching water, better hygiene, and more consistent availability of water for daily needs.We are grateful for the rains as the increase in Bulawayos dam capacities to 50 percent is a positive development with far-reaching implications for the citys economy and social life. The expected rains bring further hope for continued improvement, promising a more secure and prosperous future for Bulawayo and its residents.\n\n",
