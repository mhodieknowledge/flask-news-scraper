Chinhengo admitted receiving the money from Ndlovu, leading to the discovery of the remaining fake notes.\n\nThe case adds to a growing trend of counterfeit currency incidents across the country. In 2023, police in Gweru arrested two other Bulawayo men, Chrispen Kutira (42) of Fourwinds and Everson Kabura (38) of Cowdray Park who were reportedly part of a syndicate circulating fake currency across the country. The pair was apprehended at an apostolic shrine in Mtapa suburb, where police recovered counterfeit money stashed in their vehicle.\n\n",

Because the researchers, those young boys and girls who have been gifted, cannot dream of what they need. But if you go to them and you tell them what you need, they will crack their minds and you will have solutions, he said to a round of applause.\n\nThe Vice President stressed that as the nation transitions from National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) to National Development Strategy 2 (NDS2), there must be a deliberate and accelerated shift to enhance productivity, remove bottlenecks, and enable full private sector participation.\n\nHe further noted that Zimbabwes push toward industrialisation must be reinvigorated with targeted efforts that will position the country as a competitive player in regional and continental trade.\n\nRunning under the theme Revitalising Industrialisation for Zimbabwes Economic Resurgence, the IBC stands as the countrys premier business forum, drawing together government leaders, policymakers, and industry experts.\n\nThe conference provides a vital platform for engaging on key economic issues, such as integrated industrialisation, sustainable growth, and unlocking global business opportunities.\n\nAttended by top business leaders and decision-makers, the IBC continues to serve as a critical space for shaping Zimbabwes economic trajectory.\n\n",
