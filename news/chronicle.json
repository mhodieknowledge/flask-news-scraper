This situation calls for a lot of deep thinking on the best way forward. In the absence of any windfall to the club, the only alternative is to partner with those who have the financial muscle and expertise to run the project. In this way, the club can gain something from the project rather than allow the current situation to continue. As I mentioned above, I exhort the generality of the Highlanders membership to come up with suggestions that can ensure this project kicks off, said Mhlophe.\n\nThe mining claim was awarded by President Mnangagwa in 2020 as part of an effort to empower the club to expand its revenue streams. This was when the club was approaching its 95th year of existence in 2021.\n\nShould the project take off and yield positive results, it is hoped that Highlanders will be able to compete on equal terms with wealthier clubs such as FC Platinum, Manica Diamonds, Chicken Inn, and Ngezi Platinum.\n\n",

            "content": "The decision left Mikel Arteta fuming, pundits were baffled, while Arsenal fans were furious.\n\nThe Gunners may have beaten struggling Wolves 1-0 to maintain their Premier League title hopes  but it was Myles Lewis-Skellys controversial red card that stole the headlines.\n\nIn the 43rd minute Lewis-Skelly caught Wolves Matt Doherty above the ankle to break up a counter-attack on the edge of Wolves box  about 70 yards away from Arsenals goal.\n\nReferee Michael Oliver showed the 18-year-old a straight red card, a decision which was upheld by the video assistant referee (VAR).\n\nAfter the match, Arsenal manager Arteta told BBC Match of the Day the decision was so obvious that today you dont need my words.\n\nI am absolutely fuming but I leave it with you, he said to Sky Sports.\n\nBecause it is that obvious, I dont think my words are going to help.\n\nArsenal rallied against Wolves, who themselves went down to 10 after Joao Gomes second yellow, and the Gunners celebrated a 74th-minute Riccardo Calafiori winner to stay within six points of leaders Liverpool.\n\nAt an Arsenal corner, Wolves cleared their lines and looking to start a counter-attack, Doherty took the ball from the edge of the penalty area and drove forward.\n\nLewis-Skelly caught Dohertys shin and then foot, bringing the defender down, a challenge which the Premier League Match Centre described on X as serious foul play.\n\nOliver quickly showed a red card, and VAR checked the call, deciding against sending the referee to the pitchside monitor.\n\nOn the Premier Leagues website it says high, full and forceful contact on the ankle or above is considered dangerous and a red card.\n\nThe divisions record goalscorer, Alan Shearer, said the sending off was one of the worst decisions Ive seen in a long time.\n\nAs a referee you can get it wrong on the pitch, you might see something which is incorrect, he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\nHow on earth Darren England, the VAR, thinks that the referee has got that right and there is no need to send him to the screen.\n\nShearer added on BBC Match of the Day: It should have been a yellow card, it is a terrible decision. There was no speed, no intensity, it was not endangering an opponent and was 90 yards from goal, so never, ever a red card.\n\nWhat worries me is there is an assistant VAR and a VAR who have seen several replays and they think it is serious foul play.\n\nAsked if Arsenal will appeal against the decision, Arteta told Sky Sports: Thats for the club to decide what the best decision is. I think its that obvious, maybe we dont even need to.\n\nUnless overturned, the Arsenal academy graduate will face a three-match ban, missing his sides matches with Manchester City and Leicester City in the Premier League, and Newcastle United in the Carabao Cup semi-final.\n\nArsenal substitute Calafiori told Sky Sports that Lewis-Skelly was disappointed for the team and that from the bench, it was clearly not a red card.\n\nAt 18 years and 121 days, Lewis-Skelly became the third youngest player to be sent off in the Premier League, behind Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen.\n\nFormer Premier League referee Mike Dean on Sky Sports: When you see a still image you understand what he has done. He has put his studs down his leg for serious foul play. Scraped down the Achilles.\n\nFormer Chelsea and Scotland winger Pat Nevin: Myles Lewis-Skelly is only 10 yards outside the oppositions box. It must be for violent conduct, but that doesnt look like violent conduct. Its a cynical trip. I have never seen that in my life. I am stunned by a red card.\n\nFormer Manchester City centre-back Nedum Onuoha: Its not definitely a red card for me. I can see now with more replays why it is the right thing to do. Maybe the referee sees that Myles Lewis-Skelly has no intent to play the ball. Its a tough moment for Arsenal. For the youngster, I think he needs to understand there are different ways to do that.\n\nThats not a red, that will get overturned very quickly. He tries to stop the counter-attack and it doesnt look very bad to me.\n\nBBC Radio 5 Live presenter Mark Chapman: Baffling and nonsensical\n\nFormer Blackburn and Tottenham midfielder Tim Sherwood on Sky Sports: I am still reeling from that. I cant believe he has sent him off.\n\nJim: Its not controversial sending Myles Lewis-Skelly off, he didnt even try to play the ball.\n\nPaul: Good decision. Absolutely fed up with players getting away with deliberately hacking players down with no attempt to get the ball.\n\nTim: Fans and managers need to come together and strike in terms of voicing all our frustrations on the quality of referees. Im not an Arsenal fan but thats NEVER a red card. If thats a foul every tackle is a red!\n\nTocowa: Seen worse tackles not even yellow-carded.\n\nSimon, Colchester: The narrative that it was above the ankle so its a red is utter, utter nonsense. There are multiple fouls EVERY game above the ankle that arent even given as yellows, let alone a red.\n\nFor Arsenal, Lewis-Skellys dismissal was their fourth in the Premier League this season, one more than any other side.\n\nIt is not the first time the Gunners have been left aggrieved following a red card.\n\nWhen Leandro Trossardwas given a second yellow for time-wastingagainst Manchester City in September, Arteta again said the decision was so obvious he would leave it up to the media to decide.\n\nThis season Arteta has also criticised decisions to send off Declan Rice at home to Brighton and a penalty call against William Salibaaway to the Seagulls.\n\nSource: BBC\n\n",

So thank you so much, added Keys, who will now equal her career-high seventh in the world ranking she attained nine years ago.They believed in me when I didnt believe in myself, and helped me every step of the way. Last year was so tough, with some really bad injuries, I didnt know if I was gonna be able to do it again.What a tournamentKeys becomes the fourth oldest first-time winner of a major since the Open Era began in 1968.Sabalenka was gracious after a first Melbourne defeat since 2022.First of all, Madison, what a tournament. You have been fighting really hard to get this trophy, Sabalenka said.I really feel like its home when Im here and Ill come back stronger and do my best next year.It was Keys who came out of the blocks playing exemplary tennis to put Sabalenka under pressure and race to the first set in 35 minutes on Rod Laver Arena.The Belarusian began to flip the script in the second set, breaking in the third game and moving ominously ahead 3-1.Another break followed on a brilliant Sabalenka cross-court pass and she levelled the match after an hour and 20 minutes on court.The 26-year-old Sabalenka by now was timing the ball much better and a younger Keys might have buckled.But this mature version of Keys, who battled all the way to beat Iga Swiatek in a 10-point final-set tiebreak in the semi-finals, is made of sterner stuff.At 5-6 when Sabalenka served to take it to another final-set tiebreak, Keys brought up two match points.She held her nerve to secure the long-awaited title on the second with her 29th winner after 2 hours and 2 minutes.
