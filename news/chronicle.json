The initiative aims to raise US$20 from 50 supporters to empower young talents in poetry, hip-hop, dance, writing, and music. The funds will support innovative performances and provide emerging artists with exposure, confidence, and the opportunity to develop their craft.The Friends of Intwasa initiative is gaining momentum. People are coming forward, some supporting immediately, others asking for more information. Our community loves to support good causes, and they want to invest in something that benefits the less privileged, Baya shared.\n\nBaya shared the critical role of public support for the festival, especially given the economic challenges.Public support is vital. Supporting the festival will bring the community closer. Supporters can influence programming and other aspects because they will be investing in the brand. We want people to be part of the festival, not just as consumers but as investors in the event, he said.\n\nAs the festival continues to gain traction, Baya remains hopeful about its success.We are optimistic. We keep praying. Things are tough, but anything can happen. But we always say, Ithendele elihle ngelikhala ligijima. While we run and organise, we stay hopeful. We are a miracle that happens every year.
