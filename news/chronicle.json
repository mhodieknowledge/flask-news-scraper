They had a chance to steal it first half, thanks to our slow start. We came back stronger and a better side. Second half, we just couldnt see the ball across the line. Not the result we wanted but coming back from a loss last weekend, we take the point and look forward positively to the next game.\n\nMainline FC is set to face Talen Vision on their next match. The team is yet awaiting for an update from ZIFA on where and when the match will played.\n\nIrene Mwanza the Head coach for Victoria Falls City FC said her team created more chances to win, but the opponents defence was strong. We created a lot of chances, I wish we could have won this game. I was appointed Head Coach for this team in September last year. Our 2nd coach is Zivanayi Chawanji and Innocent Ndlovu is our 3rd coach. She Said\n\nI am also so excited as I recently received a call from ZIFA to be an Under 20 girls assistant coach for the national team. She added.\n\nMainline fans expressed disappointment after the draw against Victoria Falls City FC, with many nostalgically stating, We miss Gumede, referring to the teams former head coach.\n\n",

She converted US$502 in school funds to her personal use.\n\nMagwaku was sentenced to 12 months in prison, of which six months were suspended on condition that she restitutes the stolen amount. The remaining six months were further suspended on the condition that she completes 420 hours of community service.\n\nMagwaku was arrested last week alongside the schools headmistress, Stella Mhlanga (63), deputy head Enelesi Sibanda (56), and teachers Nombulelo Maiswa (57) and Siphatheleni Sibanda (52). The group faces fraud charges relating to alleged embezzlement of school funds.\n\nThe prosecutor, Mr Samuel Mpofu told the court that between February and December last year, Magwaku breached her fiduciary duty by failing to remit funds she had collected.She received a total of US$502 meant for the school and instead converted it to her own use, said Mr Mpofu.\n\nThe offence was uncovered during a workshop attended by Government and school development bursars, where Magwaku admitted that her books were not balancing. A subsequent financial reconciliation and audit revealed the misappropriation, with auditors\n\nWhile Magwaku has been sentenced, her co-accused are out on bail and are set to return to court on April 30.\n\nBulawayo magistrate Ms Beverly Madzikatire granted each of the four accused US$50 bail, ordering them to reside at their given addresses and not interfere with State witnesses.\n\nThe ongoing investigation stems from an audit by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, which exposed gross financial irregularities at the school. According to court documents, Mhlanga allegedly received US$7 835 in levy payments but only banked US$2 727, with the remaining US$5 108 unaccounted for. Enelesi Sibanda is\n\naccused of receiving US$1 299, but only depositing US$208, effectively misappropriating US$1 091, Siphatheleni Sibanda allegedly kept US$630 after banking just US$121 from the US$751 she received. Maiswa is alleged to have banked only US$20 out of US$2 574, leaving US$2 554 unaccounted for.\n\n",

Gwanda Fire Brigade personnel conducted a two-hour rescue operation to extricate the injured man. Another coach veered off the rails into nearby bushland, while a third coach rammed into the one ahead of it.\n\nThe luxury train, operated by a private company based at Capital Park Station in Pretoria, South Africa, had departed on Thursday en route to Victoria Falls, with arrival scheduled for Sunday.\n\nTourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Barbara Rwodzi visited the accident scene on Saturday to assess the damage and confirmed that efforts were underway to remove the wreckage and repair the line.Im here with a team to assess the extent of the damage at the accident scene. As a ministry, its in our interest to do this because, as part of our national strategy, we are leveraging tourism to foster positive relations with other countries, she said.The Rovos train had nationals from several countries, including Canada, the USA, the UK, Denmark, Switzerland and South Africa. We stand in solidarity and sympathise with them, and His Excellency President E.D. Mnangagwa is doing everything possible to ensure the Rovos train is removed and returned to service as soon as possible.\n\nMinister Rwodzi noted that the Rovos Rail service plays a crucial role in Zimbabwes tourism strategy, connecting the country to international markets through South Africa. She commended Rovos Rail for its positive contribution to the local tourism industry and its collaboration with domestic tourism operators.\n\nShe emphasised that the Government, through her ministry, the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure Development, and the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ), remained on standby to provide all necessary assistance.\n\nMinister Rwodzi also praised the swift response by all stakeholders involved in the rescue efforts.While investigations are ongoing, Rovos must be supported to continue its operations. This train route is cherished by many international tourists, particularly those from the USA and Canada, who prefer rail travel from South Africa to Victoria Falls. It is in our national interest to ensure that it becomes operational again as soon as possible, she said.We are grateful to Rovos for the work they have done, and to our rescue teams. We always strive to foster positive relationships with other nations through our hospitality and culture, which is essential to our foreign policy goals.\n\nThe collision resulted in eight people being hospitalised at Mater Dei Hospital: seven Rovos Rail crew members and one female tourist from the United States. Injuries varied in severity, with one South African crew member undergoing a complex 12-hour spinal surgery.\n\nThe train was carrying 47 tourists from several countries, including the USA, Canada, Denmark, Switzerland and the UK.\n\nOn Saturday, Minister Rwodzi, accompanied by Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube, visited the injured at hospital and later met with uninjured tourists, who were accommodated at a local hotel. She offered reassurances of full Government support until their recovery.\n\nShe revealed that the visit had been made at the behest of President Mnangagwa, who expressed deep concern over the incident and directed that the wellbeing of the affected tourists be prioritised.\n\nThe two ministers also visited Rovos Rail crew members at a lodge in Gwanda.\n\nRovos Rail manager Mr Louis Jonga expressed gratitude to Minister Rwodzi and the Government for their support, saying it had provided immense comfort during a difficult time.@DubeMatutu\n\n",

However, the term was reduced on condition he does not commit a similar offence within the next five years.\n\nBulawayo magistrate Mrs Eva Matura delivered the ruling on Wednesday, after Khumalo, of Pumula South suburb, was convicted on two counts of theft of trust property.\n\nProsecutor Mr Samuel Mpofu outlined the offences, which took place in 2024.\n\nThe first incident occurred on 26 April 2024, when Khumalo was entrusted with a Ford Ranger by his client, Mr Alec Chayukebawa. He was asked to sell the car for US$5 400 which he did but he did not give Mr Chayukebawa the money.\n\nThe second offence involved a Toyota Allion, valued at US$6 400, which he received from Mr Thadeous Ndlovu under similar terms. Once again, he sold the vehicle but did not surrender the money to Mr Ndlovu.\n\nMrs Matura said Khumalos conduct was a serious breach of trust which soiled the reputation of car dealers in Bulawayo.\n\nShe said there was a need to pass a sentence that served as warning to those who did notvalue integrity in business.\n\nTrust is the foundation of any transaction.
