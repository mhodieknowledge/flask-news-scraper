Her subsequent tracks, Impi/Isagila and Yay Yeah, quickly became sing-alongs, showcasing her ability to engage the crowd and deliver powerful messages through her music.\n\nKnown for addressing mental health issues and bragging rights in her lyrics, TBK Smirk demonstrated an impressive command of bars, metaphors, and rhymes.\n\nFollowing her performance, a jubilant TBK Smirk reflected on the event, saying, Well, it (the event) had a slow start, so that was disheartening at first because I thought people wouldnt show up. But eventually, the atmosphere changed, and I enjoyed every minute of my set and the reception as well. It was an honour to be considered as one of the first acts after the Hip Hop Power Sessions three-year hiatus, and I am grateful to the organisers for that.\n\nLooking ahead, TBK Smirk hinted at exciting projects in the pipeline.Ive got a few features in the works. Im working on my EP, although I havent found a title that Im married to yet. I also plan to release a single soon titled NXA! which will be a pure rap clap back to the Bulawayo music industry, motivated by my encounters these past couple of years. Youll be seeing a lot more of me this year!\n\nThe night was not just about the music; a talented dance group also brought the house down with their mind-blowing choreography, adding to the vibrant atmosphere of the event.\n\nOther performers included seasoned rappers Brintz, Chuck The Lunatic (CTL), Liz Taylor, and Curtis Dee Rovar, each contributing to the rich tapestry of talent that Bulawayo offers.\n\nBrintz, one of the event organisers, expressed his excitement about the successful turnout.It was a win for the Bulawayo hip-hop community and the city at large, he said, reflecting the collective joy of artistes and fans alike at the revival of this beloved event.\n\nBulawayo Chiefs Village hosted the No Heeps gig to move the hip-hop movement.

Employment opportunities have been enhanced for the community, especially the youth.\n\nWe urge the government and private sector to set up technical colleges to train the youth in mining activities, said a local representative, Mr Samuel Tlou.\n\nAccording to the project overview, upon its completion, it will provide 10,000 jobs for the community and address a significant number of employment challenges.\n\nAt the same time, it will provide technical training to Zimbabwean employees, improve their professional skills, and facilitate the integration of teaching and practice in technology transfer and skill enhancement.\n\nAt present, there are more than 300 Chinese teams and more than 800 Zimbabwean teams, totalling over 1,000 project teams.\n\nA joint venture has been established with the sovereign wealth fund directly under the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion to jointly develop the Turi open-pit coal mine, which has now entered normal mining operations.\n\nAdditionally, a high-quality coking coal mining agreement with Wanji Coal, a state-owned enterprise in Zimbabwe, has been signed, and exploration has been completed.\n\nThe coal washing, coking, ferrochrome smelting, and tail gas power generation projects in the Palm River Park have all commenced construction, with the coal washing and coking projects already successfully operational.\n\nThe tail gas power generation and ferrochrome smelting projects are set to be inaugurated at the end of February, marking the parks entry into the substantive production and operational stage.\n\nThe expansion of coal and energy projects in the Matabeleland region is set to play a pivotal role in advancing the countrys re-industrialisation agenda, with far-reaching benefits for various business sectors.\n\nA stable energy supply is crucial for domestic industries, as energy shortages remain a major constraint.\n\nAdditionally, potential foreign investors place significant emphasis on energy efficiency when assessing investment opportunities.\n\nStrong expertise in the energy sector, combined with a robust local raw material base and a business-friendly environment, positions the country as an attractive investment destination.\n\nThe manufacturing sector, in particular, is expected to gain substantially from these developmentsboosting export earnings, reducing the budget deficit, and creating high-value jobs.\n\nThese efforts align with President Mnangagwas vision of transforming Zimbabwe into an upper-middle-income economy by 2030.\n\n",
