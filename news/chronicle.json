This tour will provide us with an objective view of the performance of industries here in Bulawayo.\n\nAt General Beltings Holdings (GBH), General Manager Mr Joseph Gunda highlighted the companys need for US 20 million to acquire machinery for producing steelcoded belts.He revealed that in 2023, Zimbabwe imported US 18 million worth of steel-coded belts, significantly increasing the nations import bill.\n\nOur market share is between 25 to 30 percent, said Mr Gunda.The Government has supported us by restricting the importation of conveyor belts and some local companies have also backed us. However, most of our raw materials are imported from South Africa and China.\n\nMr Gunda also noted that GBH recently acquired a 3D mixer to increase production capacity, improve product quality, and enhance competitiveness. Despite these efforts, the company faces challenges, including the influx of cheap imports disguised as steel-coded belts, which undermines local production.\n\nCde Mashaba expressed concern over the challenges faced by GBH, particularly the issue of imported goods masquerading as steel-coded belts.\n\nIm very much touched by your presentation. There are a lot of interventions the party and the Government are doing. Im touched by these belts that come in as steel-coded belts, so we need to ensure that anything coming in with coded belts is investigated further, he said.\n\nHe added that the party is working closely with border authorities to address these issues and will share insights from the tour to strengthen local industry protection. Each country should protect its own industry by banning anything that is not manufactured here, said Cde Mashaba.\n\n",
