            "content": "Mashudu Netsianda in Hwange\n\nPRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday officially launched the countdown to the 15th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Wetlands (COP15), which Zimbabwe will host in July this year.\n\nThe 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties (COP14) took place from November 5 to 13, 2022 in Wuhan (China) at the East Lake International Conference Centre (ELICC) and Geneva (Switzerland) at the International Conference Centre Geneva (CICG).\n\nKasibo wetlands in Hwange\n\nThe opening ceremony and the high-level segment were in a hybrid mode with participation of invited representatives both in Wuhan and Geneva linked via video. Negotiations and all other aspects of COP14 took place in-person in Geneva.\n\nAs the countdown officially begins, Zimbabwe is intensifying preparations to host the 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, a landmark global event set to take place in Victoria Falls from July 23 to 31.\n\nAddressing stakeholders in a speech read on his behalf by Defence Minister, Cde Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri during the belated World Wetlands Day commemorations at Kasibo in Hwange District yesterday, President Mnangagwa stressed the importance of the conference and said only 170 days remain before Zimbabwe play host to the historic event.\n\nMinister of Defence Oppah Muchinguri plants a tree at Kasibo garden during the belated commemorations of world wetlands day at Kasibo in Hwange yesterday\n\nI, therefore, compel that this countdown be flighted and announced every day on all key national and international media platforms to ensure the whole world and entire nation remains reminded of COP15 and the legacy we want to build on wetlands, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nZimbabwes selection to host the COP15 signifies its growing role as a leader in wetland conservation.\n\nThe country is home to seven Ramsar-designated wetlands, including Victoria Falls, Driefontein Grasslands and Lake Chivero, which are internationally recognised for their ecological significance.\n\nThese wetlands play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation, water purification and climate change mitigation.\n\nMinister of Defence, RAMSA secretary General Dr Musonda Mumba and Environment, Climate and Wildlife Minister Sithembiso Nyoni share notes during the belated commemorations of world wetlands day at Kasibo in Hwange yesterday\n\nPresident Mnangagwa also stressed the diplomatic and environmental significance of the upcoming event, describing it as a vital platform for fostering international partnerships.\n\nCOP15 meeting is essential in building stronger diplomatic partnerships as contracting parties to the Convention on Wetlands and ensuring that the protection of wetlands remains a global priority for our common future, he said.\n\nThe Ramsar Convention, an international treaty adopted in 1971, seeks to promote the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. With over 170 contracting parties, the convention underlines the importance of wetlands as essential ecosystems supporting both human livelihoods and wildlife.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa expressed gratitude to the Ramsar Secretariat, particularly its secretary general, Dr Musonda Mumba, for supporting Zimbabwes successful bid to host the prestigious conference.\n\nI want to promise you and the whole world that Zimbabwe will do its best to ensure that COP15 is successful, he said.\n\nThe President further extended a call to nations across the world to actively participate in COP15.\n\nI want to encourage contracting countries around the world to participate in COP15 as a conference of significant opportunity for dialogue on global wetland issues and collaborative efforts towards sustainable management practices, he said.\n\nDefence Minister Oppah Muchinguri chats with National Aids Council representative Anesu Siwela during the belated world wetlands day commemorations at Kasibo in Hwange yesterday.\n\nAs Zimbabwe, we stand tall and proud as a leader in wetland conservation that promote international co-operation and growth. I am equally proud that we will be hosting you at Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Wonders of the World and one of our Seven National Ramsar sites.\n\nTo that end, we are excited to welcome you to converse and contribute positively towards global wetland protection initiatives.\n\nZimbabwe has been making strides in wetland preservation through legislative frameworks such as the Environmental Management Act, which protects wetlands from degradation.\n\nFish pond at Kasibo garden\n\nHowever, President Mnangagwa noted that rapid urbanisation, agriculture expansion and climate change continue to pose challenges, necessitating stronger conservation efforts.\n\nGlobally wetlands are facing unprecedented threats from rapid urbanisation, agriculture and land degradation, pollution, deforestation and effects of climate change.\n\nThese threats not only undermine the environmental services provided by wetlands but also put at risk the communities that depend on them for their survival, he said\n\nKasibo garden member Mrs Fungai Khumalo shows her butter ready for harvest at the garden at Kasibo in Hwange\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said protection of wetlands for posterity remains unquestionable the world over. The future of our wetlands is in our hands and so is our futures. Therefore, let us protect wetlands for our common future. Value wetlands, protect wetlands, inspire others to value and protect wetlands, he said.\n\nVictoria Falls, the venue for COP15, is not only a UNESCO World Heritage Site but also a Ramsar-listed wetland of international importance. Its selection as the host city aligns with Zimbabwes commitment to balancing environmental conservation and sustainable tourism.\n\nMan-made Kasibo dam that is fed by wetlands\n\nThe conference is expected to attract environmentalists, policymakers, scientists and international delegates, all converging to deliberate on strategies for wetland conservation amid the challenges posed by climate change.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe is poised to showcase its commitment to global environmental stewardship while leveraging the event to drive sustainable development initiatives.\n\n",

            "content": "Ranga Mataire,Group Political Editor\n\nBESIDES agreeing to have a joint SADC/EAC (East African Community) Heads of State and Government Summit on the way forward in bringing peace to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the recent SADC Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government held in Harare on January 31 2025 also called for the revival of the Luanda Process.\n\nBut what is the Luanda process, which SADC reiterated its support in bringing diplomatic efforts to secure a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the Eastern DRC?\n\nThe Luanda Peace Process led to the Luanda Peace Deal on September 6, 2002. At the time, the deal was between the DRC and Uganda and was mediated by the then President of Angola, Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The peace deal was meant to bring ceasefire and normalisation of relations between Uganda and the DRC governments. It was signed in Luanda between then DRC President Joseph Kabila and Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni.\n\nThe Luanda Peace Deal became the standard or model for peace accords in Africa and is viewed favourably by outside entities, such as the United Nations and the European Union.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Luanda Peace Deal was meant to bring ceasefire and normalise relations between Uganda and DRC. Uganda accused DRC of hosting ADF, a rebel unity that had been attacking western Uganda from the 1990s into 2000s. DRC on the other had accused Uganda of using the pretext of fighting ADF by plundering its valuable natural resources.\n\nThe genesis of instability in the Congo and broadly in the Great Lakes region, dates back to colonial times when DRC was under the control of Belgium, Rwanda under Germans/Belgium, Uganda under Britain. The colonial powers parcelled the territories without regard to existing African social and political settings. Families and whole tribes were separated and when independence came, the new African rulers decided to stick with the colonial boundaries.\n\nIn mapping out the Luanda Peace Deal, President Eduardo dos Santos was conscious of the fact that Uganda and DRC were brotherly countries whose relationship predates colonial conquest.\n\nThus Article One of the Agreement on Withdrawal of Ugandan troops specifically states that: The Government of Uganda commit itself to the continued withdrawal of its forces from the DRC in accordance with the Implementation Plan. The Luanda Peace deal was hailed by regional and international experts as a ground-breaking deal that attempted to bring peace and security between two contending parties.\n\nFast forward to 2022, almost three decades after the 1994 Rwanda genocide and after what former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright described the Congo as being at the heart of Africas first world war, the Great Lakes region seem to have come full circle with the same neighbourly protagonists- Rwanda, Uganda and the DRC once again entangled in an attrition conflict.\n\nOnce again, SADC, the regional bloc, had to intervene in line with its Defence Mutual Pact, which outlines a commitment to collective self-defence and regional peace and security.\n\nIt states that any armed attack against one member is considered a threat to regional peace. This is the rationale behind the deployment of SADCs Mission in DRC (SAMIDRC), which was deployed on December 15, 2023. The decision to deploy the force was made in May 2023 at the Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government in Windhoek, Namibia.\n\nRevival of the Luanda Road Map\n\nThe Luanda Peace Process was established as part of the 2022 Luanda Roadmap aimed at calming tensions between Rwanda and the DRC. On November 23, 2022, a Mini-Summit of Heads of States and Governments on Peace and Security in Eastern DRC was held in Luanda, Angola to address the conflict and insecurity in the eastern region of the DRC.\n\nThe Mini-Summit was attended by the EAC chairperson- Burundian President Evariste Ndayishumiye, DRC President Felix Tshisekedi, Rwandan Minister of Foreign Affairs and Affairs of Rwanda- Vincent Biruta who was representing President Kagame and former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta who is the Facilitator appointed by the EAC for the implementation of the Nairobi process as well as a representative of the African Union and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR)\n\nPresident Flix Tshisekedi\n\nEscalation of fighting from October 2023 between M223 and the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) temporarily stalled the peace process. This time the DRC claimed that the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) was fighting alongside the M23 rebels while Rwanda accused the DRC of harbouring and supporting the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR)- A Hutu rebel movement whose composition include former Rwandan Army forces who fled to eastern Congo following the genocide.\n\nThe peace process was revived in early 2024 under the Angolan President Joao Lourencos mediation, and on July 30, 2024, a permanent ceasefire was agreed between the two countries.\n\nThe Rubavu Agreement\n\nThe ceasefire was followed by meetings between the Rwandan and DRC foreign ministers that looked at the core triggers of the recurrent conflict. Another productive meeting between the two countries intelligence service heads was held in Rubavu, Rwanda, on August 29 and 30 whose agreement revolves around: neutralising the FDLR, withdrawal of Rwanda forces from the DRC territory and possibly involving Rwandas forces in the military operation against the FDLR.\n\nAn ad hoc mechanism composed of three Rwandan, three Congolese and 18 Angolan military officers led by Angolan Lieutenant-General Joao Nassone was set up. Disagreements remain on how to implement the Rubavu agreement, as the DRC insists that the neutralisation of the FDLR accompanies the withdrawal of Rwandan Forces.\n\nDespite the recent escalation of violence instigated by M23, both the EAC and the SADC still believe the Luanda Peace Deal is the best foot forward in bringing lasting peace to the DRC.\n\nAngolan President Lourenco, is highly regarded by both Rwanda and DRC. It is not surprising that the EAC chose him to mediate given the fact that he is the African Union Champion of Peace and Reconciliation in Africa and is designated to maintain dialogue between the DRC and Rwanda.\n\nBoth SADC and EAC are keen on reviving the Luanda Peace Process, which in November last year managed to facilitate the signing of a peace deal between DRC and Rwanda. The Angola-brokered peace deal brought fragile truce that stabilised the situation until the recent incursions of the M23, which took over Goma in a development that has led to deaths of both civilians and military personal and displaced thousands of people.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThe way forward in bringing lasting peace in the DRC lie in the Communique released by the recent SADC Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government held in Harare on January 31, 2025.\n\nThe summit reiterated its support to the diplomatic efforts to secure peaceful resolution to the conflict in the eastern DRC through the Luanda Process, led by President Joao Lourenco of Angola and the African Champion for Peace and Reconciliation in Africa and the Nairobi Process, led by former Kenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta.\n\nThe summit also called for the immediate dispatch of Defence Ministers, Chiefs of Defence and Troop Contributing Countries to DRC to ensure that the SAMIDRC troops are safe and ensure immediate repatriation of the deceased troops and those injured.\n\nMore fundamental was the call by the summit to have a joint SADC and EAC summit and mandated the SADC Organ Troika on Politics, Defence and Security Co-operation, to engage all state and non-state parties to the conflict on a ceasefire process to protect lives and facilitate a smooth flow of humanitarian support to people and communities affected by the armed conflict.\n\nIt is now left to the Secretariats of both SADC and EAC to work out the logistics in terms of dates and venue for the joint summit of the two regional blocs. Given the urgency of the matter, it wont be long before such a meeting is convened.\n\n",

She described the ride in the air ambulance as smooth.\n\nWhen the staff at Plumtree Hospital told me that my son would be transported to Bulawayo, I had a lot of questions running through my mind, she said.\n\nEmergency response team that saved a 2-year-old boys life after airway obstruction diagnosis at Plumtree District Hospital\n\nI was scared at the idea of flying in a helicopter but also happy that my son was going to get specialist services at UBH, said Ms Ndlovu.\n\nMy child was getting worse with each passing minute and I knew that his best chance of staying alive was a quick transfer to Bulawayo.\n\nShe said when the helicopters engines roared to life, she was compounded by a mixture of both dread and hope.\n\nAs the helicopter ascended into the sky and the world below them started to shrink, Ms Ndlovu stayed focused on her son and kept praying for divine intervention to save his life.\n\nI was a bit scared when the helicopter started drifting into the air but the ride was smooth and incredibly fast. Before I knew it, we were at UBH, she said.\n\nDuring the flight my son received medical attention as the crew constantly checked his condition and gave me assurances that he would be okay,.\n\nThe boy is in a stable condition. Ms Ndlovu expressed her gratitude to the Government for the lifesaving medical services.\n\nMy son would probably not have made it to UBH if he had been transported by road. I am grateful to the Government for such a service that is assisting villagers from places as far as Solwezi in Plumtree to access better medical services, she said.\n\nIn a separate case, a suspected illegal gold miner was also airlifted to Esigodini District Hospital on Wednesday after being struck multiple times with a machete. Unfortunately he died hours after being admitted to UBH.\n\nHospital officials said the man, believed to be in his early 20s, succumbed to the injuries hours after being admitted. UBH clinical director Dr William Busumani said the identity of the deceased could not be disclosed as his relatives were yet to be notified.\n\nThere are two air medical rescue service ambulances that are stationed at UBH to offer swift medical responses especially to patients from hard-to-reach areas.\n\nIf the air ambulance is summoned to an area where there is no helipad, the pilots use their discretion to land in an open space such as a sports field.\n\nIn the last few weeks HeliDrive Zimbabwe has airlifted patients from hard to reach places such as Tsholotsho, Nkayi and Bubi, among others.\n\n",

This is compared to 108 949 hectares planted last season, said Mrs Tsarwe.\n\nOur first round or crop assessment indicates that production is nearing the final stages with most growers reaping, curing and performing other post-harvest activities, she said.\n\nOn Matabeleland, Mrs Tsarwe said the tobacco farming was promising, with growers being given relevant information to capacitate them on how they can improve production regardless of the rain patterns in the region.\n\nTobacco is a resilient crop that can withstand extreme conditions and the crop in Matabeleland is promising, she said.\n\nWhile rainfall may be limited, the region receives enough precipitation to support tobacco growth, especially that the growers are practicing climate smart agriculture.\n\nTIMB public affairs officer Mrs Chelesani Tsarwe.\n\nThey are taught to do deep ploughing, have tight ridges to reduce runoff and to use improved liquid fertilisers that enhance the soils water-holding capacity.\n\nTobacco is predominantly grown in Mashonaland provinces with a few farmers involved in Midlands Province and not so common in the entire Matabeleland region, which majors in cattle ranching.One of the pioneer tobacco schemes was introduced last year at Syringavale Farm in Ward 11, Marula\n\nVillage of Mangwe, breaking the decades cycle of reliance on subsistence staple grain farming and livestock keeping.\n\nThe increasing incidents of drought have greatly affected yields, plunging the majority of the communal farmers in the area into poverty, prompting a shift to the adoption of a different mode of generating income, which is tobacco farming.\n\n",

We are into our second month now and the spirits are still very high.\n\nA year on from last term, we are in pretty decent shape. Obviously, with some months still to come until the Africa Cup, we are taking baby steps to get the boys back to playing rugby.That should be around early March, he said.\n\nOn the international front, Benade had another reason to smile as Sables front rower Cleopas Kundiona signed for English Premiership champions Northampton.\n\nWe are extremely proud of Cloppy (Kundiona). He is an excellent example of someone who used Zimbabwe rugby as a vehicle to improve or change his life. He is extremely proud to be a Sable and, thankfully for us, he has assured us that he will be available for national duty for July.\n\nKundiona was a key member of Benades team that clinched the 2024 Rugby Africa Cup in Uganda. At the time, he was on the books of French Pro Division Two side USON Neves where he spent three seasons.\n\nCleopas Kundiona\n\nNow, a big break is on the horizon for Kundiona as he switches to the top English Premiership side Northampton. The 26-year-old Zimbabwean front rower is not the only player Benade and his technical team have been keeping tabs on.\n\nWe are keeping a close eye on everyone with particular attention being paid to all the foreign-based players, he said.\n\nOur strength and conditioning coaches are in constant communication with our foreign-based boys. We will do our best to ensure that everyone arrives fit, strong and ready to cope with the demands of what is to come in July.\n\nZimbabwe will go into this years Africa Cup rated as the number one team.More importantly for Benade is the fact that this years Africa Cup is also serving as the final 2027 World Cup qualifier. And the Sables are looking to end their long absence from the global rugby showcase where the class which included their ex-coach Brendon Dawson and the late Richard Tsimba featured for Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Sables have only been to two World Cup shows, in 1987 and 1991.They have often come agonisngly close to qualifying in the last 34 years with Namibia proving their biggest nemesis.\n\nBenades men, however, showed last year that Namibia are beatable as they overcame the Welwitschias via a sensational 32-10 win in the Africa Cup semi-final on July 24.While it was necessary to win the Africa Cup last year, Benade and his Sables know that it could all count for very little if they do not repeat that feat in the same country this year.\n\nSables in South Korea for their 2024 end of year tour\n\nThis is because the winner of this years Africa Cup will automatically punch a ticket to the World Cup showcase in Australia.\n\nThe runners-up in the Africa Cup, will then get a second bite of the cherry at the Repechage tournament, which many believe could be a harder mountain to climb.Benade and his charges are well aware of what is at stake.There will be massive pressure and nerves come the Africa Cup tournament in July.\n\nWe are aiming to showcase the best of Zimbabwes senior mens team on a world stage.That is the responsibility of all the coaches and players in that we want to ensure that we project a positive image.\n\nWe will have a national block, early next month, where we hope to also assist our Under-20s prepare for their season with a match.\n\nThe boys will then represent their clubs during the Nedbank Rugby Challenge before we take on a series of regional international sides in May.\n\nPrimarily, this will be aimed at providing pathways to the national team for our local-based players, added Benade.\n\n",
