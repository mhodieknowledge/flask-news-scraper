However, he clarified that Zimra had stated that those offering phone repair and other services were not being targeted.\n\nThey are targeting those who are not paying duty, especially those who deal with clothing, mobile phones, and accessories. However, those who repair phones do not seem to be affected, said Mr Manasidze.They have instructed us to compile all the stock and submit it to them so they can calculate how much duty is owed.\n\nAffected traders, who were gathered outside the closed market, expressed their frustration, stating that the shutdown was a significant blow to their livelihoods. Many now face an uncertain wait for Zimra officials to resolve the issue.\n\nI dont know what to do; I will just wait for Zimra officials to see what they say next. I am hoping for an immediate resolution to this unexpected shutdown, said one trader, who chose to remain anonymous.\n\nOthers voiced concerns about losing customers and struggling to provide for their families due to the uncertainty of when they would be able to resume business.\n\nMeanwhile, retail outlets adjacent to the Central Police Station, among others, have also been closed in recent weeks as part of the same operation.\n\n",

While at correctional service centres, they are exposed to different trades and skills, to leave the institutions ready for life outside.\n\nMkhulunyelwa Ngwenya, the Bulawayo Metropolitan Province Officer Commanding for the Zimbabwe Correctional and Prison Services, told Zimpapers Sports Hub on the sidelines of a 12-inmate teams tournament, that soccer had been identified as a key tool towards rehabilitation and reintegration into society.The commander said they were no longer running punitive centres but now wanted to see inmates correct their ways and return to life with communities.As an organisation we have transformed from a punitive approach we used to have to a rehabilitative approach, we realise if we take that route we want to have a citizen who comes out motivated to develop the most popular game, said Ngwenya.\n\nHe said playing in the Bulawayo Social Soccer League allowed inmates to get an appreciation of the outside world and prepare into being integrated back to society.We have registered a team of inmates with the Bulawayo Social Soccer League. This is part of our rehabilitation and reintegration exercise. They prepare gradually for life after when they go back to society. We are now rehabilitation centres and this approach has proved a success and we are working with organisations such as City Football Development Trust, said Ngwenya.On Saturday the inmates side clashed with Sekusile in a league match at Khami Prison Stadium.The venue is outside the prisons, officers and their officers watched the match.Commissioner Ngwenya was the guest of honour at a tournament held to launch a league in which inmates from 12 centres in Bulawayo will battle it out.The day marked the beginning of a partnership with City Football Development Trust that has been formed by football legends Sikhumbuzo Ndebele and Zenzo Moyo.Another member of the organisation is Thandolwenkosi Nyathi an accounting graduate and Bulawayo City FC chief executive officer.Those legends, are role models we want inmates to copy from them, how they behave and how they engage with community. We want them to go out and be useful citizens, said Ngwenya.City Football Development Trust donated balls and uniforms for 12 teams that will play in the league.We appreciate our legends we have received uniforms and balls from them, he said.Sikhumbuzo Ndebele said they would love to assist inmates come out as qualified coaches and referees so that they can fend for themselves outside prison.Ndebele said very good players will be recommended to professional teams after serving time at the Correctional Centres.\n\n",

However, 12 months were suspended for five years on the condition that he does not commit a similar offence during that period. The remaining 12 months were further suspended, contingent on his completion of 420 hours of community service at Magwegwe Police Station.\n\nIn passing sentence, Mrs Marondedze expressed concern over the rising tide of sexual crimes involving juveniles. She emphasised the courts duty to protect the girl child.Cases that involve sexual relationships with juveniles are now on the rise, hence the need to send a clear message to would-be offenders that the law does not tolerate such behaviour, she said.\n\nThe incident goes back to December last year when Kakarahwa lured the victim with a promise of a trip to Harare.\n\nProsecuting, Mr Milton Moyo said the accused arranged to meet the girl at Lobengula West Business Centre. Instead of heading to the capital, Kakarahwa diverted to Donnington West, where he held the girl in a single room for three days and engaged in sexual acts with her. Initially, he faced a kidnapping charge alongside the sexual offence, but the former was dropped due to insufficient evidence.\n\nThe matter came to light after the girls father reported her missing, prompting a police investigation. The victim was eventually located and brought to the station, where she recounted her ordeal.In his defence, Kakarahwa claimed the girl had misrepresented her age, insisting she told him she was 19.\n\nThe Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act criminalises sexual activity with a child below the age of 18. This was after the Government last year raised from 16 to 18 years, the threshold within which one can make valid sexual consent.\n\nAccording to the law, there is no defence to a charge of sexual intercourse or performing an indecent act with a young person to prove that he or she consented to such sexual intercourse or indecent act.\n\nAccording to the Zimbabwe Gender Commission, sexual offences against minors have spiked in urban areas, with perpetrators sometimes exploiting trust or offering false promises. Advocacy groups have long called for stronger community education and enforcement of child protection laws to stem the trend.\n\n",

The land has been and is still being allocated to these settlers, who are believed to be buying from the top traditional leadership. Please help us recover our grazing land, from which our forefathers were relocated without compensation, for grazing purposes, reads the letter from the villagers.\n\nThey said the land that was meant to cater for grazing space has been targeted for sale, leaving them landless.\n\nThe situation in Ward 21 is so volatile and now needs your prompt response as we submit this letter, said the villagers.\n\nThis publication also has a response from Mr Togara, in which he notifies the villagers that a meeting to deliberate on the contentious matter has been set for 19 March.\n\nChief Mphini, whose area of jurisdiction is Ward 21, denied that the traditional leadership was parcelling out grazing land to strangers for kickbacks, saying the area under dispute was no longer used as livestock pastures but is just a thick forest.\n\nThis is an old story, something which was done by village heads. In any event, the area which people are complaining about was no longer used for pastures, as the livestock are grazing at a nearby farm, Sibantubanye, said Chief Mphini.\n\nHe said the Bulilima Rural District Council had targeted the same land for development, as it is closer to their sub-office in the area.\n\nHowever, Bulilima RDC Acting Chief Executive Officer, Mr Billiat Mlauzi, said the council is not involved in the allocation of the land under dispute.\n\nAs council, we are not involved. In fact, we are disappointed that the piece of land has been allocated to some villagers because it was part of our long-term plan as we expand. But on this particular matter, we are nowhere near the allocation of the stands, said Mr Mlauzi.\n\nWard 21 Councillor, Dolly Dube, said she was aware of the dispute but is not privy to who is involved in the illegal allocation of the stands.\n\nCllr Dube said she will be attending the stakeholders meeting, which has been called by the DDC.\n\nContacted for comment, Bulilima DDC, Mr Togara, confirmed that he has been approached by the villagers over the land dispute.\n\nWe are seized with the matter as an office, and a meeting has been scheduled to see how best this issue can be resolved. As you are aware, communal land is state land, which is not for sale, said Mr Togara.\n\nCommunal land refers to land set aside under an Act of Parliament and held in accordance with customary law by members of a community under the leadership of a Chief.\n\nThe Government has consistently warned traditional leaders and individuals who are parcelling out state land to desperate land seekers in return for kickbacks, saying such behaviour is a criminal offence. They have vowed to dismiss and prosecute those found on the wrong side of the law.\n\nThe warnings were fuelled following an increase in the parcelling out and selling of state land countrywide. Four village heads from Dema in Mashonaland East Province were recently convicted after appearing in court for selling stands in undesignated places and pocketing the proceeds.\n\n",
