            "content": "Blessing Chidakwa, Harare BureauBUSINESS units under the Presidential Rural Development Programme established in every village and some schools across the country are yielding positive benefits for communities, enhancing food security and improving livelihoods.\n\nThis initiative, spearheaded by President Mnangagwa, promotes a collaborative approach across various Government departments to maximise benefits for farmers.Each business unit is designed to be self-sufficient and includes a solar-powered borehole, provided under the Presidential Borehole Drilling Scheme, two 10,000-litre water tanks, four community water taps, one-hectare fenced-drip horticultural garden (size may vary based on borehole yield) and two fish ponds (100 cubic meters or 100 square metres).\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nAdditionally, the units may include feeding and water troughs for livestock, tailored to the specific needs of the area. The goal is to establish 35,000 units nationwide.In districts like Buhera, villagers are already selling produce from these business units, reaping substantial rewards.\n\nProfessor Obert Jiri, the Permanent Secretary for Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, said the units are more than just gardens but comprehensive businesses aimed at supporting community livelihoods.We anticipate that the entire village will rally behind the village business unit to ensure its operational success. The benefits include access to water for both livelihoods and production, and the production of vegetables ensures nutritional security for every household, he said.\n\nThe average village requires about 33 metric tonnes of grain per year. If a business unit is well-managed, it can produce approximately seven tonnes of grain in one cycle, covering nearly a fifth of the villages grain needs. With two production cycles, this can meet about a third of the requirement.The income generated from the sale of grains, vegetables, and fish can enhance community welfare. Households can afford to send their children to school and purchase essential goods, leading to direct positive impacts on community well-being.\n\nFor schools, the funds generated will support learners by supplementing fees and feeding programmes. Pupils will also gain valuable agronomic skills, learning to view agriculture as a viable business from a young age.\n\nAggregation of these village business units allows for economies of scale, enhancing marketing opportunities beyond the village to local business centres, provincial capitals and even for export, Prof Jiri said.\n\nDuring the El Nio-induced drought, business units were adapted to serve as drought mitigation centres, providing crucial support to affected communities.Apart from villages, a total of 9,600 schools will receive business units, along with 43 vocational training centres under the Ministry of Youth Empowerment, Development and Vocational Training.\n\nThe Agricultural Rural Development Authority (Arda) will appoint trained managers to oversee daily operations, including labour management, agronomic activities and water supply oversight.\n\nThe Agricultural Rural Development Authority (Arda)\n\nThese managers will also report any operational issues, while Ardas business advisors will provide ongoing agronomic support, ensuring the sustainability and success of the business units.\n\nThrough this initiative, Government seeks to foster food security, enhance livelihoods, and promote sustainable agricultural practices across the nation.In Buhera, the Davhe Village Business Unit yielded an impressive 10 tonnes of maize despite the drought.With consistent water supplies, Davhe Business Unit adopted crop rotation techniques, cultivating maize, vegetables, tomatoes and cabbages.This years maize harvest marked a major milestone for the unit, as all 10 tonnes were purchased at a lucrative price of US$4,000 by Prevail Group International (PGI).\n\nThe organisation has not only facilitated access to water but has also created sustainable market linkages for small-scale farmers.Special Advisor to the President also PGI chairperson Dr Paul Tungwarara, whose company is Governments implementing partner, said the Scheme spearheaded by President Mnangagwa, has transformed the agricultural narrative for Buhera.Despite being in a drought-prone region, local communities are now producing surplus yields, improving food security and transforming lives, he said.Ms Maria Nyamunda, a beneficiary and mother of three, shared how the Business Unit has been a game-changer for her family.\n\nBefore this noble initiative, we relied on inconsistent rains and our crops often failed. Under this scheme, I can now grow food throughout the year. I sold my share of the maize harvest and will use the money to send my children to school and buy groceries, said Ms Nyamunda.Another beneficiary, Mr Tatenda Mhiripiri said: This initiative has empowered women like me to be financially independent.\n\nI no longer worry about feeding my family, and I even managed to start a small poultry project with the proceeds from our Business Unit earnings.In Mt Darwin, the Business Units are already bearing fruit with some beneficiaries earning a monthly income of up to US$80 and up to US$3 000 in dividends.Mr Staford Kabaira of Zunde D Village Business Unit said the project will go a long way in addressing the scourge of hunger in the area, adding that they can provide food and send their children to school.\n\nOur business is thriving, we can sell our produce and send our children to school. Markets are guaranteed and so far, the scheme is paying well, he said.Mrs Sheila Gwaze said the business helped to stabilise marriages in the community adding that divorce cases are likely to decrease since the majority of women are now empowered.This empowerment is critical. We do not fully depend on husbands hence cases of domestic violence are minimal. Poverty is the major issue, which drives violence in marriages. We thank our President for such initiatives, which help to improve peoples livelihoods, she said.\n\nCamperdon Village Business Unit chairman, Mr Gift Machipisa said they are earning a reasonable amount of money every month through the Business Unit.We are earning a living through various farming activities, which are taking place here. We are utilising the borehole well. We have extension workers who also provide us with guidance in the growing of our crops. If funding is increased, we are sure we can penetrate international markets, he said.Agricultural Marketing Authority chief executive officer, Mr Clever Isaya, recently revealed that it is critical for communities to utilise the Business Units.We are happy with progress so far at the Business Units. They are selling produce, which is in demand on the market.\n\nUnder the Presidential Rural Development Programme, a total of 35,000 village business units and 9,600 school business units will be established by end of this year. These village business units will help spur rural industrialisation and address gaps in food security, income generation and employment creation.In Manicaland province, 2 822 villages are expected to benefit. Elsewhere, 4 244 villages in Mashonaland East, 3 335 villages in Mashonaland West, 8 692 villages in Masvingo, 3 205 villages in Matabeleland North, 2 418 villages in Matabeleland South and 6 342 villages in Midlands are also benefitting from the programme.\n\n",

My sofas, beds, and so much else are ruined. I now hate the rain.Mrs Nyonis voice quivers as she recounts the harrowing nights spent battling the floodwaters while worrying about her young grandchildren, aged two and four.\n\nCowdray Park houses submerged in Water\n\nWe should be loving the rain, but I now hate the rain. I couldnt even go to work for the past two days. Every time it rains, I have to rush home, no matter where I am, to protect what little I have left, she says.Mrs Nyonis plight is shared by many in the area, where homes were built without a proper drainage system.\n\nThe situation has worsened over the years, with each rainy season leaving a trail of destruction. Bulawayo has been experiencing heavy rains, with the Meteorological Service Department (MSD) warning of continued downpours until Saturday. For residents of Hlalani Kuhle/Garikai, these rains spell disaster.\n\nLast year, the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) resolved to demolish 17 houses in the area to make way for a long-overdue drainage system. However, progress has been stalled due to funding constraints.\n\nCowdray Park houses submerged in Water\n\nOn Monday, we invited the councillor and the city engineer to assess our situation. While some homeowners are set to be compensated, others, like me, have not been included on the list, and were living in limbo, explains Mrs Nyoni.Ward 6 Councillor, Nkosinathi Mpofu admits that the situation has become a personal torment.\n\nResidents call me at all hours, even at 2 AM, seeking help, but the truth is, we dont have the resources to address this crisis adequately.The entire area lacks a drainage system, and water flows indiscriminately, flooding homes, he says.\n\nCowdray Park houses submerged in Water\n\nOn Monday, Clr Mpofu, accompanied by BCCs public works acting director, Engineer Methusi Dibidi, visited the affected homes. They found a community in despair, with residents demanding immediate action.He said Eng Dibidi explained that the council doesnt have the funds to compensate the 17 homeowners whose houses need to be demolished, let alone construct the drainage system.\n\nClr Mpofu said as a temporary measure, Eng Dibidi promised to send a grader to create trenches. Which is just a stopgap solution.The flooding problem in Hlalani Kuhle/Garikai is not new. The housing project, handed over to the council in 2012, was meant to include water, sewer and drainage infrastructure. Residents were expected to contribute US$50 monthly to fund these amenities, but the financial burden proved too heavy for many.From the records, it has been shown that 75 percent of the allocated beneficiaries had failed to meet their agreed monthly obligations of US$50, according to council minutes.\n\nBCC later reduced the contribution to US$15 per month, but this led to a significant drop in revenue. Only 25 percent of beneficiaries consistently paid their dues, crippling the projects cash flow. As a result, the timeline for completing the infrastructure was extended from five years to a staggering 16 years.Clr Mpofu called on the central Government to intervene, acknowledging that the council alone cannot resolve the crisis.\n\nBCC identified stand numbers 18666, 18667, 18712, 18853, 18852, 20144, 20145, 20113, 20074, 20060, 20063, 19837 and 19807 for relocation.In some areas, houses were even built on wetlands, making the flooding problem worse.  @nqotshili\n\n",

However, the rise of local SMEs in Bulawayo offers an alternative, with many parents opting for high-quality, locally produced school wear at competitive prices.\n\nToday, indigenous fashion designers and producers are capitalising on this space, providing uniforms for schools. With over six million learners in the country, the market is vast and local SMEs are eager to claim their share.\n\nAt the SMEs Centre at OK Mart in Bulawayo, a Chronicle news crew found a bustling scene of garment producers working tirelessly to meet deadlines. Various uniforms, including those for almost every school, were on display, with prices ranging from US$10 for a complete uniform, set to US$25 for bags.Ms Samkeliso Nyambiri, one of the producers at the SMEs Centre, said they are struggling to keep up with the demand.\n\nOK Mart\n\nWe are ready to supply the market with school uniforms, but our capacity is being stretched. We had three days without electricity, which set us back, and some of our clients wont receive their orders on time, she said.\n\nMs Nyambiris small team of five employees is simply not enough to meet the growing orders. Despite being stocked with common materials, the shortage of manpower is a significant challenge.\n\nWere doing our best, but its hard to keep up with the pace, she added.Another producer, Ms Juliana Mujuru, shared similar frustrations.\n\nThe customers come all at once, and the pressure is immense. Sometimes, we have to sleep at work just to meet the deadline. The mosquito bites and cold winds make it tough, but were committed to delivering, she said.Ms Mujuru also cited working capital as a significant hurdle.\n\nWe get more orders than we can handle, and without enough funds, its hard to meet the demand, she said.Adding to the challenges, substandard products flooding the market at lower prices are making it difficult for SMEs to compete. Some uniforms are being sold for as little as US$3, which undercuts the prices of high-quality, locally produced garments.\n\nPower cuts are another persistent issue, with many businesses struggling to maintain consistent production. Mr Adam Mlambo, a shop assistant at Prigar Marketing, said: The power cuts are making it hard to meet deadlines. To compensate, were working night shifts to cover the gap, but its not easy.Bulawayo SMEs Chamber programmes co-ordinator, Mr Nketa Mangoye Dlamini, pointed out that many of the SMEs are struggling with working capital, which limits their ability to produce in large quantities.\n\nMost of our members depend on their personal finances, which affects their production capacity. We need to address this issue, and it is important to stock materials at the centre to reduce the time spent sourcing supplies from town, he said.\n\nDespite these challenges, there is a bright spot in the form of the Maker Space initiative. Funded by UN Women in partnership with the Government, the Maker Space provides a collaborative environment for women entrepreneurs in garment manufacturing. The facility offers advanced machinery and software, enabling women to enhance their productivity and competitiveness.This has helped reduce the time spent outsourcing services like embroidery and promotes mass production, said Mr Dlamini. @SikhulekelaniM1\n\n",

It is clean, renewable, cost-effective and, depending on the level of investment made as well as the quality of equipment used, is just as reliable as the national grid even for heavier tasks.\n\nIt is reassuring that the Government has partnered the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to install solar power systems at Mpilo and United Bulawayo hospitals.\n\nThere is now little to no risk of power going off while a patient is on the operating table or a ventilator.\n\nWe are sure this is a national project.If not, we urge authorities and the UNDP to expand it to other health centres nationwide.\n\nIt is also important to take this investment not as a stop-gap measure during load shedding periods but to actually wean them off the grid. They can obviously switch back if the elements make it impossible for solar systems to run as efficiently as expected or in times of system failure and scheduled maintenance.\n\nOther essential Government services must follow that route. The same must apply to private business and households.\n\nThese individual investments will, when brought together, ease pressure on Kariba and Hwange, leaving them with enough capacity to power up other households, businesses and institutions that, for one reason or another, cannot go off-grid.\n\n",

These individuals contribute significantly to their families welfare back home, providing a vital lifeline for many.\n\nEconomist, Mr George Nhepera, noted that remittances are emerging as a key source of income for households, particularly during periods of economic slowdown and drought recovery.\n\nRemittances not only sustain families but also boost aggregate demand for goods and services, leading to increased sales and revenues for the retail sector, he said. \n\nAdditionally, a portion of these funds is channelled into housing construction in both urban and rural areas, aligning with the Governments Vision 2030 objective of ensuring decent accommodation for all.\n\nThe impact of remittances extends beyond household consumption.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) reported a significant increase in international reserves, which rose from US$285 million in April 2024, when the Zimbabwe Gold-Backed Digital Token (ZWG) was launched, to approximately US$540 million by October 2024.\n\nReserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ)\n\nProf Ncube attributed this improvement to a deliberate reserve accumulation strategy that has bolstered foreign currency and gold holdings. This strategy ensures adequate coverage for ZWG reserve money and contributes to financial stability.\n\nMoving forward, the Reserve Bank will continue building international reserves to provide a buffer for ZWG stability and maintain sufficient import cover, said Prof Ncube.\n\n",

            "content": "Chronicle Writer\n\nBeitbridge farmer Mr Phumudzo Mudau (32) has turned his passion for sheep farming into a thriving enterprise and now eyeing investing in high-quality Boer and Dorper sheep breeds, known for their resilience and meat quality.\n\nWhen he was only 16, Mr Mudau started reading a lot of books and other material related to sheep and goat rearing, which helped him acquire basic knowledge of livestock farming.\n\nAfter finishing Ordinary Levels in 2010, Mr Mudau pursued his childhood dream by venturing into livestock production starting with goats.\n\nTo add value to goat farming, he decided to expand to include sheep. Starting with a modest flock of a ram and three ewes in 2022, Mudau now manages over 100 sheep on his plot in rural BeitbridgeHe got one of the ewes from his late grandmother after exchanging it for a doe.\n\nI grew up herding cattle, but I always dreamed of diversifying into sheep farming. Sheep require more care, but the rewards are worth the effort, he said.\n\nMudaus journey was not without challenges. Initially, he struggled with diseases like foot rot and inadequate grazing lands due to the semi-arid climate. However, through persistence and a thirst for knowledge, he attended workshops and worked closely with veterinary officers to improve his flocks health and breeding practices.\n\nMr Mudau said his long-term plan is to venture into stud breeding and be able to introduce Dohne Merino sheep to enhance the quality of his flock for export purposes.\n\nI am working on improving my breed by cross-breeding the indigenous breed with high-quality Boer and Dorper sheep. By cross-breeding these with local breeds, I want to create a line of sheep that thrive in Beitbridges harsh conditions, he said.\n\nThe Dohne Merino sheep is a breed of domestic sheep from South Africa. The breed was started in the late 1930s by the South African Department of Agriculture.\n\nIt was developed by interbreeding Peppin-style Merino ewes and German Mutton Merino rams. The Dohne Merino is a dual-purpose breed providing meat and fine wool production.\n\nMr Mudau also practices rotational grazing to prevent overgrazing and ensures year-round fodder availability by planting drought-resistant lucerne and sorghum. He recently installed a solar-powered borehole to ensure his livestock always have access to clean water.\n\nFarming is about adapting to your environment. You cant fight nature; you must work with it. My ultimate goal is to transform my plot into a hub for sharing knowledge on animal husbandry, said Mr Mudau.\n\nHe supplies lamb to local markets and supermarkets in Beitbridge.\n\nAs a long-term goal, I want to explore value-added products like sheep milk, cheese and organic fertilizer from manure. My dream is to see Beitbridge recognised as a hub for high-quality livestock farming, said Mr Mudau.\n\nSuccessive droughts linked to the effects of climate change in the last decade have brought agony and misery to most communal farmers across the Matabeleland region, especially Beitbridge, where crop production can only do well under irrigation-based farming.\n\nBeitbridge falls under Agriculture Natural Region five and the Meteorological Services Region three, respectively. In recent years, the district has received less than 350mm to 450mm needed to sustain the summer cropping season for both livestock and crops to do well.\n\n",
