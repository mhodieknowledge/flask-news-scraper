            "content": "Nqobile Bhebhe in Beitbridge\n\nPRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday led the ground-breaking ceremony for the massive US$3,6 billion Palm River Energy Metallurgical Special Economic Zone project in Beitbridge District, Matabeleland South, in another bold milestone towards transforming Zimbabwes economy into an upper middle-income status by 2030.\n\nThe mega-investment by Chinese investors is a multi-faceted project encompassing mining, power generation, coke production, and steel manufacturing.\n\nOnce fully operational, it will produce stainless steel in phases and is expected to create over 2 000 jobs, significantly addressing employment challenges in the country.\n\nCurrently, over 300 Chinese and 800 Zimbabwean workers  totalling over 1 000 personnel  are already engaged in project implementation, which is at an advanced stage.\n\nUS$3,6 billion Palm River Energy Metallurgical Special Economic Zone project in Beitbridge District\n\nCovering 5 163 hectares, the project will be constructed in five phases over 12 years.The first phase, with a construction period of two years, involves a US$237 million investment and will focus on producing 200 000 tons of ferrochrome annually while supporting coal mining, coking, infrastructure development, and other related projects.\n\nPlans are also underway for the construction of a 1 200MW green power and integrated power generation plant by Zimbabwe Xintai Resources (Pvt) Ltd.\n\nThe new industrial park is expected to contribute more to the provinces economy, Matabeleland region and the country at large through expansion and unlocking of new opportunities for employment, technological advancement, and social development.\n\nIn his keynote address, President Mnangagwa said the investment breakthrough was a direct result of the Second Republics engagement and re-engagement policy, which continues to position Zimbabwe as a favourable investment destination through the normalisation of relations with the global community.\n\nThe thermal power station that is under construction at the Palm River Energy Metallurgical Industrial Industrial Park in Beitbridge\n\nHe commended Zimbabwe Xintai Resources (Pvt) Ltd, under the investment entity Xinganglian (Shanxi) Holding Group Co. Ltd, for its bold decision to invest US$3,6 billion into this metallurgical and energy hub.\n\nIn this regard, it is my expectation that the Palm River Energy Metallurgical Special Economic Zone project will play its part as a critical block for our nations industrialisation and modernisation, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nWe look forward to this project helping to drive our national economy forward and unlocking unprecedented opportunities for employment, technological progress, and social development as we march towards the attainment of Vision 2030.\n\nHe described the initiative as a model of excellence, a beacon of innovation, and a driver of prosperity for future generations.The President reaffirmed his Governments commitment to fostering a conducive environment for investors and emphasised the projects role in the countrys industrialisation and modernisation agenda.\n\nThis ceremony follows hard on the heels of other projects, which are at various stages of implementation since the advent of the Second Republic, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nThe progress we are seeing here is also a positive result of my Governments engagement and re-engagement policy that has led to growing confidence in Zimbabwe as a favorable investment destination.\n\nAs Zimbabwe marches towards 2030, the President invited more companies to grab opportunities offered by Zimbabwe, particularly those from strategic allies such as China and beyond.\n\nHe highlighted the countrys commitment to achieving its ambitious targets by 2030 through increased foreign direct investment as a testimony that indeed, Zimbabwe is Open for Business.\n\nAt the heart of this Special Economic Zone is the integration of energy and metallurgy, two sectors that could redefine Zimbabwes industrial landscape.\n\nThe project prioritises sustainable mining practices, including low greenhouse gas emissions, waste reduction, and energy self-sufficiency through waste recycling.\n\nI applaud the fact that the project targets the production of two million tons of chromium-based materials and one million tons of coke per year, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nAmid the rising demand for minerals and the economic opportunities they represent, he cautioned against potential challenges if the transition to clean energy is not managed responsibly.\n\nThe President noted that the first phase of the project has already made significant progress, with a 100MW thermal power generation plant currently being commissioned.\n\nOf this, 50 MW is expected to be operational by the end of March. Additionally, the coal wash plant, with a 160 000-ton annual capacity, and the chrome smelting plant have been completed.\n\nThe thermal power station that is under construction at the Palm River Energy Metallurgical Industrial Industrial Park in Beitbridge\n\nHe highlighted the importance of technological advancements in mining, urging collaboration between the mining sector, academic institutions, and the Government to support and sustain mining education.\n\nThe partnership between Shanxi Engineering Vocational College and Harare Polytechnic to carry out the College-Enterprise project will go a long way towards upskilling our young people in this sector, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nThe project will provide scholarships for students to study in China in the fields of metallurgy, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering.\n\nUnder the programme, there is scope for the establishment of a Metallurgical Centre of Excellence, with a focus on value addition and beneficiation.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa further encouraged institutions such as the Zimbabwe School of Mines to establish similar partnerships to advance the industry.\n\nTurning to mineral beneficiation, he said Zimbabwe was prioritising investments in exploration and value addition to maximise economic benefits.\n\nIn line with the Africa Mining Vision, mineral value addition ensures that our great motherland, Zimbabwe, derives maximum benefits from our abundant natural resource endowments, said the President.He called on all stakeholders to cooperate to ensure the projects success, urging engineers and workers to recognise their role in shaping Zimbabwes industrial future.\n\nLet us work hand in hand to ensure that the Palm River Energy Metallurgical Special Economic Zone not only succeeds but exceeds expectations. To the engineers and all who will work on this project to bring it to life, know that what you are building is a legacy, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nMy Government is fully in support of this initiative and will move with you for shared success. Let it be a model of excellence, a beacon of innovation, and a driver of prosperity for generations to come.\n\nGovernment declared Beitbridge a Special Economic Zone in 2018 as part of broader strategies to attract more investment to the economy. The SEZ model is designed to boost foreign direct investment, enhance local business competitiveness, and drive economic growth.\n\nVice Presidents Dr Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi, Minister of State for Matabeleland South Provincial Affairs and Devolution Dr Evelyn Ndlovu, Finance Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube, Mines Minister Winston Chitando, Chinese embassy officials, mining sector players, and Beitbridge community leaders also attended the event.\n\n",

            "content": "Sikhulekelani Moyo,[emailprotected]\n\nAs Zimbabwe seeks to capitalise on trade opportunities under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), industrialists are advocating the reduction of production costs to enhance the competitiveness of domestic products.President Mnangagwa has expressed his Governments readiness to address private sector concerns and is actively working on initiatives to promote low-cost production.\n\nThis call comes at a time when the Government is refining its monetary policy to increase the use of the local currency, a key factor in boosting competitiveness.\n\nThe issue of easing the cost burden on businesses was a major topic of discussion last week during the National Competitiveness Commission (NCC) inaugural Competitiveness Summit, which was officially opened by President Mnangagwa.\n\nMr Busisa Moyo\n\nReflecting on the matter, prominent industrialist and CEO of United Refineries Limited Group, Mr Busisa Moyo, emphasised the importance of creating a low-cost environment and highlighted the need to embrace the local ZWG currency to reduce the foreign currency-based cost of doing business.\n\nA low-cost environment that prioritises the ease of doing business is critical for the growth of a manufacturing sector to avoid offshoring of production to cheaper jurisdictions, Mr Moyo posted on his X-handle.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why a local currency is important. The USD destroyed all competitiveness in the last two and half decades and thats why we constantly need tariffs, permits, and other non-tariff barriers (NTBs).According to Mr Moyo, the use of strong currencies, as is the case in Zimbabwe where the United States dollar is dominant, encourages imports, and discourages exports by nature, thereby, engendering a high-cost environment.\n\nEconomist, Mr George Nhepera, concurred saying promoting low-cost production is one of the best strategies to improve competitiveness and economic growth in a global economy.\n\nThis is the strategy currently being followed by China, Japan, and South Korea leading to rapid industrialisation, increased exports, and a high standard of living for its citizens, he said.\n\nWhile it is critical to achieving low-cost production using our currency, which is relatively weaker compared to other international currencies, it should be noted that the best route should be promoting a low-cost production environment through embracing cutting-edge technology in our production and manufacturing systems, said Mr Nhepera.This is the model currently being pursued by the majority of European nations including our neighbors such as South Africa and Botswana.\n\nIts noble to reduce costs through technology rather than through payment of lower wages and salaries using a weaker currency. It affects the morale and dignity of our workforce.Bulawayo businessman, Mr Morris Mpala, said the need for low-cost production holds the key to the future of effective competitiveness of local industries.\n\nHe said the cost of production in Zimbabwe has to be interrogated and solutions proffered to create an enabling environment for such.\n\nOne critical factor is the local currency use, which should be encouraged but should be encouraged when all fundamentals are right for its sole use, said Mr Mpala.\n\nIf we are still in the multi-currency era, we need to let the currency float freely to represent a fair value and thats a start.Some of the issues that affect competitiveness as mentioned by industrialists include the high cost of power, local authority rates, and high cost of compliance, amongst other things.  @SikhulekelaniM1.\n\n",

Their performances captivated the diverse audience, proving their ability to entertain large crowds.\n\nThe event featured stellar performances from Insimbi ZeZhwane, Godolude, Ma9nine, Noluntu J, No Name Dance Crew, and Mzoe7. Each act contributed to making the celebrations unforgettable with a variety of musical genres that resonated with the audience.\n\nExcitement was high among the youth, who not only enjoyed the days activities but also appreciated being recognised as the future of the nation.\n\nIn a show-stopping performance, Noluntu J left the crowd breathless. The young singer took to the stage with confidence and charisma, delivering a set that left everyone on their feet. Her performance was a masterclass in energy and enthusiasm. She performed her hit songs Ispoko and Moko, which had the crowd singing along and dancing to the infectious beats. Her outfit, a stunning denim jumpsuit paired with flying hair, added to her overall stage presence, making her a joy to watch.\n\nGovernment officials present at the event were equally impressed, rising to their feet to give Noluntu J a standing ovation after her performance.\n\nI was overwhelmed by the response, Noluntu J said in an interview after the show.It was my first time performing before such a huge crowd, and I didnt know what to expect.Despite admitting to initial stage fright, Noluntu J credited the other artistes who performed before her for helping to calm her nerves and warm up the crowd.\n\nThe other artistes really helped me to relax and get into the zone. By the time I got on stage, I felt like I was ready to take on the world. I defeated my stage fright and gave it my all.\n\nInsimbi ZeZhwane on stage file picture\n\nAs soon as Mzoe7 stepped onto the stage, he commanded attention, demonstrating his widespread popularity among young people nationwide. His surprise performance followed an outstanding act by Ma9nine, further igniting the crowds energy.Dressed in his signature trendy attire, Mzoe7 was joined on stage by the No Name Dance Crew, whose eye-catching outfits creatively fused workwear with contemporary fashion. Their dynamic performance left the audience in awe, particularly students who were thrilled to witness Mzoe7 live.\n\nAlice Mukombe, a student from Bindura University, expressed her excitement, saying, I always watched Mzoe7s music videos on Channel O, and I never imagined I would see him perform live. He is truly talented  one might even mistake him for a South African artiste. Hes the best I have seen in his genre. Melusi Hlabangana, a student from St Columbus in Bulawayo, described the event as his best Youth Day celebration yet.\n\nI enjoyed all the performances. As someone passionate about music, this event really showed me that theres a future in the arts. This was the best Youth Day ever, he said.\n\nAfter his set, Mzoe7 spoke on the importance of supporting the arts, highlighting how many individuals have found purpose and livelihood within the industry. He also stressed that artistes serve as cultural and tourism ambassadors, sharing Zimbabwes heritage, fashion, landscapes, and stories with the world through various artistic expressions such as music, visual arts, poetry, and dance.\n\nNo Name Dance Crew\n\nOther notable performances came from Rhumba artistes Godolude and Insimbi ZeZhwane. Godolude and his team delivered an engaging performance, captivating the audience with their impressive dance moves.\n\nHowever, Insimbi ZeZhwanes performance, which followed shortly after, faced challenges. A noticeable drop in sound quality affected their set, although the technical issues seemed isolated as other acts performed without difficulties. The audience only fully re-engaged when the group performed Child Abuse, popularly known as Jeremiah.\n\nOverall, the National Youth Day celebrations were a resounding success, with Bulawayo artistes proving once again that they have what it takes to shine on major platforms.\n\n",

It is, therefore, significant that the President is coming to join the Namibian nation at the memorial service on 28 February, which will be followed by the burial on 1 March.\n\nAmb Chaurura said Dr Nujomas death was a heavy blow to the Namibian people, coming just a year after the death of the countrys third President, Hage Geingob.\n\nYou can feel it, you could tell from the way the news was received that it was profound, especially considering that President Nujoma was not only a former President but the founding father of Namibia.\n\nIt is no wonder he has also been declared the father of the Namibian nation, said Amb Chaurura.It has been a very difficult time for the people of Namibia, but the prevailing sentiment is that of continuing the struggle started by the late founding father. The people are determined not to betray the spirit of liberation ignited during the fight for independence.\n\nAmb Chaurura said Zimbabwe looked forward to deepening bilateral ties with Namibia, building on the solid foundation laid by their forebears and advancing beyond political freedom towards economic emancipation.\n\nOur cooperation with Namibia is strong, but we are working hard to ensure that we fully leverage our solid bilateral relations to enhance business and trade cooperation, she said.\n\nWe still have much work to do to achieve that goal, and we are grateful that Namibia has provided Zimbabwe with a Dry Port. This will help us realise our vision for regional integration, boosting trade and economic relations between the two countries and across the SADC region.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nReacting to the late Dr Nujomas death, President Mnangagwa described the veteran nationalist, who led Namibia from 1990 to 2005, as the last in an iconic generation of leaders of our liberation movements and nations of our Southern Africa region.\n\nHe also hailed the liberation icons unwavering dedication to the liberation of Namibia and his commitment to the unity of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).\n\nWe hurt and grieve deeply at the passing on of this gallant freedom fighter and visionary icon who led and delivered independence and nationhood to the Namibian people, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe acknowledged Dr Nujomas steadfast support for Zimbabwe, particularly during the Land Reform Programme, when he stood by Harare despite international pressure.\n\nZimbabwe will always remember and cherish Dr Nujomas principled and unconditional support as our nation faced concerted onslaught by vindictive countries of the West, said the President.\n\nHe said Dr Nujomas legacy was that of a true Pan-Africanist, who championed the independence and sovereignty of African nations and that Africa must remain vigilant against new challenges of resource-induced encroachments.\n\n",

The families involved are experiencing immense emotional turmoil, hence swift resolution is essential to provide closure and begin the healing process for these families.\n\nAs we reported yesterday, the incident, which caused considerable upset and concern, prompted the Ministry of Health and Child Care to thoroughly review procedures at the hospital, and the public awaits the outcome of the investigation with keen interest.\n\nDeputy Minister of Health and Child Care, Sleiman Kwidini, speaking after a tour of UBH last Thursday, said the ministry is still dealing with the matter and will leave no stone unturned. He acknowledged that while the families involved have been reunited, the incident is unacceptable and must never happen again.\n\nThat matter is still under investigation, but I can assure the nation that the findings will be made public. If charges are to be brought against anyone found guilty, they will be. And if it is proven that it was simply a mistake without ill intent, the public will also be informed. It must be clear that this matter will not be swept under the carpet, Deputy Minister Kwidini said.\n\nIncidents like these can severely undermine public trust in healthcare institutions. Expediting the investigation and transparently sharing the findings will help restore confidence in the hospitals ability to provide safe and reliable care. It demonstrates accountability and a commitment to preventing future occurrences.\n\nDetermining the root cause of the baby swap is necessary to hold any responsible parties accountable. Whether it was due to negligence, procedural lapses, or other factors, identifying and addressing these issues is crucial to ensuring justice for the affected families and upholding ethical standards in healthcare.\n\nA thorough and prompt investigation will help identify gaps in the hospitals procedures and protocols. This information is vital for implementing corrective measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. Ensuring that staff are adequately trained and that robust checks are in place can significantly reduce the risk of such errors.\n\nThe broader community needs reassurance that their healthcare system is reliable and that such incidents are taken seriously. Expediting the investigation and communicating the steps being taken to address the issue can help alleviate public anxiety and reinforce the hospitals commitment to patient safety.\n\nAs we have argued before, expediting the investigation into the baby-swapping incident at UBH is essential for the emotional well-being of the affected families, restoring public trust, ensuring legal and ethical accountability, implementing preventive measures, and reassuring the community. The Government and hospital authorities must prioritise this investigation to address the immediate concerns and prevent future occurrences.\n\n",
