Transport operators continued to ply their routes without disruption and the city centre was a hive of activity in the afternoon.\n\nEarlier in the morning, Tshova Mubaiwa Transport Co-operative chief executive officer, Mr Ndaba Masunda, reassured commuters that there would be no interruption in transport services.\n\nWe did not withdraw our vehicles, we are operating normally as per our timetable and routes. We have no reason to ground our fleet, said Mr Masunda.\n\nA Chronicle news crew visited western suburbs to assess the situation and observed residents going about their daily routines undisturbed. In Cowdray Park, vendors set up their stalls at designated sites around 10AM, resuming their trade without incident.\n\nI wasnt sure what to expect in the morning, especially after what happened last time when shops were looted and cars were burnt. But after seeing that the situation was calm and the police were out in full force, I came to my stall, and its business as usual, said a vendor at the terminus site.\n\nAt Entumbane, Sai Mart Supermarket opened at its usual opening time, serving customers without interruption. Similarly, in Mpopoma, near the Western Commonage Magistrates Court, vendors and shops were fully operational. A similar atmosphere was observed at New Lobengula and the popular koChigumira Shopping Centre in Luveve, where businesses opened their doors to customers. In the city centre, big supermarkets, including OK Zimbabwe, Pick n Pay and Greens were open throughout the day.\n\nIn the Midlands Province, a peaceful atmosphere prevailed in Gweru as residents ignored calls for protests. Minister of State for Midlands Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Owen Ncube, later addressed the media, saying the planned demonstrations had failed to materialise.\n\nI have checked the situation and all districts have reported that its peaceful and people are going about their business,he said.\n\nMinister Ncube said the agenda of the countrys detractors who are calling for the demonstrations, is to disturb the prevailing peace and tranquility that the country is enjoying.\n\nOur people, who have a well-documented history of fighting colonialism know the value of peace and will never be part of this subversive agenda, he said.\n\nMinister Ncube said they will continue to stand with President Mnangagwa to lead the country adding that any attempts to remove a constitutionally elected Government is an insurrection and will be regarded as subversion.\n\nI therefore urge the entire Midlands community including business, public and private sector workers, residents, church fraternity, vendors and civic society to ignore the calls from these misguided individuals who want to destabilise the country, he said.\n\nMinister Ncube said Zimbabwe in general and the Midlands Province in particular, remains united, resolute in support of President Mnangagwas leadership.\n\nIt is, therefore, business as usual here in the Midlands province. Our security sector is on high alert and will deal decisively with any malcontents bent on undermining security, peace and tranquillity being enjoyed by our law-abiding citizens, he said.\n\nIn small towns such as Tsholotsho the shops and other businesses were open.\n\nMr Melusi Ndebele, who runs a lodge and a grocery shop at the business centre, said it was business as usual.\n\nThings are normal here, there was a slow start but shops are open, said Mr Ndebele.Police also issued a statement in the morning urging citizens to go about their normal business as their safety was not only assured but guaranteed.\n\nAt the weekend, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Dr Jenfan Muswere urged Zimbabweans to go about their business saying law-enforcement agents were on high alert to guarantee security and ensure peace across the country.\n\nHe urged Zimbabweans to ignore calls for protests that are being made by cyber terrorists and fanned through social media, saying the countrys security sector is well-equipped to deal with any mischief.\n\n",

            "content": "Mbulelo Mpofu,Zimpapers Arts and Entertainment Hub\n\nJust when it seemed that the heated debate surrounding the US$150 cover band tariff imposed by the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (Zimura) had settled following a recent dialogue, new developments have reignited tensions.\n\nThe National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) intervened yesterday, calling for the suspension of the contentious fee, but Zimura remains resolute in its stance.\n\nThis dispute stems from Zimuras decision to impose a US$150 licensing fee per show for cover bands, a sharp increase from the previous annual fee of US$50. This move comes despite a meeting two weeks ago that brought together key stakeholders, including representatives from NACZ, Zimura, academics, associations, unions, composers, cover band leaders and intellectual property beneficiaries. Discussions focused on establishing a fair and sustainable tariff structure for cover bands operating in Zimbabwe.\n\nAccording to NACZ, following lobbying from various music institutions addressing concerns over Zimuras proposed tariff, NACZ facilitated what seemed like a productive dialogue with Zimura and other music industry stakeholders. Following the meeting, NACZ expressed satisfaction with the progress and stated that Zimura had shown a willingness to reconsider the fee structure if proper lobbying processes were followed, including direct engagement with composers whose music is performed by cover bands.\n\nLast week, on March 27, NACZ followed this up with a meeting with representatives of copyright holders, who strongly expressed their views on the matter and challenged both NACZ and Zimura to arrive at a solution that holistically protects their rights, ensures copyright infringement is taken seriously and guarantees fair compensation.\n\nThe conclusion was that, at the wider consultation, users of copyrights would be adequately educated on the sanctity of copyrights and their views would be respected. They believe the $150 tariff should be the entry level, and Zimura should charge more for bigger concerts.\n\nNACZ said they had shared with Zimura their intention to invite rights users for this engagement before convening a broader dialogue forum.\n\nHowever, in an unexpected turn of events, Zimura issued a public notice on Friday, reaffirming its stance.\n\nEffective immediately, all performers and organisers must obtain the necessary licences before staging any event featuring protected musical works, Zimura communicated on their social media platforms.\n\nThey also warned they would be conducting nationwide monitoring in collaboration with law enforcement agencies, with legal action against those found violating copyright regulations.\n\nIn response, through a statement issued on Monday, March 31, NACZ executive director Napoleon Nyanhi, criticised the tariff, labelling it punitive. He raised concerns over its implementation process, the change in licence periods and its deviation from international best practices.\n\nNapoleon Napster Nyanhi\n\nFollowing this, NACZ suspended all directives regarding the US$150 tariff, pending further discussions and negotiations.\n\n. . . All directives for payment of the $150 tariff are suspended immediately, pending the conclusion of the registration, dialogue and negotiation processes, Nyanhi said in the statement.\n\nHe also directed Zimura to regularise its registration with NACZ as an arts association.\n\nWe direct that the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association regularises its registration with the NACZ as an arts association, in line with the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe Act Chapter 25:07, read in conjunction with section fourof Statutory Instrument 87 of 2006.\n\nThe National Arts Council of Zimbabwe takes seriously its mandate to foster, develop, and improve the knowledge, understanding, and practice of the arts in Zimbabwe, concluded Nyanhi in the statement.\n\nIn response, Zimbabwe Musicians Union (Zimu) founding president, Edith WeUtonga Katiji, welcomed NACZs intervention.\n\nWe are grateful for this stance by NACZ. It reinforces our concerns about Zimuras mismanagement. In the coming weeks, the real issues surrounding Zimura must be exposed in the best interests of the Zimbabwean music sector. They have acted in bad faith, and this must stop, she said.\n\nHowever, Zimuras executive director, Polisile Ncube-Chimhini, dismissed NACZs position, asserting that Zimura is not legally obligated to register with NACZ.\n\nThe NACZs press statement has no bearing on us. We are not an arts organisation; we are a royalty-collecting body registered under the Companies and Intellectual Property Office of Zimbabwe (CIPZ), a department within the Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs.\n\nWe do not report to the Ministry of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture.\n\nIn apparent response to Nyanhis claim that Zimura had been engaged regarding the meeting with rightsholders, Ncube-Chimhini said: We were not engaged in any discussions  NACZ simply posted their statement on social media. This holds no legal weight for us. We see this as more of a rant than a directive, she said.\n\nZimuras Board echoed this stance, stating that NACZ had misrepresented the legal requirements governing the organisation.\n\nZimura has operated for 43 years without NACZ registration because it has never been a statutory requirement. We are not obligated to register under two separate Acts of Parliament, the board asserted in a statement.\n\nAs NACZ attempts to mediate the issue, striking a balance between protecting copyright holders and fostering artistic growth remains a challenge.
