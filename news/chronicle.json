The country shares six transboundary aquifers with neighbouring countries, including South Africa and Mozambique.\n\nWe applaud efforts by the SADC Groundwater Management Institute in initiating regional cooperation and management of these transboundary aquifers through research, capacity building and joint monitoring initiatives, Prof Jiri added.\n\nHe further emphasised the importance of leveraging technology to sustainably manage groundwater resources.\n\nUnlike surface water, groundwater is a hidden resource that, when not sustainably managed, is almost impossible to restore. Investing in technologies that monitor groundwater in real-time will aid in better understanding and managing this finite resource, he explained.\n\nEfforts are also underway to establish a National Groundwater Database.\n\nThe Zimbabwe National Water Authority has already taken the lead by digitising what was once a paper-based groundwater database, Prof Jiri said, noting that fragmented groundwater data remains a challenge.\n\nHe concluded by urging stakeholders to work towards a sustainable future.\n\nLet us all strive for universal access to safe drinking water and encourage each other to sustainably manage our groundwater as we transform Zimbabwe into an upper middle-income economy by 2030, he said.\n\n",

This oversight increased scrutiny of the councils curation of the event and sparked a call for broader representation in the arts.\n\nResponding to these concerns, Town Clerk Christopher Dube announced via social media that this years festival will welcome not only musicians, dancers, and poets but also visual artists, sculptors, culinary artists, and craftspeople. This expanded focus aims to create a more diverse and vibrant artistic representation, allowing all forms of creativity to shine.\n\nThe invitation is to artists in visual arts, music, dance, poetry, theatre, culinary arts, crafts, sculpture, Dube stated.\n\nArtistes interested in participating are encouraged to submit their proposals to the City Councils Arts, Culture and Heritage Office, headed by the multi-talented Nomashawekazi Lady Tshawe Damasane.\n\nProposals can also be sent via email to[emailprotected]. The submission deadline is February 28, with the festival scheduled to take place from June 2 to June 5.\n\nThe BAF has a significant place in the cultural calendar of Bulawayo, especially since the City officially declared June 2 as Bulawayo Day in 2019, marking the beginning of an annual Arts Festival week.\n\nLast years theme, #RESTART, aimed to rejuvenate the arts scene post-pandemic, and this years event is expected to build on that momentum.\n\nThis call will surely leave local creatives hopeful that this years inclusive approach will foster a vibrant artistic community, showcasing the full spectrum of talent that Bulawayo has to offer.\n\n Follow on X @MbuleloMpofu\n\n",
