Emerging as the 2nd Runner-Up Mister Africa International, Mister Southern Africa International, and Heart of Africa, Nyonis achievements highlight his status as a trailblazer in the modeling industry.\n\nThe Mister Africa International 2024 pageant, which took place from Saturday night to the early hours of Sunday, was not just a beauty contest but a comprehensive evaluation of contestants abilities in community engagement, public speaking, talent showcases, and charity initiatives. These challenges aim to foster social responsibility and leadership among participants, making the accolades even more significant.\n\nNyoni, hailing from the breathtaking Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe, has already built an impressive modeling career, previously holding titles such as Mister Zimbabwe and Mister Southern Africa. His latest triumph at Mister Africa 2024 further cements his position as a prominent figure representing Zimbabwe and Southern Africa on the international stage.\n\nThe timing of the pageant coincided with Unity Day in Zimbabwe, a moment that resonated with Nyonis personal mantra, Together we can. This motto underscores the importance of unity and collective action, values that Nyoni embodies through both his modeling career and philanthropic efforts.\n\nExpressing his gratitude, Nyoni said, I extend my sincerest gratitude to the organizers of the Mister Africa International 2024 pageant and the incredible team at House of Twitch for their tireless efforts in making this event a resounding success. Their dedication and passion for African excellence shone brightly throughout the pageant, and I am honored to have been a part of it.\n\nReflecting on his experience, Nyoni noted, Participating in Mister Africa 2024 was truly enriching. I immersed myself in Africas rich cultural heritage, forged lasting bonds with my fellow contestants, and was inspired by their remarkable stories. It was a regal experience, and I am deeply honored to have been part of it.\n\nNyoni also emphasised the importance of maintaining connections with his fellow contestants, stating, We have formed a strong bond, and I am excited to see the amazing things we will achieve together in the future.\n\nBeyond his modeling accolades, Nyoni is a committed philanthropist, focusing on advocating for refugee education. He is actively supporting the construction of classrooms in refugee camps in partnership with the PAWA Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to empowering vulnerable communities across Africa.\n\nEducation is the cornerstone of unlocking human potential, Nyoni asserted.\n\nI urge everyone to join me in supporting this noble cause. Together, we can create a brighter future for these deserving children and empower them to become the leaders of tomorrow.\n\nNyonis stunning success at Mister Africa 2024 is a resounding testament to his exceptional talent, relentless work ethic, and commitment to making a positive impact. This achievement comes on the heels of another remarkable performance by Zimbabwean beauty, Miss Universe Zimbabwe Sakhile Dube, who made it to the Top 30 semifinal of the Miss Universe pageant, narrowly missing the Top 12.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues to make waves on the global stage, Future Nyonis accomplishments signal a bright future for the nation in the world of modeling and beyond.\n\nFollow on X @MbuleloMpofu\n\n",

This leaves us with the responsibility to help these families, as they also deserve to enjoy the Christmas holidays. We are happy with the response from the Gweru community towards this worthy cause, he said.\n\nThe Gweru community was amazed by the various activities on display during the fun-filled day.\n\nGweru resident Nobetter Chiweshe said, Its been an amazing experience watching the spins.

But an aviation expert suggested that cause seemed unlikely.\n\nOfficials did not immediately explain why it had crossed the sea, but the crash came shortly after drone strikes hit southern Russia. Drone activity has shut airports in the area in the past and the nearest Russian airport on the planes flight path was closed on Wednesday morning.\n\nAzerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev said according to information he had received, the plane changed course due to poor weather, but he added the cause of the crash was unknown and must be fully investigated.\n\nThis is a great tragedy that has become a tremendous sorrow for the Azerbaijani people, he said.\n\nVideo of the crash showed the plane descending rapidly before bursting into flames as it hit the seashore, and thick black smoke then rising. Bloodied and bruised passengers could be seen stumbling from a piece of the fuselage that had remained intact.\n\nA map showing the path a passengers jet took from Azerbaijan to Russia, including a length stretch where the exact path was unknown before it crashed.\n\nReuters was able to verify from visible landmarks that the video was filmed on the Caspian shore near Aktau.\n\nSixty-two passengers and five crew were aboard. The death toll was disclosed by Deputy Prime Minister Kanat Bozumbayev in a meeting with an Azerbaijani delegation in Aktau, Russian news agency Interfax reported.\n\nKazakhstans emergencies ministry said in a statement that fire services had put out the blaze and that the survivors, including two children, were being treated at a nearby hospital. The bodies of the dead were being recovered.\n\nAzerbaijan Airlines said the Embraer 190 jet was flying from Baku to Grozny, capital of the Chechnya region in southern Russia, but had been forced to make an emergency landing around 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from Aktau in Kazakhstan.\n\nPreliminary: after a collision with birds, due to an emergency situation on board, its commander decided to go to an alternate airfield  Aktau was chosen, Russias aviation watchdog said on Telegram.\n\nBut a collision with birds typically results in the plane landing in the nearest available field, said Richard Aboulafia, analyst at consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory. You can lose control of the plane, but you dont fly wildly off course as a consequence.\n\nRUSSIAN AIRPORT ON FLIGHT PATH WAS SHUT\n\nAktau is on the opposite shore of the Caspian Sea from Azerbaijan and Russia. Commercial aviation-tracking websites tracked the flight flying north on its scheduled route along the west coast before its flight path was no longer recorded. It then reappeared on the east coast, circling near Aktau airport before crashing into the beach.\n\nAuthorities in two Russian regions adjacent to Chechnya, Ingushetia and North Ossetia, reported drone strikes on Wednesday morning.\n\nAn official at Makhachkala airport in Russia on the west coast of the Caspian, the airport closest to where the flight disappeared from tracking, told Reuters it had been closed to incoming traffic for several hours on Wednesday morning. Reuters could not immediately reach officials at the airport in Grozny.\n\nAuthorities in Kazakhstan said a government commission had been set up to investigate what had happened and its members ordered to fly to the site and ensure that the families of the dead and injured were getting the help they needed.\n\nKazakhstan would cooperate with Azerbaijan on the investigation, the government said. Azerbaijan Airlines suspended flights from Baku to Russias Chechnya region until the investigation is complete. Russias state TASS news agency reported, citing the company.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin expressed his condolences. Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, had decided to return home from Russia where he had been due to attend a summit on Wednesday, his office said.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya, expressed his condolences in a statement and said some of those being treated in hospital were in an extremely serious condition and that he and others would pray for their rapid recovery.\n\nIn a statement, planemaker Embraer expressed its condolences and said it would support authorities efforts.\n\nThe Reuters Daily Briefing newsletter provides all the news you need to start your day.

Some are heading to rural areas while others are travelling between cities. Our message is clear. We want safety on the roads and as such we should all observe road rules and regulations to avoid accidents. We should reduce the carnage on our roads cause mainly by reckless driving,said Comm Makamache.\n\nHe attributed most road accidents to human negligence and urged citizens to remain vigilant, especially during this festive season.\n\nComm Makamache also warned against criminal activities, noting that some individuals exploit the festive season to commit crimes like robbery and rape.\n\nTo the ordinary people, we say zero tolerance to crime. Criminals should watch out as we are in full force and our message is clearrespect human life, he said.\n\nTSC board member Mrs Tambudzai Madzivire emphasised the importance of driving to arrive safely.\n\nWe are here to promote road safety. Safety should always come first because there is no second chance if you fail to drive safely. We urge drivers to remain alert, avoid fatigue and be cautious of hazards like cattle on the roads, she said.\n\nMrs Madzivire said accidents cause economic losses and also strain the healthcare services.\n\nPublic service vehicle driver Mr Mengezi Ncube commended the campaign, stressing the need for adherence to road safety measures.\n\nThis campaign is crucial as it reminds us to drive safely by observing road rules and regulations. Potholes however remain a major concern, especially at night as drivers often try to avoid them resulting in them encroaching onto the lane of traffic coming from the opposite direction, he said.\n\nDuring the campaign motorists were given Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development fliers on the 10-point Decade of Action for Road Safety tips. The tips are: dont drink and drive, avoid using cellphones while driving, ensure your vehicle is roadworthy, obey road signs and markings, check tyre pressure regularly, carry a reflective triangle and vest, have a spare wheel, spanner and jack, take frequent rest breaks, invest in a fire extinguisher and obey the speed limit.\n\n-@nqotshili\n\n",

This has drastically reduced cases of recidivism.\n\nThe establishment of community correctional centres will therefore speed up the inmates reintegration into society while at the same time reducing overcrowding in prisons.\n\nWe want to commend the Justice Ministry and ZPCS for their commitment to transform our prisons into rehabilitation centres for inmates as opposed to places to punish prisoners as was the case before independence.\n\nZimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS)\n\nPrisoners under the present system are given another chance to contribute to the development of their communities using skills gained while in prison.\n\nPrisons across the country are running thriving farming projects and as such many of them are producing food not just for their own consumption but surplus, for sale.\n\nThe ZPCS is therefore saving Government a lot of money by producing food and other provisions for inmates such as uniforms.\n\nWe want at this juncture to implore communities to embrace the establishment of correctional centres in their areas to facilitate inmates quick reintegration into society.\n\n",

            "content": "Innocent Kurira,[emailprotected]\n\nHIGHLANDERS 18-year wait for the league title can only be ended by improving the quality of players in the squad, according to two-time league championship winner, Noah Muvindi.\n\nMuvindi had exciting moments in his career, especially with the Bulawayo giants, which saw him lifting two consecutive Premiership championships and many other trophies in 2001 and 2002.\n\nMuvindi is now a keen observer of the local football scene and attributes Bossos struggles to lack of quality players.\n\nTo be honest, Bosso have not had the quality players needed to compete for the league title. When you look at the starting 11 and then the bench, there is a clear lack of depth that can win you a league title. During our days you had two quality players battling for each position, which is not the case now. For example, I personally had Gift Lunga (Jnr) as my competition for the left-back position and sometimes the coach would have a headache on who should start and would ask us to agree on who was to start. I dont think the players the team has now are the quality which can win you a championship, said Muvindi.\n\nHe believes that a strong and balanced squad is essential for winning the league and unfortunately, Bosso have been lacking in that department.\n\nMuvindis comments come at a time when Bosso fans are eagerly waiting for the team to reclaim its former glory.\n\nWith the teams rich history and passionate fan base, there is no doubt that Bosso has the potential to dominate the local football scene once again.\n\nHowever, according to Muvindi, this will require significant investment to get quality players.\n\nBosso needs to attract and retain top talent if they want to compete with the best teams in the league, said Muvindi who started his career at Giants in Division One before moving to Buffaloes two years later.\n\nHe believes Bossos player exodus in 2003 disrupted their dominance in the league and Caf Champions League.\n\nThe team lost Adam Ndlovu (late) and Stewart Murisa, who both joined South African clubs. The following season, it was worse because the team lost Dazzy Kapenya, Thabani Masawi, Siza Khoza, Charles Chilufya, Blessing Gumiso and myself, he said.\n\nThe late Warriors striker Adam Ndlovu\n\nHighlanders quest for league glory is set to suffer a major setback before the start of the next campaign as they are set to lose key players to newly-promoted Scottland FC.\n\nPeter Muduhwa, Godfrey Makaruse, Lynoth Chikuhwa and Marvelous Chigumira are reportedly bound for Scottland FC, leaving Bosso with a daunting task of finding suitable replacements.\n\nThis development comes at a time when Highlanders were showing signs of improvement, particularly in their attacking play.\n\nIn the 2024 season, they scored 43 goals, the third-highest tally in the league.\n\nThe teams attacking prowess was further emphasised by their player, Chikuhwa, winning the Golden Boot award after scoring 17 goals.\n\nLynoth Chikuhwa\n\nHowever, defensive frailties remain a major concern, with Highlanders boasting the 11th-best defence in the league.\n\nThe loss of key players will undoubtedly exacerbate this problem, and Bosso will need to spend money on the transfer market or promote from their development sides to beef up their defence.\n\nThe club leadership is on record stating that they will be beefing up their squad ahead of next season. @innocentskizoe\n\n",
