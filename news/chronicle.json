He was 100 years old.\n\nMr Moyo dedicated his life selflessly to the liberation of Zimbabwe and the empowerment of its people. His unwavering commitment to the struggle for freedom resulted in his imprisonment for life by the Smith regime  a sacrifice emblematic of his deep love for the nation. His contributions remain a proud part of Zimbabwes history, said his great grandson and family spokesperson Mr Mkhululi Chimoio.\n\nMr Chimoio said his great grandfather was a local businessman in Mawabeni who was passionate about uplifting the lives of local community members.\n\nBeyond his role in the liberation movement, Mr Moyo was a pillar of the business sector, playing a significant role in uplifting communities through economic empowerment and business development, with many families benefiting from his wisdom, leadership, and foresight,\n\nMoyo, who was a branch treasurer of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU) at the time, was 50 years old when he was sentenced following the alleged shooting of a white storekeeper, Mr Leonard Ashly, at Mbalabala on July 7, 1976.\n\nThe Rhodesian media reported that three freedom fighters had asked Moyo for food and shelter, and he harboured them at his home for four nights. The reports further alleged that on the fourth day, the freedom fighters murdered a white storekeeper not far from Moyos village.\n\nIn a story titled This man lost all  through helping the terrorists, Moyo was accused of making his family suffer by risking his business, losing his $50-a-week job, and selling cattle to pay $700 for lawyers fees.\n\nThe storys first line read: Elias Njani Moyo, who is 50 years old, has recently lost everything he has striven for in life because he gave help to some terrorists.\n\nSuch stories were obviously meant to deter the black majority from helping or supporting freedom fighters.\n\nThe majority Government eventually pardoned Moyo after independence, and his upcoming 100th birthday is a testament to his resilience and the long struggle for justice and freedom.\n\nMany freedom fighters were imprisoned under harsh conditions by the Rhodesian regime, which sought to maintain white minority rule.\n\n",

Its entertainment. I dont write with the aim of teaching a lesson, she said. But if people take something meaningful from it, then Im happy, she said\n\nHer writing, however, is anything but surface-level.\n\nIn Heart in Two 2, Maphosa dives deep into grief, betrayal, loyalty, the haunting weight of secrets and the power of forgiveness.\n\nHer characters wrestle with not just matters of the heart, but also generational trauma, hidden legacies and the burden of blood ties.\n\nThese stories are fiction, yes, but theyre also a mirror. They are a reflection of the emotional reality many people live in silence, she said.\n\nReflecting on her previous works, Maphosa discussed the themes explored in her different books.\n\nIn The Y in Your Man is Silent series, she delves into the intricacies of relationships marked by infidelity, offering a rare perspective on the experience of being the other woman.\n\nThrough the eyes of a young woman entangled with a married man, Maphosa examines the emotional tension, identity struggles, and battles with self-worth that unfold in the shadows of secrecy.\n\nThe Y in Your Man is Silent navigates the blurred lines between love, desire and deception, revealing how loyalty and morality are tested when emotions run deep.\n\nThe Grasping at Straws series explores the clash between tradition and progress within a rural village context. It highlights the challenges of navigating patriarchal systems upheld by tradition, while striving for agency, education and self-determination. Themes of gender inequality, cultural expectations, the spiritual weight of ancestral beliefs, forgiveness, piety, and the role of African Traditional Religion are tackled, illustrating the deep emotional and cultural conflicts faced by those attempting to break free from societal constraints.\n\nIn the Heart in Two series, Maphosa explores the emotional and psychological aftermath of trauma, focusing on how violence, family secrets, betrayal, grief, and unresolved pain affect personal growth and relationships. The series delves into the complexities of gang life and social unrest, weaving themes of forgiveness, redemption, and resilience. It also explores the emotional challenge of being torn between two relationships and how love can develop across social divides and defy expectations. Heart in Two offers a powerful exploration of the emotional endurance required to confront the past, heal and move forward.\n\nMaphosa is also a dedicated literary mentor and advocate for emerging voices, passionate about making literature more accessible and relatable. Through initiatives like the Luvone Writing Competition, masterclasses, and regular X (Twitter) Spaces, she nurtures new talent and champions authentic African storytelling.\n\nMaphosa is a recipient of the Outstanding Author Award at the Zimbabwe Achievers Awards and Outstanding Literary Work at the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards. These accolades recognise her compelling storytelling, cultural authenticity, and invaluable contributions to shaping modern African literature.\n\nOn the topic of adapting her books for the screen, she remains hopeful.Its still a dream at this point, but I have a good feeling. It will happen in due time, she said.\n\nCurrently, shes working on the third instalment of her acclaimed series: The y in your man is silent and on a non-fiction memoir reflecting on her childhood.\n\nMaphosas books are available in major bookstores in South Africa, online retailers such as TakeALot, Amazon and from book stores in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini (Swaziland).\n\nReaders can interact with Yvonne Maphosa on social media:Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook: @Yvonne_Maphosa.\n\n-@TeamKarubwa\n\n",
