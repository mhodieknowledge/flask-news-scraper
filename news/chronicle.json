            "content": "Nqobile Bhebhe,[emailprotected]\n\nBULAWAYOS manufacturing sector is experiencing a significant resurgence, driven by substantial capital investments from leading companies such as Treger Group, Edgars Stores Carousel Manufacturing, Arenel, Datlabs, and Innscor Africa Limited.\n\nThese investments, focused on retooling and enhancing production efficiencies, are paying off, with companies reporting increased capacity utilisation, job retention, and export growth.\n\nThe re-industrialisation drive is a key pillar of the Governments National Development Strategy (NDS), which aims to achieve an upper-middle-income economy by 2030.\n\nPermanent Secretary for Presidential Affairs and Devolution, Engineer Tafadzwa Muguti, recently visited top companies in Bulawayo and noted that the Governments business-friendly policies and incentives were yielding positive results.\n\nAs a result, Bulawayo is slowly regaining lost ground after years of failed attempts to reverse de-industrialisation and bring about sustainable business viability.\n\nTreger Group, a shining example of Bulawayos manufacturing potential, has invested US$4,5 million in modernising its production plants.\n\nTreger Group managing director, Mr Fitzpatrick Mawovera, stated: We aim to be one of the leading manufacturers not only in Zimbabwe but in the region.\n\nHe, however, appealed for Government intervention to regulate cheap imports and the informal sector, which provides unfair competition.\n\nHowever, there are issues that we would want authorities to look into. Cheap imports are coming into the country. We need that space to be regulated. The informal sector is growing and is unregulated, providing unfair competition, he said.\n\nMr Mawovera appealed for further Government intervention in the rollout of industrial incentives to accelerate the retooling drive.\n\nWe also want companies to be incentivised to employ bigger numbers and have access to cheaper loans to further retool factories, he said.\n\nThe Treger Group has become the largest manufacturer of household, industrial and hardware appliances in Africa through its different divisions.\n\nThe group is one of the largest manufacturers of window frames, door frames, wheelbarrows, geysers, kitchen furniture, and painted and galvanised hardware to the building and allied industries. Its products are of high quality and conform to the Standards Association of Zimbabwe (SAZ) standards.\n\nThe company also exports to several countries in Southern Africa and beyond.\n\nCarousel Manufacturing, another major player, has seen production units growing to 2 500 daily, up from less than 200 units a few years ago, following a US$1 million capital investment.\n\nDirector, Menfree Tanyanyiwa attributed the growth to an aggressive retooling exercise aimed at increasing capacity, efficiency, and product quality.\n\nWe have been interacting with customers in the retail sector for the last eight or so years, and recently we went on a very aggressive re-tooling exercise, mainly aimed at increasing capacity, improving efficiency, and improving the quality of our product. That exercise is still ongoing, he said.\n\nWe still have a few more pieces of machinery that we want to acquire, and we are hoping that in the first half of the year, funds permitting, we will be able to source it.\n\nWe are currently pursuing the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe facility, and we are hoping to use the funds to acquire the last pieces of the machinery.\n\nOn production, Mr Tanyanyiwa said the broader aim is to get back to 1999 levels when the firm used to produce 100 000 units a month, and expressed confidence in reaching the volumes. In terms of employment levels, the bulk of approximately 700 workers are females constituting 60 percent.\n\nHe indicated that upgrading the laundry machine was being prioritised at an estimated cost of US$260 000, and the cutting room solution at US$250 000.\n\nPresident Mnangagwas commissioning of the new Bakers Inn factory in the Belmont industrial area last year, where Innscor Group invested nearly US$30 million, is a testament to the Governments efforts to revive Bulawayos industrial sector.\n\nEng Muguti noted that Edgars, which had downsized to about 30 employees, now employs 700 people in its Bulawayo plant, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Governments policies.\n\nAs we know, Bulawayo used to be the hub of industrial activity. One of the things we have seen is that Government policies are working, he said.\n\nBulawayos de-industrialisation, exacerbated by Western sanctions, has been reversed, with several companies reviving operations and increasing production.\n\nThe Governments assistance in retooling and diversifying operating models has led to significant job creation and economic growth.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Commerces allocation of ZWG509 million for implementation of the Zimbabwe Industrial Reconstruction and Growth Plan (2024-2025) will further enhance re-industrialisation programmes.\n\n",

It takes a dedicated person who is willing to sacrifice personal interests for the greater interests of the nation at large, he said.\n\nToday, I stand before you as a proud demonstration of what it means to overcome hardship and adversity. I want to encourage each one of you not to give up on your dreams no matter how impossible they might seem to be.\n\nIn reality, every dream is possible. It might take too much effort and time but through dedication, it is possible.\n\nThe tournament, which featured 12 football and netball teams representing different constituencies, was aimed at nurturing talent, promoting youth development, and combating drug and substance abuse.\n\nThe winning teams received R175 000 each, while the runners-up received R90 000.\n\nGwanda Tshitaudzes football and netball teams won the prize money by beating the Gwanda South teams in the finals.\n\nGwanda Tshitaudze beat Gwanda South 1-0 in football, while the netball side won 28-11.\n\nBeitbridge West Constituency was placed third in the football event while Mangwe was fourth. Umzingwane Constituency came third in netball and Insiza South was fourth.\n\nMatabeleland South Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister, Dr Evelyn Ndlovu, praised VP Mohadis dedication to youth empowerment and community development.\n\nShe said his influence has been a driving force behind different initiatives, and his contributions have had a profound impact on the community, province and the nation at large.\n\nDr Ndlovu urged youths to embody the spirit of excellence, craftsmanship, entrepreneurship and sportsmanship.\n\nHonourable guest, we are grateful for your selfless efforts, your philanthropic endeavours and your passion to empower our youth and promote community development, she said.\n\nYour remarkable achievements serve as an example to us all. I hope this day will not only show our appreciation and affection but rather push us to follow in your footsteps.\n\nZanu-PF Matabeleland South Provincial Youth League chairperson Cde Moses Langa, emphasised the importance of emulating VP Mohadis hard work and dedication to serving the country.\n\nAs youths from the province, we have to be proud of the leaders we have in the province like our Honourable Vice-President KCD Mohadi, and we have to emulate their great works, he said.\n\nThis tournament is just a start as we will have more editions coming up, and in the process, several youths will be empowered. I call upon more youths to be part of this programme.\n\nCde Langa expressed his gratitude to all constituencies, sponsors and participants for making the tournament a success.\n\nDeputy Minister of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture, Emily Jesaya, stressed the significance of youth participation in sports, citing the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1).\n\nShe encouraged youths to engage in sports, promoting good health, Unhu/Ubuntu values, entrepreneurship, and sporting excellence.\n\nThe tournament was a brainchild of the Zanu-PF Matabeleland South Provincial Youth League aimed at celebrating VP Mohadi as a revolutionary for dedicating his life to the defence of the sovereignty of Zimbabwe.\n\nIt is set to become an annual event and will play a crucial role in unearthing and nurturing sporting talent among the youth as well as helping in the fight against drug and substance abuse.\n\nThe initiative started in May last year with competitions being held at the ward level.  @DubeMatutu\n\n",

We look forward to Zimbabwes contribution to the G20 agenda.

All the accused then joined and stabbed the deceased indiscriminately on the legs and buttocks, said Mr Uladi.\n\nThulani hit the deceased with a log on the legs and arm. Mkhululi stomped the deceased on the neck and kicked him in the ribs.\n\nWitnesses testified to the brutal nature of the attack, with Mr Ndlovus mother, Ms Sawe Ncube, recounting how the five thugs showed no remorse, referring to her son as a dog.\n\nWhen I arrived at the shops and they saw me, Qhubekani and Thulani used logs to strike my sons legs and arms, while Mkhululi stomped on his neck and kicked him in the ribs, she recounted.\n\nAfter they were satisfied with the damage they had done to my son, the accused persons said, take your dog away, she said with tears streaming down her cheeks.\n\nMs Ncube said a well-wisher ferried her badly injured son to Kwekwe District Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.\n\nConstable Mhondiwa Chitima told the court that the accused brothers surrendered themselves at the police station on August 7, 2023, and Moyo did the same on August 26.\n\nJustice Mutevedzi stressed that the accused gang forfeited its right to a second chance in society due to the heinous nature of the murder.\n\nYou do not deserve to reintegrate into society. Your actions demonstrate a complete disregard for human life, and therefore, you forfeit your right to a second chance.

For years, Zifa has been plagued by maladministration, corruption, and embezzlement allegations, leading to a decline in local teams competitiveness and a lack of transparency in financial activities.\n\nMagwizi was elected on Saturday with his two vice-presidents, Kennedy Ndebele and Loveness Mukura, as well as ordinary board members, Tafadzwa Benza, Thomas Marambanyika, Kudzai Kadzombe, Brighton Ushendibaba, Davison Muchena and Alice Zeura.\n\nThey will be joined by the chairs of the Premier Soccer League and Zimbabwe Women Soccer League respectively.\n\nMagwizi, who emerged as a virtual outsider in the Zifa presidential race on Saturday, has an uphill task ahead, but with the right strategies and a positive mindset, he could help take Zimbabwean football to new heights.\n\nOver the past years, Zifa has suffered from pervasive corruption and mismanagement, which has had a significant impact on the development of football in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe successive leadership crises have led to a sharp decline and a lack of competitiveness among local teams. This trend has been further fuelled by inadequate funding, irregularities in player transfers, and the lack of transparency in Zifas financial activities.\n\nIf Zifa is to have any hope of reversing this trend, Magwizi must provide a framework that promotes transparency, accountability, and inclusivity. The new leadership must take steps to ensure that it is free from the petty squabbles and bickering that have plagued Zifa for far too long. They need to work towards putting in place a culture that demands respect for the rule of law and good governance.\n\nHis impressive CV and passion for the game are promising, but he must prioritise grassroots development, womens football, and junior academies, with incentives offered to those who prove successful.\n\nHe must work towards the professionalism of Zimbabwean football and make it attractive to investors. Magwizi should also put adequate measures in place to ensure that his board is driven by a passion for the game rather than personal gain.\n\nAs we urge Magwizi to lead the charge in reviving Zimbabwean football, it is also important to remind him of the challenges that lie ahead. First, he should take immediate action to ensure that Zifa is free of corruption by instituting an independent auditor to scrutinise all financial activities of the association. He should also set up an anti-corruption unit, free from any interference. This unit should be tasked with investigating all suspected cases of irregularities in player transfers, match-fixing, and favouritism.\n\nIn addition to this, we also implore Magwizi to look at aligning Zimbabwean football with global standards and trends. He must work towards forging strong ties with international sports associations. This would give Zimbabwean football exposure and facilitate the transfer of technology, know-how, and resources across borders.\n\nMagwizi needs to be bold and decisive in his leadership. The challenges ahead require strong leadership and a willingness to make difficult decisions. He must be guided by the people of Zimbabwe and the love they have for the game. The new board must also be willing to accept and implement constructive criticism and suggestions from stakeholders, such as players, coaches, and fans.\n\nZimbabwean football is at a critical juncture, and Magwizi needs to lead the change. The new board must work on rebranding Zifa and promote transparency, accountability, and inclusivity to restore the associations reputation. With strong leadership and a willingness to change, Zimbabwean football can overcome its challenges and regain its position of pride in the African continent.\n\n",

If you are in your country, it is very rare to lose your investment, Mr Dube explained.\n\nHis positive experience with investing in Zimbabwe is shared by other diasporans, who are eager to invest in various sectors, including agriculture, real estate, tourism, education, and health.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has taken steps to support diaspora investment, directing relevant ministries to set up a working committee on diaspora affairs to address concerns and facilitate investment.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nWith the Governments efforts to mobilise Zimbabweans abroad to invest back home paying off, Mr Dubes sentiments echo the growing optimism among diasporans.\n\nAs he aptly put it, For me, investing back home has been a wonderful experience because registering a company in Zimbabwe is not hard as compared to other countries.  @SikhulekelaniM1.\n\n",

Such actions undermine the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and peace and security of the DRC and the SADC region, reads the statement.\n\nThe pursuit of territorial expansion by M23 only exacerbates the already existing dire humanitarian and security situation in the Eastern DRC, which has left thousands of people dead and forced millions in North Kivu, particularly women, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities, to flee their homes.\n\nThe rebel group M23 attacked the SAMIDRC in Goma to which SAMIDRC retaliated and successfully repelled the armed group. SADC commends the actions of the brave men and women from SAMIDRC who sacrificed their lives for the Region.\n\nSADC also noted that M23 aggression violated the peace agreement struck by Angolan President Joo Manuel Goncalves Lourenco.\n\nThe actions of the M23 armed group contravenes the Nairobi Peace Process and is a clear violation of the agreed ceasefire brokered through the Luanda Process led by His Excellency Joo Manuel Gonalves Loureno, President of the Republic of Angola in his capacity as the African Union Champion for Peace and Reconciliation in Africa.\n\nWe, therefore, call upon all parties in the conflict to adhere to their obligations in the ceasefire, calling for immediate cessation of hostilities and atrocities perpetrated by M23, as well as unconditional withdrawal from all occupied positions.\n\nSADC further encourages all parties in the conflict in Eastern DRC to comply with the terms and conditions of the existing peace agreements and engage through dialogue for everlasting peace, security and stability in the DRC and the Region.\n\nTo this end, the SAMIDRC will remain resolute in supporting efforts aimed at addressing the unstable and deteriorating security and humanitarian situation prevailing in the Eastern DRC. We call upon the international community, including the United Nations, to join us in denouncing these unlawful actions by the M23.\n\nSADC region reiterates its solidarity with the people of the DRC and commends them for resilience against brutal actions perpetrated by the M23 and other armed groups, reads the statement.\n\nThe African Union (AU) has also denounced the M23s actions, with Commission chairperson Dr Moussa Faki Mahamat expressing deep concern over the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in the East of the DRC.\n\nDr Mahamat called for the strict observance of the ceasefire agreed between the parties and the immediate cessation of all hostilities.\n\nDr Mahamat expressed his unreserved support for such efforts, which are the only way to resolve the persistent tension between the DRC and Rwanda, on the one hand, and between the government of the DRC and its political-military opposition, on the other.\n\n",
