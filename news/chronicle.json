When we look at irrigation farmers, we see you as priviledged farmers because not every farmer with access to land has access to irrigation. With irrigations it means you can produce throughout the year.\n\nA lot of funds have been put into developing these irrigation schemes and as farmers that have benefited, we expect you to contribute to national development through production. In the past we would develop the scheme and leave you with little supervision from extension officers but now we realised that as farmers you were having challenges in maintaining the schemes, he said.\n\nDr Chitsungo said Government has gone a step ahead by introducing the V30 accelerator model which will play a crucial role in attainment of Vision 2030.\n\nHe said Agricultural Rural Development Authority (ARDA) managers have been further deployed to help farmers run their schemes as businesses while Agritex extension officers will continue providing technical support.\n\nDr Chitsungo said intervention from Government has also seen farmers being capacitated through access to loans, equipment and farming inputs.\n\n@DubeMatutu\n\n",

            "content": "Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Investigations Desk\n\nA Bulawayo City Council clerical officer has reportedly gone AWOL after allegedly colluding with a local church to defraud the council of US$2,072 through fraudulent bookings of the City Hall for church services.\n\nAccording to the councils internal audit report, the church exploited weak internal controls, using the Large City Hall five times without payment, causing a confirmed loss of US$2,072.05. The probe was triggered after the Town Clerks office flagged concerns over the legitimacy of the churchs bookings.\n\nAuditors uncovered that receipt 0151638434 was used twice: once legitimately, then fraudulently. On 21 June 2024 at 14:22, the church paid US$415 for hall hire, receiving the receipt without specified dates or times. Two days later, security officer Mr Maickel Ndlovu logged the receipt, recording a booking from 10:00 to 14:00details absent from the original receipt. The booking for 23 June was pencilled in, signalling unpaid fees.\n\nOn 14 July 2024, the same receipt resurfaced on CS Form 573, fraudulently extending the halls use by an hour. Further scrutiny revealed receipt 0141590226 was also duplicated.\n\nDuring interviews, Mr Charamba admitted to unknowingly reusing receipts, claiming he received them from council officer Mr Busani Nyoni in exchange for local currency transactions. He pledged to repay the council.\n\nThe audit also exposed discrepancies in 2023 bookings: the church used council halls 25 times but paid for only six. While the church paid ZWL 7,415,659.46 in bulk payments, this exceeded the actual fees of ZWL 3,920,254.16. The report warned: Discrepancies raise suspicion of possible money laundering if not linked to system failures in adjusting for exchange rates or policy changes.\n\nMore details to follow\n\n",

The defending European champions host Arsenal at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu tonight in the second leg of their quarter-final meeting in the competition.Los Blancos were blown away by Arsenal in last weeks first leg as Mikel Artetas men won 3-0, courtesy of Declan Rices brace and a neat finish by Mikel Merino. The Merengues have a massive task on their hands if they are to overturn the deficit, more so against one of the continents best defensive sides.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti will be without Andriy Lunin, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao and Ferland Mendy for the game as they continue to recover from injuries, whereas Eduardo Camavinga is suspended following his red card at the Emirates Stadium in last Tuesdays fixture against the Gunners.Dani Ceballos is back, however, as he marked his return from injury at the weekend against Alaves. He could start and in addition to the former Arsenal loanee, all eyes will be on Kylian Mbappe, Rodrygo Goes and Vinicius Junior if Real Madrid are to stand any chance of reversing the first leg arrears.\n\nMeanwhile, Arsenal come into the game having been held at home by Brentford in the Premier League. A 1-1 draw further derailed their title hopes, more so after Liverpools win, so very realistically, the Champions League is the only piece of silverware the Londoners can claim this season.Arsenal will be without Ben White, Gabriel Magalhaes, Riccardo Calafiori, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz. Jorginhos participation is doubtful but Thomas Partey has made the travelling party after a minor fitness worry. The English giants have no suspension worries.\n\nReal Madrid will have to put in one of their best performances of not just this season but in their illustrious history as they bid to achieve a feat that has eluded them for close to five decades. The 15-time European champions have not come back from three goals down in the competition since 1976.\n\nThe Santiago Bernabeu will be in its full glory though it is hard to escape the supposition that Arsenal are the clear favourites to progress into the semi-final and end Real Madrids title defence in the process. For context, Artetas charges last conceded thrice in a match more than 80 outings ago.An exciting second leg between two fantastic teams awaits and Real Madrid will hope they can defy all odds to produce yet another magical night on home soil in the European Cup.\n\n",
