            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza,[emailprotected]\n\nAS soon as Bulawayo City Council municipal officers  the enforcers of the citys by-laws regarding parking, and the picking up and dropping off of passengers  finish their duties for the day, lawlessness in the City of Kings shifts into high gear.\n\nA full of life scene unfolds at the corner of Fort Street and Leopold Takawira Avenue as a large public bus, operated by one of the countrys major transport companies, pulls up to the curb.\n\nPassengers eager to travel to Harare begin to board the vehicle. Just a short distance away, on the opposite side of Fort Street, another bus is attracting passengers. Located near the iconic Tredgold Building, this brightly coloured 75-seater bus is ready to embark on its journey.\n\nEven though its only 5.30pm on a Thursday afternoon, the area surrounding Tredgold Building is already transforming into a busy food market. Vendors are setting up their stalls, offering a diverse range of meals, from traditional Zimbabwean cuisine to international fast food. This culinary spectacle is primarily driven by the influx of night bus passengers, who rely on these vendors for sustenance during their long journeys.\n\nAs the sun sets, a different and illicit night economy takes shape on Fort Street. Vendors, capitalising on the demand from night bus passengers, set up their stalls and engage in informal transactions, often involving US dollars. This underground economy operates outside the regulatory framework of the Bulawayo City Council.\n\nOn average, I sell about 50 takeaway food packages on a single night, and the majority of my customers are divided between passengers boarding the Harare buses and taxi drivers, said Marylene Sibanda, a food vendor who sells isitshwala, rice, beef and chicken.\n\nNight activity: As early as 17.30 a new business activity begins. The picture taken along Fort Street near Tredgold Building shows a Harare-bound bus loading passengers\n\nBusiness is brisk around 7pm when the second or third long-distance bus parks at the illegal rank that is popular among passengers travelling to the capital city at night, she says. Each takeaway costs US$1.\n\nMost people prefer the buses that leave for Harare between 7pm and 9PM, and that is during that time when business is good, she said.\n\nFor someone who doesnt pay rent or any other utility bills that registered food outlets pay in the formal sector, making a gross total of US$50 per night cannot be considered bad business for the middle-aged woman.\n\nCold drink vendors can also be seen milling around the long-distance buses, hoping for a thirsty passenger to stick their head out of the bus windows and make a purchase. Vendors are seldom allowed into the buses, even when they are stationary. The other commodity that sells like hot cakes, riding on the back of dollar deals, is airtime. An airtime vendor who only identified himself as Mbuso doubles up as a money changer  the individuals who sell and buy foreign currency at premium rates.\n\nThe night economy at Tredgold has also given a lifeline to taxi drivers who bring passengers to the long-distance buses or anyone looking for convenient and quick transport in and around the city. The irony of the booming business at Tredgold is that some of it, especially the illegal kind, is conducted right in front of the building where transgressors of the law are reprimanded or punished.\n\nOn the other side of the street, at the corner of Leopold Takawira Avenue and Herbert Chitepo, one man has close to 100 pairs of sneakers lined up on the pavement. He sells his merchandise right in front of what used to be a building that housed Edgars, the clothing retailer who deserted the building after complaining that competition from unlicensed clothes vendors was pushing the giant retailer out of business. The sneakers cost between US$10 and US$30.\n\nAfter Edgars vacated the building, it was taken over by numerous small shopowners selling a variety of items, including cell phones, clothes, and kitchenware. The long-distance buses that operate overnight on the Bulawayo/Harare route have been flagged by the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) as operating illegally, as the location is not an authorised bus terminus. The BCC has not yet responded to questions sent to the municipalitys communication and public relations department.\n\nOvernight travel has become a lucrative business for bus companies, and the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) is also looking to capitalise on this market. The NRZ is working on resurrecting its passenger coaches following a complete overhaul of its railway network, which is currently in a poor state.\n\nWe suspended our passenger coaches for operational reasons as it was no longer profitable. NRZ is working on revising passenger coaches operations but that can only be done when the freight services is profitable to a point that we can subsidise passenger coaches, said NRZ public affairs and stakeholder relations manager, Mr Andrew Kunambura\n\nPassenger services are currently suspended due to financial constraints and the poor condition of the existing coaches. According to Section 37 of the Railway Act, passenger services are supposed to be subsidised by the Government, as they are more of a social service than a business venture.\n\nMr Kunambura stated that once the NRZ addresses the freight side of its business and ensures it runs profitably, the company will be able to efficiently run passenger trains, subsidising the operations as part of their corporate social responsibility.\n\nEarlier this year, NRZ general manager, Miss Respina Zinyanduko, mentioned that the parastatal aims to emulate the rail and port authority of Mozambique, CFM Mozambique, which provides a 90 percent subsidy to its passenger service.\n\nCommenting on the illegal activities that occur at night around the Tredgold area, Bulawayo United Residents Association Chairman Mr Winos Dube said there is a need for the BCC to introduce a night shift for its municipal security department.\n\nPeople engage in all sorts of illegal activities at night around the Tredgold area taking advantage of the fact that BCC officers will have knocked off. At this rate, Bulawayo will turn into a slum as a result of people breaking the law by selling food everywhere and buses picking up and dropping off passengers at every street corner, said Mr Dube.\n\n",

As a Ministry, we are fully behind this ingenuity and will ensure that the vision becomes a reality.\n\nHe noted that it is also vital to make concerted efforts and continue fostering regional collaboration among Correctional Services to holistically enhance successful reintegration.\n\nI therefore urge all Correctional Services in Africa to fully utilise the African Correctional Services Association in order to propel exchange programmes for mutual benefit towards successful reintegration. It is our belief that African problems should be solved by African solutions.\n\nSpeaking at the same ceremony, ZPCS Commissioner-General Moses Chihobva said the enactment of the new Prisons and Correctional Service Act (Chapter 7:23) has empowered ZPCS to bolster its efforts in the rehabilitation and reintegration purview.\n\nBy focusing on rehabilitation over punishment, the new legislation aims to strengthen the furnishing of former inmates with the requisite skills and support for successful re-entry back to society after serving their sentences, he said.\n\nReintegration is crucial not only for the personal growth of released inmates but also for enhancing public safety and reducing recidivism rates. When ex-offenders are provided with access to education, employment opportunities, and social services, they are more likely to become contributing members of society.\n\nHe noted that the holistic approach fosters a sense of belonging and encourages positive citizenship, ultimately strengthening the fabric of the nation.\n\nHe said through effective reintegration efforts, ZPCS seeks to transform lives and promote a more inclusive and resilient society.\n\n",

When Mr Raeez Lunat called me saying, Nsingo, I want to donate to the vulnerable, can you get me ten people, I was so excited thinking that its towards Christmas and with what is happening, there is no rain, El Nio is everywhere, people are suffering. For me, it was a blessing.\n\nMost of the people who benefited here are widows, and they are heading families now, so just imagine, when you get something like this during this time, it means a lot to them. Mr Lunat is one of our fundraising committee members in Bulawayo, so he has been helpful in many ways. We thank him for giving back to the community, said Cde Nsingo.\n\nAfter receiving the hampers, the beneficiaries expressed their gratitude, noting that receiving a gift during this time of the year means a lot, especially as some of them had nothing to depend on during this festive season.\n\nWe thank Budget Cash and Carry for what they did. We are going to celebrate the holidays in style with our grandchildren; we didnt even know where to start. They gave us a surprise gift; may God bless the owners of Budget Cash and Carry and give them everything they wish in life, said Ms Prudith Mtebe.\n\nBudget Cash and Carry Managing Director, Mr Lunat, said that in whatever capacity, they try to give back to the community they serve.\n\nBesides supporting local manufacturers, we also try to give back to the community by assisting wherever we can, in whatever capacity we can, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Budget Cash and Carry is passionate about supporting local manufacturers and promoting the growth of Zimbabwes economy. Their commitment to local procurement is reflected in their innovative Local is Lekker brand activation day, which showcases the best of local products and provides a platform for local businesses to shine. On Saturday, different companies displayed their products at Budget Cash and Carry in Belmont.\n\nMr Lunat said that by choosing local commodities from local manufacturers, customers are not only getting high-quality products but also contributing to the growth and development of the local community.\n\nHere are just a few reasons why local matters: stimulating economic growth and creating jobs, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship, improving quality and safety standards, supporting unique and culturally relevant products, and improving quality and safety.\n\nOur Local is Lekker brand activation day is a celebration of all things local. We invite local manufacturers to showcase their products, connect with customers, and receive valuable feedback.

Given the extensive scope of road maintenance work, the local authority engages private sector contractors to complement its own efforts, a council official has revealed\n\nWhile 70 percent of the citys roads have outlived their lifespan, limited resources prevent the council from fully reconstructing most of them. Instead, the local authority has resolved to conduct periodic maintenance to keep the roads trafficable. In recent months, the council has been patching some of the citys major roads.\n\nResponding to questions, Bulawayo communication officer, Ms Bongiwe Ngwenya, said the council covered a total of 3000 square metres of pothole patching this year at a cost of nearly US$700000. Contractors hired for the current year have completed the scope of works for 2024, which totalled 3000 square metres citywide.\n\nWe will engage contractors again for pothole patching during the first quarter of 2025 through an open tender system. The pothole patching programme will continue using both the councils in-house teams and private contractors year on year until the councils road maintenance teams are fully resourced.\n\nWe normally give the contractors the scope in terms of the area to be covered in patching and the budget varies. The average annual budget for patching is about US$600000 to US$700000, said Ms Ngwenya.\n\nShe explained that the council resolved to hire private contractors as it cannot rehabilitate the citys roads on its own.\n\nMs Ngwenya said the council outsources equipment from five contractors, while two others are involved in road maintenance.\n\nThe City of Bulawayo outsources or subcontracts road maintenance activities and plant and equipment to augment council resources (i.e., plant, equipment, labour). The council on its own does not have the capacity to undertake all road maintenance activities citywide. The council has been outsourcing pothole patching for years. For the year 2024, the council outsourced pothole patching to two companies and hired plant and equipment from more than five companies, said Ms Ngwenya.\n\nShe revealed that the city implements a periodic road maintenance programme, which includes reconstruction, overlays, reseals and road markings, as well as routine maintenance works such as pothole patching and drain clearing.\n\nThe budget allocation split is 75 percent to periodic works and 25 percent to routine maintenance works, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, a local construction company has patched potholes along Khami Road to Emthunzini suburb on the outskirts of the city as a donation. Over the past few weeks, workers from Hawkflight Construction have been patching potholes on the section of Khami Road, while road markings have also been done on the same road.\n\nThe current works on patching the carriageway on Khami Road from Emthunzini Suburb towards the city centre is a donation. The works are carried out at no cost to the council, she said.\n\nBy October this year, the Zimbabwe National Roads Administration (Zinara) had disbursed over ZWG 13 million to Bulawayo for road rehabilitation.  @nqotshili\n\n",

From January to September 2024, the Fund provided crucial support to 33 projects, reflecting the Governments ongoing efforts to enhance womens economic participation.\n\nIn the 2025 National Budget statement, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube, highlighted that the projects funded through the WDF benefitted a total of 261 women and sustained 450 jobs.\n\nDuring the period January to September 2024, thirty-three projects were funded through the Women Development Fund, benefitting a total of 261 women and sustaining 450 jobs, he said.\n\nThe Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises, in its 2022 annual report, noted that the Women Development Fund supported 240 projects worth US$297 million. Professor Ncube also mentioned that a total of 76,741 women entrepreneurs across all provinces received training in diverse areas, including technical skills, business management, climate change adaptation, health access and life skills.\n\nHe stated that 5 228 MSMEs were facilitated to participate in local, regional and international fairs and exhibitions, including events such as the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF), provincial and district agricultural shows, as well as regional market fairs in Zambia, Malawi, Botswana, Eswatini, Mozambique and Tanzania. MSMEs are acting as pathfinders in regional and international markets through participation in exhibitions and fairs such as the upcoming Tokyo Expo 2025.\n\nAccording to Professor Ncube, through the Start-up Business Advisory Program, 150 MSMEs were formally registered in 2024. He also highlighted that the Government is working with the Women Owned Business Trust and UN Women, including Praz, to promote the participation of women entrepreneurs across various supply chains in supplying goods and services to the public sector.\n\nProfessor Ncube said that the Government will continue to expand support towards SME initiatives and women empowerment through the capitalisation of the Zimbabwe Women Micro Finance Bank, EmpowerBank, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Corporation and the National Venture Capital Company of Zimbabwe.\n\nAccording to the Finscope Survey of 2022, Zimbabwe has 3.4 million micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) owned by 4,2 million entrepreneurs, employing 4.8 million people and contributing US$8,6 billion to the countrys gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n",

I will appeal, said Mliswa.\n\nHe said he will seek to challenge the loopholes in the new Zifa constitution, that was recently adopted by the associations congress and registered with the Sports Commission.\n\nThe process of appeal is critical, not because Im bitter, but its ones right to also test the constitution. I always say that this constitution is flawed in many ways. Being flawed in many ways, it has to be tested, said Mliswa.\n\nFarai Jere\n\nThe interpretation of a constitution can only be known to be what it is through the processes and the courts. I intend to start the process as soon as possible, but like any other method of appeal, you need to be given the reasons why you did not make it. And then from there, it becomes the basis for you to appeal.\n\nThe process to appeal must not be seen as a bitter way of responding, but it is a right and its good for the people of Zimbabwe. We need the best leaders.\n\nAnd even in a political election, you know that the appeal process is there, the constitutional court is there The process starts now. The game is not over. The game has just started.\n\nMliswa and some of the barred candidates that spoke to Zimpapers Sports Hub were unhappy there was no explanation from the Zifa Normalisation Committee why they failed to make the cut.\n\nVeteran football administrator Jere, who had announced he was leaving the Premier Soccer League chairmanship to focus on the Zifa job,\n\nI have nothing to react to at the moment, I cannot even say what the next step would be because I have not received any communication from Zifa to say I have failed to meet the eligibility criteria because of ABC.That way I can be able to make a decision, whether to appeal or not to. If you also look at it from another angle, maybe their decision is correct but that we can only know if they say something.As people versed with tenets of good corporate governance I thought they were going to communicate beforehand and explain why my candidature was not successful. Probably the letters are on the way. We wait, said Jere.There has been an overwhelming interest in the upcoming elections, with a record number of nominations for the various posts in the Zifa board.In announcing the successful candidates, a statement from the association yesterday said, The Zifa Normalisation Committee acting as the Zifa Electoral Committee in accordance with Article 85(9) is pleased to announce the names of all the candidates who have met the eligibility criteria stipulated in the Zifa Statutes, 2024.

The event, held at the Large City Hall, saw participation from Government officials, churches, residents and members of the media.\n\nMinister Ncube acknowledged that the signing of the December 22, 1987 Unity Accord by the late President Cde Mugabe and the late Vice-President Joshua Nkomo laid the foundation for the peaceful country we have today. She noted that the Unity Accord ended years of conflict that threatened to tear the nation apart.\n\nThe Unity Accord is one of the major political milestones in Zimbabwe since independence. It extinguished the fires of conflict in our nation and established the foundation of peace and unity that we enjoy up to now. Some may not value the Unity Accord because they dont know what was happening. Even today,in our homes, in our families, there are serious conflicts.\n\nSome are even forced to relocate as they dont want to interact with their siblings. We need the church to unite families as some end up killing each other. We are aware of some children who kill their parents and siblings, blaming them for their misfortunes, said Minister Ncube.\n\nExpressing concern over the alarmingly high divorce rates in the country, Minister Ncube underlined the importance of prioritising national interests over personal gains when resolving family conflicts. Mirroring the selfless dedication of the countrys founding fathers, Minister Ncube urged citizens to approach family disputes with a spirit of national unity and a commitment to preserving the sanctity of the family unit.\n\nWhatever contradictions and differences we face as a nation, we should always find resolutions through peaceful dialogue. No nation can develop if there is conflict. As His Excellency, the President of Zimbabwe Dr Emmerson Mnangagwa always says,ilizwe lakhiwa ngabanikazi balo, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo.We thought it fitting that as we hold this Unity Day commemoration, we invite the clergy because the clergy needs to pray for the country. More than ever, we need to embrace the power of coming together, said Minister Ncube.\n\nAcknowledging the numerous challenges facing Bulawayo, including the ongoing water crisis, she emphasised that unity of purpose is crucial to overcoming these obstacles.\n\nWe need to pray for rain as the water situation is causing conflicts in the city. As a Government, we are closely working with the council through the Town Clerks office and the Mayor to address the water issue. Right now, feasibility studies are being conducted to establish whether we can draw water from an aquifer in Hope Fountain. All these efforts are aimed at addressing the citys water challenges, she said.\n\nSpeaking during the same event, Bulawayo Deputy Mayor Edwin Ndlovu said the Unity Accord is an important day in the nations calendar as it reminds us of the countrys shared history, struggles and enduring spirit.\n\nThis Unity Accord marked a watershed moment in our nations history. It was a time when we chose to prioritise our collective future over individual differences. It was also a time for healing, reconciliation and a commitment to building a brighter future for all Zimbabweans.\n\nThe journey to this unity was not an easy one. It was fraught with challenges, sacrifices and profound losses. Yet, the leaders of that time had the foresight to recognise that our strength lies not in division but in togetherness. They understood that, despite our varying backgrounds, languages and cultures, we share a common destiny. Today, we honour their vision and the legacy they left us, said Clr Ndlovu\n\nHe said that for Bulawayo to thrive, a spirit of unity and a collective focus on the citys interests must guide the provinces development.\n\nAs Bulawayo, we are in a space that symbolises community and collaboration. Let us take a moment to reflect on what unity truly means. Unity is not the absence of conflict or disagreement; rather, it is the ability to come together, to listen to one another and to work collaboratively towards common goals. It is a reminder that as Bulawayo, we need to embrace our diversity, recognising that each of us brings unique perspectives and strengths to the table.\n\nIn our current context, as we face both local and global challenges, the spirit of unity is more crucial than ever. We live in times of uncertainty, where divisions can easily be exacerbated by misinformation and fear, he said\n\nRepresenting the Roman Catholic Church of Bulawayo, Archbishop Alex Thomas stated that Unity Day commemorations provide a valuable opportunity for the nation to reflect upon its past and collectively plan for a brighter future.\n\nThis is an important part of our country where we chose peace and national cohesion. This Unity Accord marks a significant step towards healing the divisions that once threatened to tear us apart, said Archbishop Thomas.\n\nHe said that a united front is essential for the development of both Bulawayo and the nation. While acknowledging that conflicts are inevitable, he stressed that mutual respect and the spirit of Ubuntu  characterised by humaneness, compassion and collective well-being  should guide the nations development agenda.\n\nThis is about coming together, setting aside our differences to build a nation where each one is valued, respected, heard, understood and included in all the development processes. It is through unity that we can face many economic challenges and social injustices. When we stand together, we are stronger, more resilient and better equipped to address the issues that confront us in our daily lives, said Archbishop Thomas.  @nqotshili\n\n",
