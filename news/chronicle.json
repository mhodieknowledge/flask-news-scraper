Nothing came out of the set-piece.\n\nFive minutes later, Michael Tapera dribbled past the Bosso defense but his goal attempt went over the bar.\n\nIn the 20th minute, former Highlanders striker, now plying his trade for Scottland, Lynoth Chikuhwa found himself unmarked in the box but headed his effort wide off goal.\n\nAfter a tight contest, the first booking of the match was received by Tichaona Chipunza who has given a yellow card for pulling down Bosso striker, Brighton Ncube at the half hour mark.\n\nWith two minutes remaining before the break, Bosso got another chance but McKinnon Mushores long range shot went over the bar.\n\nIn the 46th minute, soon after the start of the second half, Rauzhi, after recovering a brilliant pass from Melikhaya Ncube managed to beat his marker outside the box but sent his effort over the bar.\n\nPeter Muduhwa captained Scottland in place of Walter Musona who started from the bench.\n\nTeams:\n\nHighlanders:\n\nRaphael Pitisi (gk), Talent Dube (Archford Faira, 78mins), Arthur Ndlovu, Brian Mlotshwa, McKinnon Mushore (Nqobile Ndlovu, 66mins), Melikhaya Ncube, Reason Sibanda, Brighton Ncube (Tendai Muvuti, 78mins),Andrew Mbeba, Mason Mushore, Never Rauzhi.Scottland:Nelson Chadya (gk), Tichaona Chipunza, Michael Tapera, Peter Muduhwa, Gareth Madhake, Kevin Moyo, Ronald Pfumbidzai (Kudzai Jason, 86mins),Panashe Mutimbanyoka (Walter Musona, 66mins), Lynoth Chikuhwa (Khama Billiat, 66mins), Vassili Kawe, (Nathan Mutasa, 86mins), Fredrick Botchway (Mthokozisi Msebe, 54 mins)\n\n",
