More, he said, must be done to alleviate the situation, which recently claimed 16 soldiers from South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and Malawi, who form part of the SADC Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC).\n\nAmong those peacekeeping forces are soldiers from the UN mission in Congo (MONUSCO).President Mnangagwa noted with regret that since an Extraordinary Summit that was held in Harare in November last year, very little progress has been made in our search for lasting peace in the Eastern DRC, which is now characterised by escalating hostilities and conflict.\n\nThis culminated in the unfortunate and atrocious attacks carried out on our Mission in Goma, that claimed the lives of several SAMIDRC and MONUSCO peacekeepers, while others sustained serious injuries.\n\nThe people of the eastern DRC have suffered for far too long. SADC condemns in the strongest terms the attacks by aggressor forces. While we pause to mourn our loss, our resolve to ensure collective security cannot be shaken, he said.\n\nSADC Chairperson President Mnangagwa\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said it was important that dialogue and peace building are boldly pursued to achieve the intended result of peace for the benefit of the people of the Eastern DRC.\n\nTo this end, our region stands ready to intensify efforts to protect the SADC citizens from all forms of instability, in line with the SADC Mutual Defence Pact. The peace and security of our region is a shared obligation.\n\nOur political-will must be strengthened towards a concrete and actionable roadmap that will help accelerate the realisation of peace in the Eastern DRC, he said.\n\nMay we, as Member States, continue to do all we can to support our gallant men and women in the theatre of operations, and ensure that SAMIDRC achieves its important objective.\n\nThe SADC Chairman said the plight of millions of internally displaced populations cannot and should not be ignored.As we deliberate on our firm and united response, let us not overlook the humanitarian crises stemming from the prevailing armed conflict in Eastern DRC.\n\nSADC appreciates the support rendered by International Co-operating Partners, in response to the critical needs of the displaced populations, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa conveyed the regional blocs condolences to Member States and families who lost their loved ones in service.\n\nOn behalf of SADC, the Government and people of the Republic of Zimbabwe and indeed on my own behalf, I wish to convey our heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies to the Member States and families of the brave men and women who lost their lives in the service of the people of DRC, the SADC region and indeed the cause of continental and world peace.\n\nOur condolences also extend to the families of the non-combatant victims who have lost their lives as a result of this conflict. May the souls of the departed rest in eternal peace, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa commended the Heads of State for showing up at the meeting at short notice.He also lauded the SADC Troika for convening to deliberate on the security situation in the DRC before the Extraordinary Summit.\n\nI thank you all for taking time to attend this meeting, which was convened on short notice. We meet today, to seek lasting solutions to the challenges faced in the Eastern DRC. I commend the contributions made by fellow Member States and the SADC Secretariat in ensuring our collective security.\n\nI wish to thank the Chairperson of the SADC Troika, Her Excellency, President Samia Hassan and the other members of the Troika as well as Troop Contributing Countries for having convened in Dar es Salaam to deliberate on this very important matter, he said.\n\nThe SADC Chair welcomed the recently inaugurated Mozambiques President Chapo, who was attending the regional bloc gathering for the first time since assuming office.\n\nI extend a special revolutionary welcome to His Excellency, Cde Daniel Francisco Chapo, the President of the Republic of Mozambique.\n\nAs a region, we look forward to working with him in enhancing regional peace, security and integration as well as our collective development agenda, he said.\n\n",

Their bond, however, was truly tested in 2019.\n\nBeauty, then 53, received a devastating diagnosis: breast cancer. In a cruel twist of fate, Raviro Mawira, now 58, was herself diagnosed with the same disease, forcing the two women to confront their fears and fight their battles side-by-side.\n\nBeauty is more than just a housekeeper; shes a member of our family. When she was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in 2019, I knew I had to be there for her.\n\nShe had to undergo a mastectomy and intense chemotherapy treatments. It was a lot to handle, both emotionally and financially, Raviro recalls. But I knew that I had to be there for her, just like she had been there for me for over three decades.\n\nShe was like family to me, and I couldnt imagine going through such a difficult time without her by my side.Raviro herself was diagnosed with stage 0 breast cancer in 2022, adding another layer of complexity to their already challenging situation.\n\nDespite the hardships they faced, both women fought bravely and emerged victorious.As both of them embarked on their cancer journeys, the financial burden weighed heavily on them.\n\nThe cost of treatments, surgeries, and medication was high, and they were struggling to make ends meet as Raviro had lost her husband to myeloma cancer, popularly known as spinal cancer, in 2020.Beauty did not hesitate to take extra jobs to help support her family and also cover their treatment expenses.\n\nThe situation had now become bad. I looked at my condition and that of my boss, and I knew I had to step up and take on piece jobs so that I could help with some of the expenses, she said.\n\nBeautys sacrifice left an enduring mark, and Raviros heart continually overflows with thanks.I couldnt believe the sacrifices she made for me. She worked tirelessly to ensure that I could afford the treatments I needed.\n\nShe was a true angel in my life, and I will forever be grateful for her kindness and selflessness.Their bond only grew stronger as they navigated the uncertainties of cancer treatment together. Beauty became a mother figure to Raviros four children, caring for them as if they were her own.\n\nWe are not just house help and employers, we are sisters in arms. We have been through so much together, and our bond is unbreakable. Cancer may have tried to break us, but it only made us stronger, said Beauty.\n\nCancer suvivors\n\nToday, Raviro and Beauty are a living testimony to the power of love, resilience, and compassion. They have faced the darkest moments of their lives head-on and emerged victorious, proving that with faith and a strong support system, anything is possible.\n\nAs they look towards the future, Raviro and Beauty are filled with hope and gratitude. They are determined to make the most of their second chance at life, cherishing every moment and never taking anything for granted.We may have had our share of struggles, but we also have a lot to be thankful for. We are survivors, fighters, sisters in arms, and together we can conquer anything that comes our way, Raviro says.\n\n",

            "content": "Zesas failure to expand the national grid, load shedding and the resulting need for users to be more energy self-sufficient have influenced a growing number of households, businesses and institutions into using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking.\n\nRecognising this rise in demand, investment in filling stations, gas tanks and accessories has been on the up in recent years. Some users are now exclusively relying on LPG for all their cooking even at times when the lights are on. They have gotten used to it and have also done the sums to conclude that doing so represents a saving given the high Zesa tariffs.\n\nThe Government has commended the growth in this area and noted the factors underpinning it.In the 2025 national budget, authorities removed the 13 percent value added tax (VAT) on LPG sales. The motivation was to make the fuel more affordable and widen options for users.\n\nWhile we celebrated the good intentions behind the VAT removal, retailers, even wholesalers perhaps, have not effected a concomitant reduction in LPG prices. It is business as usual since the tax was removed 31 days ago.\n\nThe intention was to lower the prices of LPG gas by the extent of the VAT that was being charged previously, said Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister, Prof Mthuli Ncube.\n\nHowever, the Government has noted with concern that some of the LPG operators have not reduced their prices, thus profiteering from the VAT relief, which was aimed at citizens.\n\nMthuli Ncube\n\nThis is unethical. I, therefore, urge LPG operators to reduce their prices by the extent of the VAT relief as intended. This will go a long way in giving relief to our consumers and citizens and is also consistent with the Governments efforts towards greening the economy.\n\nWe are exceedingly unhappy, as Prof Ncube surely is, over the refusal by suppliers to act as the Government expected them to with the duty review.\n\nThis is one of the many reasons why we have problems with local business generally. They pursue profit in a not-so-healthy manner. It is profit, profit and more profit. They have no regard for their customers. They have no regard for Government incentives. It is them and them alone.\n\nThis is plain greed and corruption which authorities must fight head-on so that policy pronouncements yield the positive effects they are intended to have for the common person.\n\nWe implore LPG suppliers to act the way they must; cut the price of the product by 13 percent. By refusing to do so, it means they are unfairly enjoying 13 percent more profit than they did before the duty waiver.\n\nIf they continue in their defiance, the Government must find a way of enforcing ethical business conduct in the LPG sector. This can involve a blitz to get the price lowered, reviewing the licensing mechanism or ticketing of those who are violating the law.\n\n",

            "content": "Martin Mahenga\n\nWHILE searching for inspiration online in April 2023, I stumbled upon an impressive artwork on a popular image website. To my shock, it was created by an image generator powered by artificial intelligence, not a human artist! My belief that computers couldnt create such art was shaken. How was this possible? I had to find out because, as a visual artist, this was going to affect me in one way or another.\n\nHow do computers learn how to draw? Well, they study countless pictures, picking up on different shapes, colours, and styles. With this knowledge, they can create their own images. This process, called machine learning, lets computers make art that looks like it was created by humans. I have simplified this explanation deliberately so that the layperson not familiar with computer terminology can understand the topic at hand.\n\nThis article aims to highlight the voices of local artists, including my own, and explore the profound impact of this emerging technology on our creative community. Obsessed with uncovering the truth behind this technological marvel, I embarked on a journey of relentless research, questioning, and debating with my peers. As I delved deeper, I sensed that this was not just a technological revolution but an emotional subject as well. The implications of AI in art sparked passionate discussions, revealing a complex interplay between innovation and human creativity.\n\nOf all the emotions I observe from artists online and in the real world, fear tops the list! Fear of being replaced by machines, fear of competition, and fear of being seen as someone whose work is in doubt, whether it was created by AI or not. But not Thamayi Maodza, a talented Bulawayo-based graphic designer who also dabbles in illustration using a ballpoint pen. Thamayi has been drawing well before image generation became a thing, but now he prefers to take a balanced view of this technology and not fear it.\n\nI use generative AI in my creative work. Not to replace my own creativity, but to enhance it. This is because, with generative AI, I can quickly tailor-make a picture that matches the exact needs of the work Im doing, as if I am a photographer telling a live model how to pose or to wear a certain outfit. This helps me create design work that more effectively meets clients needs, he said.\n\nGedion Tivafukidze\n\nArtists like Thamayi and many others who have been creating original work before the advent of AI in the visual arts are not doubted for their capabilities, as they have been proven. But what about a young artist currently in school who hasnt made a name for himself? How can his creativity shine when, by the time he finishes his university course, this technology will obviously be at a more advanced level? I decided to ask Mr Sibanda, my former art teacher and a Zimbabwean currently based in Botswana, for his perspective on how the emergence of this technology has impacted the learning curriculum of students.\n\nAI is yet another exciting tool that can deepen your insight into art themes. The syllabuses will give guidance on how far you may use AI. Further, one has to acknowledge by consent and communication that AI has been use, he said.Gideon Tivafukidze, a craft worker based in Harare, makes handmade toys and framed art pieces out of recycled materials. One of his impressive pieces is a handcrafted portrait of Econet founder, Strive Masiyiwa, made entirely out of discarded recharge cards.\n\nHe shares a different perspective: The way I see it, AI is definitely going to replace some art jobs, such as illustration and still images. As someone who makes artwork out of what you may call rubbish, it may be a long time before a computer does what I do, he said with a sense of pride.\n\nGideons craft and what he does really requires the dexterity of human hands which is the essence of craft artefacts, I wouldnt want a basket made by a 3D printing robot!\n\nJust from these few local examples, the three artists acknowledge that the artistic machines have arrived, and artists may have to create a hybrid workflow to use AI as a partner to usher in a new era of creativity. Adapt or be left behind!\n\nIn conclusion, as an artist myself, I foresee a future where AI will become part of my workflow as a form of inspiration or as a test space to throw new ideas and see if they stick before embarking on a big project such as a large painting, comic book, or whatever artistic task I may have before me.\n\nThamayi Maodza\n\nIt is crucial for artists to understand the principles and rules of visual and creative art because, without this knowledge, how can one know when the AI has got things right or wrong? Sometimes it does! There is a need for caution though, as no new technology comes without its drawbacks. These systems, as fast as they can create, do so after being trained on thousands of pre-existing images whose owners were not consulted during the machine learning process.\n\nI encourage readers to look into this further to understand the implications fully.Art is a timeless form of human expression that no machine can take away from any sentient being, irrespective of its speed or proficiency.A machine should serve only as a tool, a means to an end. So, keep expressing yourself through the gift of art.\n\n",

            "content": "Stanford chiwanga,[emailprotected]\n\nTHE recent ascendancy of Nqobile Magwizi as Zifa President, flanked by Kenny Ndebele and Loveness Mukura as his deputes, presents a pivotal juncture for Zimbabwean football.\n\nThe game, currently grappling with a myriad of challenges ranging from governance woes to a precipitous decline in performance, desperately requires a Lazarus-like resurrection.\n\nDrawing inspiration from footballing powerhouses such as Germany, Brazil, and Japan, Zifa must urgently formulate a comprehensive and sustainable development blueprint.\n\nAddressing the pressing concerns raised by Fifa and Caf regarding undue interference in football affairs constitutes the immediate priority. This necessitates a radical overhaul of Zifas governance structures, prioritising transparency, accountability, and a robust separation of powers. Implementing stringent financial controls and establishing an unwavering ethical framework for all stakeholders are crucial steps towards regaining Fifas trust and unlocking vital financial assistance.\n\nGermanys renowned football governance, characterised by its transparency and efficiency, serves as a compelling benchmark.Rekindling national pride in Zimbabwean football and turning the national team into Warriors demands an unwavering focus on player welfare. The timely disbursement of salaries and bonuses, ensuring access to top-tier medical care, and providing comprehensive insurance coverage are fundamental rights for all players called for national duty. Furthermore, investing in state-of-the-art training facilities, including high-performance centres equipped with cutting-edge technology and experienced sports scientists, is imperative to enhance player development and performance.\n\nKennedy Ndebele\n\nThis approach mirrors the success of the Bundesliga, where clubs invest heavily in youth academies and cutting-edge training facilities.\n\nCultivating strong relationships with all stakeholders is paramount. Zifa must actively engage with sponsors, fans, and the private sector through open dialogue, town hall meetings, and community outreach programmes. This approach fosters a sense of ownership and strengthens the bond between the game and the community.\n\nMoreover, leveraging the power of social media and digital platforms to engage with fans worldwide can significantly enhance Zifas visibility and attract a new legion of supporters.\n\nPlaying home matches away from home should embarrass the new Zifa leadership, it was not their doing but they should hang their heads in shame when the Warriors rent a stadium in a foreign land. Thus, rehabilitating and upgrading key stadiums, namely the National Sports Stadium, Barbourfields Stadium, and Rufaro Stadium, to meet the stringent standards of Fifa/Caf is crucial for hosting international fixtures and enhancing the overall matchday experience for players and spectators. This will not only improve the playing surface and spectator amenities but also contribute significantly to the economic growth of surrounding communities.\n\nRufaro Stadium\n\nRehabilitating the stadiums is just a start, constructing modern stadiums and training facilities across the country is paramount for the long-term growth and success of Zimbabwean football. These strategic investments will not only provide top-class facilities for players and coaches to thrive but also generate significant economic benefits for local communities.The bedrock of any successful football nation lies in a thriving grassroots movement.\n\nTo nurture a new generation of stars, Zifa must prioritise a robust programme that ignites the passion for the game at its very core. This necessitates the launch of nationwide school and community tournaments, where budding talents can flourish. Furthermore, regular coaching clinics conducted by seasoned coaches  think Sunday Chidzambwa, Gibson Homela  are crucial to hone raw skills and impart invaluable knowledge.\n\nA comprehensive talent identification system, meticulously designed to unearth hidden gems across the length and breadth of the country, is paramount. The Japanese J-League, renowned for its exemplary youth development programmes, serves as a compelling blueprint for Zimbabwe to emulate.\n\nThe Premier Soccer League (PSL) is in dire need of a significant revitalisation. Securing long-term sponsorship deals, combating the scourge of match-fixing through robust anti-corruption measures, and implementing stringent financial regulations to ensure the financial stability of all clubs are critical steps towards enhancing the leagues competitiveness. This approach echoes the efforts of the Spanish La Liga, which has successfully implemented strict financial fair play rules to safeguard the long-term sustainability of its clubs.\n\nThe continuous professional development of local coaches and referees is paramount to elevating the overall standard of play. Implementing comprehensive training programmes aligned with Caf/Fifa standards, including mentorship programmes and invaluable international exchange opportunities, will equip Zimbabwean football professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel on the global stage.\n\nGenerating sustainable revenue streams is paramount for Zifas long-term financial autonomy. Exploring innovative revenue-generating avenues, such as merchandise sales, membership programmes, and strategic partnerships with corporate entities, will provide a robust financial foundation for the development of Zimbabwean football. Zimbabwe just has to look across the Limpopo River to see how South Africa has gone about it  SAFA has diversified their revenue streams beyond the traditional reliance on matchday ticket sales.\n\nZIFA President Nqobile Magwizi and Warriors Coach Michael Nees\n\nThe growth of womens football constitutes a critical area of focus. Increased investment in womens leagues, coupled with improved infrastructure and the provision of equal opportunities for female players, is essential for ensuring gender equity and fostering a more inclusive football ecosystem.\n\nWomens football in the United States, with the success of the National Womens Soccer League (NWSL), demonstrates the value of increased investment.\n\nPartnering with schools to integrate football into the curriculum and actively engaging with rural communities to identify and nurture young talent will undoubtedly spread the love of the game across the nation.Some of Zimbabwes best players came from school academies and rural areas. The National Association of Secondary School Heads (NASH), a prominent school-level football competition in Zimbabwe, should be used to identify and nurture talent.\n\nZifa must realise that NASH plays a crucial role in developing young football talent across the country as the tournament features teams from various secondary schools, providing a platform for students to showcase their skills and potentially advance to higher levels of the sport.\n\nEstablishing a national football academy to nurture elite young players, coupled with forging strategic partnerships with leading international clubs, will provide invaluable exposure and unparalleled opportunities for Zimbabwean talent to compete at the highest level.\n\nThis approach, mirroring the success of renowned youth development programmes at many top European clubs, will not only significantly enhance the quality of Zimbabwean players but also pave the way for talented individuals to pursue successful professional careers abroad.\n\nThe foundation for a truly professional and competitive football environment rests upon a series of critical pillars. Firstly, the stringent implementation of Fifa/Caf club licensing standards is paramount. This ensures that clubs adhere to rigorous criteria encompassing financial stability, infrastructure, sporting performance, and personnel management.\n\nSecondly, a comprehensive overhaul of player contract regulations is essential, safeguarding the rights and interests of both players and clubs while fostering a more transparent and equitable system. Finally, professionalising league administration is crucial, encompassing aspects such as improved match officiating, efficient data management, and effective marketing and communication strategies.\n\nFinally, it is imperative to acknowledge the profound societal impact that football can exert. By strategically utilising the sport as a powerful catalyst for social development, we can unlock a myriad of benefits for the nation. Firstly, football possesses the unique ability to empower young people.\n\nIt provides a platform for personal growth, instilling crucial life skills such as discipline, teamwork, and resilience. Moreover, by engaging youth in meaningful sporting activities, we can effectively combat the insidious scourge of drug abuse, providing a healthy and constructive outlet for their energies. Furthermore, football can serve as a powerful unifying force, transcending social and economic divides.\n\nNqobile Magwizi\n\nBy fostering a shared passion for the game, Zifa can cultivate a sense of national pride and unity, bringing people together from all walks of life.\n\nThe ultimate success of the Magwizi-Mukura-Ndebele administration will hinge on their ability to foster unity within the football community, embrace best practices from across the globe, and deliver tangible results that inspire a new generation of players and fans. By cultivating a spirit of collaboration and inclusivity, they can unlock the true potential of Zimbabwean football.\n\n",
