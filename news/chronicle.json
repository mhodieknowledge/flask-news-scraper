In Bulawayo, where residents have been grappling with acute water shortages, many have turned to water harvesting to ease their challenges.\n\nIn an advisory issued yesterday, MSD forecast heavier rainfall from yesterday until Saturday.\n\nMeteorological Services Department\n\nAn abundance of moisture in the atmosphere, brought by a cloud system, has been causing rainfall across the country since late December 2024 and continues into January 2025. Matabeleland North, northern areas of Midlands, Harare Metropolitan, northern parts of Manicaland, and all Mashonaland Provinces are expected to receive scattered thunder showers from 5-8 January 2025, read the statement.\n\nThe MSD said on Wednesday evening, additional moisture from the south-east coast of Southern Africa would result in cloudy, windy, and cold conditions over Matabeleland South, Masvingo, and Manicaland Provinces.\n\nBy Friday, January 10, the rain showers are expected to intensify in the southern parts of Mashonaland West, Mashonaland East, and Harare Metropolitan Provinces, with rainfall exceeding 50mm in 24 hours, the statement continued.\n\nMSD warned of potential flooding, even in areas where heavy rains might not have occurred, as floods could result from rainfall upstream. Violent storms may cause trees to fall, rooftops to be blown off, and billboards to collapse due to strong winds.\n\nNational police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi\n\nThe department advised the public to secure rooftops and properties, avoid parking vehicles under trees, refrain from standing under trees or being the tallest object to prevent lightning strikes and avoid using outdoor heavy machinery during storms.\n\nSeveral incidents have already been reported this rainy season. On December 23, a bus crossing the flooded Mletshane River in Gwanda District, Matabeleland South, missed a submerged bridge and was swept away, killing one person, with a three-month-old baby still missing.\n\nLast Friday, two people drowned in Lupane, Matabeleland North, while attempting to cross the flooded Tshangane River.\n\nNational police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi, urged the public to adhere to safety measures to prevent further loss of life.\n\nWe encourage parents to be vigilant and ensure children do not play near water bodies, trenches, or rivers, as this poses a drowning risk. Parents should be proactive in ensuring the safety of their children, he said.\n\nComm Nyathi also cautioned motorists against attempting to cross flooded rivers or submerged bridges.\n\nMotorists, cart drivers, and pedestrians must exercise extreme caution. We might be conducting awareness campaigns with stakeholders, but everyone must play their part in ensuring safety during this rainy season, he said. @nqotshili\n\n",

            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza,[emailprotected]\n\nTHE heavy downpours that continue to drench Zimbabwe have become both a blessing and a curse for residents of Rangemore suburb in Umguza District on the outskirts of Bulawayo.\n\nResidents are grappling with the dual realities of life-saving rains and the havoc they wreak on their poorly planned settlement.\n\nWhile the rains bring much-needed relief for water supplies and agriculture, they have turned roads into muddy quagmires and left some homes partially submerged, raising concerns about the structural integrity of properties in the area. Rangemore is home to many residents who work or run businesses in Bulawayo. Some students at local tertiary institutions also commute daily to the city, making road access critical. However, the persistent rains have rendered many roads in the sprawling suburb impassable, causing frustration and disruptions.\n\nUmguza RDC Ward 17 Councillor Garikai Godwill Mhazo whose ward covers Rangemore suburb stretching to West Acre along Bulawayo-Plumtree Road, acknowledged the residents plight, citing limited control over some of the affected roads.\n\nMajor roads from Rangemore leading to other suburbs such as Nkulumane and Emganwini are under the jurisdiction of Umguza Rural District Council (RDC), and we consistently maintain those roads, he said.\n\nHowever, smaller roads leading to residents homes are still under the control of land developers or plot owners. Until these roads are officially handed over to the council, there is little we can do.\n\nClr Mhazo said the roads are inaccessible, especially during the rainy season.\n\nWe are aware that residents are not happy with the situation. Umguza RDC will continue to maintain the roads under its control, he said.\n\nFor residents like Mrs Noma Mhlanga, the rains have brought mixed blessings.\n\nThe rains are vital for drinking water and crops, but they also make life difficult. Walking less than half a kilometre to the main road to catch transport to work becomes a nightmare after heavy rains, she said.\n\nHaving lived in Rangemore for seven years, Mrs Mhlanga observed that the situation has worsened with each rainy season.\n\nThe dust road leading to the tarred main road gets so muddy making it almost impossible to walk out of the house, she said.\n\nMr Givemore Muneti, another resident, described how his yard turns into a pool of water during downpours.\n\nThere are no storm-water drainage systems here, so the rainwater has nowhere to flow. Ive resorted to using buckets to collect water from my yard and throw it into the streets, he said.\n\nCllr Mhazo explained that while the council is working on constructing storm-water drainage systems along major roads, the smaller roads remain the responsibility of private developers.\n\nThe challenges faced by Rangemore residents mirror those in other areas, such as Cowdray Parks Hlalani Kuhle/Garikai section, where perennial flooding has forced the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) to take drastic measures.\n\nTo address flooding in Cowdray Park, BCC has identified 17 properties for demolition to make way for a storm-water drainage system. These properties include completed homes, undeveloped stands, and houses at various construction stages. Some of the affected homes are over 15 years old.\n\nAffected residents have expressed frustration, citing a lack of clear communication and concerns over compensation.\n\nUrban flooding is a growing challenge in Zimbabwe, exacerbated by construction in wetlands and floodplains. Impervious surfaces such as roads, parking lots, and buildings prevent rainwater from seeping into the ground, causing even small amounts of rainfall to result in flooding.\n\nFor Rangemore residents like Mr Muneti, the fear of future displacement looms large.\n\nWho knows what will happen in 10 or 20 years? Maybe we will also be told to vacate our homes to make way for storm-water drainage systems, just like the residents of Cowdray Park, he said.\n\n",
