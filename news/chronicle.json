            "content": "Chronicle Writer\n\nBYOSHUTDOWN, the largest entertainment show in the city, has paid tribute to the countrys forebears for liberating Zimbabwe while also praising the Second Republic for creating economic opportunities, especially for the youth.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa will preside over this years national Independence Day celebrations, which will take place in Nembudzia, Gokwe, in the Midlands, as part of the Governments devolution of national events.\n\nUnder the theme Zim @45: Devolve and Develop Together Towards Vision 2030, the celebrations will be cascaded to provinces, each of which will be overseen by the respective Ministers of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution.\n\nThe Bulawayo Annual Shut Down, a musical show featuring artists from across the country and beyond, will take place in the city on April 26. Organisers believe its growth is a result of the opportunities given to young people by the Government.\n\nAhead of the shutdown, the second edition of the BYO PIANO Fest will be held on April 12, featuring internationally acclaimed South African DJ Maphorisa, Leemcray, Scotts Maphuma, and a range of local acts, including Umlungu Omnyama, Kotwane Hikwa, Keezy-AM, and DJ Sida.\n\nThe shutdown itself will feature Winky D, Enzo Ishall, DJ Tamuka, Oriyano, Bazooker, Killer T, Mzoe 7, and DJ Eugy, along with other local talents.\n\nFrom neighbouring South Africa, Uncle Waffles, DJ Tira, Nasty C, EMTEE, and ZEE Nxumalo will add flair to the carnival.\n\nOur shows are part of the celebrations leading up to and following the Independence Day festivities, and we join the rest of the nation in honouring the sacrifices made by the sons and daughters of the soil to liberate our country from colonialism, said Mr Rice, who is also involved in the hospitality industry.\n\nWe do not take our freedom for granted, as we are now enjoying opportunities that the majority of black Zimbabweans did not have during the colonial era.\n\nRecording growth each year since its inception, Mr Rice stated that the shutdown has worked to benefit all sectors of the economy.\n\nWe are inspired by President Mnangagwas philosophy that Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo / Ilizwe lakhiwa ngabanikazi balo. Through these events, we employ more than a thousand young people and help them support their families. It is part of our efforts to keep the youth off the streets and contribute, in our small way, to the fight against drug and substance abuse. Some of the young people we have worked with in the past have excelled and been employed in our hospitality industry. While we cannot offer permanent employment to all of them, we will continue doing our best to support the youth.\n\nMr Rice added that the musical shows have also provided a platform for local musicians and DJs to showcase their talent.Beyond that, we are collaborating with a number of content creators, as seen on platforms like TikTok, to promote both the music shows and our hospitality business. What we are trying to create is a vast ecosystem that will benefit as many people as possible, inspired by the Presidents philosophy of leaving no one and no place behind.\n\nWe fully recognise that all of these benefits are made possible by the sacrifices of our freedom fighters and the leadership of those committed to the pursuit of total liberation under the guidance of our Government and President, said Mr Rice.\n\nIn response to recent controversy surrounding the use of Queens Sports Club for their shows, Mr Rice stated that they should not be treated as offenders.\n\nFor every venue we book for our shows, everything is done transparently. We have never engaged in any illicit activity to warrant the negative portrayal weve received from certain sectors, said Mr Rice.\n\nAll we wish to do is provide top-tier entertainment to Bulawayo and beyond, as we attract people from outside the city to our events. We are a group of young people enjoying the fruits of our independence, and I firmly believe that we should be celebrated, not maligned.\n\nMr Rice urged Zimbabweans to cherish the countrys independence and commit to contributing to its development.\n\nAll of us have a responsibility to build our nation and develop together, as the theme of this years celebrations encourages, he said.\n\n",

He was remanded in custody to April 17 for trial.\n\nProsecuting, Mr Ngonidzashe Shumba told the court that in February this year, Ncube lured the young girl into his house under the pretext of giving her sweets, before allegedly raping her.\n\nOn the day in question, the complainant was playing outside her home with other children when the accused called her into his house, claiming he wanted to give her sweets to share with her friends, said Mr Shumba.\n\nOnce inside, the court heard, Ncube directed the girl to his bedroom where he allegedly raped her. He then gave her sweets and instructed her to return outside and continue playing.\n\nThe following day, the girl began complaining of pain in her private parts, prompting her to confide in her mother. A police report was made, leading to Ncubes arrest.\n\nIn his defence, Ncube denied the allegations, claiming they were fabricated by the complainants mother due to a personal grudge.\n\nYour Worship, I didnt rape the complainant, and I have never summoned her into my bedroom. The complainant is young enough to be my daughter. I am a principled person and would never do such a thing.\n\nHe further told the court that he had previously had a dispute with the complainants mother, which he believes led her to make false accusations against him.\n\n@DubeMatutu\n\n",

This will contribute to the competitiveness of the industrial sectors by building their capacity to adopt, invest in and utilise energy-efficiency.\n\nUnder the mining sector which is strategic in the national economy, the policy says that the sector is a massive consumer of electricity accounting for more than 20 percent of the utility generated power.\n\nThe implementation of the energy efficiency in mining will not only improve their international competitiveness but can also deliver significant benefits to other energy consumers, it says.\n\nThe Government shall encourage the mining sector to improve on their energy intensities. This will be enhanced by establishing institutional energy efficiency policies and energy management programmes.\n\nTurning to the artisanal and small-scale miners energy efficiency improvement, the policy encourages the establishment of an energy consumption baseline for small-scale and artisanal miners.\n\nThis data shall be a reference point in the continuous improvement of their energy intensities.\n\nOn agriculture Government undertakes to promote energy-smart Argo-chain systems that will take full advantage of available renewable energy and waste-to-energy technologies.\n\nThe Government undertakes to explore, integrate, and apply various energy efficiency technologies in specified value chains as enshrined in the Agriculture Food Systems and Transformation Strategy (AFSTS), reads part of the document.\n\n",
