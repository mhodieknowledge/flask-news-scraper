            "content": "Sikhumbuzo Moyo,[emailprotected]\n\nTORRENTIAL rains accompanied by strong winds wreaked havoc in several suburbs of Bulawayo, leaving scores of families homeless after their roofs were blown off.\n\nThe unexpected storm, which struck late Tuesday afternoon, caused widespread damage, flooding homes and uprooting trees.\n\nThe violent winds that swept through the city tore off roofs in Sizinda, Richmond, Harrisvale, and Entumbane suburbs, damaged property, and left families exposed to the elements. A church and a school had their roofs blown off.\n\nIn Sizinda suburb, 20 families at Sizinda Flats and two in Richmond and Harrisvale suburbs, are now grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious storm. Ntabeni Primary School in Entumbane had two of its classroom blocks roofs ripped off by strong winds including the New Apostolic Church in Sizinda whose entire roof was completely blown off. The heavy downpour lasted for about three hours, inundating streets and overwhelming the citys drainage systems.\n\nThe Bulawayo Fire Brigade swiftly attended the scenes, working through the better part of the night and until yesterday as they provided temporary coverage to the roofs using salvaged sheets.\n\nLocal Government director for Bulawayo, Mrs Tswagai Fikile Marovatsanga, who also heads the provincial Civil Protection Unit, said the Bulawayo Fire Brigade managed to live up to expectations and saved the day when they attended to all the affected homes including the school.\n\nThe New Apostolic Church roof damaged by heavy winds on Tuesday in Sizinda suburb in Bulawayo\n\nThe council fire brigade attended to the scenes and managed to provide overhead coverage to the affected areas. We are, however, facing a reality of dwindling resources and should we have a similar situation, we fear that we will face a big challenge in terms of rendering assistance, she said.\n\nMrs Marovatsanga said they are seized with harnessing more resources.\n\nChief fire officer for Bulawayo, Mr Mhlangano Moyo said the Sizinda families are in urgent need of food, clothes, and blankets as most of their belongings including food were soaked in water.\n\nHe said the cost of the damages is estimated to be around ZWG200 000.\n\nOne of the victims in Sizinda where residents woke up to scenes of devastation, Gogo Eresia Machokovhingo, recounted the terrifying moments when her roof was blown off.\n\nIt happened so quickly. One moment we were having supper, and the next, the wind was howling, and our roof was gone. Rain poured into the house, soaking everything and we lost all our foodstuff and also slept without blankets, she said.\n\nWe didnt know what our fate would be going forward as you can see that the rains are still with us, we are however, grateful to the Fire Brigade for the temporary shelter.\n\nAnother affected tenant at Sizinda Flats, Mr Trust Zabi said he had already used his resources to repair the roof of his flat.\n\nWhen a Chronicle news crew arrived, builders were busy replacing the roof.\n\nReplacing the roofing sheets including labour will cost me around US$250. I decided to use my means rather than waiting for the council to assist. I dont know when these rains will stop, said Mr Zabi.\n\nHe said he was yet to quantify the damage to some of his household property especially electrical gadgets such as the television set, radio, and stove that were exposed to rain when the roof was blown off.\n\nResidents repair one of Sizinda flats roofs, which was blown away by strong winds\n\nThe SADC Humanitarian and Emergency Operations Centre (Shoc) on December 31 issued a heavy rainfall advisory for the SADC region. Based on the advisory issued, a tropical storm, which is 3000km away from Zimbabwe was expected to bring heavy rainfall with some thunderstorms from the period of January 10 to 15.\n\nThe Bulawayo CPU committee is still faced with the dilemma of relocating Cowdray Park residents whose homes are still drenched in water since last week.\n\nThe committee had identified Cowdray Park Secondary and Tategulu Primary Schools as possible relocation sites but the challenge now is that schools have opened for the first term.\n\nMeanwhile, in its situation report on rainfall-induced and drowning incidents across the country, the CPU national directorate has reported that two middle-aged men are marooned along the Runde River, near Citrus Plantation, Section 10, in Chiredzi Masvingo province with growing fears for their safety as the rivers water flow is rapidly increasing in intensity.\n\nThe District Civil Protection committee is swiftly assembling a rescue team to respond to this emergency and ensure the safe evacuation of the stranded individuals, reads the report.\n\nIt also reported that on January 11, Muponjane Primary School in Zvishavane, Midlands province was hit by a devastating storm that caused significant destruction to infrastructure. The disaster resulted in four classrooms losing their roofs entirely with the estimated costs of repairs being US$8 120 and the disaster has exacerbated the existing classroom shortages at the school.\n\nAccording to CPU, 15 people have lost their lives since the start of the 2024/25 rainfall season\n\nOf these deaths, three are in Masvingo, Mashonaland East and Mashonaland West provinces, two in Manicaland and Matabeleland North provinces respectively while Midlands and Matabeleland South recorded one each.\n\n",

Democracies across the world have healthy interactions between the ruling party and the opposition, he said.\n\nThe real issue is whether or not the opposition remains true to the independent political demands of its constituency.\n\nSen Tshabangu added that the oppositions engagements with Zanu-PF reflect a commitment to advancing national interests while maintaining its independence.\n\nWe have maintained that the status quo is inconsistent with the objectives of the struggle for national liberation.\n\nOur engagements with the ruling party have asserted this contention, he said.\n\nSen Tshabangu called for a shift in opposition politics, urging maturity and a focus on home-grown solutions.\n\nThe tragedy is to assume that opposition should oppose for the sake of it. It is not enough to oppose. In fact, it is not the task of the opposition. The task is to offer alternative, objectively sound and home-grown solutions made by Zimbabweans, for Zimbabweans,and about Zimbabweans, he said.\n\nTurning to Zanu-PFs resolution to defer the 2028 elections to extend President Mnangagwas term until 2030, Sen Tshabangu said the CCC had not yet deliberated on the matter.\n\nThat issue has not been considered by the party. At present, it is a matter internal to Zanu-PF. Zanu-PF has neither approached us on the issue nor presented it in the appropriate legislative body for deliberations, he said.\n\nSen Tshabangu said the issue of the deferring of elections has not arisen in any of their party meetings, stressing the importance of understanding and debating the reasons behind any proposal to defer elections.\n\nIt will be important to understand and debate the reasons for the argument of the deferring of elections and how that benefits us as a people and country. Deferring elections cannot be an end in itself, he said.\n\nOn the question of CCCs internal structures, Sen Tshabangu acknowledged the need for a congress to elect substantive leaders.\n\nCongress is an absolute necessity. We are in the process of strengthening the party to prepare and have a congress. It will happen as soon as the conditions permit, he said.\n\nSince its establishment, CCC has operated without substantive structures, with internal confusion and divisions often dominating its ranks.\n\n@nqotshili\n\n",

Soccer has its own grievance pathways that have to be explored. We should never resort to the courts when it is clear which way to go towards conflict resolution in football, said Pamire.Pamire said those with guts to take matters to court are not football family members.\n\nMany of those who take matters to court do not care about football, they do it because if they are sacked or banned, they wont lose anything. Football has its ways and those have to be respected, said Pamire.\n\nHe emphasised that Fifa statutes should always be followed.Pamire conceded that football laws at times are in variance with national judicial features but at the end of the day soccer must stay sport.\n\nMeanwhile aspiring Zifa board member, Alois Bunjira, has urged councillors to elect candidates they think are the best for Zimbabwean football.\n\nThe CAPS United legend and sees the upcoming elections as a perfect opportunity for the country to start afresh.Zimbabwean football has been under a Fifa appointed Normalisation Committee since July 2023, when the world governing body lifted a 17-month ban on Zifa, that was caused by a cocktail of factors including Government interference.\n\nThe Normalisation Committee, which is headed by former Dynamos chairman Lincoln Mutasa, steps down after the January 25 election.\n\nZifa Normalisation Committee chairman Lincoln Mutasa (left) and committee member Rosemary Mugadza\n\nBunjira, is one of the over 30 candidates vying for the six board member positions.A former Mamelodi Sundowns and Zimbabwe national team player, Bunjira says he is not getting into the race because he is a former star footballer, but because of what he believes he can bring into football.\n\nThe 49-year-old rose through the ranks as a footballer and founded an academy called Albun when he retired.He grew up in Zengeza, Chitungwiza, where he played junior football before he joined Wieslaw Grabowskis Darry T.Bunjira also played for the now defunct Blackpool before he joined Harare giants CAPS United.\n\nAfter winning the Premier Soccer League championship with Makepekepe in 1996, the year he also won the Golden Boot, Bunjira crossed the Limpopo River into South Africa where he turned out for several clubs.\n\nIn South Africa he played for Bidvest Wits, Mamelodi Sundowns and Jomo Cosmos.Bunjira was also part of the Warriors squad at their maiden African Cup of Nations finals in 2004.\n\nIt has been a while since we last saw former footballers trying to get into Zifa leadership positions.Being a former footballer is an advantage, it has given me a lot of knowledge, a lot of experience.\n\nIve lived it, Ive played football from a very young age and I know the process.Ive gone through a lot of different administrations in different countries in Zimbabwe, South Africa, America and Europe, said Bunjira.\n\nAlois Bunjira\n\nThe former Sundowns star wants to turn back the hands of time, if elected into office.He wants to reintroduce a sound junior football development structure.\n\nThe number one problem we have in Zimbabwean football at the moment is the lack of a proper structure.We have dismantled the whole football and that needs to be restored.\n\nBunjira actually thinks commercialisation of Zifa should be done after restoration of proper structures.Ive heard people talking about commercialisation and everything. Yes. Indeed, football needs to be commercialised, but not before we restructure and put the structures back in place.\n\nWe need to see kids playing football again. We need to see primary schools playing football again.We need to see juniors playing from area zones, districts and provinces.\n\nWe need to have a proper tertiary football league. You know what, we have a lot of academics who are good at football. We have lost so much talent through education.\n\nOur culture is that we focus too much on school at the expense of sport, said Bunjira.He added: In that vein, it is prudent for all Premier Soccer League and Division One teams to have junior teams.\n\nI played junior football for an Area Zone team called Hotspurs in Chitungwiza.The likes of Lloyd Mutasa and Ralph Kawondera won national junior tournaments with Division Four teams like Kunaka Trading Stores (KTS) in Chitungwiza.\n\nBunjira squares up against some big names in football administration including Sweeney Mushonga, Gilbert Saika, Davison Muchena, Andrew Tapela and Modern Ngwenya.\n\nSimba Bhora director Brighton Ushendibaba, long-time womens football benefactor Lewis Muzhara and Dutch Academy director Kudzai Kadzombe are also contesting for the board member positions.Ex-footballers Walter Musanhu, Harlington Shereni and Terrence Malunga are also in the race.\n\n",

I think for us people, yes its sad, but nowadays people can find or source alternatives to have access to and keep up with their favourite movies. For example, Netflix and Showmax. Of course, it cannot be compared to the cinema, as you still miss that different scenery you get from the cinema compared to small screens like laptops and cellphones.\n\nCinema goers at a premire hosted by Ster Kinekor Bulawayo in this file photo\n\nThe advent of streaming platforms has undeniably changed how audiences consume films. With the convenience of watching movies from the comfort of their homes, attendance at cinemas has seen a significant decline.\n\nGrace Mguni, another patron, noted the operational challenges that led to Ster Kinekors closure.For Ster Kinekor, it made business sense to shut down. As much as movie lovers will miss the place, it cant be ignored that the cinema was gradually beginning to deteriorate.\n\nNotably, the once ever-so-clean toilets were beginning to lose their reputation due to them renting out to the church people, and snack prices were unreasonably high in efforts for the cinema to cover costs of operation. Basically, they reached a point where even patrons like myself knew something had to give.\n\nThe closure has also sparked nostalgia among moviegoers who cherish the unique experience that cinemas offer.A local film enthusiast, who preferred to be called MaKhumalo, said the closure of the cinema is a minus for movie lovers.\n\nIt leaves us bereft of teenage debts, the sound of the PA system bellowing throughout the arena, as well as the switching off of lights and the whole ambience with friends and family. Watching a movie is more than just seeing it; its about the shared experience, the laughter and the excitement of being in a packed theatre.\n\nAs Bulawayo adjusts to this new reality without its beloved Ster Kinekor, the conversation continues around the future of cinemas in a world increasingly dominated by streaming services.\n\nWhile the allure of home viewing is undeniable, the community spirit and collective experience of watching a film in a theatre remain irreplaceable for many. @MbuleloMpofu\n\n",

The hearings are part of the Second Republics broader efforts to address grievances, particularly in Matabeleland and parts of the Midlands, where communities have linked underdevelopment to the effects of Gukurahundi.\n\nWhile the 1987 Unity Accord united liberation movements Zanu-PF and PF-Zapu, bringing peace to the nation, lingering social issues remain. The public hearings are expected to provide a platform for communities to chart a path forward in addressing these matters.\n\nTraditional leaders, mandated by President Mnangagwa to spearhead the hearings, have received training alongside their rapporteurs. Essential equipment, including recorders and laptops, has been procured to facilitate the process.\n\nThe countrys Constitution and customary law empower chiefs to resolve conflicts among people in accordance with traditions and customs. Speaking on the progress, Attorney-General Mrs Virginia Mabiza, who serves as the national coordinator of the programme, said preparations are on track.\n\nShe said the hearings steering committee on Gukurahundi met last weekend to discuss the modalities of implementing the programme.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting was to plan for the upcoming hearings. It is the hope that during the first quarter, the hearings are going to commence. These are public hearings and the media to a certain extent is going to be allowed as regulated by the sector, said Mrs Mabhiza.\n\nThat is the progress that we have recorded so far. Resources will never be adequate, but Im happy to announce that the Office of the President and Cabinet has availed some resources to take us somewhere and we are optimistic that the hearings will begin in the first quarter.\n\nNational Council of Chiefs president, Chief Mtshane Khumalo, expressed optimism about starting the hearings in February.\n\nI had a meeting with the Attorney-General (Mrs Mabhiza) on Monday where we discussed the matter. We aim to commence the hearings in February if everything goes according to plan, he said.\n\nThis will be a busy period for us. Although we intended to begin shortly after the President launched the programme, resource constraints delayed progress. However, we are now ready to move forward.\n\nChief Mtshane highlighted the importance of the Command Centre, which will serve as a secure repository for testimonies. Located at the corner of Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo Street and 9th Avenue in Bulawayo, the facility is undergoing renovations by the Department of Public Works to meet programme requirements.\n\nWe now have the Command Centre, which will be used for the storage of our data. We are going to be using the offices that previously housed the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission (NPRC). We have been assured that offices will be secure, we have been promised security 24/7, he said.\n\nTraditional leaders will conduct hearings in villages, but testimonies will be stored at the Command Centre for security reasons.\n\nTo ensure smooth operations, the Government is hiring staff for the Command Centre and plans to provide vehicles for the 72 to 73 chiefs involved in the hearings.\n\nCars will be hired for all the 72 to 73 chiefs to improve their mobility. The Office of the President and Cabinet will hire vehicles to enhance the mobility of chiefs and their teams during the hearings, Chief Mtshane said.\n\nAdditionally, a refresher training session for traditional leaders, including newly appointed chiefs, is planned, subject to funding availability.\n\nThe Gukurahundi public hearings are expected to play a crucial role in promoting healing and reconciliation while addressing unresolved issues from the past.\n\nSpeaking during the launch of the Gukurahundi manual to guide the holding of victim-friendly public hearings at the State House in Bulawayo in October 2022, President Mnangagwa emphasised the importance of unity. He noted that detractors have attempted to sow divisions, but the Government remains resolute in its commitment to fostering national cohesion.\n\nThe manual, developed through inclusive engagements between chiefs and various stakeholders, is a culmination of traditional leaders meetings with President Mnangagwa, which began in March 2019.\n\n",

Watched by an audience of about 2 500 including Heads of State and Government and their representatives, top officials and his supporters, he pledged to rationalise the civil service and reset government priorities. Achieving social and political stability in the country, he added, will be the priority of priorities.\n\nWe are delighted that President Chapo has taken over, extending the rule of the revolutionary party, Frelimo, by another five years. This came after an intense, violent campaign by the local opposition and their funders to disrupt the transition.\n\nIndeed, the plot by White interests, fronted by local opposition parties, to use the ballot and street violence to frustrate or unseat revolutionary parties has been clear in southern Africa in recent elections  South Africa, Botswana and Namibia. The campaign has succeeded in some cases but failed in others notably in Namibia and Mozambique.\n\nCde Daniel Chapo\n\nAs a matter of fact, however, the Western scheming started way back in 2000, with our country being the target. Illegal sanctions, the Movement for Democratic Change and a parade of civic bodies were unleashed against Zanu-PF. All that failed.\n\nIn Mozambique, we saw Mr Venancio Mondlane, who contested in the October 9 poll as an independent to emerge with 25 percent of the vote, inciting nationwide demonstrations. He left the country for some time, and returned ahead of President Chapos inauguration. Landing at an airport in Maputo, he performed a well-worn opposition antic, particularly in our country, when he comically took an oath of office.\n\nWe expect the chaos he has caused to die down soon, not just because of the robust response to it by law enforcement, but also because President Chapo is now in office.\n\nAn Islamist insurgency has been active in northern Cabo Delgado Province since 2017. It has resulted in deaths of almost 5000, displaced thousands and disrupted business.\n\nPresident Chapo has to find a way to end this carnage.Our brothers and sisters in Mozambique do not deserve all this having fought a protracted, bitter armed struggle for decades and fought Renamo bandits over the first 16 years of independence. They deserve lasting peace.\n\nThe president must also intensify the Frelimo effort to defeat poverty and promote greater economic development. The countrys vast natural gas resources, minerals and so on must be judiciously exploited in a manner that ensures more durable national development.\n\nAmid climate change, Mozambique has suffered the worst in the region as a result of floods, droughts and cyclones. We expect his government to build national resilience against these devastating phenomena.The order, like President Chapo himself, is very tall indeed but we trust Frelimo will deliver for its people.\n\n",

In the period under review, the group successfully completed upgrading the core network which marks a pivotal milestone of the digital service provider (DSP) journey.\n\nIt notes that the critical enhancement and modernisation effort has significantly improved the central part of the network, integrating systems such as charging, billing, and application servers in addition to enabling advanced digital and AI features.\n\nThe modernised network enables advanced digital use cases such as high-quality voice calls over 4G/LTE network (VoLTE).

            "content": "Gibson Mhaka,Zimpapers Politics Hub\n\nROAD traffic and work-related accidents are among the most significant disasters and emergencies that disproportionately affect the lives and health of children, youth, and individuals of working age.\n\nStudies have shown that road traffic accidents, for example, could become the seventh leading cause of death globally by 2030 if appropriate actions are not taken.\n\nThis growing problem suggests a potential increase in health problems, mortality, and medical issues resulting from road traffic accidents and work-related accidents in the coming years.\n\nPeople in need of trauma care after a road crash or work-related accident are most likely to survive if they receive definitive care within the Golden Hour  the first hour after the accident.\n\nMpilo hospital introduces trauma course\n\nThe risk of death or severe injury is believed to significantly increase after this critical period.Given the significant impact of these disasters and emergencies on public health, essential pre-hospital care and effective hospital preparedness play a pivotal role in managing and mitigating associated health and life-threatening issues.\n\nEssential pre-hospital care includes prompt communication, treatment, and transport of injured people to formal healthcare facilities.\n\nAccording to research, a major contributing factor to these tragic outcomes is often the delay in critical medical care.When accident victims reach the hospital, they frequently encounter delays in treatment due to a lack of adequate training among hospital staff in handling emergency situations.\n\nThis delay can be fatal, as timely medical intervention is crucial in minimising the impact of severe injuries and maximising the chances of survival.\n\nHospitals play a vital role in providing medical care and first aid facilities during disasters and emergencies.Since these disasters and emergencies, such as road traffic and work-related accidents, can lead to the death or injury of one or more individuals, hospitals and healthcare centres are often the first point of contact for injury victims.\n\nIn other words, hospitals provide ambulances and trained healthcare personnel to transport and transfer injured individuals.In addition to providing emergency care to injury victims at the time of the accident, the healthcare system also provides rehabilitation services for these victims.\n\nThe increase in the burden of hospital patients and the need for timely and effective provision of medical services by hospitals highlight the importance of hospital preparedness during disasters and emergencies, especially those resulting in mass casualty incidents.\n\nTo improve preparedness for emergencies and in line with international commitments to improve the countrys healthcare systems and strengthen national capacity for emergency health management, crisis response, and flexibility in healthcare systems, Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo has made history by launching Zimbabwes inaugural post-basic nursing diploma in accident and emergency management.\n\nThis ground-breaking initiative is designed to elevate the countrys emergency care to international standards.In an interview, Mpilo Central Hospitals chief medical officer, Dr Narcisius Dzvanga, revealed that the programme is being conducted in partnership with South Africas Wits University, which provides mentorship and support.\n\nDr Narcisius Dzvanga\n\nWe have introduced a post-basic nursing diploma in accident and emergency management. Its the first of its kind in the country, with mentorship and support from Wits University in South Africa, in addition to our local mentors, said Dr Dzvanga.\n\nThis two-year programme is not only designed to improve emergency patient care at Mpilo Central Hospital but also across the country. We have recruited staff from all corners of Zimbabwe, and as the number of trained professionals grows, we are confident more lives will be saved, he added.\n\nDr Dzvanga said the hospital seeks to tap into the skills from mentorship from the Wits University which is expected to provide material and human capital training.\n\nThe diploma curriculum includes training in patient management during air transport, aligning with the Governments Air Ambulance initiative launched last year.\n\nDr Dzvanga noted that the programme is critical for equipping medical professionals with advanced skills to handle various types of accidents.\n\nWhile all doctors and nurses have basic training in accident and emergency care, this programme takes it a step further, aligning with international best practices. It prepares our staff to handle any accident, whether its a fall, car crash, or domestic assault, he explained.\n\nThis initiative by Mpilo Central Hospital in partnership with Wits University highlights several key aspects of Zimbabwes efforts to improve its healthcare service delivery in addressing disasters and emergencies.\n\nThe establishment of this post-basic nursing diploma also signifies a significant step forward in improving Zimbabwes healthcare service delivery in addressing disasters and emergencies. By prioritising specialised training, collaborating with international partners, and focusing on building national capacity, the country can enhance its ability to save lives and mitigate the impact of these events.\n\nHeliDrive Zimbabwe air Ambulance technicians airlift a patient to Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare from United Bulawayo Hospitals recentlympilo\n\nRecognising their critical role in ensuring service continuity and effective healthcare delivery during disasters and emergencies, the World Health Organisation emphasises the importance of robust hospital preparedness and response capacity.\n\nIt is important to note that the effective implementation of hospital preparedness plans and crisis management strategies is paramount.\n\nBy introducing this inaugural post-basic nursing diploma in accident and emergency management, Mpilo Central Hospital is taking a proactive step towards significantly reducing mortality rates.\n\nThis specialised diploma will equip nurses with the advanced knowledge and skills necessary to effectively respond to a wide range of emergencies, from trauma and natural disasters to infectious disease outbreaks.Graduates of this programme will be invaluable assets in strengthening the hospitals capacity to handle critical situations, ensuring timely and efficient patient care during emergencies.\n\nFurthermore, this initiative aligns with the national goal of enhancing healthcare systems and strengthening emergency response capabilities.\n\nBy cultivating a cadre of highly skilled emergency nurses, Mpilo Central Hospital is not only improving its own capacity but also contributing to the overall enhancement of Zimbabwes healthcare systems resilience in the face of unforeseen challenges.This investment in specialised training will undoubtedly yield significant dividends in terms of improved patient outcomes and a more robust healthcare system for the nation.\n\nAccording to the Hospital Safety Index (HSI) defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the most crucial factor in hospital performance is having preparedness plans to deal with emergency conditions and unexpected events.\n\nIn this regard, evaluating hospital preparedness can identify critical gaps in readiness during emergencies and assess the current level of preparedness.\n\n",

            "content": "Fungi Kwaramba,Harare Bureau\n\nBANKABLE title deeds for State-owned land will not result in financial institutions seizing control of large tracts of land, or lead to the reversal ofthe Land Reform Programme,Chairperson of the Land Tenure Implementation Committee, Mr Kudakwashe Tagwirei, has said.\n\nSpeaking on ZBC TVs Face the Nation programme last night, Mr Tagwirei allayed fears that financial institutions would wrest land from beneficiaries of agrarian reforms who would have failed to service loans extended under the scheme.\n\nThe businessman also laughed off speculation that he was personally going to grab land from indigent or defaulting farmers, adding that the issuance of title deeds would indirectly address aspects of multiple farm ownership, as is stipulated in the countrys Constitution.\n\nOutlining the processes and mandate of the Land Tenure Committee, Mr Tagwirei said it was impossible for banks to take ownership of what is essentially State land.\n\nThe land belongs to the Government, it does not belong to the bank. If you look at the total value of this land that we are talking about, the actual value is around US$20 billion. There is no bank that can give a mortgage for that land.\n\nSo what the banks are merely doing is administering the mortgage that this farmer is going to get (through Government) on that piece of land. The ultimate owner of this land still remains Government, its not the bank that owns it.\n\nWhen the bank is repossessing this land for whatever reason, maybe the farmer has failed to pay, remember that the owner is still the Governmentok? They (banks) will have to consult Government, obviously, when they are doing that process.\n\nHe added: One of the things that you must understand is that these farmers are supposed to be commercial farmers, not subsistence farmers. When you were applying to get that piece of land, you were saying I want to be a commercial farmer.\n\nAnd the risks that are associated with being a commercial farmer are that you must make sure that you work the land so that you are able to pay back.\n\nMr Tagwirei said because title deeds were allocated on the basis of an individuals unique national identification number, this could help address public concerns about multiple farm ownership.\n\nHe emphasised, though, that this was not the committees core concern or its mandate.\n\nSection 289 of the Constitution says that any citizen of this country is allowed to have access to land. A citizen is a person. Its not an institution. Its a person. A person is identified by an ID number. The ID number represents a person. You cannot have multiple ID numbers\n\nWhen an ID is given to an individual, to a citizen of this country, the ID is a unique identifier to an individual. When we are issuing title to a farmer, the main focus point is the ID number; we will issue it on the basis of that ID number.\n\nWhen the bank repossesses this land,  because a bank cannot take land  on behalf of Government, the bank cannot then own the land because they have no ID number.\n\nOn claims that he would use his financial muscle to gain control of land, Mr Tagwirei said at an average valuation of US$2,000 per hectare of arable land, it was ridiculous to think he could purchase it because he did not have that kind of money.\n\nSome people have even said Kudakwashe Tagwirei wants to take all this land for himself because he can buy it, which I cant because I dont have US$20 billion to buy this land.\n\nMr Tagwirei explained that banks would only administer a fund that would, among other things, provide affordable financing to farmers.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa launched the bankable deeds late last year as part of measures to unlock the value of Zimbabwes agricultural land and to grow the economy in line with national development targets.\n\nThe deeds are structured as per recommendations of the Land Tenure Implementation Committee, which brings together 14 experts from a variety of fields.\n\n",
