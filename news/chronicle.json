            "content": "Innocent Kurira,[emailprotected]\n\nNQOBILE Magwizi, who was elected as the Zimbabwe Football Associations (Zifa) president has a vision to honour the countrys football legends.\n\nMagwizi won the Zifa president election by a landslide posting 61 votes, while his nearest\n\nPhilemon Machana (6), Twine Phiri (4), Marshall Gore (1), Makwinji Soma Phiri (0) and there were 5 spoilt ballots.\n\nMagwizi suggests creating a Hall of Fame section in stadia where seats would be branded with the names of iconic players like Peter Ndlovu, Moses Chunga and Benjani Mwaruwari.\n\nA portion of the revenue generated from the sale of these seats will then support the families of the celebrated players.\n\nThis initiative aims to celebrate Zimbabwes football heritage, inspire young players and unite fans. Magwizi also emphasized the importance of recognising off-field heroes such as commentators and scouts. His proposal released on his social media handles is part of his campaign for the ZIFA presidency. The elections are on this coming Saturday.\n\nAs an aspiring ZIFA president, I believe its time to reimagine how we honour our football legends. Imagine a Hall of Fame section of the stadium with seats branded in the names of icons like Peter Ndlovu, Moses Chungaand many more. A legacy immortalised for future generations as we honor the greats who made Zimbabwean football unforgettable.\n\nFans could buy tickets for these legend seats at a small extra fee, with a portion supporting the families of the players, said Magwizi.\n\nPicture this: fans seated in the Peter Ndlovu 12 or Moses Chunga 7 seats, taking selfies and sharing memories of these legends on social media. Wed create an atmosphere of pride, excitement, and connection in our stadiums, one seat at a time.\n\nThis initiative will not just honour history but inspire the future. Young players will dream of seeing their name on a seat one day. Every match day will become a celebration of our heritage and a reminder of whats possible in Zimbabwean football, said Magwizi.\n\nHe called for the uplifting of football legends.\n\nLets celebrate our heroes, uplift their families and unite fans under a common cause. As Zifa president, this will be one of the many steps Ill take to restore pride and passion to our football. Together, we can make this dream a reality.\n\nWould you join me in sitting on a seat dedicated to a legend? How many selfies would you take in a Benjani Mwaruwari seat? Lets honor the past and ignite the future of Zimbabwean footballtogether, said Magwizi.\n\nLets not forget our off-field heroes too. Imagine a seat dedicated to Charles CNN Mabika our iconic voice of football! His expert analysis, radio and TV commentary have shaped how we experience the beautiful game.They are many more like him even scouts and football executives, he said.\n\nMagwizi, former Premier Soccer League boss Twine Phiri, Northern Region Soccer League chairperson Martin Kweza, former Zifa board member Philemon Machana, football advocate Marshall Gore and former Highlanders and Dynamos striker Makwinji Soma Phiri will battle it out for the presidency.\n\n @innocentskizoe.\n\n",

The vice president must act in accord with the ultimate FA president, who is the arrowhead of the organisation for progress and success to be achieved by the entire leadership team. Zimbabwean football has, in the past 15 years, faced a myriad of challenges.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent suspension from FIFA membership exacerbated the situation, leaving the game in dire need of reform on all fronts. We need to sort out that mess. And it is important to realise the need and commit to a paradigm shift in the entire football organisations governance and operational approaches, said Ndebele.\n\nHis campaign hinges on 11 pillars that speak to re-organisation, governance, capacity development, club licencing, decentralisation, grassroots and youth football, womens football development, collective responsibility, communication, marketing, and ideal competition participation.\n\nNdebele, who is on record citing governance challenges at the countrys football mother-body, will face competition from ex-Zifa vice president Omega Sibanda, former PSL and Highlanders chairman and now Bosso board member Peter Dube, James Takavada, and Francis Nyamutsamba.\n\nNdebele stressed the importance of working collaboratively with the Zifa president and other stakeholders to implement effective programmes and reforms.\n\nMy key commitments will be to work closely with the president, offering support. Be available at all times to take the role assigned by the president and stand in for him. I will also keep abreast of the organisations activities, including those of subcommittees, and be supportive in providing guidance for strict strategic planning and implementation of policies and plans. I will be committed to unwavering, principle-focused leadership at all times and ensure a culture of prompt decision-making, communication, and enforcement, said Ndebele.\n\nHe boasts of a career spanning several leadership roles in football, including serving as Highlanders secretary and chairman as well as coordinating the 2009 Cosafa tournament. He was also the marketing director for the African Union Sports Council Region 5 Games that were hosted by Zimbabwe a few years ago.\n\nNdebeles academic credentials include a Science Politics and Administration (Hons) Degree from the University of Zimbabwe (UZ), a Diploma in Management of Olympic Sport Organisations from the IOC, and a FIFA Futuro III Regional Instructor Administration and Management Certificate.\n\n",

Sometimes, septic tanks overflow during the rainy season, posing a health hazard for residents.\n\nThe meeting has been welcomed by residents as a major step toward addressing these challenges. Mr Khumbulani Mpofu, one of the residents, said there is hope for proper water, sanitation, and hygiene.\n\nPeople paid for servicing and were disappointed that nothing has happened, considering the time we have stayed in BD46 without sewerage and with parts of the road unserviced. However, we are excited and joyful that something is finally coming up, Mr Mpofu said.\n\nAnother resident, Ms Simangaliso Tshuma, said the meeting shows the local authoritys regard for residents.\n\nThis is an opportunity for us to air our views and concerns. We dont feel comfortable without a sewer system in the area. We are hoping this meeting will finally bring about a solution for BD46, she said.\n\nA church leader who preferred to remain anonymous narrated how their church had struggled with a shortage of water since the year 2000.\n\nThe church was established in 2000, and we relied on temporary Blair toilets until 2005. Since then, we have been using a septic tank system. You can imagine the challenges this has posed for people, as it is hazardous for a church not to have a proper sewer system. We really look forward to the meeting called by the council, and we hope that its not just a meeting but one that will quickly address the challenge, he said.\n\nThe local authority is implementing a US$4 million WASH project, where it is constructing overhead and underground water reservoirs in Mkhosana to address the entire WASH programme.\n\n",

Notably, intercity buses carrying suspected contraband have been detained in some of the latest operations.\n\nEngineer Tafadzwa Muguti, the Permanent Secretary forPresidential Affairs and Devolution, witnessed the sheer scale of the problem first-hand when he toured the CONDEP on Thursday.\n\nThe warehouses were teeming with diverse items from household appliances like stoves and refrigerators to everyday necessities like diapers, alcohol, and tinned foods.\n\nMuguti reinforced that no one is above the law in the fight against illicit trade, emphasising that the crackdown would not tolerate any exceptions.\n\nThe anti-smuggling campaign is now a lifestyle. We are simply saying zero tolerance to smuggling. We are aware that we have porous borders as a country. We are aware that some villages along the borders are now leasing out storage space to smugglers and we will deal with them decisively, said Muguti.\n\nWe are aware that we also have political elements who tried to politicise His Excellencys vision of rebuilding the economy by stopping smuggling. We can confirm that this has nothing to do with politics.\n\nHe said going forward, all confiscated goods would be forfeited to the State.\n\nAs you can see behind me, we have hundreds of thousands worth of alcohol in this warehouse, which was confiscated, and as you saw outside, we have many vehicles, which were also impounded for smuggling. What we are simply saying, according to the Customs and Excise Act, is that anyone who tries to import, export, introduce, or anyhow put something onto the Zimbabwean economy or market without following the relevant customs and excise laws, the law says they are stealing from the State.\n\nSo, we are done with the days when we confiscate things and ask you for a nice, friendly fine in return.\n\nFrom now going forward, you smuggle something into the country, we catch you, you forfeit it to the State, and that becomes a State asset. Essentially, when people are smuggling, its a criminal enterprise, Muguti said.\n\nHe questioned the logic of smuggling electric stoves which are readily available in the country.\n\nWhy should we have refrigeration being smuggled into the country when weve got companies in Bulawayo and Harare, which are now manufacturing these appliances?\n\nWe are not saying we do not want imports. You can import,but we want a fair playing ground. Pay your dues and pay your taxes.\n\nAccording to security officials, smugglers are avoiding the border and using the border flanks.\n\nThey then load the goods into intercity buses or cargo trucks in Beitbridge before transporting them to various destinations in Zimbabwe. To enhance surveillance, authorities are deploying high-tech security systems, including drone surveillance.\n\nGoods can be held for 60 to 90 days under the Customs and Excise Act. Various disposal methods, including rummage sales and destruction, are also used to clear warehouses.\n\n",

Returning to Zimbabwe in 1974, he spent his formative years shuttling between Mhlahlandlela and his rural roots in Emanxeleni, Ntabazinduna.\n\nDlaminis journey then led him to South Africa, where he quickly rose to prominence through his captivating performances in various television productions.\n\nWhile his portrayal of Stan Nyathi in the popular eTV soapie, Scandal, undoubtedly garnered him widespread recognition, it might surprise many to learn that this isnt necessarily his most cherished role.\n\nNo, it would be the role of Christopher in astage play I did at the LibertyTheatre on Mandela Square in Sandton. This is because the play was based on an award-winning book in London that I had never read before.\n\nWhen I was offered the role, I was drawn to it because it was challenging and complex, it was a lovely piece for all of us. I understand why he won the award because it was a lovely piece, he said.\n\nAsked to encourage the new generation of thespians, Dlamini said: Continue to love what you do, and continue being passionate about chasing new ideas, and education. Be passionate about innovation, ingenuity, (and) invention in your craft. Be knowledgeable about your craft. Love your craft so much so that you wake up in the morning and Google more about your craft.\n\nLearn more and have the attitude that youll never stop learning. Things are developing so fast in the world today so you have to keep up.\n\nThe seasoned actor expressed his optimism about the potential of Zimbabwes film industry. After spending years abroad, Dlamini is eager to reconnect with the creative scene in his home country.\n\nEver since Ive been here, Ive seen a lot of potential within the film sector and other facets of art. As I was watching a play at the Bulawayo Theatre, I could see how invested these young ones are. Theres so much more we could do to help them, said Dlamini.\n\nQuizzed on whether he will feature in a soapie soon, Dlamini cheekily said: Yes, no, definitely, well . . . look, I dont know. The space Im currently in and have always been in is that I will work until the day I die, doing what I love doing.\n\nDlamini is a spiritual, scientific, and astronomic man.\n\nIsintu is a religion that existed before all other religions and it worked. Those values of humanity, empathy, I feel like we are losing and that they arent emphasised enough in other secular religions. Isintu sethu is as old as the stars and was developed because it worked for its society, that is, abantu.\n\nDlamini, who spent over two decades in the UK specialising in dramatics and theatre before moving to South Africa, reflected on his roots with pride.\n\nFrom a young age, it has all been theatre, stage work. Acting was what everyone else was doing. I tried football, but it didnt work out. I was always acting, he reminisced.\n\nHis first acting gig was at the Bulawayo Theatre in the 1970s, where he played two roles in the play The Baobab Tree, being a wise owl and the monkey.\n\nWith an impressive career that includes memorable roles in popular television series such as Scandal, Jacobs Cross, and Generations, Dlamini has become a well-respected figure in the South African entertainment industry. Though he doesnt know much about the current crop of actors now, Dlamini vehemently remembers the Harare International Festival of the Arts (Hifa).\n\nHis parents, grounded in culture, nurtured Dlamini on the education ethos where Dlamini and his siblings were taught to value their culture and education. He is not just an actor; he is also an engineer, scientist, and a devoted fan of Highlanders.\n\nDlamini revealed that he is set to participate in this years Imiklomelo kaDakamela, hosted by Chief Mbusi Bekithemba Dakamela of Nkayi on April 4-5.\n\nIm even embarrassed that its been this long since I was away. I need to come back and reacquaint myself with the scene. Theres a lot I have to learn and see, he said.\n\nDespite refusing to comment about rumours that he is homeless, Dlamini previously addressed the claims on Instagram.\n\nIm fine, I promise Im not homeless. Be sure of your sources of information. Dont compromise your integrity for 15 cheap minutes of fame.\n\nRecently, Dlamini assumed a new role as an independent film producer, an endeavour which saw him release The Cold Father, a move he described as traumatic.\n\nIt was traumatic in the sense that Ive never wanted to be behind the camera. I left paperwork in business when I left the corporate world and decided to be an actor. It was traumatic in the sense that it was also by force but a blessing in disguise because Ive learnt so much about my industry, he said.\n\nWith the nicely-trimmed lawn serving as a backdrop to our conversation, Dlamini alluded to such a place as a perfect specimen to his ideal resting spot after a long day at work.\n\nI relax in a garden, a pretty garden like this. With friends, family, I love my grandchildren, just the serenity of a beautiful environment. I look for this kind of serenity, he said.\n\nFollow on X @MbuleloMpofu\n\n",
