            "content": "Online Reporter\n\nBULAWAYO has been rocked by a surge in violent crime, with an illegal foreign currency dealer becoming the latest victim after being shot and robbed of thousands of US dollars by an armed suspect on Monday night.\n\nThe victim, Mthokozisi Nkomo, was attacked near Maplanka Shops in Luveve at around 9.30 PM soon after disembarking from a commuter omnibus from the city centre to Gwabalanda suburb.\n\nBulawayo acting police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Nomalanga Msebele, said Nkomo noticed a suspicious individual who had also disembarked from the kombi.\n\nSensing danger, he allowed the suspect to pass him along Intemba Road. However, the suspect suddenly pulled out a firearm and shot him in the stomach before making off with a bag containing US$5 700, BWP2 000, R1 400, and a Samsung A13 cellphone.\n\nThe complainant fell to the ground, bleeding profusely, as the suspect searched him and took his belongings before fleeing the scene, said Asst Insp Msebele.\n\nNkomo was rushed to Mpilo Central Hospital for treatment.\n\nAsst Insp Msebele said police have since launched a manhunt for the suspect. She warned residents against carrying large sums of money, especially at night, urging them to utilise banking services to minimise risk.\n\nAsst Insp Msebele said police are intensifying patrols and urging the public to provide any information that could help track down the perpetrators.\n\nThis incident comes amid a worrying increase in armed robberies in Bulawayo, particularly targeting fuel service stations and individuals handling large amounts of cash. Just a day before the forex trader was attacked, gunmen stormed a service station along Siyephambili Drive in Kelvin West, getting away with US$1 000 and R7 000.\n\nIn that case, three masked suspects armed with rifles and a pistol ambushed fuel attendants, firing a warning shot before forcing them into the cash office. The robbers seized all available cash and fled the scene.\n\nWe have witnessed an upsurge in armed robberies at fuel service stations. We urge operators to improve security measures, deposit daily earnings promptly, and minimise cash held on-site, said Asst Insp Msebele.\n\nThe escalating crime wave has prompted some fuel stations to revise their operating hours, shutting down at night to protect workers and customers. In recent months, a gang raided a Kelvin Industrial Area service station, escaping with US$2 374 and R115 235.\n\n",

Instead of depositing the money, they converted it for personal use and created fake CBZ deposit slips to mislead Ms Madonko. The scheme was uncovered when the school contacted Ms Madonko about unpaid fees, prompting her to file a police report.\n\nThe prosecutor, Ms Mufaro Ndirayire, said the first incident occurred on 7 February, when Ms Madonko handed Chipeta US$350 to deposit into the schools account. Chipeta then approached Shoko, who enlisted Mhlanga to forge a deposit slip using a fake stamp and printed confirmation slip. A second incident followed on 20 February, involving US$210, which Chipeta again failed to deposit.\n\nChipeta then approached Shoko and asked for a forged CBZ deposit slip. Shoko then engaged the services of Mhlanga, who forged the slip by designing a fake stamp and printing a CBZ bank confirmation of cash deposit slip, said Ms Ndirayire.\n\nTheir lawyer, Simon Mutandi of Sandi and Matshakaile Attorneys, pleaded for leniency, citing their status as first-time offenders and noting that they had compensated the complainant.\n\nChipeta faces additional charges of theft of trust property and fraud in connection with violating a trust agreement with Ms Madonko and misrepresenting the payment of school fees to Gloag High School. These charges stem from her role in producing fake deposit slips and deceiving both Ms Madonko and the school administration.\n\n",

The meeting, held in Harare last week, focused on creating a fair and sustainable tariff structure for cover bands operating within the country.\n\nStakeholders present at the meeting included representatives from NACZ, Zimura, academics, associations, unions, composers, cover band leaders, and beneficiaries of intellectual property rights.\n\nNACZ communication and marketing manager Aggabu Nyabinde issued a statement following the meeting, expressing satisfaction with the outcome and the willingness of all parties to continue the dialogue. The National Arts Council of Zimbabwe is pleased to announce the successful conclusion of a productive stakeholder meeting with Zimura and other music industry representatives. This meeting was prompted by lobbying from various music institutions who sought to address concerns following Zimuras announcement that all cover bands should pay a US$150 licensing fee per show, Nyabinde said.\n\nHe added that Zimura has expressed openness to revisiting the tariff if the proper lobbying processes are followed, including engaging with the composers whose music is performed by the cover bands.Zimura indicated that there is room for revisiting the tariff if the proper lobbying process is followed. They will engage the composers whose music is being performed by the cover bands for their input.NACZ will work closely with Zimura to facilitate the necessary processes and come up with a solution that brings unity and harmony to the music industry, Nyabinde said.\n\nThe National Arts Council is committed to fostering a vibrant and inclusive arts sector. This meeting marks a significant step forward in addressing the concerns of cover bands while upholding the rights of copyright holders.The NACZ highlighted the importance of aligning all stakeholders understanding of intellectual property rights and incorporating international standards for royalty collection from cover bands.\n\nA key point of the discussion centred on reaching an agreement on fair fees that respect both the rights of composers and the operational realities of cover bands.All attending parties agreed that music is intellectual property and should be compensated when used in any form. It is both legal and just for composers to seek compensation for the public performance of their work, Nyabinde said.The conversation also addressed the role of venue owners and festival organisers, who typically handle royalty payments for cover bands as part of their copyright licenses.In Zimbabwe, our law provides for Collective Management Organizations (CMOs) to collect directly from artists, Nyabinde outlined.\n\nThe meeting aligned with the National Music Strategy launched in 2022, which advocates for a well-structured copyright system that ensures fair distribution of royalties to all contributors, including songwriters, performers, producers, and publishers.This collaborative approach will not only benefit all stakeholders but will also contribute to the growth of Zimbabwes creative economy in line with the national vision for 2030, Nyabinde added.\n\nNotable attendees included NACZ executive director Napoleon Nyanhi, Zimura executive director Polisile Chimhini, and Zimbabwe Musicians Union representative Chioneso Rutsito.\n\nThe meeting marked a significant step towards resolving the ongoing concerns surrounding the licensing tariffs for cover bands and further strengthening the music industrys copyright framework.\n\n",

This is the second time, if not the third time, you guys are doing this, Shange commented, visibly upset.\n\nAyanda Shange\n\nThe post, which was later edited and deleted by Vocal Ex, sparked further debate in the comments section, with some followers praising the groups talent while others pointed out the lack of originality, suggesting that Vocal Ex should focus more on their own compositions instead of posting constant cover songs.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Vocal Ex reassured their fans, asking them to be patient as they are working on original material.\n\nScreenshots from the argument between Vocal Ex and Ayanda Shange\n\nThank you. Keep watching this space for details on the projects in the pipeline, the group said.\n\nA lesson to creatives who often post cover songs on social mediaPosting cover songs on platforms like Facebook requires proper legal steps, including obtaining a mechanical license from the copyright owner (usually the music publisher) or a third-party licensing service. If the cover is used in a video, a synchronisation license is also necessary.\n\nScreenshots from the argument between Vocal Ex and Ayanda Shange\n\nFor those who wish to share cover songs without legal issues, it is important to give credit to the original artiste and songwriter by tagging them or including a disclaimer. A simple statement clarifying that the music is not owned by the poster and that no copyright infringement is intended can help avoid legal complications.\n\n",
