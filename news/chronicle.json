            "content": "Online ReporterTHE meeting of SADC Ministers of Employment and Labour and Social Partners has commenced in Victoria Falls, with calls for the region to develop policies that formalise the informal sector to achieve sustainable development.The week-long meeting opened this morning with the Senior Officials Meeting of SADC, officiated by the Permanent Secretary for Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare, Mr Simon Masanga, who is the Chair of the SADC Employment and Labour Sector Senior Officials.Officiating at the meeting, Mr Masanga said that the region faces numerous challenges, including high levels of informal employment, limited access to decent work, and a skills gap that hinders productivity. He emphasised that employment remains at the core of sustainable development and industrialisation in the region.\n\nAs we meet under the theme of the 44th SADC Summit: Promoting Innovation to Unlock Opportunities for Sustained Economic Growth and Development towards an Industrialised SADC, it is important that we reflect on how employment and labour can contribute to this vision. Informal employment, which accounts for a significant share of economic activity in many SADC member states, presents both opportunities and challenges.On the one hand, it provides livelihoods for millions, and on the other, it often lacks social protection, fair wages, and adequate working conditions. It is imperative that we work towards the formalisation of the informal economy, which, according to the International Labour Organisation, is around 58.8 percent in Africa.\n\nAddressing informality through appropriate policies and strategies is essential for promoting decent work, reducing poverty, and achieving sustainable development. In addition, the integration of small to medium enterprises into the formal economy is particularly important, given their role as engines of job creation and innovation in our region, said Mr Masanga.He highlighted that, in light of these challenges, the meeting is not merely a formality but a critical platform to collectively strategise and find solutions.Mr Masanga stressed the need to create an environment that fosters innovation, entrepreneurship, and sustainable job creation.The meeting continues with closed-door discussions, culminating in the Ministerial session on Thursday.\n\n",

We urge petrol attendants not to keep large sums of money on themselves or on their premises but to deposit their monies in the safes under lock and key and day sales to be banked, said Asst Insp Msebele.\n\nThe worrying surge in armed robberies targeting Bulawayos fuel service stations has also forced the businesses to drastically alter their operations, with some now closing their doors at night.\n\nThis drastic measure comes in response to a persistent wave of robberies, a trend that began last year, where criminals have repeatedly targeted these establishments, making off with substantial sums of foreign currency.\n\nThe escalating threat has left fuel station owners and staff increasingly vulnerable, impacting both their livelihoods and the vital service they provide to the community.\n\nIn some of the incidents, a gang made off with a total of US$2 374 and ZAR115 235 after raiding a service station located in the Kelvin industrial area last month.\n\nHe said that the robbers forced the employees to lie on the ground before stealing the cash.\n\nIn a separate incident, Commissioner Nyathi reported that the same suspected group targeted a service station in Tshabalala, where they stole US$440 and a Toyota Altezza valued at US$3 200, which they later abandoned in the Pumula suburb.\n\nHe appealed to the public for information that could lead to the apprehension of the suspects, who were wearing balaclavas.\n\nHe urged business owners to strengthen their security measures by installing CCTV systems and other electronic security devices, such as trip alarms.\n\n",

Through this process, Makomo Resources settled its obligations to creditors and restructured its financial position, ensuring that it is no longer in financial distress, he said.\n\nMr Mbano said with the transition, the board and management will fully regain control of the companys operations upon the completion of the ongoing handover process.\n\nWe extend our sincere gratitude to the board, management, staff, creditors, the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development, Zimbabwe Power Company, Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company, and all other stakeholders for their unwavering support throughout the Corporate Rescue process.\n\nUnder our guidance, the company has regained financial stability, and we are confident that Makomo Resources is now well-positioned for future success. We wish the board and management continued growth and prosperity as they create value for stakeholders and contribute to the nations economy.\n\nMakomo Resources is a coal mining company in the Bulawayo Mining District of Zimbabwe, with its mineral resource at Entuba Colliery, which is situated approximately 17 kilometres from the Hwange, Matabeleland North province of the country.\n\nIts concession covers 7 000 hectares, which enables the mining concern to carry out open cast mining for the next 30 years at one million tonnes per annum plus another 100 years of underground mining.\n\nThe mining sector is a key player in the countrys economy, contributing more than 60 percent of Zimbabwes export receipts and attracting more than 50 percent of foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\nThe sector also contributes about 13 percent to the Gross Domestic Product, as well as generating significant downstream business and revenue injection to the fiscus through taxes.\n\n",
