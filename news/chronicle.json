She said the gang was armed with pistols, knives and axes when they pounced at Young Money General Dealer Shop, one of two grocery shops situated deep in Insuza at Jiba village.\n\nMs Nxumalo said she was attending to customers at the grocery shop at around 8PM, shortly before closing, when two of the suspects came and bought cigarettes. The shop was closed and the gang later attacked around 11PM, demanding gold reportedly kept in safe.\n\nThey were convinced there was gold in the shop, which was not the case. Gold mining activities take place in Nkosikazi area, which is far from here and our employer is not into gold buying or gold mining, said Ms Nxumalo.\n\nShe said the armed robbers spent the day drinking alcohol in the modest rural shop.\n\nThey just seemed like ordinary customers at the time. Little did we know that they were planning something sinister, said Ms Nxumalo.\n\nShe said long after the shop attendants had retired for the night, the gang broke into the shop, tied the employees with an electric cable and ransacked the place.\n\nThey were armed with pistols, knives and axes. They demanded gold and cash but were convinced that there was gold somewhere in the shop, said Ms Nxumalo.\n\nThe stolen items included an unknown amount of cash, groceries, a 48-volt lithium battery, an inverter and an amplifier, a nine-kilogramme gas tank and cellphones.\n\nIt was only after the robbers had left that one of the terrified shop employees frantically sought help at a grocery shop next door and asked for a cellphone to call her employer, who was at another business she owns in Nyamandlovu.\n\nThe call to my boss (Mrs Kholiwe Danisa Dube) was made around 01:30AM on Tuesday morning and she told us to seek refuge at a nearby homestead in case the robbers decided to come back while she called the police, Ms Nxumalo said.\n\nNational police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi could not be drawn to divulge more information last night saying his office will provide a further update today (Thursday) saying investigations were ongoing.\n\nCommissioner Paul Nyathi\n\nHowever, in an earlier statement, police had said the shooting occurred early Tuesday morning between 2AM and 4AM after the suspects loaded their loot into their getaway silver Honda Fit vehicle, registration number, AEY 4843 and fled.\n\nComm Nyathi said after a report was made to the police, the getaway vehicle was spotted moving towards the tollgate.\n\nDetectives ordered the suspects to stop but instead the suspects fired shots towards the police officers, leading to a shoot-out, he said.\n\nThe suspects went on to hit the boom gate at the toll gate. They were arrested and taken to United Bulawayo Hospitals where they all unfortunately passed on.\n\nComm Nyathi said two pistols with four live rounds were recovered at the scene.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police reiterates that there is no going back in the fight against armed robbery syndicates in the country.

The Government has so far drilled over 120 boreholes across Gokwe North and South, including at the event sites. The celebrations will feature the lighting of the Independence Flame, the traditional Torch Relay, and a variety of cultural performances by dance troupes and artists from Kwekwe, Gokwe, and other districts.\n\nFootball enthusiasts can look forward to matches between Simba Bhora and FC Platinum during the main celebrations, while Herentals Queens and Black Rhinos will play at the Childrens Party.\n\nIn previous years, Harare hosted the national festivities, but under the Second Republic, President Mnangagwa has directed that the commemorations be rotated across the different provinces, aligning with his administrations vision of leaving no one and no place behind.\n\nRotating the celebrations ensures that all regions of the country benefit from the legacy projects associated with hosting the main event.\n\nZanu PF Midlands Provincial party chairperson Cde Edson Chiherenge said the momentous occasion is ushering in massive developmental projects for Gokwe Nembudziya and other areas.\n\nCde Edson Chiherenge\n\nThere is massive development in Gokwe North District, which has resulted in the employment of over 300 youths and women. Remember, the Government is constructing two state-of-the-art boys and girls hostels at Nyamuroro Secondary School, the venue for the childrens party, he said.\n\nGovernment is rehabilitating Nembudziya High School through erecting a new fence, a borehole, and other developments.\n\nCde Chiherenge said new structures were being put in place at Nembudziya District Hospital, including a new mortuary and a new building for the nursing school.\n\nAll these projects have brought about employment for the people of Gokwe, and we commend the Government for decentralising Independence Day celebrations as a lasting legacy for the local community, he said.\n\nMinister of Primary and Secondary Education, Torerayi Moyo, who toured Nyamuroro Primary School, which will host the childrens party over the weekend, said the decentralisation of independence celebrations has brought economic benefits to the local community, with youths and women being employed in various roles ahead of the event.\n\nAfter the disbursement of funds, we are seeing a lot of work being done at both venues. The school where the childrens party is being hosted is going to benefit a lot, as more hostels and ablution facilities are being built, he said.\n\nWe are happy for this development, and we have witnessed many people being employed.Minister Moyo said that through the decentralisation of national programmes, the Government is fostering economic and social development at the grassroots level.\n\nGovernments decentralisation policy of national programmes is not only bringing the national narrative to the doorstep of its diverse populace but has also become an empowerment tool benefiting youths and women. We commend the Second Republic for bringing this development to us, he said.\n\nMidlands Province construction officer, Mr Jemitious Vhovha, said preparations for the Childrens Party are on course, with officials pleased with the progress recorded to date.\n\nWe are on course with the works here as we have a target to be finished by April 10, ahead of the Childrens Party on April 17.

            "content": "Business Writer\n\nJAPANESE Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Yamanaka Shinichi, has said Expo 2025 Osaka to be held in his country from April 13 to October 13 this year presents a valuable opportunity for Zimbabwean and Japanese businesses to discover new opportunities for business and collaborations.\n\nAccording to ZimTrade, the countrys premier trade promotion and development body, the value and volume of trade between Zimbabwe and Japan, Asias second-biggest economy after China, remains low despite the long-standing cordial relations between the two countries.\n\nCollaborations between Zimbabwean companies and Japanese information technology (IT) firms, particularly small-scale enterprises, could be highly beneficial.\n\nZimbabwes young and talented human resources hold significant potential for collaborations in the IT sector, including the software industry, Amb Shinichi said.\n\nThe Japanese diplomat was speaking in an interview with Star FM earlier this week to give an update on preparations for the global exhibition, where Zimbabwe will be among several participatingcountries.\n\nJapan holds a strong position in global IT rankings, particularly in innovation and technology, with notable universities and institutions excelling in computer science and engineering.\n\nJapan ranks 13th among 133 economies, according to the Global Innovation Index (GII), which assesses innovation capabilities.\n\nIn terms of technological expertise, Japan consistently ranks among the top countries globally, often appearing in the top 5-10 and is recognised for its advancements in areas like robotics, electronics and automotive engineering.\n\nThat expo will be a good platform for both Zimbabwean and Japanese companies to realise new opportunities for businesses and to find suitable partners for collaboration.\n\nI find good potential in the software business here, by using the young, talented human resources.\n\nAlso, I think it may be useful to collaborate with Japanese IT companies or small-scale companies. They have a very unique and good technology and their decision-making is quite quick and flexible, said Amb Shinichi.\n\nZimbabwe intends to use the global exhibition to grow its investment and trade deals as well as tourist arrivals by 10 and 15 percent, respectively.\n\nThis comes after Zimbabwe successfully participated in Expo 2020 Dubai where it secured trade partnerships and investments from the Asian continent.\n\nFollowing its participation in Expo 2020 Dubai, Zimbabwe achieved several milestones, including the US$250 million joint venture agreement between the Agriculture and Rural Development Authority (Arda) and NV Group of India, to establish a brewery in Masvingo.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) struck a partnership with the Dubai National Air Travel Agency (Dnata) to market local tourism offerings.\n\nThrough its participation in Expo 2025 Osaka, Zimbabwe will showcase its economic potential, and the many investment opportunities in the country, to potential investors from around the world.\n\nThe country will also be able to project its culture and heritage to a global audience, which could help drive interest in the countrys tourism sector and increase visitors to the country.\n\nExpos provide an opportunity for Zimbabwean enterprises to meet and connect with potential investors, new business opportunities and collaborations.\n\nZimbabwe aims to showcase its diverse offerings through exhibitions, B2B meetings, commercial activities, cultural exchanges and demonstrations.\n\nIt will also conduct side events such as trade and investment seminars and business forums, among other activities, to amplify the countrys presence in Japan.\n\nZimbabwe aims to welcome at least three million visitors to its pavilion, showcasing the countrys vast trade and investment opportunities, natural beauty and rich cultural heritage.\n\nThe platform will also raise global awareness of Zimbabwe as a premier destination to live, work, study, visit and conduct business.\n\nAs one of the oldest and largest international events, the expo has been held every five years since 1851, providing a prestigious global platform for showcasing achievements, innovation, collaboration and co-operation.\n\nAmb Yamanaka Shinichi\n\nOver 28 million visitors from across the world are expected to attend the event while over 150 countries have confirmed their participation in this six-month-long exhibition.\n\nZimbabwes participation in the global event presents a unique and invaluable opportunity to strengthen its trade relations with Japan, Asia and the global community.\n\nBy leveraging this platform, Zimbabwe can effectively promote its trade and investment potential, foster new partnerships and enhance its visibility on the international stage.\n\nZimbabwe has over the years been engaging with Japan to establish a trade protocol and pave the way for the export of high-demand products such as avocados and citrus fruits.\n\nThis development is particularly timely, as the growing global population has become increasingly aware of healthier lifestyles, creating a surge in demand for nutritious products.\n\nAs a result, Zimbabwe is well-positioned to capitalise on this trend by expanding its exports of healthy goods, including blueberries, to cater to the rising demand for healthier living options.\n\nZimbabwe also holds significant potential for exporting various oils, with several companies already exploring opportunities in this sector. Avocado oil and citrus oil are just a few examples of the value-added products being developed.\n\nAdditionally, there is a growing interest in heritage-based products, such as amarula and baobab oils, which not only showcase the countrys rich cultural heritage but also offer a unique selling proposition in the global market.\n\nThe Expo, which will run under the theme Designing Future Society for Our Lives supported by three sub-themes Connecting lives, Saving lives and Empowering lives is expected to enhance Zimbabwes visibility, networking opportunities, learning opportunities and competitive analysis.\n\nThe participation of local players at the occasion intends to benchmark Zimbabwes product offering whilst tapping from international best practices.\n\nIt will create a platform for the government to engage with international investors and promote policies that encourage Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).\n\nWe have a commercial space where we will display some of our artefacts and also leather and other related products that we feel will be beneficial in terms of them being exhibited at that Expo.\n\nWe are getting content from the countrys 10 provinces. I think so far, we have got content from Matabeleland South, Matabeleland North, Bulawayo and Midlands and we should be moving to Manicaland, Masvingo and Mashonaland West, where we really want to showcase what Zimbabwe has to offer both on the trade, tourism and the investment side of things.\n\nPeople are now looking to live healthier, so we should also be showcasing products like blueberries, avocado and citrus and oils, which are more for people to live healthier, said ZimTrade chief operations officer, Mr Similo Nkala, in the interview with Star FM.\n\nThe six-month event offers a platform to attract international investors and businesses who are interested in exploring new markets and expanding their operations.\n\n",

            "content": "Mbulelo Mpofu,[emailprotected]\n\nLast week, visual art lovers converged at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe (NGZ) in Bulawayo for the Vital Voices: Accelerate Action all-female exhibition.\n\nTo celebrate feminine excellence in the visual art space, the NGZ in Bulawayo hosted this event, showcasing numerous art pieces echoing voices for change.\n\nIn her curatorial statement, Doris Kamupira, assistant curator of the NGZ in Bulawayo, articulated the essence of the exhibition.\n\nThe Vital Voices: Accelerate Action is a substantial exhibition commemorating International Womens Day, featuring 26 visionary female artists from diverse career stages and artistic disciplines. This dynamic exhibition comprises paintings, drawings, design motifs, mixed media, and three-dimensional art, culminating in a powerful exploration of womens empowerment.\n\nThrough their works, these artists serve as catalysts for social change, amplifying the voices of the marginalised and challenging the systemic barriers that perpetuate gender inequality, read part of the statement.\n\nAccording to Kamupira, the exhibition is a call to action, urging swift and decisive steps toward achieving gender parity.\n\nThe artists works serve as a powerful call to action. Alison Bakers pieces inspire women to find the courage and strength to break free from societal constraints, Kamupira said.\n\nShe highlighted that Kafiya Eyvazovas work, particularly her thought-provoking piece, I Want Seven Sons and One Daughter, challenges societal values and sheds light on the struggles faced by women in patriarchal societies, where the inability to bear a male child can lead to devastating consequences.\n\nSimilarly, Sidanisile Dubes Dlala Mama celebrates the importance of self-care and living in the present, highlighting the need for women to prioritise their well-being and happiness.\n\nVisual artist, Nomathemba Dube posing for a photo with her artwork\n\nChronicle Showbiz observed as art lovers admired the various artworks on display on Friday.\n\nIn separate interviews, visual artists shared their thoughts on the exhibition and Womens History Month. Mavies Ndhlovu, a ceramicist from Gwanda, said her work was inspired by the artistry of Matobo women, who elevated hut painting into a broader form of artistic expression. One of her pieces, Sesilapha, depicts how Matobo women started by painting their huts in rural areas, but now their work is seen in urban spaces and even on fabrics. They inspire me a lot.\n\nNomathemba Dube, who drew a piece titled Free to Be, said the exhibition provided her with a platform to step out of her shell and embrace her true self.\n\nLuzibo Luchi Shiki Moyo, daughter of Bulawayo-based imbube ensemble Black Umfolosis founding member Sotja Moyo, said her journey into visual arts was inspired by a woman who painted portraits at Meikles store back in the day.\n\nLuzibo Moyos artwork\n\nGrowing up, I was surrounded by musicians, which is why Im also a musician and dancer. However, my journey into visual art was sparked by a woman  I dont know her name  who painted portraits at Meikles. I would watch and admire her work. Then, when I attended Founders High School, I chose art as one of my practical subjects, and I have never looked back.\n\nTo me, Womens History Month should celebrate humanity as a whole, not just women. Of course, women play a huge role in peoples lives from birth and beyond, so they should be celebrated daily, she said.\n\nOther participating artists included Lauryn Arnott, Abigail N Hunda, Arzu Jabrailova, Langelihle B Moyo, Gloria JC Schonegeuel, Thokozile Dube, Andiswa Matobo, Nomvuyiso M Mpofu, Alison Baker, Portia Ndlovu, Valiyeva Yasemen, Clementine VT Nyati, Kafiya Eyvazova, Zandile V Masuku, Fidan Nazim Qizi, Lethiwe Ndebele, Kimberley Bumhira, Florence Nyathi, Nubar Rafiyeva, Tendai Mandira, Portia Ndlovu, Nomathemba Ndlovu, Lakhina Zulu, and Sidanisile Dube.

            "content": "THE tragic events of March 18, 2025 along the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Highway should serve as a stark warning to all criminals that the police are out in full force, and any attempts to engage in criminal activity will be met with swift and decisive action.\n\nIn the early hours of that morning, a gang of six armed robbers carried out a violent heist at Young Money General Dealer Shop in Insuza.\n\nArmed with pistols, knives, and axes, the suspects stormed the shop, overpowered the victims, and tied them up with electric cables.\n\nThey ransacked the premises; stealing money, groceries, electronics, and other valuable items before fleeing in a silver Honda Fit. But their crime spree didnt last long.\n\nThanks to a quick-thinking victim who managed to alert their employer, the police were immediately informed of the robbery.\n\nActing with precision, law enforcement positioned themselves along the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Road, ready for action.\n\nWhen the suspects vehicle was spotted approaching the tollgate, police attempted to stop the car. Instead of surrendering, the criminals opened fire, sparking a fierce gunfight.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to escape, the suspects rammed their vehicle into the tollgates boom barrier. But the outcome was inevitable.\n\nThe officers quickly subdued the gang, and the suspects were transported to the United Bulawayo Hospitals, where they were later pronounced dead.\n\nThis dramatic conclusion to the robbery is a testament to the ZRPs unwavering commitment to fighting crime.\n\nThe police successfully recovered a cache of weapons from the suspects, including pistols, knives, and an axe.\n\nSome of the stolen goods were also found in the vehicle. But perhaps the most important take away from this incident is the message it sends to criminals across the country: if you choose a life of crime, you will face the full force of the law.\n\nThe police are sending a clear and firm message: there is no room for leniency when it comes to armed robbery and violent crime.\n\nThe ZRPs statement couldnt be clearer: Any form of confrontation by criminals will be met with appropriate measures.\n\nThe law enforcement officers are ready, and they will stop at nothing to ensure the safety of law-abiding citizens.\n\nThose who think they can outsmart or overpower the police will quickly learn that their actions have consequences  consequences that could very well lead to their own downfall.\n\nTo all criminals operating in Zimbabwe, take heed: the police are more determined than ever to rid the country of dangerous crime syndicates. The law is watching, and it will not hesitate to act.\n\n",
