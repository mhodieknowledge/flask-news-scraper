The other two are Pamela Natare (1 year 9 months) of Tsive Village and Effort Shava (3) of Mudzimiri Village.\n\nThe bodies Devine, of Pamela and Effort were later found at the river bank between 1 kilometre and about 20 kilometers from Tare bridge, he said.Insp Mahoko said a search is still going on to locate the outstanding body of Beauty.The retrieved bodies were taken to Gokwe South District Hospital Mortuary and investigations are still underway,  he said.\n\n",

Appearing before Harare magistrate Clever Tsikwa, Mandaza denied allegations of spiking the teenagers drink and assaulting her.\n\nMandaza asserted that he neither engaged in sexual activity with the minor nor administered any substances to her. He stated that on the alleged date, he was performing his duties as a DJ at entertainment venue, Mashwede Village in Harare, where the girl and her friends were present.\n\nThe prosecution alleges that on October 16, 2024, the victim failed to return home from school. Her father, upon investigation, discovered she had been absent from classes for two consecutive days. It is claimed that during this period, the girl was in the company of Mandaza and others at the entertainment venue, where she was given an unknown substance and later assaulted. The girl reportedly regained consciousness at Mandazas residence and was found in Highfield after a missing person report was filed.\n\nDuring a previous bail hearing, it was revealed that the victim provided conflicting statements. Initially, she did not mention any assault; however, in a subsequent statement, she alleged that her drink was spiked and she was assaulted. This inconsistency led the State to consent to Mandazas bail application, which was granted by Justice Regis Dembure.\n\nThe trial is set to continue, with the victims father scheduled to testify.\n\n",

The Red Devils have averaged a match every four days since his first game, affording him limited time on the training ground to implement a system which is unfamiliar to most of his squad.\n\nOnly five teams have won fewer points in the Premier League since the Portugueses arrival, leaving United 15th in the table and on course for comfortably their worst season since their infamous relegation in 1974. Amorim wont change his approach, though, as hes welded to his 3-4-2-1 formation, a stance which is being questioned inside the dressing room.\n\nThe Mail report that a section of Uniteds squad believe that even when they win, its largely down to individual moments of quality or good fortune rather than Amorims tactics working out.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, a source revealed: The feeling is, We got away with one but we might not be so lucky next time.\n\nThe feeling from that particular group of unnamed players stems from the number of late goals that United have scored in recent weeks, turning draws into wins. The Red Devils have scored late against Leicester, Fulham, Rangers, Southampton, Manchester City and Viktoria Plzen, with their performances in most of those games being criticised.\n\nSimilar reports of behind-the-scenes discontent have emerged under previous managers, namely David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag. Amorims fuse appears to be shorter than his predecessors, who all bemoaned the rigours of the job later in their tenures.\n\nBut after Sundays dire 1-0 defeat at Tottenham, who theyve lost to three times this season, Amorim told Sky Sports: What you see guys and what you discuss every week, I also see. I have a lot of problems, my job is so, so hard here. But I stick with my beliefs.\n\nUnited are back in action on Saturday, as they make the trip to Goodison Park for the final time to face Everton.

Ive made mistakes, learnt a lesson, and won along the path. Id like to say, its been an eye-opening experience.\n\nHe shared his evolution into a communication expert.Ive gained so much knowledge in the area over the years. Ive been manufacturing laughter and working with different companies in communicating messages to their target market. I mastered the art of persuasion and Ive since graduated into a communication expert.\n\nAddressing the future of skits, Bhutisi said, The format has stayed in fashion for too long. It has become something anyone can just do as if its an application that comes with any smartphone, (who will pay for something that they can do on their own), so is the podcast madness which has become oversubscribed.With the turning of tables in the content creation space, this is an alarm call to my fellow and junior skits producers to start creating new formats.\n\nHe suggested that reality television could be the next significant trend, advising, My lucky tip as you create, please go in the direction of reality television.\n\nBhutisi concluded with a call to action for fellow creators: The only way and hope that skits will remain is to make a hybrid format by adding unique elements to them. Lets create knowing we are in the last phase.\n\nThe Zimbabwean actor, comedian, and filmmaker gained recognition through his involvement in the comedy show P.O Box Reloaded and his work with the organisation P.O. Box. Kuzhangaira co-founded P.O. Box with Rolland Lunga (Boss Kedha) and Lucky Aaroni, and later co-founded P.O Box Reloaded with Lunga. He has also been involved in various film and television projects, earning accolades such as the Nama 2019 Film and Television Award for Outstanding Actor.\n\n",

Musician Madlela Skhobokhobo took the initiative to support Buhlungu by facilitating his recording sessions at Cite Zw studios in Bulawayo, enabling him to produce his first album. That same year, Buhlungu received the Best Newcomer award at the Bulawayo Arts Awards.\n\nFrom there, the self-taught guitarists career soared, leading to the release of his debut album. His inspiring journey attracted the attention of various companies and local communities, who rallied to support him in multiple ways, including assisting in building a modern home for the rising star.\n\nThis inspiring success story, led DJ Mapressa, recognised as the first DJ from Tsholotsho to gain significant recognition in the music industry, to single out Skhosana through a Facebook post on Tuesday.Wrote DJ Mapressa: Also known as umculi olenhlanhla yamaSwazi esiNdebeleni ngubaba u Skhosy. In less than a year, he has achieved remarkable milestones. He has built a house, received cattle as a gift, won a national award, and secured a brand ambassadorship.\n\nThemba Boyoyo Mathe\n\nHowever, DJ Mapressa also drew attention to the contrasting journey of Boyoyo, celebrated for his significant contributions to the Kalanga music genre. Born in Kezi, a region known for producing musical talents, Mathe has been instrumental in popularising Kalanga music both locally and internationally.\n\nIn 2013, Boyoyo departed from Mokis Connection to form his own ensemble, Boyoyo and Mthimbani Sound Blasters. Despite facing personal challenges, including blindness in 2014, he continued to produce music, releasing albums such as Nansi Ndoda, Sengi Discover Itsotsi and MaTouch Screen.\n\nHowever, according to DJ Mapressa, the former Mokis Connection band member, has faced challenges within the region, including a lack of support and recognition.The most unfortunate artiste among the Ndebele clan is Themba Boyoyo. But remember, he is notably the only Rhumba artiste known to have embarked on a seven-hour-long flight, to play his music in various countries. He is recognised as the godfather of the Ayibophe Rhumba version. He has choreographed nearly 80% of existing Rumba dance styles.Over 20 Rhumba groups have adopted his style (or his unique footwork). He is the first artiste to release more than eight hit albums consecutively. He is the first artiste to tour the entire country with a band that replicates the exact sound of his cassette recordings.His event holds the record for the highest CD sales in Rhumba history. Despite these significant achievements, he has not been fortunate within the Ndebele community, receiving no love from the people he has supported for years, wrote DJ Mapressa.\n\nDJ Mapressa indicated that it is important for locals to acknowledge the artistes contributions and offer him the love and appreciation he deserves.I understand that its easy to give him Boyoyo material things, but we should also show him love in this post or any positive comments we can make about him.\n\nFollowing DJ Mapressas post, there have been suggestions to provide an account number for donations to support Themba Boyoyo Mathe. Additionally, some have proposed organising a fundraising event to showcase his talent and provide financial assistance.\n\n",
