At just 21 years old, this talented and creative poet is leaving audiences captivated with his compelling verses and profound storytelling.\n\nBorn in September 2003 at Alexandra Clinic in South Africa, Moyo, the eldest of three siblings, relocated to Zimbabwe, where he was raised by his grandparents in Sizinda suburb in Bulawayo.\n\nHis creativity was nurtured early by his grandfather, a railway worker who introduced him to painting. Tragically, his grandfather passed away when he was still young. Reflecting on his childhood, Moyo shared, I grew up in Sizinda under the care of my grandparents, and my grandfather, a cultured man, taught me painting. His passing was a huge loss.\n\nBradley attended Intunta Primary School in Sizinda, where he was part of the school choir and discovered his love for music. He later moved to Ihlathi High School, where he joined the debate club and continued singing tenor whenever there were opportunities to form a choir. Raised in a Christian home, he actively participated in the Scripture Union Club and eventually became its president. Additionally, he captained the first aid team while excelling academically.\n\nGrowing up, I transitioned from being a naughty kid to a reserved and outspoken one, he said.\n\nThis newfound confidence allowed him to participate in workshops like those hosted by the Higher Life Foundation. These experiences broadened his perspective on the arts, especially as he struggled with science subjects like Chemistry and Physics.\n\nI used to love Biology, but numbers were not my strength, so I shifted to Arts, he explained.\n\nMoyo sought to explore other creative outlets beyond music, experimenting with unique art forms such as writing extracts, short stories, and poetry.\n\nMusic has always been a part of me, but because it was what everyone was doing, I wanted something different, he said.\n\nAfter completing his O-levels, Moyo pursued A-levels at Milton High School, where he discovered a passion for literature, particularly poetry. A turning point in his life came when he lost his best friend, a tragedy that inspired him to channel his grief into poetry. This led to the creation of his first book, Thalitha Koumi: The Prayers We Never Say.\n\nSince then, Moyo has remained steadfast in his poetry journey, achieving numerous milestones in 2024. He was nominated twice in the Third Edition of the Poetry Red Carpet Awards for Best Page Poet and Best Promising Poet. Additionally, he secured second runner-up in the Dreams Discovery Publishers Awards under the Best English Poetry category. These accolades motivated him to publish Thalitha Koumi, which is now available on the market.\n\nThe artist envisions a future where his work amplifies the voices of Africans, particularly the black majority, Ndebele people, and youth.\n\nI address a lot of issues. What I can say is I am a conscious writer passionate about telling the stories of Africans, blacks, Ndebele people, and young people, he explained.\n\nHe is now focused on creating more poetry and short stories that highlight these narratives.\n\n",

The employee had collected R158 160 and US$9 339 from the betting house. While parked on Robert Mugabe Way in Parkview to package the money, a dark grey Mazda Axela with Botswana number plates blocked his exit.\n\nOne of the suspects, armed with a pistol and a brick, smashed the drivers door and demanded the cash. The robbers seized the satchel containing the money and fled in their Mazda Axela. A police report was filed shortly after.\n\nOn January 20, police received a tip-off linking Nomzamo Nkiwane to the robbery. Acting on the information, they arrested her in Nkulumane 5 suburb.\n\nDuring interrogation, Nomzamo revealed that her neighbour, Alfred Taurai, had informed her about the complainants routine cash collection from the betting house. Alfred, who previously worked as a security guard at the betting house, provided details about the complainants vehicle and schedule.\n\nNomzamo then shared the information with her cousin, Kelvin Tshuma, who, along with Vusumuzi Ndlovu, executed the robbery. Searches at the suspects residences led to the recovery of R2 000 in R200 notes from Nomzamos home.\n\nShe admitted to receiving R10 000 as her share, part of which she sent to South Africa, R1 600 in R200 notes and US$40 from Alfred Taurai, who also received R10 000, R200 and US$50 from Kelvin Tshuma, who led police to Esigodini, where Vusumuzi Ndlovu was arrested.\n\nAt Vusumuzis residence, police recovered R19 120, US$68, and a silver-grey Toyota Aqua used in the robbery.

This issue demands immediate attention across all sectors, he said.\n\nAfdis indicated its commitment to implementing measures to defend its market share, enhance sales volumes, and sustain profitable growth.\n\nIn terms of performance during the reviewed period, Afdis achieved a 14 percent volume growth compared to the previous year for the quarter and a 12 percent growth year-to-date.\n\nThe Ready-to-Drink (RTD) and Wine segments, which recorded 12 percent and 47 percent growth respectively, benefited from improved product supply and a decline in informal imports.\n\nZimbabwe shares borders with several countries, including South Africa and Mozambique. Some of these borders are porous, making it easier for goods to be smuggled into the country.\n\nLast week, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Pro Mthuli Ncube acknowledged the difficulties and said the ongoing crackdown on smuggling was partly aimed at addressing the challenges.\n\nHe said as part of efforts to bolster the viability of the formal retail sector, the Government had initiated a door-to-door crackdown to confiscate contraband goods entering the country and being sold within the informal retail industry.\n\nThe issue of retailers who are struggling . . . thats the reason why we have launched the blitz on smuggling  one of the things the retailers have told us about is that smuggling is hurting their businesses, said Minister Ncube.\n\nManufacturers are also feeling that this is hurting their businesses. So, we have had this blitz on smuggling to make sure that we slow down this illicit behaviour.\n\nWe are very happy to look into key areas or issues that are impacting the sector negatively and I will engage them to make sure we can unlock those challenges.\n\nThe operation is also targeting wholesalers, supermarkets and tech shops, with smuggled goods including a variety of food stuffs, clothing, drugs, beverages, fertilisers, cement,\n\n",

Civil society members and NGOs working in Goma put the death toll at 25, with 375 people wounded.\n\nGreg Ramm, country director for Save the Children in DRC, said on Tuesday that while we have reports that neighbourhoods are calm, a few minutes later, we hear reports of new shelling.\n\nHeavy small arms fire and mortar fire continued in the streets, where many dead bodies could be seen, Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office, also said at a press briefing, citing reports from UN staff in the city.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Food Programme said food assistance activities in and around Goma have been temporarily paused and expressed concern over food shortages.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, South Africa confirmed three of its soldiers haddiedin the fighting on Monday after getting caught in the crossfire. It added that another soldier killed in the recent fighting had also died on Monday, bringing the number of deaths in the past week to 13.\n\nThe fighting has sent thousands of people streaming out of Goma, which has been a key regional hub for humanitarian aid for displaced people. Hundreds of thousands have fled fighting since the start of the year on top of three million displaced in the eastern DRC last year.\n\nThe city is in real difficulty and if it hasnt fallen overnight, it will in the coming days, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told Sud Radio. Rwanda must put down its weapons, calm must return and dialogue needs to restart.\n\nOne Goma resident told the Reuters news agency that he had seen men in Rwandan army uniforms on Monday.\n\nIn the evening, I went out to see what the situation was. I saw soldiers dressed in brand new Rwandan uniforms, the resident of central Goma said.\n\nFire exchanges also took place between Congolese and Rwandan troops on either side of a border crossing near Goma. Five civilians were killed and 25 seriously wounded on the outskirts of Rwandan border town Gisenyi, Rwandas military told AFP on Monday.\n\nM23, or the March 23 Movement, is one of hundreds of armed groups operating in the eastern DRC and seeking to control critical mineral mines.\n\nThe group iscomposedof Tutsi fightersand claims it is fighting for the rights of the DRCs minority Tutsi population. It emerged in 2012 after a group from the armed forces of the DRC (FARDC) broke away, complaining of ill-treatment.\n\nIn 2012, M23 first seized Goma, but the Congolese army, supported by the UN forces, pushed the rebels back into the eastern hills on the border with Rwanda in 2013.\n\nThe DRC government and the UN accuse Rwanda, under President Paul Kagame, of supporting M23 with soldiers and weapons in a bid to control the mineral-rich eastern DRC.\n\nTheres no question that there are Rwandan troops in Goma supporting the M23, UN peacekeeping forces chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told reporters at a livestreamed event. Its difficult to tell exactly what the numbers are.\n\nRwanda has denied the charge and accused the DRC of harbouring members of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, an anti-Kagame rebel group that was involved in the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\n\nAs the fighting escalates, the African Unions Peace and Security Council will hold a meeting later on Tuesday to discuss the crisis.\n\nThe UN Security Council will also meet on Tuesday to discuss the crisis.\n\n",
