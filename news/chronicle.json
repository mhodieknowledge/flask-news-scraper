In the ongoing war effort against drug and substance abuse, there are no sacred cows.

There was a trail of blood everywhere. This is outrageous.\n\nAnother villager said:\n\nThe body of his wife was found in a pit latrine and it was covered by some leaves, he said.\n\nAnother villager said:\n\nThis is callous and an abomination on our land. I have never witnessed such gruesome murders,  said the villager.\n\nAnother villager said:\n\nThe juveniles body was covered with three branches and there were blood stains on the ground.\n\nShe said the headman, Kuwesu Masawu, (56), was caught in the web after trying to solve the fallout between h Trymore and his wife.\n\nIts very unfortunate that we lost our headman who went there to mediate.\n\nTore and his wife had an altercation about a day or so before the incident but we never thought the altercation was going to end in this way.\n\nA dog was found dragging a skull and it was found out that it was Masawus head.\n\nMeanwhile, police in Masvingo arrested Joseph Dimiti (38) in connection with a case of murder that occurred at Machakata Village, Soti-Source, Gutu, on Monday.\n\nThe suspect allegedly attacked his friend, Richard Takawira (35), with a hoe all over the body after accusing him of proposing love to his wife.\n\nThe victim died upon admission at a hospital in Gutu, said Commissioner Nyathi.\n\nPolice have also arrested Prisca Takaza (29) in connection with a murder case in which she allegedly stabbed her husband, Liberty Karikoga (40), with a knife on the collarbone after a domestic dispute in Borrowdale.\n\nMembers of the public are urged to respect the sanctity of life and resolve disputes amicably without resorting to violence, said Commissioner Nyathi.\n\nWhere possible, parties should seek counselling from traditional leaders, the church and elders from the community.\n\n",
