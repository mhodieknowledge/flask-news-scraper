City sunk to a ninth defeat in their last 12 outings, despite Phil Fodens late consolation, intensifying the spotlight thats upon Guardiola.\n\nWe were incredibly successful, said Guardiola in a 2014 interview with Audi. Winning 14 trophies in only four years was the greatest period in the clubs history.\n\nBut gradually I found it more and more difficult to motivate myself and to motivate the team. That is when you know it is time to walk away.\n\nLike that Barcelona side of 2012, City have sunk from those dizzying highs amid concerns over an ageing squad. The club now sits seventh in thePremier League, 22nd in the reformattedChampions Leaguetable and has already been knocked out of the Carabao Cup.\n\nGuardiola, 53, won his first Premier League title in his second campaign at City, and the club has won five more top-flight crowns to its cabinet in the six seasons since then. But their recent fall from grace proves they are not immune to the cyclical nature of sport.\n\nPlayers likeKyle Walker(34), Ederson (31), Ilkay Gundogan (34) and injury-prone Kevin De Bruyne (33) have attracted scrutiny as being past their best at City. And with a raft of senior contracts ending in 2026 and 2027 (including Guardiolas), it appears City may be reaching the end of an era.\n\nTheres also the small matter of City learning the fate of their hearing into 115 charges of alleged spending breaches. Major accusations alleging improper spending and financial doping have hung over the club for some time now, with the outcome of that verdict set to arrive some time in early 2025.\n\n",

It is a big project because I managed to capture the heart of a prominent artist, Qounfuzed, who accepted a collaboration for free. Its no more fake love type of song.\n\nGunvosta is a reality. It is a song based on a personal experience; it is about a cheating partner. Its something that really happenedits a reality that I had to deal with through a song, he said.\n\nThe artiste, who has sung over 70 songs in his career, aspires to be recognised as an international brand, representing Zimbabwe as an Afro Dancehall guru.\n\nFor him, collaborating with Qounfuzed is a dream come true.\n\nThe Beitbridge-based artist said his songs can be found on YouTube and other social media platforms.\n\nI also wish to uplift the youth emerging from my hometown, Beitbridge. The area is full of talented youths who arent getting enough chances. This makes the Qounfuzed collaboration a big achievement in my career, considering my geographical location. We are too far from the real industry, so sharing a stage or collaborating with a big brand is just a dream come true.\n\nMy songs are available on my YouTube account, Mark Geezo, my TikTok account, Mark Geezo Wenyu, my Facebook account, Mark Geezo, and my Instagram account, Mark Geezo Kid99.'\n\nMark Geezo is a 25-year-old Afro Dancehall artist from Beitbridge who began his music journey at a tender age, following mentorship from his brother, Marcus Mandangu, aka Razorman, who was an urban groover in the early 2010s.\n\nLast year, the artist scooped two TESMA awards. This year, he released a four-track EP with songs such as Nemoyo, Mbabvu, Hallelujah, and Mwana Wasatan before Gunvosta was released on 6th November this year.\n\nI am also a producer and ghostwriter for several artists. Last year I won two TESMA awards: Best Afropop Song (Nhasi) and Best Reggae/Dancehall Song, he said.\n\n@TeamKarubwa\n\n",

It will feature performances and sermons.\n\nMai Mwamuka told Chronicle Showbiz that the event is a thanksgiving for both this and the forthcoming year.\n\nA year is not just one day, two days, or a week, but is made up of 365 days, many weeks, hours, and minutes. God has seen us through challenges, and we are still alive and thankful. Some have gone to be with the Lord, and though heaven is a beautiful place, no one desires to leave this life just yet. Thats why, when someone passes away, we view it as a misfortune. However, when we read the word of God, we understand that those whose lives are with God are in a beautiful place.\n\nWe are still here, alive, and we must understand Gods assignment for us. On this day, we will be thanking God. We decided to host this online worship session to celebrate the Worship Well family, which has grown to include other families in places like Harare. Because the event is regularly held online, it has expanded globally, said Mai Mwamuka.\n\nShe added that worshippers and believers should come together to celebrate their successes and the gift of life.\n\nWe want to celebrate how the Lord has seen us through the year, protecting us, providing for us, and above all, giving us victory. We will also thank Him for the year 2025, as thanksgiving is often the precursor to a miracle.\n\nWe see this in the example of Jesus Christ at the tomb of Lazarus, where He said, Father, I thank You because You always hear me. Similarly, before feeding the 5,000 and 4,000, Jesus first gave thanks. So, for 2025, we thank God for the year ahead, knowing that it will release miracles for us, said Mai Mwamuka.\n\nFollow Mthabisi Tshuma on X (@mthabisi_mthire)\n\n",

There, he met a sea of enthusiastic partygoers.\n\nHis performances in both locations, as well as in Kwekwe (Sunday), were electric, each lasting between 20 to 30 minutes.

Cover limits to be reviewed in the first quarter of the year.\n\nAbout 96 percent of all valid existing bank accounts in Zimbabwe are covered meaning that if any of these banks fail today, we are able to compensate up to this level, he said.Banking Zinyau said members of the public dealing with unregistered micro-finance institutions are not beneficiaries of the scheme.It is very important to promote formalbanking channels so that people are covered in the unfortunate event of a bank failing, their deposits will be insured, and safe, he said.Mr Zinyau said the DPC is on a drive promoting financial literacy and inclusion even in the remotest of areas.He said the public are at risk of beingprejudiced through financial pyramids like mukando.We do not encourage these financial pyramids because if someone disappears with your money you will be prejudiced because they do not have operating licences.\n\nWhen they come to us, we tell them that it is unfortunate this is a not registered financial institution,  he said.Mr Zinyau said the DPC does offsite supervision to ascertain viability of member banks.DPC public relations manager Mr Allen Musadziruma addressing the same meeting assured depositors that their deposits are safe with member banks, who are registered financil institutions.\n\nWe know that some people keep money under pillows, while others move around with it risking robberies.Money should be kept in the bank. Service fees are not that much because the risks that the banks are taking as custodians of those funds is very high.We are promoting financial inclusion,and everyone should utilise the formal banking channel, he said.Mr Musadzimura said the DPC was also compensating depositors who lost savings during the migration from United States dollars to local currency a few years back.\n\nIdeally all people with bank accounts inthe banking sector are supposed to be compensated for loss of fund. Its a gradual process and now at POSB and will move to other banks once funds become available, he said.\n\n",
