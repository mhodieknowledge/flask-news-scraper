A lot of people alive in America wont remember much about him, or will remember more about his post-presidency.\n\nThis includes the building of homes around the world, working to eliminate disease around the world, and the building of democracy. He got the Nobel Peace Prize for all that work in 2002.\n\nOne of the words that Joe Biden has been using when talking about Jimmy Carter is decency, which I think is one of the things well hear today in the eulogy.\n\nThere has been a lot of focus on what a decent man Jimmy Carter was, even if his presidency was beset with a lot of problems, particularly economic problems, the energy shock and other issues he was having at the time with inflation.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carters casket is being carried out of the US Capitol, and well continue to bring you updates as the ceremony begins in the National Cathedral.\n\nRemember, you can also watch along with us by pressingwatch liveat the top of the page.\n\nAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent, reporting from Washington National Cathedral\n\nThe 10-page programme for todays memorial service is embossed in gold with the seal of the President of the United States.\n\nJoe Biden is listed as giving the tribute, but several of Carters grandchildren are also scheduled to speak, as are the sons of former Vice-President Walter Mondale and former President Gerald Ford.\n\nAndrew Young, who served as Carters ambassador to the UN, will deliver the homily.\n\nAs a reminder, you can watch the funeral service by pressing theWatch livebutton at the top of this page.\n\nAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent, reporting from Washington National Cathedral\n\nHello from the Washington National Cathedral, which is still blanketed in snow from the winter storm earlier this week.\n\nSecurity is tight around the grounds of the building, which should be no surprise give the long list of VIPs who will be attending the memorial service for former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe president, the president-elect and three former presidents will be in attendance along with countless Washington politicians, policymakers and dignitaries.\n\nState funerals of this magnitude are rare in Washington  reserved for only the most solemn occasions of national mourning.\n\nIll be perched with other reporters high inside the cathedral, where Ill have an elevated, if distant, view of the proceedings. Ill report what I see as the services get under way.\n\nJimmy Carter was born in 1924 and grew up on the family peanut farm.\n\nHe entered politics and in 1970 was elected governor of Georgia, where he was a strong advocate for racial and gender equality.\n\nCarter became US president in 1977, serving one term before losing to Ronald Reagan.\n\nHe founded the Carter Center, which works to promote human rights and resolve international conflicts, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.\n\nCarter is survived by his four children, 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. His wife, Rosalynn, who he married 77 years ago, died in November 2023.\n\nOnly six years after starting out in politics, Jimmy Carter, a former peanut farmer, took the highest office in the US when he was elected as the 39th president in November 1976.\n\nHe was sworn in on 20 January, 1977 in Washington DC  you can see that moment in the clip below:\n\nA state funeral in the US a highly ceremonial event that is typically reserved for a former president. These funerals are sometimes also held for high-ranking officials or military leaders, as designated by the sitting president.\n\nThey include a Lying in State period, where the body is flown into Washington DC, often aboard a military aircraft. It is kept at the Capitol Rotunda for a few days, where mourners from the public are allowed to come in and pay their respects.\n\nThis is followed by a state funeral service at the National Cathedral, where many dignitaries are often among the attendees.\n\nAfter that, the body is then transported to the chosen place of burial. In President Carters case, that chosen place is his hometown of Plains, Georgia, where he will be buried next to his wife, Rosalynn, at his familys peanut farm.\n\nAll five living US presidents are expected to attend the state funeral service for Jimmy Carter later today, with Joe Biden set to lead the tributes.\n\nBiden will be delivering the eulogy when the ceremony begins at the Washington National Cathedral, after he said Carter had asked him to give the eulogy while planning the proceedings in March 2023.\n\nBill Clinton, George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump  who takes office again in the White House this month  are also expected to be in attendance.\n\nThe state funeral service for Jimmy Carter is due to begin at 10:00 local time (15:00 GMT). Heres a look at how todays events will unfold:\n\nAfter Carters passing was announced in late December, tributes poured in for the former US president and Nobel Peace Prize, who died aged 100.\n\nPresident Joe Biden  who is also set to give a eulogy today  remembered his fellow Democrat as a man of principle, faith and humility.\n\nHe showed that we are great nation because we are a good people  decent and honourable, courageous and compassionate, humble and strong.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, who previously called Carter a nice man and a terrible president on the campaign trail, struck a different tone in his tribute.\n\nThe challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans, Trump said in a post on his platform Truth Social.\n\nFor that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.\n\nOthers who remembered Carter include King Charles III, who said his dedication and humility served as an inspiration to many.\n\nI remember with great fondness his visit to the United Kingdom in 1977, the King said.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called him a steadfast advocate for the rights of the most vulnerable, while UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Carter redefined the post-presidency with a remarkable commitment to social justice and human rights.\n\nRead more here.\n\nAdam GoldsmithLive reporter\n\nWere restarting our live coverage, as the state funeral for former US president Jimmy Carter is due to begin in Washington in the next few hours, before he is laid to rest in Georgia.\n\nSince Tuesday, Carter has been lying in state at the US Capitol Rotunda, where thousands of mourners have visited to pay their respects following his death last month aged 100.\n\nUS President Joe Biden will deliver the eulogy at Carters funeral, which is due to begin at 15:00 GMT.

            "content": "Luisa Kremlevas lawyer called in sick at the last minute last October ahead of her scheduled trial, alleging a medical emergency and forcing a suspension as public prosecutors tried to get her jailed for two years on conviction. The Russian-born beauty opted to stay away from the court in the Costa del Sol capital of Malaga at the time so she didnt have to face waiting media.\n\nOn Thursday, court officials confirmed Kremleva had been handed a six-month suspended jail sentence and fined 1,500 after striking a hush-hush plea bargain deal with public prosecutors and admitting perjuring herself by claimingFranceinternational Hernandez, 27, raped her in the back of aPorscheoutside a Marbella nightclub.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been warned she will be made to do time if she reoffends in the next two years after being formally convicted of a crime of making a false criminal complaint. The plea bargain deal is understood to have been rubber-stamped last November following talks between her defence lawyer and state prosecutors, but it was only made public today in a five-page written sentence.\n\nKremlevas conviction brings to an end a near-seven-year saga which began on June 4, 2017. The real estate boss daughter, who forged a name for herself on Spanish TV reality and dating shows between modelling assignments, prompted a police probe by accusing Hernandez of an early-hours rape in a friends Porsche Cayenne parked outside glitzy Marbella nightclub Olivia Valere where they had both been partying.\n\nInvestigators took just two days to halt their probe after viewing CCTV car park cameras showing she had fallen to the ground accidentally instead of being pushed out of the car after forced sex as she had claimed. Police are also believed to have obtained a phone message Kremleva sent the Marseille-born footballer around 6.15am two hours after the supposed rape, asking him repeatedly when he was going to go home with her.\n\nAttacking left-back Hernandez, capped 35 times by France at senior level, was never arrested before a court dismissed her rape claim and police started preparing a case against her. She was charged with making a false criminal complaint following her arrest in January 2020 on a warrant after she failed to answer a court summons.\n\nLuisa Kremleva is the daughter of a real estate boss\n\nThe Russian-born models accusation was from 2017\n\nHer trial was delayed by a string of suspensions, including one linked to medical treatment Kremleva was thought to have been undergoing in her homeland when a previous court date was set.\n\nA public prosecution indictment submitted ahead of her scheduled trial last October and before the plea bargain deal accused her of maliciously making up the rape after consensual sex with Hernandez out of revenge for the footballer snubbing her attempts to get him to go home with her after they made out in the back of the Porsche.\n\nIn a newspaper interview after investigators dismissed her rape claims early on in their probe, Kremleva insisted: I have proof of the attack which are on my backside and knees. I would love it if Theo apologised. Its the least I deserve.\n\nHer mum, Mila, went on Spanish TV after news of her January 13, 2020 detention broke to claim: My daughter is not under arrest. She went to pick up a court notification. With time the truth is going to come out.\n\nKremleva admitted to acting maliciously in accusing Hernandez of raping her as part of the plea bargain deal she struck to lift the threat of a two-year prison sentence hanging over her head if she had decided to plead innocent and go to trial.\n\nSentencing judge Lourdes Sanchez Esquinas ruled following the TV models admission of guilt, referring to her by her first name and initials in her written sentence: It has been proven that in the early hours of June 4, 2017, the accused Luisa T.K was in the Olivia Valere nightclub in Marbella, where she had arranged to meet up with Theo H. who was in a VIP area with a group of friends.\n\nAbout 4am both left the venue with the intention of having sex. They went to the car park and in Theos friends car they had full consensual sex before returning to the nightclub. The accused subsequently tried but failed to get Theo to spend the night alone with her at her home, getting into a fight with other women who formed part of Theos group before she returned home alone without him.\n\nAbout 8am, in revenge and taking advantage of Theos fame she called police telling them she had been the victim of a rape and informed them about her intention of making a formal complaint before being taken by officers to hospital for a medical examination.\n\nOn June 4 at 5.25pm she went to a police station in Marbella and maliciously reported that after initially agreeing to sex with Theo H, she said she didnt want to continue and despite making that clear, Theo forced himself on her against her will before pushing her out of the car onto her knees and injuring her.\n\nShe unlawfully hid the fact that she had previously fallen onto the ground by accident and then again during the aforementioned fight.\n\nHernandez, who was due to give evidence at last Octobers scheduled trial, is said to be close to penning a new deal withSerie Aside AC Milan which will make him one of the highest-paid players in their squad. The star footballer played a key role in his clubs 3-2 Italian Super Cup final victory in Riyadh on Monday, scoring a goal and setting up another in their stunning comeback against city rivalsInter.\n\n",

            "content": "Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau\n\nTHE Department of Immigrations Regional Compliance and Enforcement Unit has stated that it is not relenting in its quest to prevent criminals and illegal migrants from accessing the transformed Beitbridge Border Post.\n\nFigures from the department indicate that 3 493 people were arrested for offences related to illegal activities between Zimbabwe and South Africa from December 1 to January 7. The ongoing regional compliance operation, which is also supported by other border agencies, aims to curtail criminal activities, including border jumping and touting.\n\nOther crimes include the use of fake immigration stamps and counterfeit travel documents, which are associated with a surge in human trafficking.\n\nAssistant Regional Immigration Officer in charge of Beitbridge, Mrs Canisia Magaya, said the department is collaborating with other border agencies to minimise illegal activities at the border post. She noted that during the same period under review, 591 people had been refused entry between South Africa and Zimbabwe for various reasons. Among these were 538 Zimbabweans, 46 Malawians, two Tanzanians, two Congolese, one Ghanaian, and two Kenyans.\n\nSome of the reasons for refusal of entry include the lack of visas, unpaid fines, undocumented status, and being blacklisted as undesirable immigrants, said Mrs Magaya.\n\nWe are unwavering in our quest to maintain the safety and security of travellers and to ensure a smooth flow of traffic this festive season. Our regional enforcement and compliance efforts remain robust, and from December 1 to January 7, we intercepted a total of 3 493 individuals for violating immigration laws, handing them over to the ZRP (Police) for further management.\n\nShe said some irregular migrants were intercepted on the South African side of the border after navigating illegal crossing points along the Limpopo River. Mrs Magaya said the team is cracking down on child smuggling cases, having prevented 61 minors from being illegally transported to South Africa during the festive period. The unaccompanied minors have since been handed over to the Department of Social Development (DSD) for contact tracing and reunification with their parents or guardians.\n\nWe have deployed sufficient manpower and are targeting all known hotspots and areas, said Mrs Magaya.\n\nAt the same time, the department is urging travellers to continuously use the designated ports of entry and exit for their own safety. They should approach the immigration office should they have any questions or queries, as touts are always eager to take advantage of their lack of information on certain migration issues.\n\nThe compliance operation is ongoing, and the official said they will not give criminals any breathing space. Spot checks are being conducted at the border on vehicles and buses leaving or entering the country, as well as along major highways.\n\nThe senior immigration official advised parents to ensure their children have valid travel documents. In cases where they are not travelling with them, they need to adhere to the legal requirements necessary for such clearance. Under border regulations, children travelling with guardians should, in addition to having a valid passport, possess a copy of the childs birth certificate and affidavits from the parents granting consent for the minors to travel with them. For a single parent travelling with a child, an affidavit from the non-travelling parent is required, along with copies of the parents ID or passport.\n\nAutomation of services and the separation of traffic at the transformed Beitbridge Border Post have significantly enhanced efficiency and security systems at the countrys busiest port of entry.\n\n",
