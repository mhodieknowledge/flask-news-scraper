She said the gang was armed with pistols, knives and axes when they pounced at Young Money General Dealer Shop, one of two grocery shops situated deep in Insuza at Jiba village.\n\nMs Nxumalo said she was attending to customers at the grocery shop at around 8PM, shortly before closing, when two of the suspects came and bought cigarettes. The shop was closed and the gang later attacked around 11PM, demanding gold reportedly kept in safe.\n\nThey were convinced there was gold in the shop, which was not the case. Gold mining activities take place in Nkosikazi area, which is far from here and our employer is not into gold buying or gold mining, said Ms Nxumalo.\n\nShe said the armed robbers spent the day drinking alcohol in the modest rural shop.\n\nThey just seemed like ordinary customers at the time. Little did we know that they were planning something sinister, said Ms Nxumalo.\n\nShe said long after the shop attendants had retired for the night, the gang broke into the shop, tied the employees with an electric cable and ransacked the place.\n\nThey were armed with pistols, knives and axes. They demanded gold and cash but were convinced that there was gold somewhere in the shop, said Ms Nxumalo.\n\nThe stolen items included an unknown amount of cash, groceries, a 48-volt lithium battery, an inverter and an amplifier, a nine-kilogramme gas tank and cellphones.\n\nIt was only after the robbers had left that one of the terrified shop employees frantically sought help at a grocery shop next door and asked for a cellphone to call her employer, who was at another business she owns in Nyamandlovu.\n\nThe call to my boss (Mrs Kholiwe Danisa Dube) was made around 01:30AM on Tuesday morning and she told us to seek refuge at a nearby homestead in case the robbers decided to come back while she called the police, Ms Nxumalo said.\n\nNational police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi could not be drawn to divulge more information last night saying his office will provide a further update today (Thursday) saying investigations were ongoing.\n\nCommissioner Paul Nyathi\n\nHowever, in an earlier statement, police had said the shooting occurred early Tuesday morning between 2AM and 4AM after the suspects loaded their loot into their getaway silver Honda Fit vehicle, registration number, AEY 4843 and fled.\n\nComm Nyathi said after a report was made to the police, the getaway vehicle was spotted moving towards the tollgate.\n\nDetectives ordered the suspects to stop but instead the suspects fired shots towards the police officers, leading to a shoot-out, he said.\n\nThe suspects went on to hit the boom gate at the toll gate. They were arrested and taken to United Bulawayo Hospitals where they all unfortunately passed on.\n\nComm Nyathi said two pistols with four live rounds were recovered at the scene.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police reiterates that there is no going back in the fight against armed robbery syndicates in the country. Any form of confrontation by criminals will be responded to through appropriate measures, he said.\n\n",

The Government has so far drilled over 120 boreholes across Gokwe North and South, including at the event sites. The celebrations will feature the lighting of the Independence Flame, the traditional Torch Relay, and a variety of cultural performances by dance troupes and artists from Kwekwe, Gokwe, and other districts.\n\nFootball enthusiasts can look forward to matches between Simba Bhora and FC Platinum during the main celebrations, while Herentals Queens and Black Rhinos will play at the Childrens Party.\n\nIn previous years, Harare hosted the national festivities, but under the Second Republic, President Mnangagwa has directed that the commemorations be rotated across the different provinces, aligning with his administrations vision of leaving no one and no place behind.\n\nRotating the celebrations ensures that all regions of the country benefit from the legacy projects associated with hosting the main event.\n\nZanu PF Midlands Provincial party chairperson Cde Edson Chiherenge said the momentous occasion is ushering in massive developmental projects for Gokwe Nembudziya and other areas.\n\nCde Edson Chiherenge\n\nThere is massive development in Gokwe North District, which has resulted in the employment of over 300 youths and women. Remember, the Government is constructing two state-of-the-art boys and girls hostels at Nyamuroro Secondary School, the venue for the childrens party, he said.\n\nGovernment is rehabilitating Nembudziya High School through erecting a new fence, a borehole, and other developments.\n\nCde Chiherenge said new structures were being put in place at Nembudziya District Hospital, including a new mortuary and a new building for the nursing school.\n\nAll these projects have brought about employment for the people of Gokwe, and we commend the Government for decentralising Independence Day celebrations as a lasting legacy for the local community, he said.\n\nMinister of Primary and Secondary Education, Torerayi Moyo, who toured Nyamuroro Primary School, which will host the childrens party over the weekend, said the decentralisation of independence celebrations has brought economic benefits to the local community, with youths and women being employed in various roles ahead of the event.\n\nAfter the disbursement of funds, we are seeing a lot of work being done at both venues. The school where the childrens party is being hosted is going to benefit a lot, as more hostels and ablution facilities are being built, he said.\n\nWe are happy for this development, and we have witnessed many people being employed.Minister Moyo said that through the decentralisation of national programmes, the Government is fostering economic and social development at the grassroots level.\n\nGovernments decentralisation policy of national programmes is not only bringing the national narrative to the doorstep of its diverse populace but has also become an empowerment tool benefiting youths and women. We commend the Second Republic for bringing this development to us, he said.\n\nMidlands Province construction officer, Mr Jemitious Vhovha, said preparations for the Childrens Party are on course, with officials pleased with the progress recorded to date.\n\nWe are on course with the works here as we have a target to be finished by April 10, ahead of the Childrens Party on April 17. We have all the material we need, and the manpower is also available, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, locals have welcomed the move, praising the Second Republic for its inclusive development agenda.\n\nWe have been given an opportunity to serve our country while getting money to look after our families, said Ms Lorraine Ncube.\n\nAnother villager, Mr Andrew Machaya, expressed excitement over the transformation of Gokwe, saying they never thought it was possible to have such direct opportunities.\n\nOur area is being developed, and most importantly, we got employed, he said.\n\n",

They have a very unique and good technology and their decision-making is quite quick and flexible, said Amb Shinichi.\n\nZimbabwe intends to use the global exhibition to grow its investment and trade deals as well as tourist arrivals by 10 and 15 percent, respectively.\n\nThis comes after Zimbabwe successfully participated in Expo 2020 Dubai where it secured trade partnerships and investments from the Asian continent.\n\nFollowing its participation in Expo 2020 Dubai, Zimbabwe achieved several milestones, including the US$250 million joint venture agreement between the Agriculture and Rural Development Authority (Arda) and NV Group of India, to establish a brewery in Masvingo.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) struck a partnership with the Dubai National Air Travel Agency (Dnata) to market local tourism offerings.\n\nThrough its participation in Expo 2025 Osaka, Zimbabwe will showcase its economic potential, and the many investment opportunities in the country, to potential investors from around the world.\n\nThe country will also be able to project its culture and heritage to a global audience, which could help drive interest in the countrys tourism sector and increase visitors to the country.\n\nExpos provide an opportunity for Zimbabwean enterprises to meet and connect with potential investors, new business opportunities and collaborations.\n\nZimbabwe aims to showcase its diverse offerings through exhibitions, B2B meetings, commercial activities, cultural exchanges and demonstrations.\n\nIt will also conduct side events such as trade and investment seminars and business forums, among other activities, to amplify the countrys presence in Japan.\n\nZimbabwe aims to welcome at least three million visitors to its pavilion, showcasing the countrys vast trade and investment opportunities, natural beauty and rich cultural heritage.\n\nThe platform will also raise global awareness of Zimbabwe as a premier destination to live, work, study, visit and conduct business.\n\nAs one of the oldest and largest international events, the expo has been held every five years since 1851, providing a prestigious global platform for showcasing achievements, innovation, collaboration and co-operation.\n\nAmb Yamanaka Shinichi\n\nOver 28 million visitors from across the world are expected to attend the event while over 150 countries have confirmed their participation in this six-month-long exhibition.\n\nZimbabwes participation in the global event presents a unique and invaluable opportunity to strengthen its trade relations with Japan, Asia and the global community.\n\nBy leveraging this platform, Zimbabwe can effectively promote its trade and investment potential, foster new partnerships and enhance its visibility on the international stage.\n\nZimbabwe has over the years been engaging with Japan to establish a trade protocol and pave the way for the export of high-demand products such as avocados and citrus fruits.\n\nThis development is particularly timely, as the growing global population has become increasingly aware of healthier lifestyles, creating a surge in demand for nutritious products.\n\nAs a result, Zimbabwe is well-positioned to capitalise on this trend by expanding its exports of healthy goods, including blueberries, to cater to the rising demand for healthier living options.\n\nZimbabwe also holds significant potential for exporting various oils, with several companies already exploring opportunities in this sector. Avocado oil and citrus oil are just a few examples of the value-added products being developed.\n\nAdditionally, there is a growing interest in heritage-based products, such as amarula and baobab oils, which not only showcase the countrys rich cultural heritage but also offer a unique selling proposition in the global market.\n\nThe Expo, which will run under the theme Designing Future Society for Our Lives supported by three sub-themes Connecting lives, Saving lives and Empowering lives is expected to enhance Zimbabwes visibility, networking opportunities, learning opportunities and competitive analysis.\n\nThe participation of local players at the occasion intends to benchmark Zimbabwes product offering whilst tapping from international best practices.\n\nIt will create a platform for the government to engage with international investors and promote policies that encourage Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).\n\nWe have a commercial space where we will display some of our artefacts and also leather and other related products that we feel will be beneficial in terms of them being exhibited at that Expo.\n\nWe are getting content from the countrys 10 provinces. I think so far, we have got content from Matabeleland South, Matabeleland North, Bulawayo and Midlands and we should be moving to Manicaland, Masvingo and Mashonaland West, where we really want to showcase what Zimbabwe has to offer both on the trade, tourism and the investment side of things.\n\nPeople are now looking to live healthier, so we should also be showcasing products like blueberries, avocado and citrus and oils, which are more for people to live healthier, said ZimTrade chief operations officer, Mr Similo Nkala, in the interview with Star FM.\n\nThe six-month event offers a platform to attract international investors and businesses who are interested in exploring new markets and expanding their operations.\n\n",

This dynamic exhibition comprises paintings, drawings, design motifs, mixed media, and three-dimensional art, culminating in a powerful exploration of womens empowerment.\n\nThrough their works, these artists serve as catalysts for social change, amplifying the voices of the marginalised and challenging the systemic barriers that perpetuate gender inequality, read part of the statement.\n\nAccording to Kamupira, the exhibition is a call to action, urging swift and decisive steps toward achieving gender parity.\n\nThe artists works serve as a powerful call to action. Alison Bakers pieces inspire women to find the courage and strength to break free from societal constraints, Kamupira said.\n\nShe highlighted that Kafiya Eyvazovas work, particularly her thought-provoking piece, I Want Seven Sons and One Daughter, challenges societal values and sheds light on the struggles faced by women in patriarchal societies, where the inability to bear a male child can lead to devastating consequences.\n\nSimilarly, Sidanisile Dubes Dlala Mama celebrates the importance of self-care and living in the present, highlighting the need for women to prioritise their well-being and happiness.\n\nVisual artist, Nomathemba Dube posing for a photo with her artwork\n\nChronicle Showbiz observed as art lovers admired the various artworks on display on Friday.\n\nIn separate interviews, visual artists shared their thoughts on the exhibition and Womens History Month. Mavies Ndhlovu, a ceramicist from Gwanda, said her work was inspired by the artistry of Matobo women, who elevated hut painting into a broader form of artistic expression. One of her pieces, Sesilapha, depicts how Matobo women started by painting their huts in rural areas, but now their work is seen in urban spaces and even on fabrics. They inspire me a lot.\n\nNomathemba Dube, who drew a piece titled Free to Be, said the exhibition provided her with a platform to step out of her shell and embrace her true self.\n\nLuzibo Luchi Shiki Moyo, daughter of Bulawayo-based imbube ensemble Black Umfolosis founding member Sotja Moyo, said her journey into visual arts was inspired by a woman who painted portraits at Meikles store back in the day.\n\nLuzibo Moyos artwork\n\nGrowing up, I was surrounded by musicians, which is why Im also a musician and dancer. However, my journey into visual art was sparked by a woman  I dont know her name  who painted portraits at Meikles. I would watch and admire her work. Then, when I attended Founders High School, I chose art as one of my practical subjects, and I have never looked back.\n\nTo me, Womens History Month should celebrate humanity as a whole, not just women. Of course, women play a huge role in peoples lives from birth and beyond, so they should be celebrated daily, she said.\n\nOther participating artists included Lauryn Arnott, Abigail N Hunda, Arzu Jabrailova, Langelihle B Moyo, Gloria JC Schonegeuel, Thokozile Dube, Andiswa Matobo, Nomvuyiso M Mpofu, Alison Baker, Portia Ndlovu, Valiyeva Yasemen, Clementine VT Nyati, Kafiya Eyvazova, Zandile V Masuku, Fidan Nazim Qizi, Lethiwe Ndebele, Kimberley Bumhira, Florence Nyathi, Nubar Rafiyeva, Tendai Mandira, Portia Ndlovu, Nomathemba Ndlovu, Lakhina Zulu, and Sidanisile Dube.

But their crime spree didnt last long.\n\nThanks to a quick-thinking victim who managed to alert their employer, the police were immediately informed of the robbery.\n\nActing with precision, law enforcement positioned themselves along the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Road, ready for action.\n\nWhen the suspects vehicle was spotted approaching the tollgate, police attempted to stop the car. Instead of surrendering, the criminals opened fire, sparking a fierce gunfight.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to escape, the suspects rammed their vehicle into the tollgates boom barrier. But the outcome was inevitable.\n\nThe officers quickly subdued the gang, and the suspects were transported to the United Bulawayo Hospitals, where they were later pronounced dead.\n\nThis dramatic conclusion to the robbery is a testament to the ZRPs unwavering commitment to fighting crime.\n\nThe police successfully recovered a cache of weapons from the suspects, including pistols, knives, and an axe.\n\nSome of the stolen goods were also found in the vehicle. But perhaps the most important take away from this incident is the message it sends to criminals across the country: if you choose a life of crime, you will face the full force of the law.\n\nThe police are sending a clear and firm message: there is no room for leniency when it comes to armed robbery and violent crime.\n\nThe ZRPs statement couldnt be clearer: Any form of confrontation by criminals will be met with appropriate measures.\n\nThe law enforcement officers are ready, and they will stop at nothing to ensure the safety of law-abiding citizens.\n\nThose who think they can outsmart or overpower the police will quickly learn that their actions have consequences  consequences that could very well lead to their own downfall.\n\nTo all criminals operating in Zimbabwe, take heed: the police are more determined than ever to rid the country of dangerous crime syndicates.

Pushcart operators also went about their business ferrying wares from various points around the city.\n\nWhile some vendors expressed a willingness to move if the process is organised, others raised concerns about the expenses involved in relocating and establishing themselves in a new location. Others vowed not to move arguing that they have invested a lot in their business.\n\nThe city councils announcement on Tuesday had sparked worries among vendors about their future, with many fearing the move could jeopardise their customer base.\n\nI can understand the councils intentions but they need to consider the people who rely on this space. We are not just numbers, we are families. We rely on this street to make ends meet.\n\nSome, if not most of us, are widows and care for our families and extended families. The little we make here goes a long way in sustaining our well-being, said Miss Nomalanga Maphosa.\n\nAnother vendor who preferred anonymity said Bulawayo City Council had lost its conscience saying forcing people to move without making prior arrangements is inhuman.\n\nBulawayo City Council (BCC)\n\nWe have been tossed around for far too long over this issue. We have lost far too much money to some of these so-called representatives from the council guaranteeing us a safe space to operate. What then happens to that? It is not like BCC is not aware of these arrangements since most of these monies were being paid to their employees, alleged the vendor.\n\nMr Tendai Charuka, a vendors representative, said the move to relocate vendors will be welcome if the council meets its obligations to build standard bays, with sheds and ablution facilities.\n\nVendors will be willing to move if no corners are being cut or favour individuals and groups. They have invested a lot in the avenue and this decision by the council will set them back a long way, he said.\n\nHowever, if it is to be the fate then let it be as long as all vendors are moved in a peaceful and civilised manner, said Mr Charuka.\n\nHe accused the local authority of taking advantage of Local Government and Public Works Minister Daniel Garwes directive to evict vendors from their places of operation.\n\nHe (Minister Garwe) only spoke of night vendors. He said the move is meant to address the growing incidence of night vending across the country.\n\nThe minister in his statement said the surge in unregulated informal trading in the countrys CBDs has resulted in increased pedestrian traffic, widespread littering and disturbances to established businesses within the CBD, making the cities unattractive to investors. So, what BCC is trying to do is not fair, said Mr Charuka.\n\nThe council also banned pushcarts from the CBD in line with the recent Government directive to restore sanity and clear city centres of illegal informal trading activity.\n\nThe decision follows widespread concerns over rampant illegal vending operations in towns and cities including night vending and pushcarts, which have been blamed for frustrating formal business operations, harbouring criminality, indiscriminate littering and violations of public health and safety regulations.\n\nComment could not be drawn from BCC, as the local authoritys corporate communications manager, Mrs Nesisa Mpofus cellphone continuously went unanswered.\n\n",

We, the IOC, need to ensure we remain neutral, which is easier said than done, but the only way that we can remain neutral is by ensuring our integrity  and our values  are upheld.\n\nRussias standing in the Olympic movement bubbles away in the background after Russian athletes who were known to have supported the war were banned from last years Paris Games.\n\nEligible athletes competed as neutrals after taking part in Tokyo, under the Russian Olympic Committee moniker, following years of state-backed systematic doping.\n\nCoventry believes the approach in Paris was the ideal way to navigate the situation.\n\nI think we need a dedicated task force that looks at how best to support athletes in conflict areas. Ultimately, the IOCs solidarity model is that we try to get every qualified athlete to the Games, she said.\n\nBut, we have to look after athletes at an Olympic Games, too. We have to make sure theyre safe, so we need to come up with clear guidelines that will protect athletes from all countries.\n\nI know, when I was winning my medals, Zimbabwe was going through a very bad power struggle and it could have been very easy for the international sports community to say were not going to recognise your athletes. I had no say. Do I think athletes should be able to remain neutral? Yes.\n\nWhat we saw in Paris was, I believe, very fair. We said athletes from Belarus and Russia who had openly supported the war would not be invited. That comes back to the principle of trying to keep everyone at the Games safe, particularly as the environment is so high-stress.\n\nThe decision on a 2036 host will also need to be made with the likes of India and Qatar lobbying to be the successor to the Brisbane Games.\n\nThe voting process will be a test of Bachs changes that allow the IOC to recommend a host without extensive bidding, in order to cut costs for potential hosts and to crack down on vote-buying in an attempt to avoid the kind of scandals that have plagued Fifa.\n\nThe threat of climate change, with the traditional timeslot for the Summer Games of July and August, during the northern hemisphere summer, providing more extreme conditions and windows for the Winter Games shrinking too, is also front of mind with the decision on hosts.\n\nCoventry called for greater flexibility, like how the marathon at the Tokyo Games was held in the cooler conditions of northern Japanese city Sapporo.\n\nWe have an incredible amount of interest in the Games for 2036 and 2040 from new regions, which is exciting. It opens up the question of the timing of the Games and I think we need to be proactive about that, both summer and winter, she said.\n\nOne less thing the next president will have to worry about is a US media rights deal with the IOC locking in a US$3 billion contract with NBC through to the 2036 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.\n\nUS Dollars\n\nBut speaking at Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympics, on Tuesday, Bach left with a warning for his successor.\n\nThe Olympic Games and the values they represent have endured for millennia, he said.\n\nAnd yet, the course of human history reminds us of their fragility.

            "content": "Richard Muponde and Sikhulekelani Moyo, Zimpapers Politics HubTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwes (RBZ) Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is expanding its operations outside Harare in a decisive move to bolster the stability of the local currency (ZWG) and ensure nationwide compliance with currency exchange regulations.\n\nThe interventions will be backed by the issuance of high-quality and durable banknotes to be distributed to remote areas where electronic money platforms are not available.\n\nDue to network limitations, most rural areas across the country do not use the ZWG, which is mostly circulating on electronic platforms. Small businesses that do not have point of sale (POS) machines, including those in cities, also rely on hard cash and sometimes deliberately close out more customers with ZWG.\n\nRBZ Governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu, has stated that these challenges are being addressed in line with the Monetary Policy Statement issued early last month, which emphasised the need for widespread public awareness on the use of the local currency.\n\nThis will be complemented by the issuance of higher-quality and durable ZWG banknotes, which will be strategically distributed to the most remote areas of the country where there are scarce brick-and-mortar financial services, said Dr Mushayavanhu.\n\nIn addition, the Reserve Bank, along with the rest of the world, will be celebrating Global Money Week from Monday, March 17 to March 21 2025.\n\nAs part of the celebrations, the Reserve Bank will carry out financial literacy programmes, which will also target rural areas in providing information on the ZWG currency.\n\nDespite the Government calling for businesses to accept all recognised currencies, some continue to refuse ZWG, hiding behind network issues and sometimes pretending they do not have POS machines.\n\nDr Mushayavanhu said RBZ remains committed to ensuring that all Zimbabweans, particularly those in rural, marginalised, and outlying areas, have access to financial services as outlined in the National Financial Inclusion Strategy.\n\nAs part of widening access to electronic payments, the Reserve Bank announced the roll-out of the POS machines programme, which is designed to reach all parts of the country under the mantra of leaving no one and no place behind, he said.\n\nIn this regard, the Reserve Bank will continue to undertake its financial literacy and consumer protection campaigns throughout the country in 2025 to support the uptake of financial services.\n\nReserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor John Mushayavanhu shows the new gold-backed currency  the ZiG\n\nA massive recruitment drive for more FIU inspectors has already been launched, and plans to establish offices in Bulawayo by May are at an advanced stage, while other provinces will follow, targeting areas with lower compliance levels. In previous years, Zimbabwe has experienced currency volatility caused by economic saboteurs through currency manipulation.\n\nHowever, over the past five months, the ZWG has remained stable, with parallel market rates now almost converging with the official rates.\n\nThis stability came after the FIU launched blitzes targeting businesses, banks, and the informal sector to restore stability to the economy.\n\nFIU Director-General, Mr Oliver Chiperesa, emphasised the need for the FIUs expanded presence to consolidate the current economic stability and tackle pockets of resistance to compliance, particularly in areas outside the capital city.\n\nThe FIU currently has offices only in Harare, and this year we are starting to move to other centres, beginning with Bulawayo. At the moment, we are recruiting inspectors to strengthen the current numbers, he said.\n\nMr Chiperesa attributed the currency stability of the ZWG to heightened compliance among businesses, bolstered by efforts from the FIU, the security sector, and the Government to crack down on currency manipulators and economic saboteurs.\n\nThe FIU Director-General acknowledged that compliance levels remain inconsistent in areas where the FIU does not have a permanent presence.\n\nWe have been receiving reports from other centres that businesses there have lower compliance levels. We have been sending some teams on an ad hoc basis to those centres, and we found that, indeed, in areas where the FIU does not have a presence, compliance levels among traders tend to be lower, he said.\n\nMr Chiperesa said that to address this gap, the FIUs expansion will ensure that traders in all provinces adhere to currency regulations.\n\nHe said the establishment of permanent offices in Bulawayo is a first step, with plans to review and expand to other towns and cities in the future.\n\nWe want to make sure we have a presence in all major centres of the country. Starting with Bulawayo, we will review where else we need to deploy permanent FIU offices, he said.\n\nMr Chiperesa reiterated the FIUs commitment to enforcing regulations and ensuring that the stability being enjoyed remains constant for economic development.\n\nWhat we want to make sure of is that we consolidate that stability and ensure that businesses in all provinces are complying with the requirements, Mr Chiperesa said.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Mushayavanhu has said the RBZ has instituted measures to allow for greater flexibility on the exchange rate and for further deepening of the foreign exchange market under the willing-buyer willing-seller (WBWS) arrangement, where the ZWG/USD exchange rate is determined under a floating exchange rate system by authorised dealers.\n\nBusinesses, including those in tourism, can include a margin for additional charges related to transaction costs in line with normal business practices in converting the local currency to foreign currency with their bankers, said Dr Mushayavanhu.\n\nSpeculative attacks on the currency will always remain a risk. This risk is acknowledged by the practices of central banks across the globe and their readiness to intervene in the foreign exchange market to protect the value of their currency.\n\nIn the same vein, the RBZ will strategically intervene in the foreign exchange market to smooth out any intermittent exchange rate volatility.\n\nOther speculative practices, which may take place in the goods and services market, will be addressed through measures to protect consumers in conjunction with inter-agency collaborations.\n\n",
