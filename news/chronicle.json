            "content": "Wallace Ruzvidzo, Harare Bureau\n\nPOLITICAL analysts say President Mnangagwas open-door policy has united Zimbabweans towards a productive and developmental path that is a turning point for the countrys once polarised political landscape.\n\nOn Sunday, in a never-before-seen show of unity, parliamentarians from across the political divide visited the First Familys Pricabe farm for a familiarisation tour. Analysts said this was a demonstration of maturity in the countrys once-fractious politics.\n\nA majority of opposition legislators attended the tour, with a few who did not participate sending their apologies.Political commentators applauded this show of unity, saying politics in Zimbabwe had indeed come of age.Government critic and former Cabinet Minister Professor Jonathan Moyo, who is living in self-imposed exile, described the opposition MPs visit to Pricabe Farm as icebreaking.\n\nGiven their number in Parliament, it turns out that contrary to earlier false reports, the attendance of 34 CCC legislators at yesterdays (Sunday) ground-breaking tour of President Mnangagwas Precabe Farm by MPs from across the political divide was significant and ice-breaking, engagement-wise!, he said.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Moyo\n\nThe unprecedented visit is in stark contrast to the antagonistic politics before the dawn of the Second Republic in 2017 and flies in the face of oppositional elements who thrive on discord.\n\nPolitical analyst, Mr Godwine Mureriwa, said the uniting of all political players in the country had been something President Mnangagwa had always wanted and has now achieved.\n\nFocus, he said, should now shift to the countrys development agenda pursuant to the attainment of Vision 2030.I think His Excellency President Mnangagwa when he came into power, made sure that he had a mandate to unite the country so that those in the ruling party, those in opposition formations, can realise that they are Zimbabweans.\n\nBut what is important is that we have to focus on the development agenda, which is key to achieving Vision 2030 that has been set by His Excellency. The vision is not individualistic, it is a vision that the country has to focus on, Mr Mureriwa said.\n\nAnother political analyst, Dr Leopold Chakanyuka, said President Mnangagwa had ushered in a new era of political maturity in Zimbabwes political landscape.\n\nThe visit on Sunday by both Zanu-PF and CCC Members of Parliament symbolises the highest level of political maturity that we have attained as a country.\n\nWe can unite where necessary and criticise where necessary, doing it constructively. The visit shows that as Zimbabweans, we are pushing towards one common agenda, which I think is very important, he saidDr Chakanyuka commended the opposition for forgoing selfish political interests and choosing national development.\n\nWe need to appreciate the opposition for realising that we are Zimbabweans first before we become political parties, he said.In his address to the Parliamentarians, President Mnangagwa urged opposition legislators to actively scrutinise and hold the ruling party Zanu PF Members of Parliament to account so that they deliver for the general citizenry.\n\nThe President said the opposition legislators should give their ruling party counterparts a hard time in Parliament to build and develop Zimbabwe.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nBecause of his open-door policy, another political analyst Mr Rutendo Matinyarare, said the President had successfully unified political parties in the country.\n\nThis, he said, would see all political players joining forces in the development of the country.I think that the President has been successfully able to bring unity to the political parties. He is breaking the polarisation that we have seen for many years in our country, uniting different political opponents to make them focus on the national interest and the one goal of building a better Zimbabwe.\n\nI would assume that, that is why some of the opposition members are saying let us hold on and hold off elections while we unite and build our country better to take us forward. I think that is very commendable, Mr Matinyarare said.\n\nHe said President Mnangagwa had demonstrated that he is a unifying leader by giving the legislators an opportunity to get a feel of his successful farming operation.\n\nI think the President has shown a very great sign of leadership. He is showing leadership in terms of farming, showing by example, what land in Zimbabwe is supposed to be used for, he said.\n\nFollowing his election victory last year, the President, in his inauguration speech, said: Now that elections are behind us, we must now focus on addressing the economic challenges facing our country.\n\n",

Recent rains across the country have significantly boosted water levels in major dams, with the national dam level average now standing at 61 percent.\n\nZhovhe Dam, located in the Mazunga area, has reached 101 percent capacity, while Silalabuhwa Dam is at 104.1 percent.Both dams, managed under the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) Umzingwane catchment, are crucial for water supply and livestock.\n\nOther dams in the region have also recorded substantial inflows. Ngwenya Dam and Exchange Dam, both under the Gwayi catchment in Matabeleland North, have surpassed full capacity at 106.5 percent and 105.8 percent, respectively.\n\nZhovhe Dam\n\nThese dams are vital for irrigation and water supply.For farmers like Mrs Saliwe Marema from Mazunga in Beitbridge, the spilling of Zhovhe Dam is a long-awaited blessing.We are happy to see Zhovhe Dam spilling, especially after a year of battling the effects of the El Nio-induced drought. The situation had become dire for us, particularly as large-scale citrus producers and horticulturists. This significant water supply will allow us to resume full-scale production to meet client demands, she said.\n\nMrs Marema added that the availability of water has also alleviated concerns about livestock.Last season, we had to buy a lot of stock feed for our animals due to limited pastures and water shortages. Now, we are guaranteed adequate water and improved grazing areas.\n\nEchoing her sentiments, Mr Alfred Makhomo, a farmer from Lot 9 in Ward 14, Beitbridge, expressed relief.Zhovhe Dam is a major water source for irrigation farming along the Umzingwane River. We have a mini greenbelt where farmers grow crops and even stock feed for animals.\n\nLast year, we were deeply concerned as water levels dropped significantly. This year, we are optimistic, he said.In a statement, Zinwas head of corporate communications and marketing, Mrs Marjorie Munyonga, urged communities downstream of spilling dams to remain vigilant.\n\nWater levels in the countrys major dams continue to rise due to ongoing rainfall, with the national dam level average increasing to 61.4 percent as of January 6, 2025. This marks a 2.17 percent rise since the beginning of the year, she said.\n\nSilalabuhwa Dam\n\nDespite the positive developments, Mrs Munyonga noted that the current national average is still lower than the 78 percent recorded during the same period last year. She stressed the need for water consumers to use available resources sparingly and efficiently.\n\nCommunities downstream of spilling dams should avoid crossing flooded rivers and ensure that all water abstraction equipment along river channels is removed or properly secured. All water use for purposes beyond primary needs, including summer crop irrigation, must comply with water abstraction agreements as stipulated by the law, she added.\n\nIn addition to Zhovhe and Silalabuhwa, other dams across the country that are spilling include Lungwala, Moza, Tuli-Makwe, Masholomoshe, Hama, Lower Zibagwe, Nyawa, Exchange and Ngwenya, among others.\n\nFarmers and communities are encouraged to continue preparing for the agricultural season while adhering to safety precautions to mitigate risks associated with heavy rains and flooding, said Mrs Munyonga.\n\n",

            "content": "Nqobile Bhebhe,[emailprotected]\n\nTRIANGLE Limited, a major player in Zimbabwes sugar milling industry, has announced a phased retrenchment exercise in response to rising operational costs and growing competition from low-cost, duty-free imported sugar.\n\nThe move, conducted in accordance with the Labour Act of Zimbabwe, is part of the companys restructuring initiative, Project Zambuko, aimed at stabilising operations and ensuring long-term sustainability.\n\nThe retrenchment process will occur in three phases: the first beginning in February, the second in May and the final phase in August.\n\nIn a notice to employees, managing director, Mr Tendai Masawi, described the decision as a difficult but necessary step to secure the companys future and maintain its vital role in Zimbabwes economy and the livelihoods of communities in the Lowveld region.\n\nMr Masawi attributed the decision to several financial and operational challenges, including escalating costs of key inputs such as fertiliser, fuel and maintenance, coupled with inflationary pressures and currency losses.\n\nSince 2022, Triangle Limited has faced a 55 percent decline in profit margins, a 133 percent rise in manpower costs as a percentage of revenue and unsustainable debt levels.\n\nCompounding these challenges is the inability to claim Value Added Tax (VAT) on inputs following the exemption of sugar from VAT, as well as revised cane supply arrangements, which have constrained cash flow generation for three consecutive years.\n\nWhile we have managed to address the decline in sugar production, our cost of producing sugar remains significantly higher than regional benchmarks, making it unsustainable. Despite implementing multiple cost-reduction and revenue-enhancement initiatives, these efforts have not been enough to stabilise the business, said Mr Masawi.\n\nHe emphasised that the retrenchment exercise will be conducted sensitively and in full compliance with the Labour Act. Affected employees will receive severance packages based on their years of service.\n\nMr Masawi clarified that the decision is driven solely by local economic and operational factors and is unrelated to the business rescue process involving Triangle Limiteds South African shareholder or its acquisition by the Vision Consortium.\n\nHe added that the phased approach will help the company manage the transition effectively while ensuring business continuity.\n\nZimbabwes sugar industry has been grappling with increasing competition from low-cost imports, particularly from Brazil, India, South Africa and Eswatini.\n\nThese duty-free imports have disrupted local markets, threatening institutional producers like Triangle Limited and Hippo Valley Limited, as well as the livelihoods of approximately 354,000 individual growers in the Lowveld.\n\nMr Masawi reiterated that the retrenchment exercise is essential to securing Triangle Limiteds long-term sustainability and its continued contribution to Zimbabwes economy.\n\nThese financial realities underscore the urgent need for corrective action to enable the business to generate sufficient cash flows, reduce debt and reinvest in its future, he said.\n\n",

Banda and Mwaruwari have since taken their case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), as prescribed by the Zifa Statutes.\n\nArticle 85.9 of the statutes reads: For the elections of the Executive Committee, which shall take place following the adoption of these Statutes, the Normalisation Committee shall act as the Electoral Committee as defined in the Electoral Code. Any appeal against any decision of the Normalisation Committee in connection with the elections shall be referred to CAS.\n\nThe case was due to be heard yesterday but could not proceed as Zifas lawyers were engaged in another election-related appeal in Harare.\n\nThe former Norton legislator was at the Bulawayo High Court yesterday, accompanied by his lawyers, Musindo Hungwe and Tatenda Madamombe. Hungwe explained that the matter could not be heard as the respondents lawyers were handling a case in Harare at the same time.\n\nThey were only made aware of the hearing this morning. We were ready to proceed, but the respondents lawyers were appearing in another matter in Harare. The court decided to defer the case to a later date. It has been rescheduled to Thursday at 8.30am, said Hungwe at the Bulawayo High Court yesterday.\n\nDerek Kossam, representing Zifas lawyers, stated that the court could not hear the case as Zifa, cited as the respondent, had been served late on Friday. He added that Zifa only became aware of the hearing at 9am, the same time the court was scheduled to sit.\n\nMliswa, disqualified from contesting the 25 January elections, has taken the national football governing body to court, alleging irregularities in the process. Fifa had ordered a comprehensive election process after former councillors were mandated to adopt the new Zifa constitution, which included amendments to the 2013 version.\n\nThe election process is being overseen by the Zifa Normalisation Committee, which also serves as the Zifa Electoral College. Both have been working in conjunction with the Zifa Ethics and Integrity Committee, chaired by Muchadei Masunda.\n\nMliswa argues that the Zifa Assemblys mandate expired in 2022, rendering the current election process invalid.\n\nMeanwhile, in Harare, Eddie Chikamhi and Yeukai Karengezeka reported that lawyers representing disqualified Zifa presidential aspirant Walter Magaya insisted that the clergymans name should be included on the final list of candidates to be published today, pending the hearing of an urgent chamber application for an interdict at the High Court.\n\nHigh Court Judge Justice Chitapi deferred Magayas case to Friday noon. Magaya is challenging the Zifa Ethics Committees decision to bar him from contesting for the associations presidency in the forthcoming elections.\n\nDespite ongoing court challenges, Zifa is expected to announce the list of candidates today and proceed with preparations for the 25 January elective ordinary Congress as dictated by the statutes.\n\nMagaya is one of five Zifa aspirants dissatisfied with the Ethics Committees ruling, which deemed them to have failed the associations ethics and integrity test. The clergyman has since lodged appeals with both the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland and the High Court of Zimbabwe.\n\nSpeaking after the High Court session yesterday, Magayas lawyer, Tavonga Makamure of Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, stated that their client remains a candidate until a final determination is made by judicial bodies.\n\nOur understanding is that Zifa must publish the list, including our clients name, even if they indicate it is subject to the hearing of the matter, as our client has not been legally disqualified, said Makamure. Outgoing Premier Soccer League chairman, Farai Jere, was also deemed ineligible by the Ethics Committee but chose not to appeal.\n\nIn his urgent chamber application filed at the High Court before Justice Tawanda Chitapi, Magaya cited Zifa Normalisation Committee chairman Lincoln Mutasa as the first respondent, with the Zifa Electoral Committee and the Normalisation Committee as the second and third respondents.\n\nAll parties were present at the hearing, with Zifa Normalisation Committee chair Mutasa accompanied by legal practitioner Chenaimoyo Gumiro, while Magaya was represented by Advocate Thabani Mpofu, Everson Chatambudza, and Makamure.\n\nThe urgent chamber application was granted and postponed to Friday.\n\nWe had a case management session for the matter today (yesterday), and it will now be heard on Friday. Both the urgent matter and the main review will be addressed, said Makamure, expressing confidence that the case would be resolved before the election day.\n\nZifas lawyer, Gumiro, noted that they were now preparing their arguments. The case has been postponed to Friday. Instead of arguing the urgent application, we agreed to hear the main review application. There wasnt much progress today, and we are now looking ahead to Friday, said Gumiro.\n\nBarring a court injunction or any other dramatic development, the Zifa elections are expected to proceed as planned on 25 January.\n\n",

He believes that, despite differences, both the ruling party and the opposition can work together for the national good.\n\nThis shift away from constant bickering and insults towards constructive dialogue is essential for the countrys progress.\n\nPolitical parties, he has argued on various platforms, should focus on addressing serious national issues and devising solutions, rather than engaging in divisive rhetoric.\n\nIn this light, the Second Republic, after the 2018 elections, set up the Political Actors Dialogue (Polad) to promote dialogue among all political parties in Zimbabwe and contribute to policy formulation through lobbying the Government via the platform.\n\nWe commend President Mnangagwa for leading by example and fostering a culture of tolerance, and encourage all Zimbabweans to follow this path, putting the nations development above partisan conflicts.\n\n",

            "content": "Court Writers\n\nTHE High Court opened for the 2025 legal year on Monday, with 165 murder cases scheduled for trial in Bulawayo and the Gweru circuit.\n\nAmong the cases to be heard during the first term is the trial of two Beitbridge-based police officers accused of killing a suspect, dismembering his body and hiding the remains under a bridge to cover up their alleged crime.The officers, Xander Siyasayi and Daniel Peyan, reportedly detained and killed Blessing Nare in 2021 after cash went missing from a bottle store in Toporo Village.\n\nThe court will also hear the case of three armed robbery suspects linked to a series of robberies and the murder of Lobengula West businessman, Langelihle Dube, in June 2022. The suspectsBrian Moyo alias Smally, Lucky Sibanda alias Makhekhe and Kelvin Njabulo Dubeallegedly attacked Mr Dube at his home, leaving him for dead and stealing cellphones and US$25.\n\nAnother high-profile case involves three Beitbridge-based Zimbabwe National Army members accused of fatally shooting Zimbabwe Christian Church (ZCC) worshipper, Jervas Masvina, in July 2019. Masvina and other worshippers were holding an all-night prayer in a bushy area along the Limpopo River when the incident occurred.\n\nThe court will preside over the case of Ndabayezulu Ncube of Gwanda, accused of killing his wife, Nokuthula Khumalo, in June 2017. Ncube allegedly struck his wife with a hoe after she reportedly denied him conjugal rights.\n\nIn the Midlands Province, 82 murder cases are set to be heard by five High Court judges during the 2025 circuit. Two judges will handle 35 cases in Gokwe, while three judges will oversee 47 cases in Gweru. The circuit begins on January 20 and is expected to run for two weeks.\n\nTo ensure a smooth process, arrangements have been made for transport and witness quarters in both Gweru and Gokwe.This deployment is a significant move to address the backlog of murder cases in the region.Midlands provincial public prosecutor, Mr Samuel Pedzisayi said a team of five High Court judges will preside over the provinces first term of the 2025 High Court circuit.\n\nThree judges will be deployed for Gweru and two for Gokwe. There are no high-profile cases, said Mr Pedzisayi.He said when the High Court sat last term, they managed to complete 137 cases.\n\nSpeaking at the official opening of the 2025 legal year in Bulawayo, Chief Justice Luke Malaba, expressed concern over the high number of unresolved murder cases in the Midlands. He noted that the Bulawayo High Court had to sit on circuit in Gweru to clear 137 cases last year.\n\nHe said the high number of murder cases in the Midlands prompted the JSC to set up an extraordinary circuit as the public was now losing confidence in the justice system.\n\nStakeholders brought to my attention the high number of murder cases in the Midlands province, which were taking too long to be finalised by the High Court in Bulawayo. The numbers were so high that sooner than later the public was likely to lose confidence that the courts could protect them, he said.\n\nIt became necessary for the Office of the Chief Justice to intervene. I directed the setting up of an extraordinary High Court circuit session in the Midlands Province, which saw the deployment of five judges in the province to deal with the murder cases.\n\nChief Justice Malaba commended the judiciary and other stakeholders for their efforts.A total of 137 cases were completed. I wrote letters of commendation to the Judge President and all judges who participated in the extraordinary circuit sitting. Collaboration among the judiciary, prosecutors, legal practitioners and police ensured the wheels of justice were not derailed, he said.\n\nUntil now, I have not found the appropriate occasion to also thank the Prosecutor General and her team; the Law Society of Zimbabwe and through it, all legal practitioners who participated by representing accused persons either through the pro-deo appointment system or after being engaged as practitioners of choice by their clients, the Commissioner-General of the Zimbabwe Republic Police and all officers under his command, he said.\n\n",

She achieved an impressive 15 points, scoring As in Mathematics, Biology and Chemistry. Gugulethu dreams of becoming a doctor and is hopeful that her stellar results will secure her a scholarship to pursue her goal.\n\nWhen I opened my results, I couldnt believe it.

Help me congratulate my son, Mlungisi Moyo Jnr, for attaining 15 points in his 2024 A-level exams.\n\nAccording to the Zimbabwe School Examinations Council (Zimsec), the 2024 November Advanced Level pass rate closely mirrors the 2023 pass rate of 94.60 per cent.\n\nZimsec Board Chairperson, Professor Paul Mapfumo, revealed that a total of 33,585 candidates sat the November 2024 examinations, compared to 34,437 in 2023a decrease of 852 candidates, translating to a 2.47 per cent decline in candidature.\n\nProfessor Mapfumo expressed gratitude to all stakeholders involved in the successful administration of the examinations.Special mention goes to school administrators, teachers, markers, our parent ministry, state security agencies, and Zimsec staff for their hard work and dedication. This collective effort ensured the integrity and security of our examinations. We wish all candidates the best in their future studies and endeavours, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a Kwekwe family was left devastated after their 18-year-old son died on the day he received his A-Level results. Lacere Masere, of Mbizo, scored 15 points in the three science subjects he sat. He succumbed to cancer last Friday at Kwekwe District Hospital, moments after being told the good news.\n\nSeveral schools across the country have produced a crop of exceptional Advanced Level learners, with many excelling and earning accolades for their hard work and dedication. The recently released results have painted a picture of determination and academic brilliance, despite the challenges faced by students in various communities.\n\n",

            "content": "Ranga Mataire,Group Political Editor\n\nMOZAMBIQUEs Daniel Chapo is set to be sworn in today as the 5th President of the former Portuguese colony, which gained its independence on June 25, 1975.\n\nChapo will become the countrys first president born after independence to assume such a position.\n\nBefore being elected Frelimo presidential candidate, Chapo was relatively unknown and had little experience in national politics. His first appointment was as an administrator of the district of Nacala-a-Velha and later served as Governor of Inhambane Province from 2015-2024.\n\nDespite being relatively unknown in national politics, Chapo showed that he was a team player during his campaign, with a good appreciation of the myriad of challenges facing his country and the need to mend good relations with regional countries.\n\nSo what will be Chapos presidency look like?\n\nSome would want to argue that his presidency would be change in continuity. They posit that since he is a Frelimo product, he is going to carry on from where his predecessor, President Nyusi left. However, this observation discounts the main reason why Frelimo settled on a man that was virtually an outsider and the first one born after independence.\n\nDomestic security issues\n\nChapo is 47 years old and understands the enormous task before him of fulfilling the aspirations of the younger population who form the bulk of the Mozambican population.\n\nResearcher, Tendai Marima, says Chapo ran a campaign promising that a vote for him was a vote for peace. He has put forth a two-pronged strategy in dealing with the conflict, involving more boots on the ground and dialogue with the rebels.\n\nWith 56 percent of the population below the age of 19 years, Mozambique has one of the youngest population bulge in the world.\n\nIt is these young people that Chapo has to pay much attention to in creating conditions for business to thrive and create the much needed employment. Chapo is not a rabble-rouser orator who panders to the whims of the people. He appears to be a pragmatist who relates well with the younger population.\n\nOne of his foremost challenge as he assumes the presidency is the issue of peace and security in the northern part of the country where Islamist insurgents were running amok leading to the displacement of hundreds of people.\n\nThe new President needs to show his resolve in dealing with the insurgents who have exploited the genuine grievances of the people in the Cabo Delgado, of lack of economic development to destabilise the province. Chapo would need to address historical lagging behind of Cabo Delgado while balancing military and development responses.\n\nChapo has said he is prepared to fight against terrorists, which have halted multi-billion-dollar gas projects. We will continue to work so Mozambique stays a country of peace, including in Cabo Delgado. We want to continue fighting against terrorism.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe former television presenter who is also a lawyer, is considered by some analysts as business friendly. They say he is prepared to fight against Islamic insurgents, which have halted multi-billion-dollar gas projects and displaced hundreds of people.\n\nJudging from his campaign message, Chapos presidency will largely focus on economic revival and development. He has been very persistent in advocating for local resources utilisation for the development and transformation of Mozambicans lives.\n\nBut for development to occur, Chapo says there has to be unity, peace and security and dialogue among citizens.\n\nWe develop Mozambique with peace, with dialogue, with harmony, with security and by talking. You dont win an election by being a One Man Show, said Chapo in the wake of violent opposition protests that ensured after the announcement of the October 9 elections.\n\nAlthough endowed with natural resources, Mozambique has never known total peace and tranquillity as it was plunged into a civil war that lasted for 15 years four months, gaining independence on July 25, 1975.\n\nThe war left Mozambique with many landmines and unexploded ordnance, making large areas of land unsafe and unusable. The war also had a significant impact on the countrys social and economic infrastructure.\n\nIn 2023, Mozambiques GDP grew by an estimated 5,0 percent, up from 4.2 percent in 2022. The World Bank expects growth to accelerate to six percent over 2024-2025. The main drivers of the economy are the extractive and service sectors. The country still faces downside risks to medium-term GDP growth, including climate shocks, security risks and food and fuel price pressures.\n\nChapo has said the countrys business environment needs to be streamlined to make it easier for business to start and operate. Another sector that needs urgent intervention is the agriculture sector which is in dire need of modernisation and implementing programmes like the National Investment Plan for the Agricultural Sector (PNISA). Another programme that needs to be executed to the letter, is the National Programme for Industrialisation Mozambique (PRONAI).\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Buzi district, in the central province of Sofala during campaigns, Chapo said mechanised agriculture would encourage the emergency of small and medium agro-processing companies, which would create job opportunities for the districts currently unemployed youths.\n\nHe claimed that in Inhambane, where he was governor before Frelimo chose him as presidential candidate, he had successfully attracted investment into local agriculture and in turn benefitted from processing units speeding up the production and marketing of produce.\n\nHe pledged to take measures to increase production and productivity of smallholder farmers including providing agricultural inputs, finance agro-business initiatives and introduce agricultural insurance extension and research.\n\nWe want to stimulate and encourage commercial agriculture so as to increase the production of food and export products, he said. Given the fact that Mozambique has suffered from floods and even drought, a robust mechanisation of agriculture will go a long way in ensuring food secure for the nation of 33,9 million citizens.\n\nRegional Diplomacy\n\nAfter being elected Frelimo presidential candidate, Chapo went on a regional charm offensive, meeting regional leaders and briefing them on what his presidency would be like if he was to win the contest. It appears Chapo understands the importance of regional engagement, for Mozambique is not an island. The country plays a significant role in facilitating trade through its ports. Under Chapos leadership, analysts say Mozambique is likely to play more strengthened role in regional integration and co-operation.\n\nClimate Change\n\nMozambique has been repeatedly struck by increasing devastating severe cyclones, such as Idai and Kenneth in 2019. The new President needs to put policies that incorporate mitigation and adaptation strategies including securing co-operation from multinational companies and organisations.\n\nIn Inhambane province he developed a concept called Local is the Only Programme we Have which was designed to strengthen the capacity of local government in providing resilient basic services and build climate-adapted infrastructure through the UN Capital Development Funds Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility (LoCAL). The programme involves listening to the voices and needs of communities, in nine of 11 provinces in the country with tangible benefits.\n\nAt the moment, in Inhambane province, LoCAL directly benefits more than 15 percent of the population living in the province, and has already delivered 42 resilient infrastructures since 2018. These include health clinics, maternity wards, schools, water supply and desalination systems as well as support for resilient livelihoods in 10 of the provinces 14 districts and one municipality.\n\nIf Chapo is to extend this programme in all the countrys provinces and district, a lot of communities exposed to climate risks will benefit immensely.\n\nAs the 47-year-old born free takes his oath of office as the 5th President of Mozambique, a lot is on his shoulders. Both opposition and ruling party supporters have high expectations that the Government will be robust in dealing with corruption, unemployment and maintaining peace and security particularly in the northernmost province of Cabo Delgado.\n\n",
