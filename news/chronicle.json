            "content": "Thokozile Mbedzi\n\nTHE Centre for Talent Development (C.T.D) invited teachers to a two-day School-Based Project workshop at Evelyn High School, aimed at equipping Ndebele teachers with a deeper understanding of the Heritage-Based Curriculum and the effective implementation of School-Based Continuous Learning. The workshop concluded on Friday.\n\nMR Thabani Moyo, the Director for Talent Development, emphasised the importance of teachers understanding the requirements of the new curriculum. He said, When the curriculum changes, teachers must understand the requirements of the programme. Now, we have Heritage-Based Projects, and as teachers, we come together to understand the materials provided. This was done to equip teachers so they can provide proper guidance to learners, as the projects are learner-centred.\n\nOne of the attending teachers, Ms Busi Ncube, shared her experience, saying, As teachers, we have gained knowledge which we did not have before. This will help us guide our learners when we return to our respective schools. Teachers are now equipped with the best content, which will enable us to make informed decisions for our learners. Since the project is learner-centred, our role is to guide them effectively.\n\nFacilitator Mr Chelesani Sibanda highlighted the importance of teachers thoroughly understanding the curriculum documents. As teachers, we needed to understand the documents very well. We must be equipped with the rich knowledge provided in the books, which are written in English. This required us to collaborate, translate (ukuhumutshela), and agree on the content to establish proper guidelines. This way, we can return to our schools and guide our learners, as they are the ones who write the projects, said Mr Sibanda.\n\nThe main facilitator, Mr Alexius Mangoro, explained the purpose of the workshop, saying, As teachers, we all wanted to gain a better understanding, which is why we came together. We collaborated to develop a way forward on how to guide our learners. Our goal was to equip ourselves and then provide proper guidance to our learners based on the agreed guidelines. We focused on understanding the Heritage Curriculum, the implementation of School-Based Continuous Learning, the characteristics of School-Based Projects, and the types of projects learners can undertake.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.chronicle.co.zw/new-rule-to-combat-time-wasting-goalkeepers-face-eight-second-limit/",
            "content": "Online Writer\n\nIN a significant move to curb time-wasting in football, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) has officially approved a new rule set to take effect next season. Under the new regulation, goalkeepers who hold the ball for more than eight seconds will concede a corner kick to the opposing team.\n\nThis decision comes as part of ongoing efforts to improve the flow of the game and reduce unnecessary delays, which have long been a source of frustration for players, fans, and officials alike. Historically, goalkeepers have been known to hold onto the ball for extended periods, particularly when their team is leading, to run down the clock and disrupt the rhythm of the opposition.\n\nThe current laws of the game already stipulate that goalkeepers must release the ball within six seconds of gaining control. However, this rule has rarely been enforced strictly, leading to widespread inconsistency and frequent time-wasting tactics. The new eight-second rule aims to address this issue by introducing a clearer and more enforceable time limit, with a direct consequenceawarding a corner kickfor non-compliance.\n\nThe decision has sparked mixed reactions across the football community. While many have welcomed the change as a step towards fairer and more entertaining matches, others have expressed concerns about its potential impact on goalkeepers and the dynamics of the game. Some critics argue that the rule could place additional pressure on goalkeepers, particularly in high-stakes situations, while others question whether it will be consistently applied by referees.\n\nIFABs announcement follows a series of recent changes aimed at modernising the sport, including the introduction of VAR (Video Assistant Referee) technology and adjustments to substitution rules during the COVID-19 pandemic. The board has emphasised that the new eight-second rule is part of a broader strategy to enhance the quality and integrity of football.\n\nAs teams and players prepare for the upcoming season, the rule change is expected to prompt adjustments in training and tactics, particularly for goalkeepers, who will need to adapt their decision-making under pressure. Fans, meanwhile, will be watching closely to see how the new regulation influences the pace and fairness of matches.\n\nWith the clock now ticking louder than ever, the message from IFAB is clear: no more time-wasting.\n\n",
