Why did the police rush to conduct a post-mortem without our consent or knowledge?fumed one female family member.\n\nWhy were they collecting bereavement monies without our knowledge? Where did that money go?\n\nAlso, why did the police notify us about her death hours after she had been killed? They also demanded her mobile phones and title deeds to the house for reasons best known to them, she blasted\n\nThe family stated that they were not satisfied with the version of events given by the police and vowed to pursue the matter until the culprits were brought to justice.\n\nIf our concerns are not addressed, then they might as well bury her themselvesafter all, she belonged to the State. The police must be held accountable, and we will not stop questioning them until we are satisfied, they said.\n\nA family spokesperson, Mr Ryan Gambinga, said they were deeply shocked and troubled by the tragic circumstances surrounding Hoves death.\n\nWhile we initially received conflicting reports, our recent meeting with ZRP Bulawayo has confirmed that a fellow police officer, and not armed robbers, was involved in this devastating incident, he said.\n\nMr Gambinga said the family would only find peace if a thorough investigation was conducted and the full truth was revealed to bring the matter to finality.\n\nThis revelation raises profound questions and intensifies our grief. We are committed to uncovering the complete truth and ensuring that justice is served, he said.\n\nAs we mourn the loss of our beloved daughter, we demand a thorough and transparent investigation, added Mr Gambinga.\n\nRelatives and mourners at a funeral service for the late female detective, Constable Cassandra Hove in Bulawayo yesterday\n\nThe family wrangled with the officers present until around 3PM, when tensions cooled following a closed-door meeting with some unidentified police bosses.\n\nWe decided to proceed with the service after meeting with the police. They assured us that they would launch a full investigation into the matter. They gave us their highest assurance, and as a family, we decided to go ahead with the proceedings, said Mr Gambinga.\n\nIt is now up to them as the police to uphold their end of the bargain.\n\nMr Gambinga said the family was disappointed that the individuals at the centre of the matter failed to present themselves to the family as they sought closure.\n\nIt would have been prudent for them to come and speak with us. After all, it is customary in many traditions to do so. We have questions that need to be answered, he said.\n\nMr Gambinga revealed that the late Hove had recently secured a scholarship to Russia to pursue a degree in forensic investigations.\n\nWe had sorted all her paperwork and were in the process of securing funds. This is truly a tragedy, he said.\n\nThe emotional send-off saw many of her colleagues in attendance, but none from the Criminal Investigations Departments crack Homicide Unit, named Lozikeyi, were present.\n\nBulawayo province acting police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Nomalanga Msebele, referred all questions to national police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi, who was unavailable for comment.\n\nHove is survived by four children. She will be buried at her rural home in Mberengwa today.\n\n",

The widespread use of illicit substances such as crystal meth (commonly known as mutoriro or guka), marijuana, broncleer (a cough syrup with codeine) and other synthetic drugs has raised concerns among authorities, communities and health experts.\n\nAs part of the campaign, which uses creative arts to spread awareness, the models are speaking out against this vice and incorporating costume designs featuring imitations of various drugs to symbolise the dangers of substance abuse at the events and platforms they attend.\n\nMiss Rural Zimbabwe founder Sipho Mazibuko, stressed the importance of using engaging mediums to connect with young people.\n\nWere using fashion to raise awareness about drug and substance abuse. Were also incorporating comedy, modelling and entertainment because young people are drawn to these platforms. By using a medium they relate to, the message is received faster and more effectively.\n\nThats why we selected a model who can act as both a drug addict and a drunkard to illustrate the dangers vividly, she said.\n\nOne of the contestants, Margaret Mangowe from Masvingo, said the initiative is aimed at educating their peers on the consequences of drug abuse.\n\nMiss Rural Zimbabwe contestant, Margaret Mangowe from Masvingo Bikita.\n\nThrough acting, Im teaching the young generation to stay away from drugs and alcohol. Many young people turn to these substances to escape their problems, not realising theyre ruining their lives.\n\nDrug abuse has become common in schools, leading to embarrassment and even crime, Mangowe said.\n\nPeggy Ngwendu, a contestant from Mbembesi, Matabeleland North, echoed similar sentiments, stating that drug abuse is a major threat to the future of the youth.\n\nDrugs have destroyed many young lives, but I believe theres a solution. One of the biggest challenges facing youth today is unemployment. When young people are idle, they often turn to drugs. If we create opportunities that keep them busy and engaged, we can reduce substance abuse cases, Ngwendu said.\n\nThe models believe their campaign, which will continue until the pageant hosts its national finals later this year, will empower the youth and contribute to efforts to curb drug abuse.\n\nSo far, they have taken their message to Matabeleland North and Masvingo provinces and had the opportunity to reach a broader audience during the National Youth Day celebrations in Bulawayo last month.\n\nUnemployment and peer pressure have contributed to the rise in substance abuse, affecting both urban and rural areas. The government has intensified efforts to tackle drug and substance abuse through various policies, initiatives and collaborations and initiatives like Mazibukos certainly go a long way.\n\nAuthorities have also strengthened laws against drug trafficking and distribution, leading to increased arrests of drug dealers and suppliers, with more and more being arrested almost daily.\n\nThis fight requires a collective effort, and with these ongoing initiatives and strengthened policies, there is hope that the country will reduce drug abuse and protect future generations.\n\n",

He also stated that they have successfully retained all the workers  estimated to be around 1,100  who were employed by Choppies.\n\nWe acquired all the Choppies outlets, not only in Bulawayo but nationwide. We bought everything from Choppies and retained all the workers, about 1100 and something, said Modi.\n\nWe have already started rebranding; we began with the ones in downtown and those in the suburbs. As soon as we finish here in Bulawayo, we will move on to Gweru, then Gokwe, Mutare and finally Harare.\n\nAs a well-known local brand, Modi stated that Sai Mart would blend seamlessly into the market and pledged to continue offering high value to customers.\n\nChoppies Supermarket in Bulawayos Pumula South suburb\n\nBy the end of last year, Choppies had cleared its stock and now, according to Deputy Minister Modi, all the outlets have been restocked.\n\nBefore acquiring the former Choppies outlets, Sai Mart owned six locations in Bulawayo and two in Plumtree. The retail chain aims to leverage this acquisition to expand its footprint and strengthen its position in Zimbabwes competitive retail sector, Modi added.\n\nThe rebranding of Choppies outlets under Sai Mart is expected to usher in a new era for the supermarket chain while maintaining its commitment to quality and affordability for Zimbabwean shoppers, he concluded.  @SikhulekelaniM1.\n\n",

Mr Njabulo Dube, who travels the Siganda-Nyathi route, expressed optimism about the improvements.\n\nFor small car owners like myself, some sections of the road had become almost impassable. However, we are pleased with the progress, he said. The contractors seem to be working efficiently, and we hope the Government will continue monitoring the project to ensure quality work.\n\nBubi Rural District Council Ward 8 Councillor Ignatius Khabo said the Second Republic has shown commitment to rehabilitating the road.\n\nWe are pleased with the work being done. This road has been in a poor state for years, making travel difficult for both motorists and businesses. We urge the Government to extend rehabilitation efforts to other sections of the road as well, he said.\n\nThe rehabilitation of the Bulawayo-Nkayi Road is expected to boost economic activities, as the route serves as a crucial link between Bulawayo, Matabeleland North, and parts of the Midlands.\n\nMatabeleland North Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister, Richard Moyo, said the Government will no longer tolerate shoddy work as it moves ahead with the rehabilitation of major roads in the region.\n\nMinister Richard Moyo\n\nIn addition to the Bulawayo-Nkayi Road rehabilitation, which has once more gained momentum with work being done on a 10km section just after Ingwingwizi Bridge in Bubi District towards Nkayi, more funds will be released soon for two major roads, he said.\n\nThe rehabilitation of the Bulawayo-Tsholotsho and Bulawayo-Victoria Falls roads are priority projects that the Government is keen to resume.\n\nThe Bulawayo-Nkayi Road had been in disrepair for years, causing significant inconveniences for motorists and impacting the local economy.\n\nWork by the contractor, who is rehabilitating a 23km stretch of road along the Bulawayo-Nkayi Road, will be assessed by engineers from the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development to determine if it is quality work, said Minister Moyo.\n\nIf the engineers are satisfied, then the Government will release more funds for another 23km to be rehabilitated. The rehabilitation of the Bulawayo-Nkayi Road will continue in this manner until it is completed, as the Government will no longer tolerate substandard work.\n\nMinister Moyo reaffirmed President Mnangagwas vision of accelerating infrastructure development in line with the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), the Governments 2021-2025 economic blueprint, which prioritises infrastructure as a catalyst for investment and business growth.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nThe rehabilitation of the Bulawayo-Nkayi Road will not only improve mobility for local communities but also create opportunities for businesses and investors. Well-maintained road infrastructure is essential for economic expansion in the region, he said.\n\nThe Bulawayo-Nkayi and Bulawayo-Tsholotsho roads fall under the Department of Roads and the Road Fund, while RIDA is mainly responsible for feeder roads within rural district councils. Feeder roads are a critical component of the Governments rural industrialisation and development strategy.\n\nThe capacitation of RIDA through a US$75 million loan facility will enable the aggressive rehabilitation and upgrading of rural road infrastructure, including opening up new arteries in underserved areas.\n\nUnder the Second Republic, the Government is scaling up the rehabilitation of major roads across the country as a key enabler of business viability and investment attraction.\n\n",

It was also his first hat-trick in Bosso colours.\n\nThe game got off to a fast start.In the second minute, a brilliant cross from Mason Mushore found Melikhaya Ncube inside the box and the midfielder made no mistake, heading the ball past Kwekwe goalkeeper Elton Nechirwe, to give the hosts the lead.\n\nHighlanders were relentless in their pursuit of a second goal, and it came in the 15th minute. After a dazzling solo run into the box, MaNinja was brought down by a Kwekwe United defender, earning a penalty for the home side.\n\nMason Mushore\n\nThe Bosso forward stepped up to take the spot-kick and sent Nechirwe the wrong way, doubling his sides lead.The match took a significant turn in the 26th minute when Kwekwe Uniteds goalkeeper, Nechirwe, was sent off for handling the ball outside the penalty area to deny Reason Sibanda a clear goal-scoring opportunity.\n\nThe visitors were reduced to 10 men and Highlanders capitalised on that, continuing to dominate possession and pressing for more goals.\n\nOn the stroke of half-time, MaNinja completed his brace.McKinnon Mushore played a perfectly timed pass through to Brighton, who finished with composure into the bottom right corner, extending Highlanders lead to 3-0.\n\nIt was a fitting end to a dominant first-half performance from Bosso.In the second half, Highlanders showed no signs of letting up.\n\nIn the 68th minute, Brighton completed his hat-trick, converting his second penalty of the day. The referee awarded the penalty after Sibanda was brought down inside the box.\n\nBrighton stepped up once again, keeping his cool and sending the goalkeeper the wrong way to seal a 4-0 victory for Highlanders.\n\nKelvin Kaindu\n\nBosso coach Kelvin Kaindu was delighted with the victory.Looking at how difficult it was in terms of preparation, I think it was a positive response. We managed to score four and keep a clean sheet. We looked a bit stable, we didnt allow the opponents to create those chances. We relaxed a bit when they were a man down; we allowed them to play in midfield, but what is positive is we had a bit of flair, and we are seeing signs of improvement from the first game.\n\nHaving a player score three goals is a positive for us. Even last year, MaNinja played an important role in producing a top goal scorer. He has started positively, and for him to score three goals when he is not yet 100 percent fit is a positive development. He only started training last week, said Kaindu.\n\nKwekwe United coach Saul Chaminuka, felt his team had a slow start to the game.We started the game slowly. We could have conceded more, said Chaminuka.With a numerical disadvantage, Kwekwe United struggled to mount a serious challenge.

Equality. Empowerment, serves as a powerful reminder of the work that remains to be done.\n\nMinister Monica Mutsvangwa\n\nDespite significant progress, women and girls in Zimbabwe still face considerable barriers to their full potential  ranging from discriminatory laws and societal norms to limited access to essential resources such as education, healthcare and economic opportunities.\n\nHowever, Minister Mutsvangwa highlighted the achievements made so far, noting how the Government has implemented various policies aimed at promoting gender equality, including constitutional guarantees of equal rights for women and men.Empowering women, especially in rural communities, is not just a moral obligation but a strategic necessity.\n\nThe Government recognises that the key to addressing issues like poverty, hunger, and illiteracy lies in the economic and social inclusion of women.\n\nMinister Monica Mutsvangwa tours stands at the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender- Based Violence\n\nInitiatives that have already made a profound impact include training rural women on climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as providing them with access to renewable energy sources such as solar power.These efforts have been transformative, reducing the health risks associated with traditional cooking methods and improving access to clean water and sustainable agriculture.\n\nAdditionally, womens financial empowerment is a cornerstone of Zimbabwes development strategy.Through microfinance institutions and funds such as the Zimbabwe Women Development Fund and Womens Microfinance Bank, women are gaining access to affordable loans that enable them to become successful entrepreneurs.This, in turn, drives local economic growth and strengthens communities.\n\nUnited Nations Development Fund\n\nThe international community, including the United Nations and the European Union, has also praised Zimbabwes progress, while emphasising the need for continued effort.\n\nSwedish Ambassador to Zimbabwe Per Lindgrde, highlighted that despite advancements, gender-based violence remains a significant challenge, urging a united effort to eradicate it.\n\nAs Zimbabwe celebrated International Womens Day, it is clear that the countrys progress in empowering rural women is not only a moral victory but a vital step towards achieving sustainable, inclusive development.\n\nHowever, this momentum must continue, ensuring that no woman or girl is left behind.\n\n",

            "content": "Showbiz ReporterMURUMBA Pitch, the acclaimed South African Amapiano duo consisting of Thabang Innocent Mangolo and Emmanuel Nanga Mathye, has officially split.\n\nThe duo announced their separation last week, stating in a joint statement that they had mutually agreed to end their partnership and contractual relationship, effective immediately.\n\nKnown for their soulful melodies and collaborations, Murumba Pitch made a significant impact on the Amapiano scene with hits such as Wena Dali, Hamba Juba and Uyeke. Their music resonated across the continent, with Zimbabweans among those who enjoyed their electrifying performances.\n\nFounded in Limpopo, South Africa, Murumba Pitch was originally established in 2012 by Venda music producer and rapper Chifo Charge, who later handed over leadership to Emmanuel Mathye in 2013.\n\nWhile the duo did not disclose specific reasons for their split, they said that the decision was mutual and aimed at allowing each member to pursue solo careers and new opportunities in the music industry.\n\nIt is with great sadness that we announce, following a meeting held on 6 March, Innocent and Emmanuel have reached a mutual decision to terminate their partnership and contractual relationship with immediate effect.\n\nThis decision marks a new chapter, and both parties are committed to moving forward independently, focusing on new opportunities and future endeavours. Both parties have agreed that a formal media statement would be released to inform the public of this development.\n\nAdditionally, the parties will be working together to ensure a fair and amicable settlement regarding the division of business interests in the Murumba Pitch brand. We thank you for your understanding and appreciate your support during this transition, it was communicated in a statement.\n\nThe announcement has been met with sadness on social media, as fans had high hopes for the duos future.\n\nOver the weekend, Mangolo reassured fans and promoters that upcoming performances would still go ahead as planned.\n\nIm no longer working with my former partner, Emmanuel Nanga Mathye, at Murumba Pitch, but were still active and making waves in the streets. I want to assure those who have booked us for future performances not to worry  well still be there and were bringing new music soon.\n\nWell also be launching new handles on Facebook and Instagram, though our YouTube and TikTok accounts will retain the same name, so dont worry, were here.Murumba Pitch joins a list of celebrated African musical duos that have split due to personal differences, creative conflicts, financial disputes, or individual ambitions.\n\nOne of Zimbabwes most beloved duos, Afrika Revenge, featuring Willis Wataffi and Mehluli Taz Moyo, gained prominence in the early 2000s with hits like Wanga, Anochengeta and Usazondisiya, before splitting in 2007. Though they never publicly disclosed the reasons for their breakup, speculation pointed to creative differences and individual ambitions. Both artistes pursued solo careers, but their chemistry as Afrika Revenge was difficult to replicate.\n\nThey briefly reunited for performances, including one in 2014, but the magic of their early days never fully returned. Many believe they could have reached greater heights had they stayed together.\n\nThe Nigerian twin duo, Peter and Paul Okoye, split in 2017 due to family disputes and business disagreements. Their solo efforts never matched their collective success. They later reconciled and reunited in 2021, but it was never the same.\n\nThe hip-hop/R&B group, once considered Kenyas future in music, disbanded around 2013 as members pursued individual careers. Despite attempts at solo ventures, none matched the groups initial impact.\n\nSouth Africas most beloved Afro-pop band, Mafikizolo, consisting of Nhlanhla Nciza and Theo Kgosinkwe, temporarily split in the early 2000s after the passing of third member Tebogo Madingoane. They later reunited and produced hits like Khona, proving that some duos work best together.\n\nAnother South African group, Malaika, featuring Bongani Nchang, Jabulani Ndaba (late), and Matshediso Tshedi Mholo, dominated the Afro-pop scene in the early 2000s with hits like Destiny, Mhla Uphel Amandla and Sebakanyana. Internal conflicts emerged in 2008 and Ndabas passing in 2013 further led to their decline. The remaining members never achieved the same success as a duo.\n\nThe split of Murumba Pitch marks a major moment in the Amapiano scene. As both members embark on solo careers, fans and the music industry will watch closely to see if they can replicate their past success. Whether they will follow in the footsteps of P-Square and reunite, or remain apart like Afrika Revenge, remains to be seen.\n\n",
