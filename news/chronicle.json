Any certificate he may present claiming to be from Unisa is fraudulent.\n\nThe university also categorically denied Magayas claim of receiving an honorary doctorate.\n\nUnisa has never conferred any honorary doctorate upon Mr Magaya. We strongly condemn this false assertion.\n\nUnisa expressed alarm at the damage such misinformation could cause to its reputation and emphasised that it would take the necessary legal steps to address the situation.\n\nWe believe that conduct of this nature damages and brings our brand into disrepute, and we reserve the right to take appropriate corrective action, reads the statement.\n\nThe university further confirmed that relevant authorities have been instructed to initiate legal proceedings against those spreading false claims about the institutions affiliation with Magaya.\n\n",

The two are facing a separate charge of possessing the copper cables without a licence.\n\nThe apprehension of Ntonga and Chamhudze led to the discovery of the theft they committed with the other accused persons at the Richmond substation.\n\nThe eight briefly appeared before Bulawayo Regional Magistrate Mr Joseph Mabeza, charged with violating The Electricity Act. They were remanded in custody until tomorrow.\n\nFor the State, Mr Dominic Moyo stated that on 25 January, the eight accused hatched a plan to steal the copper cables from the ZETDC Glenville substation in Richmond.\n\nAt around 8 PM, they proceeded there and, upon arrival, used a ladder to break into the station. While inside, they used a hacksaw and a bolt cutter to cut the 60 metres of 185 mm three-core armoured copper cable that was installed to distribute electricity from the substation to Richmond suburb, said Mr Moyo.\n\nThe eight dragged the cables out of the substation and made off with them.\n\nOn the morning of 27 January, Ntonga and Chamhudze were caught with burnt armoured copper cables after police requested to search their Toyota Hilux at Ages Industrial Solutions near Kelvin West.\n\nThe cables weighed 198 kilograms at Zimpost. An engineer from ZETDC discovered that the cables were the companys property used in the distribution of electricity.\n\nThe total cut and burnt armoured copper cables are valued at US$283,000, said Mr Moyo.\n\nThe police recovered the overhead cables, the car, a makeshift ladder, and a bolt cutter, which will be presented in court as evidence.\n\n",

It addresses 12 key areas, she said.\n\nThe HeForShe solidarity march is a significant initiative that highlights the crucial involvement of men in our shared efforts to attain gender equality and eliminate gender-based violence (GBV). GBV is a widespread problem that demands the active participation of everyone, especially men and boys, she said.\n\nThe minister urged stakeholders to join hands in eradicating gender inequality.\n\nTogether, we must challenge societal norms that perpetuate violence and create environments where women and girls can navigate public spaces with confidence and dignity, free from fear.\n\nWhile the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence is celebrated each year from November 25 to December 10, conducting this initiative today reflects our understanding that the fight against GBV is not confined to a specific timeframe, she said.\n\nThe minister stressed that in 2021, the Government of Zimbabwe committed to ending GBV by officially launching the first-ever High-Level Political Compact (HLPC) on Ending Gender-Based Violence and Harmful Practices (2021-2030).\n\nThe incoming #HeForShe co-chair, Canadian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Adler Aristide said they are committed to providing more support for the advancement of gender equality in Zimbabwe.\n\nI see it as an opportunity for me to commit to promoting gender equality in all spaces, both physical and online, that I have access to by virtue of my position as the Ambassador of Canada, he said.\n\n",
