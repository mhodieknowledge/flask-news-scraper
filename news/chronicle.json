This decision places the country among a growing number of nations worldwide that have chosen to eliminate the death penalty.In a statement, the EU hailed the development as a significant step forward.\n\nThe European Union welcomes the abolition of the death penalty in Zimbabwe. With this historic step, Zimbabwe joins the majority of countries in the world having eliminated capital punishment. Zimbabwe had maintained a moratorium on the death penalty since the last execution in 2005, read part of the statement.The EU said death penalty is incompatible with the fundamental right to life, describing it as a cruel and inhumane punishment that denies human dignity.\n\nThe death penalty is incompatible with the inalienable right to life and a cruel and inhuman punishment, representing an unacceptable denial of human dignity and integrity. No compelling evidence exists to show that it serves as a deterrent to crime, while any miscarriages of justice are irreversible, the statement added\n\nThe European bloc reaffirmed its staunch opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances and pledged to continue advocating for its abolition in countries where it remains in force.Zimbabwes decision to abolish the death penalty is widely regarded as a progressive move that aligns the country with global human rights standards. It underscores a commitment to upholding the sanctity of life and fostering a justice system rooted in rehabilitation rather than retribution.\n\n",

In Bulawayo, where residents have been grappling with acute water shortages, many have turned to water harvesting to ease their challenges.\n\nIn an advisory issued yesterday, MSD forecast heavier rainfall from yesterday until Saturday.\n\nMeteorological Services Department\n\nAn abundance of moisture in the atmosphere, brought by a cloud system, has been causing rainfall across the country since late December 2024 and continues into January 2025. Matabeleland North, northern areas of Midlands, Harare Metropolitan, northern parts of Manicaland, and all Mashonaland Provinces are expected to receive scattered thunder showers from 5-8 January 2025, read the statement.\n\nThe MSD said on Wednesday evening, additional moisture from the south-east coast of Southern Africa would result in cloudy, windy, and cold conditions over Matabeleland South, Masvingo, and Manicaland Provinces.\n\nBy Friday, January 10, the rain showers are expected to intensify in the southern parts of Mashonaland West, Mashonaland East, and Harare Metropolitan Provinces, with rainfall exceeding 50mm in 24 hours, the statement continued.\n\nMSD warned of potential flooding, even in areas where heavy rains might not have occurred, as floods could result from rainfall upstream. Violent storms may cause trees to fall, rooftops to be blown off, and billboards to collapse due to strong winds.\n\nNational police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi\n\nThe department advised the public to secure rooftops and properties, avoid parking vehicles under trees, refrain from standing under trees or being the tallest object to prevent lightning strikes and avoid using outdoor heavy machinery during storms.\n\nSeveral incidents have already been reported this rainy season. On December 23, a bus crossing the flooded Mletshane River in Gwanda District, Matabeleland South, missed a submerged bridge and was swept away, killing one person, with a three-month-old baby still missing.\n\nLast Friday, two people drowned in Lupane, Matabeleland North, while attempting to cross the flooded Tshangane River.\n\nNational police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi, urged the public to adhere to safety measures to prevent further loss of life.\n\nWe encourage parents to be vigilant and ensure children do not play near water bodies, trenches, or rivers, as this poses a drowning risk. Parents should be proactive in ensuring the safety of their children, he said.\n\nComm Nyathi also cautioned motorists against attempting to cross flooded rivers or submerged bridges.\n\nMotorists, cart drivers, and pedestrians must exercise extreme caution. We might be conducting awareness campaigns with stakeholders, but everyone must play their part in ensuring safety during this rainy season, he said. @nqotshili\n\n",

            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza,[emailprotected]\n\nTHE heavy downpours that continue to drench Zimbabwe have become both a blessing and a curse for residents of Rangemore suburb in Umguza District on the outskirts of Bulawayo.\n\nResidents are grappling with the dual realities of life-saving rains and the havoc they wreak on their poorly planned settlement.\n\nWhile the rains bring much-needed relief for water supplies and agriculture, they have turned roads into muddy quagmires and left some homes partially submerged, raising concerns about the structural integrity of properties in the area. Rangemore is home to many residents who work or run businesses in Bulawayo. Some students at local tertiary institutions also commute daily to the city, making road access critical. However, the persistent rains have rendered many roads in the sprawling suburb impassable, causing frustration and disruptions.\n\nUmguza RDC Ward 17 Councillor Garikai Godwill Mhazo whose ward covers Rangemore suburb stretching to West Acre along Bulawayo-Plumtree Road, acknowledged the residents plight, citing limited control over some of the affected roads.\n\nMajor roads from Rangemore leading to other suburbs such as Nkulumane and Emganwini are under the jurisdiction of Umguza Rural District Council (RDC), and we consistently maintain those roads, he said.\n\nHowever, smaller roads leading to residents homes are still under the control of land developers or plot owners. Until these roads are officially handed over to the council, there is little we can do.\n\nClr Mhazo said the roads are inaccessible, especially during the rainy season.\n\nWe are aware that residents are not happy with the situation. Umguza RDC will continue to maintain the roads under its control, he said.\n\nFor residents like Mrs Noma Mhlanga, the rains have brought mixed blessings.\n\nThe rains are vital for drinking water and crops, but they also make life difficult. Walking less than half a kilometre to the main road to catch transport to work becomes a nightmare after heavy rains, she said.\n\nHaving lived in Rangemore for seven years, Mrs Mhlanga observed that the situation has worsened with each rainy season.\n\nThe dust road leading to the tarred main road gets so muddy making it almost impossible to walk out of the house, she said.\n\nMr Givemore Muneti, another resident, described how his yard turns into a pool of water during downpours.\n\nThere are no storm-water drainage systems here, so the rainwater has nowhere to flow. Ive resorted to using buckets to collect water from my yard and throw it into the streets, he said.\n\nCllr Mhazo explained that while the council is working on constructing storm-water drainage systems along major roads, the smaller roads remain the responsibility of private developers.\n\nThe challenges faced by Rangemore residents mirror those in other areas, such as Cowdray Parks Hlalani Kuhle/Garikai section, where perennial flooding has forced the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) to take drastic measures.\n\nTo address flooding in Cowdray Park, BCC has identified 17 properties for demolition to make way for a storm-water drainage system. These properties include completed homes, undeveloped stands, and houses at various construction stages. Some of the affected homes are over 15 years old.\n\nAffected residents have expressed frustration, citing a lack of clear communication and concerns over compensation.\n\nUrban flooding is a growing challenge in Zimbabwe, exacerbated by construction in wetlands and floodplains. Impervious surfaces such as roads, parking lots, and buildings prevent rainwater from seeping into the ground, causing even small amounts of rainfall to result in flooding.\n\nFor Rangemore residents like Mr Muneti, the fear of future displacement looms large.\n\nWho knows what will happen in 10 or 20 years? Maybe we will also be told to vacate our homes to make way for storm-water drainage systems, just like the residents of Cowdray Park, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "The prolonged dry spell since November was getting us worried over this farming season.\n\nThe early crop was suffering substantial moisture stress while the southern parts of the country hadnt received any meaningful rainfall. The country actually experienced a two-week heatwave early last month.\n\nMeteorologists had, in August, correctly forecast normal to below-normal rainfall between October to December and normal to above normal rainfall between January and March this year, but, as we broiled, we all forgot that prognosis. We were beginning to lose hope in the performance of the entire season.\n\nThe festive period, however, brought with it heavy rainfall in most of the country, with fears that they may be much heavier this week to cause flooding.\n\nThe falls have settled our nerves and we are now hopeful that what we thought was yet another drought would turn out to be a successful agricultural season. Last summer was a failure  just 635 000 tonnes of maize harvested versus national annual consumption of about 1,8 million tonnes of the staple.\n\nDespite the initial dryness, farmers had, by the end of last week, planted 1,4 million hectares (ha) of maize, 322606ha of traditional grains and 85 000ha of tobacco. Government has a target of producing over 3,2 million tonnes of cereals this season to ensure national food security.\n\nWe continue to pray that the rains will continue falling so that the crop already in the ground regains its shape and thrives so that come March, the country will reap big.\n\nThat wetness should help pastures regenerate as well, particularly in Matabeleland South as well as the southern parts of Masvingo, Manicaland and Midlands provinces.\n\nUnfortunately, the high rainfall such as we are experiencing brings with it some headaches. As field crops and grazing thrive; weeds, diseases and pests do likewise.\n\nAs such, farmers need to be more vigilant against any pest and disease infestation. They must invest more in weed control through application of herbicides and or mechanical and manual weeding. They must ensure that they are well stocked with pesticides as well, to tackle, especially the ravenous armyworm.\n\nFurthermore, farmers have to be on the lookout for January disease. On this score, we know that farmers always need to work well in advance by vaccinating and regularly dipping their cattle right across the year. Those who have been doing this are not worried by this wet spell.\n\nAs we report elsewhere today, the Meteorological Services Department yesterday predicted heavier rainfall until Saturday, with a possibility of flooding. The warning has come early enough thus we hope authorities and the public are vigilant, ready to promptly and appropriately respond if flooding occurs so that lives and property are saved.\n\n",

Its the first of its kind in the country, with mentorship and support from Wits University in South Africa, in addition to our local mentors, said Dr Dzvanga.\n\nThis two-year programme is not only designed to improve emergency patient care at Mpilo Central Hospital but also across the country. We have recruited staff from all corners of Zimbabwe, and as the number of trained professionals grows, we are confident more lives will be saved, he added.\n\nDr Dzvanga said the hospital seeks to tap into the skills from mentorship from the Wits University which is expected to provide material and human capital training.\n\nThe diploma curriculum includes training in patient management during air transport, aligning with the Governments Air Ambulance initiative launched last year. The service operates six helicopters stationed in Harare, Bulawayo, Victoria Falls, and Manicaland, providing emergency medical support nationwide.\n\nThe air ambulance service was launched in Zimbabwe in August in conjunction with the 44th SADC summit.\n\nThese specialised helicopters are equipped with advanced medical facilities and staffed by trained medical personnel. They are designed to overcome geographical barriers and provide the same level of medical care available in an intensive care unit.\n\nThe Second Republic has embarked on a mission to modernise the countrys healthcare system to achieve the goal of becoming a modern, prosperous, and industrialised country by 2030.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa visited Russia in June to seek investors to establish an air ambulance service.\n\nWith an air ambulance based at United Bulawayo Hospitals and this new diploma, we are better positioned to save more lives. Part of their curriculum is that nurses are learning how to manage patients in the air, said Dr Dzvanga.\n\nIm looking forward to good results. As the programme grows, we aim to increase student intake to meet national needs.\n\nZimbabwe experiences a high frequency of road traffic accidents, with incidents occurring every 15 minutes and five fatalities recorded daily.\n\nDr Dzvanga noted that the programme is critical for equipping medical professionals with advanced skills to handle various types of accidents.\n\nWhile all doctors and nurses have basic training in accident and emergency care, this programme takes it a step further, aligning with international best practices. It prepares our staff to handle any accident, whether its a fall, car crash, or domestic assault, he explained.\n\nThe programme has 20 students, but Dr Dzvanga expressed hope that other central hospitals will adopt similar initiatives to broaden its impact.\n\nThis is just the beginning. Its like planting a seed and you dont expect to harvest your seed immediately. The programme is only a few months old, and students are still in the theoretical phase and are yet to come to the casualty to practise what they are learning, he said.\n\nMy goal is to see two intakes per year and other central hospitals offering this diploma so that we can create a real impact. With only 20 professionals for the entire country, its a drop in the ocean.\n\nDr Dzvanga said expanding the programme is essential to ensure that every corner of Zimbabwe benefits from improved emergency care.\n\nHe said the introduction of the diploma marks a significant step in addressing the countrys emergency healthcare challenges and underscores Mpilo Central Hospitals commitment to enhancing patient outcomes through innovation and collaboration.@nqotshili\n\n",

Last year, the team broke a 35-year jinx when it finished at the top of the standings to make history for itself.\n\nIt became the third team from Matabeleland North to qualify to play in the Premiership since Independence. Before only Hwange sponsored by the Colliery and Tsholotsho have been the provinces flag bearers at that level.\n\nIn the 1970s, when there was a regional First Division under the Rhodesia National Football League, Gwayi River Mine, Kamativi and Wankie played at the highest level.\n\nOn December 24 last year, Xolani Nyoni who is the workers committee chairman and his secretary, Mary Dube in a letter, referenced XN/md/2024, wrote to the companys executive chairman, Sydney Gata, who heads the holding company, Zesa on the matter.\n\nThey wanted to clear the air following reports that Fifa Club Licensing rules would not permit ZPC Hwange to play in the Premiership since there is already another club from the group.\n\nZPC Kariba whom the hydro electric plant in Kariba sponsors are playing in the Premiership.\n\nIt is not the first time two teams from the same organisation play in the Premiership as previously Tenax and Whawha both belonging to Zimbabwe Correctional Services have had a dance in the Premiership as has teams from the Defence Forces, Black Rhinos and Cranborne Barracks.\n\nAt one time there was also Blue Swallows and Chapungu from the Airforce of Zimbabwe. Writing to Gata, the workers committee said theirs was a plea regarding the future of the club.\n\nAs you are aware our beloved team has faced significant hurdles, particularly surrounding Fifa Article 18 of the Fifa Club Lincensing Regulations. This regulation has created barriers that are preventing our team from registering and participating in the PSL. We believe that with your esteemed support, we can legally resolve this impasse and enable our young stars to showcase their talents in the 2025 season.\n\nFor 34 long years, our community has poured its heart and soul into supporting ZPC Hwange Football Club. We have faced failures, but we have never given up. Our team is not just a group of players. It represents hope, pride, entertainment and recreation for Zesa, ZPC and Hwange community. The teams existence is integral to our collective identity and spirit, said the workers in their letter.\n\nZPC Hwange, if allowed to participate, will fill the void left by Hwange FC who were relegated for the umpteenth time.\n\nThe workers said if not allowed to play there would be a devastating effect in the community and clubs spirits and the companys corporate social responsibility.For years, sport and especially soccer has been the number one entertainment activity in the mining and power producing town.\n\nThe thermal power station in the coal mining town has sponsored ZPC Hwange. They implored Gatas office to find a solution to their fears.\n\nWe humbly request your assistance in finding a way, through legal channels, to allow our team to compete in the PSL, for at least one season. This opportunity would allow us to demonstrate just how important this team is to us and how it deeply resonates within our community, said the workers.\n\nGata, in his response on December 30 last year, referred the letter to the organisations Group Legal Advisor and Corporate Secretary for direction in a letter whose reference is SZG/30/12/24. Gata congratulated the team for winning promotion.\n\nI have learnt with utmost pride of the promotion of ZPC Hwange Football Club into the Premier Soccer League after many years of commitment and dedication to the sport.\n\nThe team exemplifies the true Zesa fighting spirit and we hope it will continue to showcase their talents and bring pride to both Zesa and the nation. I kindly request that you engage all relevant stakeholders to explore ways to support the teams aspirations, wrote Gwata in his letter to the legal department.\n\nWith Gatas support the team looks likely to play Premiership football as they can argue that the thermal plant is an entity of its own just like Kariba.Hwange FC are believed to be following proceedings with keen interest hoping to buy the franchise.\n\nFears are that even if the Colliery side buys it, they will still be relegated this season unless they engage in self-introspection and review what has made them the most relegated side.\n\n",

With Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) tourism anchoring growth, the Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry plans to build on this momentum.Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister, Barbara Rwodzi, outlined several strategies during a visit to Victoria Falls just before Christmas. Chief among these is an aggressive marketing campaign to position Zimbabwe as a premier travel destination.\n\nThere are a number of strategies, and number one among them is marketing. Roadshows are key for us, and you will see us conducting many in our key markets. We will also increase our presence in international media and build stronger relationships with journalists, she said.\n\nMinister Rwodzi said competitions for journalists will be introduced to encourage coverage of their roadshows, articles and TV features.\n\nMinister Barbara Rwodzi\n\nThe ministry has already deployed tourism attachs to 11 key source markets and plans to send six more in 2025. Locally, tourism officers will be stationed at ports of entry to promote the country as a hospitable, friendly and peaceful destination.\n\nMinister Rwodzi emphasised the importance of participating in international and regional tourism conferences, particularly those with a direct impact on the sectors growth.\n\nOne of the key milestones for the industry in 2024 was hosting the inaugural United Nations Tourism Regional Forum on Gastronomy Tourism for Africa in Victoria Falls in July last year. This event also paved the way for Zimbabwe to host the UN Tourism Gastronomy School, which will be built in Victoria Falls, further solidifying the countrys status as a global tourism destination.\n\nMinister Rwodzi attributed the sectors success to President Mnangagwas engagement and re-engagement policy, as well as the Zimbabwe is Open for Business approach.\n\nThese initiatives have attracted global personalities and celebrities, particularly to Victoria Falls, for both leisure and business.\n\nGovernments Tourism Growth and Recovery Strategy, introduced in 2020 to restore the sector to pre-Covid-19 levels, continues to guide these efforts. The country has attracted key personalities and celebrities from around the world who have visited particularly Victoria Falls for holiday and business.\n\nMinister Rwodzi said her ministry is committed to marketing destination Zimbabwe through all available channels, adding that the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) will intensify efforts to attract more visitors in 2025. @ncubeleon\n\n",

The adjustments reportedly stemmed from the council using an incorrect formula to index 2022 and 2023 tariffs to the US dollar.\n\nZimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC)\n\nIn early December, the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works convened a meeting at the council chambers to address concerns raised by the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI), the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC), and two major residents associations. The meeting, chaired by the ministrys director of local authorities inspectorate, Ms Priscillar Mudzinge, resolved to establish a budget review committee.\n\nThe committee comprises representatives from industry, residents associations (Bulawayo Residents Association, Bulawayo Progressive Residents Association, and Residents Chapter), tourism players, and tertiary institutions. Chaired by Residents Chapter chairperson Mr Thamsanqa Ndlovu, the committee was tasked with revising the budget within a week and presenting it by January 7.\n\nFollowing a progress review meeting on December 30, 2024, Mr Ndlovu revealed that a technical team of experts in statistics, mathematics, computer science, and accounting had been selected to analyse the councils financials, budgets, and tariffs.\n\nHowever, the councils failure to provide all the requested information hindered the teams work.\n\nDr Martin Rushwaya\n\nAt the special committee progress review meeting on December 30, 2024, the technical team reported that some requested information is still outstanding. Council representative committed to providing the necessary information by December 31, 2024, with the rest on January 6, 2025, said Mr Ndlovu.\n\nDue to the pending information, the technical team wont be able to meet the initial deadline of January 7. A revised target date for completing the review process will be announced once the outstanding information is received.\n\nThe revised budget will reportedly be based on 2017 tariffs.\n\nIn September 2024, BCC presented a US$309 million budget for 2025, focusing on service delivery, gender-specific projects, and revitalising recreational facilities.\n\nHowever, the Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet, Dr Martin Rushwaya, directed the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works not to approve the budget until concerns raised by the business community regarding the 2024 budget were addressed.\n\nMinister Judith Ncube\n\nHe stressed the need for the council to engage with the business community, noting that the concerns raised by CZI were invaluable and required urgent attention.\n\nCZI Matabeleland Chamber accused BCC of using an incorrect formula under Statutory Instrument (51) 1184 of 2022, which mandates indexing goods and services prices to the US dollar and converting them to local currency using the prevailing bank rate.\n\nThis miscalculation led to exorbitant charges, prompting some companies in Bulawayo to reduce operating hours or relocate to other cities.\n\nDespite numerous meetings involving CZI, BCC officials, and Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube, no resolution was reached, resulting in a stalemate.\n\n",
