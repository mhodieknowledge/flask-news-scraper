The OR Tambo International Airport and Beitbridge recorded the highest volumes of traffic.\n\nBeitbridge, the busiest inland port, sees an average of 15,000 crossings daily during off-peak periods, with the number tripling during peak seasons. The border is a key transit point for travellers from Botswana, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Zambia, Angola, Tanzania, Malawi, and Zimbabwe.\n\nStarting with immigration matters, the BMA facilitated the legitimate movement of approximately 5,084,251 travellers across our 71 ports of entry during this festive period, said the BMA.\n\nThis figure represents an increase of 51,680 travellers compared to the 2023/2024 festive period. However, it remains lower than the pre-COVID-19 figure of about 6 million travellers.\n\nDuring this festive period, OR Tambo International Airport facilitated the majority of travellers at 1,065,636, followed by the Beitbridge land port of entry to Zimbabwe at 645,590 travellers, and then the Lebombo land port of entry to Mozambique at 571,131.\n\nThe BMA also reported processing over 395,189 private vehicles, 12,974 minibus taxis, and 6,071 buses through its movement control system during the same period.\n\nThe majority of travellers used the OR Tambo International Airport, Beitbridge, Lebombo, Kopfontein, Oshoek, Cape Town International Airport, Maseru Bridge, Ficksburg, Cape Town Harbour, and Durban Harbour. According to the BMA, these top ten ports facilitated approximately 3,964,122 travellers, accounting for the majority of all movements. The remaining 33% were processed through the other 61 ports of entry across the country.\n\nOut of the total number of 58,938 processed trucks, 47,891 were processed for exports, while 11,047 were processed for imports, said the BMA.\n\nOf the trucks processed for export, 74% were cleared within 30 minutes, while 66% of those processed for imports were also cleared within 30 minutes. In this regard, Lebombo facilitated the majority of export trucks at about 18,544, while Beitbridge recorded the highest number of imports at 5,521 trucks.\n\n",

The South African government stated that any further attacks on its troops would be regarded as a declaration of war.\n\nIn a swift rebuttal, Rwandas President Kagame accused South Africa of acting as part of a belligerent force.\n\nHe claimed that South African troops were engaged in offensive combat operations to support the Congolese government in its fight against its own citizens.\n\nResultantly, tensions were high before last weeks SADC Summit in Harare, which mandated its Organ Troika on Politics, Defence and Security Co-operation to engage all state and non-state parties to the conflict on a ceasefire process to protect lives and facilitate a smooth flow of humanitarian support to people and communities affected by the armed conflict.\n\nThe Summit also urged Political and Diplomatic leaders who are parties to the conflict to engage in a co-ordinated effort of dialogue, including supporting the Luanda Process, Monusco and others, to restore peace and security in eastern DRC.\n\nSADC leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to the DRCs sovereignty, territorial integrity and long-term stability, pledging ongoing support for its development and security.\n\nLast week, the African Unions Peace and Security Council (PSC) at its 1256th Emergency Ministerial meeting on the Recent Developments in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), condemned the DRC conflict and called for adherence to the Luanda Process.\n\nUnder the Luanda Process, Angolan President Joo Manuel Gonalves Loureno has tried to broker peace between DRC President Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart, Kagame.\n\nSuch talks have, however, remained elusive, amid escalatory rhetoric and trading of accusations between the two leaders.\n\nThus, the summit, which will be held in Tanzania, offers a platform for both President Tshisekedi and President Kagame to meet directly with mediation from SADC and the EAC.\n\n",

            "content": "Ashley Phiri,[emailprotected]\n\nTHE Civil Registry Department has launched a mobile registration exercise targeting vulnerable children and child-headed families in St Peters, Robert Sinyoka, and Methodist Village in Ward 17, on the outskirts of Bulawayo.\n\nThe 10-day exercise, which commenced yesterday and will run until February 13, is in response to appeals made by residents during last years hearings conducted by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Defence, Home Affairs, Security Services and War Veterans Affairs. The hearings revealed that many residents in peri-urban areas lacked essential documentation, which hindered their access to education, healthcare and other social services.\n\nFor many undocumented children, the issue is generational, as their parents and grandparents also lack birth certificates and identity cards. Several families in these areas relocated from the Killarney squatter camp, where their documents were lost or destroyed.\n\nOn the first day of the exercise, teams from the Civil Registry Department set up at St Peters Primary School, where they identified 86 learners without birth certificates. These children are now being assisted in securing proper documentation, a move expected to empower them and their families by granting them access to their legal rights.\n\nPumula legislator, Ms Sichelesile Mahlangu, expressed gratitude to the Civil Registry Department and the Government for facilitating this critical initiative.\n\nThis registration drive is a direct response to the concerns raised by residents during public hearings last year. The people spoke, we listened, and we engaged the relevant authorities. We are grateful to the Civil Registry Department for responding to the call and coming to assist these communities, she said.\n\nMs Mahlangu noted that many of the affected children are orphans living with their grandparents or are part of child-headed households.\n\nThe response has been overwhelming, especially from child-headed families who often struggle with administrative hurdles. Many of these minors take on adult responsibilities at a young age and face challenges in providing for their siblings without proper identification documents, she said.\n\nMs Mahlangu said she is optimistic that at the end of the registration blitz, hundreds of children and families would have received critical identification documents, enabling them to access essential services and opportunities.\n\nSt Peters Village chairperson, Mr Reginald Mkhosana, welcomed the initiative, saying the documentation crisis has long plagued their community.\n\nIn our area, the lack of documentation is a major issue, particularly for child-headed families whose parents did not have documents themselves. We are grateful that the Government has not forgotten us and has taken steps to address this problem, he said.\n\nBeyond providing documentation, the mobile registration drive underscores the importance of inclusive governance and community support. Over the next several days, Civil Registry officials will be stationed at various locations to facilitate the registration process.\n\nThe teams will be at St Peters Primary School until Friday before moving to Robert Sinyoka Primary School on Saturday until next Monday.\n\nThey will then wrap up the exercise at Hyde Park Primary School from Tuesday to Thursday next week.\n\n",

            "content": "Sikhulekelani Moyo,[emailprotected]\n\nRESERVE Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has announced that it will widen its ongoing blitz on businesses across the country, defying the Government directive to accept the use of multicurrency, which also includes embracing the local currency, the ZiG, as a legal tender at the official rate when pricing products.\n\nThe operation, which was hitherto confined to Harare and its environs, will be extended to other provinces during the first quarter of the year as part of enforcing financial laws.\n\nThis comes at a time when some businesses in Bulawayo among other cities and towns, continue to defy Government directives to accept ZiG as the legal tender, with the informal sector, continuing to give flimsy excuses, among them network hurdles on their point-of-sale (POS) machines, forcing consumers to use foreign currency.\n\nZimbabwe Gold\n\nThe Statutory Instrument (SI) 81A of 2024, promulgated by the Government after the successful launch of the structured currency in April last year, compels businesses to use the official exchange rate when pricing products.\n\nAlso, in 2022, the Government gazetted SI 218 of 2023, which effectively extends the use of the multiple currency system to December 2030.\n\nHowever, regardless of all these statutory instruments, some businesses continue to frustrate consumers as they refuse to accept the local currency, with some businesses opting to accept it using the black-market rate, which erodes consumers purchasing power.\n\nIn an interview, RBZ Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu said when the Government enacts policies, it expects businesses and the general public to comply with the regulations.\n\nOn the financial side, these policies are enforced by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and other Government units that have instruments to deal with such malpractices.\n\nIt should be noted that FIU monitoring and compliance operations have hitherto been concentrated in Harare and its environs, but beginning the first quarter of 2025, the FIU is expanding its enforcement operations into Bulawayo and other provincial capital cities, said Dr Mushayavanhu.\n\nSome of the measures include heavy penalties for organisations that violate the exchange control regulations, and this will greatly improve compliance across the board. The FIU continues to urge the public to report issues of non-compliance, and they will swiftly respond as necessary.\n\nDr Mushayavanhu said in promoting compliance, efforts by the FIU are beginning to bear fruit as some areas witness increasing levels of compliance in the smaller shops that are now accepting the local currency.\n\nCompliance is a confidence issue, and the RBZ continues to refine its monetary policy to achieve and maintain price and exchange rate stability, and confidence will be restored in the transacting public, he said.\n\nRBZ\n\nDr Mushayavanhu noted that while the informal sector compliance levels are still far below the formal sector, it is encouraging to note that the trend is improving.\n\nThe Government is working towards increasing usage of local currency in all parts of the country including for settlement of taxes, purchase and sale of goods and services in local currency.\n\nIt is, however, important to take cognisance of the increased reliance on digital or electronic payment methods over cash, which has, to an extent, seen a reduction in the demand for cash and resultantly lower the proportion of cash in circulation to broad money, he said.\n\nDr Mushayavanhu said the foreign exchange market has been liberalised to reflect free market forces, adding that there should be no incentive for trading on the parallel market.\n\nIt has been noted that cases of exchange control-related violations have significantly declined over the last quarter of 2024, aligning with the exchange rate stability that has been obtained, he said.\n\nRBZ will continue to implement measures to augment the current stability and will remain mindful of balancing currency and price stability with economic growth.\n\nConsumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) director, Mrs Rose Mpofu, said the refusal by some shops to accept ZWG as legal tender is an offence as it violates consumers right to choose currencies to use.\n\nConsumer Council of Zimbabwe\n\nConsumers that are formally employed, especially those in the public sector, earning a portion of their incomes in the local currency are disadvantaged. It creates a huge demand and appetite for foreign currency thus pushing the alternative market rate high, and creating a lucrative market for the US dollar in the informal sector, she said.\n\nMrs Mpofu said the Government should build market confidence in ZiG acceptance by businesses, urging consumers to report any business unethical tendencies.\n\nIn a snap survey yesterday, the Chronicle news crew observed that some businesses in Bulawayo were refusing to accept the ZiG.\n\nWe are not accepting ZiG because our suppliers are refusing transactions in local currency, which makes it difficult for us to trade in ZiG, said an informal trader operating at the market\n\nSome selected foreign-owned shops and informal shops visited by the news crew in the city centre had displayed an exchange rate of US$1:28 ZWG, purportedly indicating that they accepted ZiG transactions.\n\nHowever, they had no POS machines preferring cash.\n\nConfederation of Zimbabwe Industries President Mr Denford Mutashu said it is illegal for retailers not to comply with exchange regulations.\n\nHowever, while most major retrial outlets are complying by accepting the ZiG, unfortunately, some have found the going tougher due to unfair competition from the informal shops, said Mr Mutashu.\n\n@SikhulekelaniM\n\n",

Our vision is to revolutionise the way people perceive jeans, transforming them from mere clothing into wearable art. We aim to blend vintage aesthetics with contemporary style, crafting unique pieces that resonate with the modern individual, Emkay Brizzy said.\n\nAs a designer, I rely on a combination of technical skills and creative expertise, which guide my design process. This includes pattern making, garment construction and texture manipulation, he said.\n\nEmkays passion for fashion began during his childhood, where he was captivated by how clothing could evoke emotions and tell stories. He draws inspiration from the vibrant colours, textures and patterns of his upbringing.\n\nHe is also influenced by the stories and emotions woven into the fabric of his community, ensuring his designs reflect not only his own journey but also resonate with others who share similar experiences.\n\nMy interest in fashion design was sparked by my childhood experiences and memories. I was always fascinated by the fact that clothes could convey emotions and narratives. I started experimenting with designs by creating my own clothing and accessories and soon realised that fashion was not just about aesthetics but also a form of self-expression and identity.\n\nFrom there, I began exploring different design techniques and seeking guidance from mentors in the industry. My journey as a fashion designer has been gradual, but it has always been driven by my passion for storytelling through fashion, he said.\n\nAccording to Emkay, Timeless Designs is a renowned apparel brand dedicated to creating exquisite pieces that transcend fleeting fashion trends.\n\nTo balance the creative and business aspects of running a fashion label, he prioritises tasks, focuses on one aspect at a time and surrounds himself with a talented team that supports both his creative and business endeavours.\n\nEmkay Brizzy design showcase by Video Vixen Nessa Nobz\n\nBy staying organised, delegating tasks effectively and trusting my instincts, I navigate the challenges of running a fashion label and keep the brand moving forward.\n\nRight now, we are focusing on expanding our denim line to include more sustainable, eco-friendly options.\n\nBesides his upcoming designs featuring bold and innovative denim pieces, Emkay also plans to collaborate with other designers and artistes to bring fresh perspectives and ideas to his brand.\n\n",

The surplus will be exported to improve on exports revenue generation and balance of payments, he said.\n\nSteel bars produced at Manhize Steel Plant\n\nCommenting on the development, Zimbabwe Building Contractors Association president, Dr Tinashe Manzungu, said production of rebars at Disco Manhize is a welcome development.\n\nWe are working to close the infrastructure gap as contractors and this requires huge capital outlay. Manufacturing such products locally will cut costs significantly thereby making the final products affordable, he said.\n\nDr Manzungu said in general, this development is going to drive capacity utilisation of industries.There has been an acute shortage of foreign currency to import raw materials such as what Disco Manhize is now producing, he said.\n\nZimbabwe Institute of Foundries chief operations officer Mr Dosman Mangisi said the manufacture of rebars will boost the construction industry.\n\n",
