This will boost a lifelong skills transfer programme and also help with the maintenance of the facilities by those trained by our teams, said Mr Ngundu.\n\nThe beneficiaries, including traditional leaders, war veterans, vulnerable members of the community, and ordinary villagers, are set to benefit from this initiative over the six-year implementation period.\n\nThis project is a key intervention expected to boost domestic productivity, create employment opportunities, and promote self-sustenance in our rural communities.\n\n",

The seized bottles had an estimated street value of US$200.\n\nIn addition to the cough syrup, police also discovered loose dagga weighing 556g hidden in the house, with a street value of US$100. Ndlovu was immediately arrested.\n\nBroncleer, commonly known as Bronco, is a codeine-based cough syrup often abused for its intoxicating effects. It has become a drug of choice among young people, leading authorities to intensify crackdowns on its illegal distribution.
