Chicken Inn had the first chance of note in the 17th minute when Xolani Ndlovu delivered a dangerous free kick into the box, but Mpumelelo Bhebhes header lacked the accuracy to test FC Platinum goalkeeper David Bizabani. Moments later, Godfrey Muchenje tried his luck from range, only to see his effort sail high and wide.\n\nFC Platinum had their own opportunities, with Ngwenya threatening in the 24th minute after a skilful turn saw him evade two defenders. However, Bernard Donovan was quick to close the space and made a crucial save to deny the forward.\n\nIn a blow to the visitors, FC Platinum were forced to make an early substitution when Shepherd Mhlanga was stretchered off after a knock, with Dylan Nchito replacing him in the 32nd minute. Chicken Inn had strong penalty claims in the 40th minute when Muza was seemingly fouled by Bizabani inside the box, but referee Mhaka Magare waved away the protests.\n\nA minute later, Elshamar Farasi came close to opening the scoring with a lobbed effort that sailed just over the bar as Bizabani was caught off his line.\n\nThe second half began with FC Platinum on the front foot, but Chicken Inn had their own chances. In the 49th minute, George Majika whipped in a dangerous cross, but Farasi could not direct his header on target. Oscar Bhebhe also came close with a powerful effort in the 62nd minute, but his shot was off target.\n\nJust when it seemed like Chicken Inn were heading for their first win of the season, disaster struck. In the 85th minute, FC Platinum equalised through Ngwenya after a mistake by goalkeeper Donovan. Brian Bandas weak shot was spilled by the keeper, and the rebound fell to Ngwenya, who calmly slotted home to make it 1-1.\n\nFC Platinum had another penalty appeal turned down in the 77th minute when Bhebhe was brought down inside the box by Lincoln Mangaira, but the referee remained unmoved.\n\nUltimately, the GameCocks were left to reflect on what could have been, as they failed to hold onto their slender lead and were forced to settle for a point. FC Platinum, on the other hand, will be satisfied with their resilience, snatching a share of the spoils.\n\nTeams\n\nChicken Inn:\n\nD Bernard, K Dzingwe, M Bhebhe, J Tulani, X Ndlovu, L Mangaira, E Farasi (G Mutungamiri 59), M Charamba (B Rendo 84), G Majika (W Vuwa 59), G Muchenje, B Muza (K Nyamutenga 81)\n\nFC Platinum:\n\nD Bizabani, B Nzori, N Nyasulu, M Ndlovu, B Banda, D Mhindirira (V Nyangulu 81), S Mhlanga (D Nchito 34), H Magaya, D Marowa (O Bhebhe 55), T Ngwenya (M Ngwenya 90), C Tshuma (J Selemani 55)\n\n",
