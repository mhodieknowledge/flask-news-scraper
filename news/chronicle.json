Spine-chilling images of the arrest show a grinning man\n\nA food delivery driver, Alaaeddin Alhalabi, 42, also from Syria , witnessed the knife rampage today from his car, and stopped the attacker\n\nThe attack in Austria comes after Farhad N., 24, injured at least 30 people, including a two-year-old child, when he ploughed his Mini Cooper through a demonstration in Munich on Thursday\n\nThe man believed to be behind Saturdays attack, Ahmad G., is a Syrian national with legal residence in Austria, according to police.

The president is now considering whether an alternative to a snap election is available.\n\nRailing against illegal immigration and pledging to increase deportations to countries likeSyriaandAfghanistan, which it is currently illegal to deport people to, are central to the Freedom Partys platform and appeal, and the party quickly seized on the Villach attack.\n\nWe need a rigorous crackdown on asylum and cannot continue to import conditions like those in Villach, Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl said in a statement.\n\nAccording to the Austrian Ministry of Interior, 24,941 foreigners applied for asylum in Austria in 2024.

In 2022, applications peaked at over 100,000, while approximately 59,000 individuals sought asylum in 2023.\n\nSeveral European countries, among them Austria, said in December they are suspending decisions on asylum claims by Syrian nationals because of the unclear political situation in their homeland following the fall of BasharAssad.\n\nPeter Kaiser, the governor of the Austrian province of Carinthia, spoke of Saturdays horrific attack in an X post this evening.\n\nThe unbelievable atrocity in Villach must have the harshest consequences! Anyone who lives in Carinthia, in Austria, must respect the law.

This Syrian migrant stabbed a 14 y/o Austrian boy to death and injured 5 others today in Villach, Austria,Vlaardingerbroeks tweet said.\n\nHe proudly smiles after the fact. I wasnt exaggerating when I said this happens daily in Europe: A one-sided civil war is waged on us Europeans, she added.\n\nIn a separate post, Musk retweeted an image of the grinning suspect and captioned it Terrible.\n\nSeparately on Saturday, Musk also backed far-right Alternative forGermanyparty, also known as AfD, after he retweeted a post from the political groups leader Alice Weidel.\n\nUS Vice President @JDVance calls for an end to the firewall! The Trump administration has also recognized that a migration turnaround can only be achieved with the AfD. Merz must now show whether he really wants an end to the deadly migration crisis. Therefore AfD!, Weidel tweeted.\n\nSharing her post, Musk commented: AfD!.\n\nWeidels remarks, which were reiterated by Musk, referred to US Vice PresidentJD Vance, who spoke at the Munich Security Conference on Friday.\n\nIn the lengthy anti-immigration speech, Vance attacked European leaders for their approach to migration.\n\nNo voter on this continent went to the ballot box to open the floodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants, he said.\n\nTurning to the UK, he added: You know what they did vote for in England? They voted forBrexitand, agree or disagree, they voted for it.\n\nThe knife attack comes just days after a 39 people were injured in Munich when a car rammed into a crowd of protestors\n\nObjects lying on the street at the scene in Munich, including a baby carriage\n\nAccording to Munich police, at least 39 people were injured when a car drove into a crowd of demonstrators during a rally by the Verdi trade union in Munichs city center on 13 February\n\nMany tributes left after Munich car attack kills mother and toddler\n\nAnd more and more all over Europe, theyre voting for political leaders who promised to put an end to out-of-control migration.\n\nNow, I happen to agree with a lot of these concerns, but you dont have to agree with me.\n\nThis is not the first time that Musk has expressed his feelings towards Europes migration policies.\n\nBack in December, he infuriated Germany by claiming that the far-right AfD party is the only party that can save the country.\n\nThere have also been concerns in Britain that Musk is taking a close interest in the countrys political scene, appearing to cosy up to ReformsNigel Farage.\n\nMusk is reported to be considering a donation of as much as $100million (80million) to help build up Reform into a political machine capable of overthrowingLabourat ageneral election.\n\n",

However, further assessments will be conducted to determine the full extent of his health condition.\n\nHis condition may explain why he wandered off and why repatriation efforts faced such obstacles, a social worker from the department said.\n\nAccording to the social workers report, he consistently eluded law enforcement, leading to multiple failed attempts at repatriation.\n\nHe was recently taken to the border at Beitbridge after being discovered on the streets of Harare.\n\nThe boy made the trip to Johannesburg the next day, where he was reunited with his family, escorted by his mother, maternal aunt, and a Gauteng social worker.\n\nHe started crying when he saw me and was saying a lot that I couldnt understand because it was in Shona; hes lost his Zulu [mother tongue] and now speaks Shona fluently, the boys 33-year-old mother said.\n\nThe mother described him as an independent child who often wandered off.\n\nWhen he started primary school, his disappearances became more frequent, sometimes leading to police involvement or kind strangers returning him home.\n\nWe thought he was just a seriously naughty child, and we would punish him and ground him from playing outside, said the mother.\n\nWhen asked about this behaviour, she admitted that it had been a confusing and painful journey.\n\nIt will empower me. I will know what medication he needs and what school I need to send him to. I also want to get him a tracking bracelet, the mother said.\n\nSeated on the concrete veranda of his home in Alexandra, Gauteng, the small-framed, shy-looking boy plays quietly with his cousin and a two-year-old brother he has just met for the first time.\n\nOne of the departments officials who accompanied the boys mother to Limpopo, Lamlani Mthembele, said the moment of reunion was deeply emotional.\n\nWhen they saw each other, he cried, his mom was crying, and even though we couldnt understand what he was saying in Shona, it felt like he was saying he was happy to be back home and that he would never leave his mothers side again, said Mthembele.\n\nAdditionally, the department has committed to getting social workers from the Gauteng region to support the boys mother in securing medical assessments and the necessary interventions for his well-being.\n\nThe department has assured ongoing psychosocial support for the boy and his family to ensure his smooth reintegration and emotional healing.\n\nSource: Sunday world\n\n",
