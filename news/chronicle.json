This reflects Zimbabwes commitment to sound economic policies and structural reforms, paving the way for future financial support and debt relief.\n\nA successful SMP will be key to unlocking concessional funding for Zimbabwes development goals.

The institution highlights the Governments focus on addressing social issues, such as drug rehabilitation. The centre plays a vital role in supporting individuals struggling with addiction.\n\nThe delegation also toured the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) silos to check on the progress of the construction of seven new storage facilities, which are crucial for the countrys food security.\n\nDr Muswere later toured the US$10 million Zhong Jin International Hotel, a notable landmark development in the mining town.\n\nIn his remarks, he said the hotel has immense potential for driving the promotion of tourism and economic growth across the region.\n\nThe minister also toured the Midlands State Universitys Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa Law School project, another milestone in human capital development.\n\nThe construction and resourcing of the Law School in Kwekwe District is part of the decentralisation and devolution of human capital development, said Dr Muswere.\n\nHe said the province has a number of smelters, mining, and processing companies, including the giant Dinson Iron and Steel factory in Manhize, Chirumanzu District.\n\nThis is part of an ecosystem, an ecosystem that had been destroyed by the illegal sanctions imposed on the country and are still put in place by the same imperialist forces, said Dr Muswere.\n\nThe Western capitals had targeted the engine of our economy because Zimbabwe took a strategic decision to redistribute land in order to correct the land imbalances brought about by the former colonisers.\n\nBecause of that, a lot of pieces of legislation were put in place and some still exist. Extending targeted sanctions on the Head of State is a direct attack on the people of Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nAs a demonstration of resilience, Dr Muswere said the coming of the Second Republic came with immense gains as evidenced by investors flocking in to invest in the economy.\n\nAll the value chains are undergoing great transformation under the leadership of President Mnangagwa. Farmers in Gokwe and Sanyathi are being capacitated to be cotton ginners and weavers until there is a finished product; that is the cloth for making garments, he said.\n\nDr Muswere said the tour of Amaveni Drug Rehabilitation Centre is part of the health strategy to curb the abuse of drugs by the people, especially the youths.\n\nPart of the tour included several hotels and industrial sites that have been put in place under the New Dispensation. The New Dispensation did not only raise the standards in terms of the gross domestic product but brought a sustainable acceleration in terms of economic empowerment, he said.\n\nEconomic empowerment also includes the land tenure, which has now been securitised so that we grow our wealth.Dr Muswere said the GMB silos under construction were part of ensuring food security and nutrition agenda that is being spearheaded by the Second Republic.\n\nAll this great work is towards an upper-middle-income society by 2030. The current revolution is about human capital growth, he said.\n\nGMB Kwekwe Silos\n\nHe said the multimillion-dollar Zhong Jin International Hotel is part of the success stories of engagement and re-engagement strategy undertaken by the New Dispensation to attract foreign direct investment.\n\nThe facility will support the various value chains that will be feeding into this hotel facility and is part of Vision 2030. Image building is also part of this vision, he added.\n\nThe minister reiterated that the Governments tourism recovery strategy remains anchored in unlocking the US$5 billion tourism economy and that such facilities speak to that vision.\n\nThere has also been a surge in the number of tourists visiting the country. The flora and fauna we enjoy has ensured that the tourism industry becomes a success, he said.\n\nThe most significant programme we have is hosted by the First Lady Amai Mnangagwa focusing on gastronomy.In his remarks, Minister Ncube said the exquisite US$10 million Zhong Jin International Hotel in RedCliff showcases the Second Republics impactful and transformational engagement and re-engagement initiatives under the able and visionary leadership of President Mnangagwa.\n\nSince the inception of the New Dispensation on November 24, 2017 Zimbabwe has realised unprecedented economic recovery and growth confirmed by international finance institutions like the World Bank and research institutions as evidenced through massive modern roads, airports, border posts, electricity infrastructure and private sector-led investments in mining, manufacturing, construction and tourism that underpin Midlands provincial GDP growth,  he said.\n\n",

In other developments, Mhlophe disclosed that the Highlanders Sports Club, run under a consultancy arrangement since early 2023, is subject to review by the end of March. He said the clubhouses kitchen arrangement is also subject to review.\n\nThis agreement includes a profit-sharing model which is expected to benefit Bosso significantly, especially given the clubs large membership and fan base.\n\nMhlophe expressed his hope that the clubs diaspora membership would soon be able to connect and participate in gatherings virtually. He noted that members have been organising themselves into various chapters, united by their loyalty to Highlanders.\n\nOur members continue to organise themselves into various chapters that are influential largely by geographical settlements, be it in cities, towns or countries.
