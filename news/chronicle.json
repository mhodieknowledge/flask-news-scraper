Over the past decade leading up to last year, Zimbabwe has not made a significant impact internationally because we are producing half-baked models.\n\nHe went on to highlight a range of basic skills lacking in aspiring beauty queens.Its sad that the models we have now dont know how to sit, stand, or even answer questions. Most of them are making it to the international stage because of powerful connections and wealthy sponsors, rather than merit.\n\nRukato lamented Zimbabwes lack of consistent visibility and success at prestigious global events such as Miss World and Miss Universe.The quality of models we are getting from the current crop of instructors is quite shocking. As a seasoned modelling trainer, I often find myself wondering where some of these models are being groomed.\n\nCalling for change, Rukato stressed the need for the formalisation and regulation of the modelling sector in Zimbabwe to ensure higher standards and more credible representation on international platforms.\n\nAmong those Rukato has trained are Phoebe Monjane (Miss Zimbabwe 2022), Sakhile Dube (Miss Universe 2024), Greatmore Chatya (Nokia Face of Africa 2005 finalist) Jeferson Mselera a TV presenter and brand ambassador for major brands, Michelle Wallace (Zimbabwe Supermodel 2024), and Francina Katuruza (Miss Zambia Zimbabwe 2023).\n\n",

But thats not all  he tackles the complexities of marriage side-by-side with his formidable wife, Dr Angel Ndlovu.\n\nDr Ndlovus sermons and prophecies transcend the confines of the church, often venturing into the political arena. This has propelled him to international acclaim but also brought criticism. Dr Ndlovu holds firm that God cares deeply for the people and their leaders and that prophets are divinely chosen to address the leadership of their times.\n\nFrom the book of Genesis to the book of Revelations whenever a prophet was anointed by God to rise, he would speak to the leadership of that particular generation because God is concerned about His people, so he sends his prophets to offer guidance to leadership.\n\nWhen they asked Christ what the sign of his coming would be he said nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, what is that? Thats politics. From the book of Genesis to the book of Revelations whenever a prophet was anointed by God to rise, he would speak to the leadership of that particular generation, he said.\n\nDr Ian Ndlovu and his wife Dr Angel Ndlovu with Kenyan First Lady Rachel Ruto\n\nDr Ndlovu seems to have a special fondness for Kenya. He has prophesied many things about the Kenyan Government that have come to pass, and the Kenyan people have embraced him as a guiding voice.\n\nI started prophesying a lot of things about the Kenyan Government that came to pass and when the people there realised that God was using me to give direction in their country they contacted me. But I have spoken a lot of things about a lot of other countries including our own. We have three branches in Kenya but the reception we get across the entire nation is relatively good, he said.\n\nThis focus on national guidance is evident in the invitation that was extended to the Ndlovus to attend the inauguration of Kenyan President William Ruto in 2022, a cherished moment for Dr Angel Ndlovu.\n\nIt was my first time at the State House and introducing myself to the President was one of the cherished moments of my life. The most inspirational thing was his ability to strongly state his belief in God regardless of his elevated office. President Ruto is a very humble man, she said.\n\nDr Ndlovus academic journey is impressive. Born in Ntabazinduna in 1976, he attended Sihlengeni Secondary School and Mpopoma High School before earning his undergraduate degree in Economics with Education from Gweru Teachers College (now MSU). He then embarked on a teaching career, but his pursuit of learning never faltered.\n\nIn 2008, Dr Ndlovu started a prayer group in Nkulumane 5 with just four members. Today, his church, Divine Kingdom Baptist Church, boasts thousands of international members.\n\nWhile serving as a Teaching Assistant (TA) at the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) from 2008 to 2010, Dr Ndlovu continued his academic journey, obtaining his Masters degree. This dedication to education propelled him to a lectureship at Nust, a position he held from 2010 to 2022. He even expanded his teaching reach by becoming a part-time lecturer at the Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU).\n\nIn 2019, Dr Ndlovus hunger for knowledge remained insatiable, leading him to pursue a PhD from Unisa. Now, he serves as an external assessor at Unisa and a supervisor at Nust, truly embodying the spirit of lifelong learning.\n\nDr Ndlovus passion extends beyond academia. He met his wife, Dr Angel Ndlovu, who attributes her own academic success to her husbands encouragement and support.When I met my husband, I did have a degree, but he encouraged me to pursue my masters and then my PhD. If you look at the grades I obtained while doing my Masters and PhD they are so much better than the ones I got for my undergrad, she said.\n\nTogether, the Ndlovus have built a beautiful life, balancing their commitment to service with their dedication to family. They have two philanthropic organisations dedicated to helping the vulnerable, with Dr Angel Ndlovus expertise in development studies guiding their work.\n\nDr Angel Ndlovu with some young learners\n\nThe Ndlovus exemplify the perfect blend of academic excellence, faith and dedication to family and community. Their secret to maintaining a healthy family balance is to spend as much quality time as possible away from their busy schedules.\n\nTheirs is a story of faith, intellect and unwavering commitment. Dr Ian Ndlovu, the prophet with a global perspective, and Dr Angel Ndlovu, the doctor with a heart for her community, together inspire and empower, proving that love and purpose can go hand-in-hand.\n\n",

Today, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to a man of God whose ministry has touched countless lives, Prophet Ian Ndlovu.\n\nHe praised Prophet Ndlovu for his unifying role in Zimbabwes spiritual landscape.Through the Divine Kingdom Baptist Ministries, you have stood as a beacon of truth, unity and peace in the body of Christ. Your consistent calls for national prayer for our countrys leadership, regardless of political affiliation, is a mark of political maturity and spiritual integrity.What I admire most is that you never use the pulpit to sow division, but rather you have used it to foster dialogue and reconciliation.\n\nThe businessman, known for his philanthropic gestures, said that both vehicles worth US$280 000 are ready for collection at Faramatsi Motors in Harare. Additionally, he pledged US$100 000 towards the completion of the prophets church building and US$50 000 to support Mrs Ndlovus charitable initiatives.\n\nChivayo wished God to continue to increase Prophet Ndlovus influence and preserve his ministry, adding that Zimbabwe is spiritually richer because of men of faith like him.\n\nIan Ndlovu, a multifaceted leader, blending faith, academia, and philanthropy alongside his wife, addresses political and spiritual leadership, believing prophets must guide nations. This conviction has earned him international recognition, particularly in Kenya, where his prophecies about the government have come to pass.\n\nBorn in Ntabazinduna in 1976, Dr Ndlovu pursued education relentlessly, earning degrees in Economics with Education, a Masters, and later a PhD. He lectured at Nust and Zou while founding Divine Kingdom Baptist Church, which grew from a small prayer group to a global congregation.\n\n",

Lessons from the 1994 Genocide are that war should never be used in Africa as a means to achieve peace because there is no peace in war, he said.\n\nHighlighting concerns about ongoing conflicts in Africa, the Minister questioned the origin of weapons fuelling violence on the continent, implying external influences contribute to instability.\n\nIf we look around we see no factory which produces bullets in the East African and the SADC region, Prof Murwira stated. We ask this question, Whose bullets are being used to perpetrate the violence in the East African region?\n\nHe said there is need for the parties engaged in the conflict in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo to cease hostilities and prioritise dialogue.\n\nZimbabwe, Prof Murwira said, will stand in solidarity with the of people Rwanda in remembering the atrocities that took place 31 years ago where over one million people, including innocent children, were brutally murdered.\n\nToday we salute the courage and resilience of survivors, who had the bravery and acceptance to forgive and live side by side with the perpetrators amidst this dark history of the country.\n\nCommemoration of this event each year, helps the world never to forget what happened in Rwanda. It reminds us of the collective failure of the international community to protect those who were killed, so that history does not repeat itself, said Prof Murwira.\n\nHe also expressed gratitude to Rwandas ability to regenerate itself from calamity to prosperity, saying the countrys national healing and reconciliation is a well-documented success story.\n\nThe theme of the 31st anniversary of the genocide, Remember-Unite-Renew, he said, demonstrates that Rwandans emerged from their devastation as a reunited and refocused people grounded on the positive ethos of unity, tolerance, social cohesion, and inclusive development.\n\nThere is no doubt that future generations will build upon this firm foundation that has been dearly laid out for them.\n\nTurning to bilateral cooperation between the two countries, Prof Murwira expressed satisfaction at agreements signed so far in various economic, social, legal and political areas of mutual interest.\n\nHe said Zimbabwe and Rwanda are looking forward to the convening of the Third Session of Joint Permanent Commission on Cooperation JPCC.\n\nSpeaking at the same occasion Rwandas Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr James Musoni said the 7th of April, when the mass killings began, is recognised by the United Nations and the African Union as the\n\nInternational Day of Reflection on the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda which resonates well with the theme Remember-Unite-Renew\n\nAs we commemorate the victims of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, we remember, the dark times of our history, commemorate and honour the lives of ours that perished, show solidarity with survivors and unite to ensure that such tragedy never happens again in Rwanda or elsewhere, he said.\n\n",
