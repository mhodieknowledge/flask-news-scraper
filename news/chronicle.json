            "content": "Judith Phiri, Business Reporter\n\nZIMBABWES largest integrated media house, Zimbabwe Newspapers (Zimpapers) in partnership with the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development are set to host Women in Agriculture Conference in Harare on 26 March.The event taking place during Womens Month aims to increase recognition and celebration of womens contributions to agriculture, while the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Permanent Secretary Professor Obert Jiri is set to grace the event at the Keynote Speaker.\n\nZimbabwe has made significant progress in promoting gender equality and empowering women in various sectors, including agriculture. However, despite their significant contributions, women in Zimbabwe continue to face numerous challenges that hinder their full participation and benefit from agricultural development.\n\nSome of the key challenges faced by women in agriculture in Zimbabwe include limited access to land and resources, lack of training and capacity building, limited market access as well as cultural and social barriers among others.This exclusion perpetuates poverty, inequality, and food insecurity, undermining the countrys efforts to achieve sustainable development and economic growth.\n\nIn recognition of these challenges, the Government of Zimbabwe has committed to promoting gender equality and empowering women in agriculture.\n\nThe Zimpapers conference in partnership with the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development will create a platform for knowledge sharing, networking and advocacy to support womens empowerment in agriculture.In an interview, Permanent Secretary Prof Jiri said it was important to recognise and celebrate womens contribution in agriculture.\n\nWomen constitute 52 percent of the population in the country and they are the bulk of farmers in communal areas. With such a demography they need to be taken on board and their contribution cannot be ignored, he said.He said women continue to prove their mettle in farming and they continue to rise fast to levels unparalleled by their male counterparts.\n\nThe event co-ordinator Mrs Hilda Marijeni said the conference will provide a platform for women in agriculture to share their experiences, challenges, and successes.\n\nShe said: It will also explore access to finance for women in agriculture, opportunities for womens empowerment through agricultural training and capacity building as well as promote gender equality and womens empowerment. This is a platform to advocate for policies and programmes that promote gender equality and womens empowerment in agriculture.\n\nMrs Marijeni said it was important to promote partnerships and collaborations between women in agriculture, government, private sector, and civil society.\n\nShe said the event will bring together women farmers that include smallholder farmers, rural women, and urban women involved in agriculture.\n\nIt will also include agricultural experts such as researchers, extension workers, and professionals working in agricultural development as well as policy makers such as Government officials, parliamentarians, and decision-makers responsible for agriculture, gender, and womens empowerment.\n\nAmong them will be civil society organisations such as NGOs, community-based organisations, and womens groups working on agriculture, gender, and womens empowerment.Mrs Marijeni said in attendance will be private sector representatives such as companies and businesses involved in agriculture, agribusiness, and rural development as well as youth and womens groups that are interested in agriculture.\n\nShe said media representatives of journalists and media professionals interested in covering womens empowerment and agricultural development stories will be in attendance at the event.Mrs Marijeni added: The conference agenda will include a Keynote Address that will address The Role of Women in Agriculture: Challenges and Opportunities. While the panel discussion will tackle Womens Experiences in Agriculture: Successes and Challenges.\n\nShe said a presentation on Government Initiatives Supporting Women in Agriculture will also be done as well as a networking session on Connecting Women in Agriculture: Building Partnerships and Collaborations.\n\nMrs Marijeni said the expected outcome will be improved understanding of the challenges faced by women in agriculture and potential solutions, strengthened partnerships and collaborations between women in agriculture, government, private sector, and civil society.\n\nAs well as empowering women farmers with knowledge, skills, and resources to improve their agricultural productivity and livelihoods.\n\nWe are calling on women in agriculture to register and come in their numbers for this important event as well as agricultural experts, civil society organisations and private sector representatives. Let us identify and come up with solutions to address challenges faced by women in agriculture.\n\n",

However, the campaign has encountered a significant hurdle: many farm workers lack national IDs, which are essential for NSSA registration.\n\nLiaison Officers are working closely with the workers to address these challenges and ensure they understand the importance of NSSA contributions and the benefits they can access. The outreach underscores NSSAs commitment to extending social security coverage to all workers, including those in remote and often underserved farming communities.\n\nDespite the progress made, the lack of IDs among farm workers remains a barrier to full participation in the scheme. NSSA has called for increased collaboration with relevant authorities to help workers obtain the necessary documentation, ensuring they can access the social security benefits they are entitled to.\n\nThis initiative highlights the ongoing efforts to bridge gaps in social security coverage and empower workers with the knowledge and tools needed to secure their futures.\n\n",

Every effort does count!\n\nThe potential for the region to create a more equitable and just society is huge and ever-present.\n\n",
