Accordingly, he is found not guilty and acquitted, ruled the magistrate.\n\nThe prosecutor, Mrs Ellen Matenga, told the court that the incident occurred on 27 May last year, at Kelvin Shopping Centre in Bulawayo.\n\nMrs Nonjabulo Ndlovu, the complainant, testified that she had gone to Kelvin to have her car fixed and left her belongings in the vehicle. These included a laptop, a mobile phone, US$380, her identification card, and bank cards.\n\nMichael, in his defence, claimed he was in South Africa on the day of the alleged crime and only returned on 31 May. He stated that he bought a phone from someone at Unity Village upon his return and later swapped it for another device.\n\nI was not in the country on 27 May. I was in South Africa and when I returned, I bought a phone from someone as I didnt have one. After using it for a few days, I swapped it for another phone, he said.\n\nMichael told the court that he voluntarily led the police to the person who had the phone.\n\nMrs Ndlovu recovered her phone, identification card, and bank cards, which had been picked up along Khami Road by a good Samaritan.\n\nSomeone called me and said they had found my particulars along Khami Road. I informed the officer handling my case, and he advised me to collect them, she said.\n\nOf the stolen goods, US$500 worth was recovered.\n\n",
