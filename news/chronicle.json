Among the top-performing schools were:\n\nEach of these schools contributed USD$100 towards the event, with the funds used to honour the learners and support the overall ceremony.\n\nCertificates and presents were also awarded to schools excelling in various sporting disciplines:\n\nIndividual awards were given to 18 learners for excellence in athletics, while 50 learners in ball games also received prizes. Seven learners represented Zimbabwe at the COSSASA games, including Praise Neshiri from Malindela Primary, who was recognised for her participation in the Confederation of African Football (CAF) games. Praise was further rewarded with a school trunk by Rauch Manufacturing, a key sponsor of the event.\n\nIn a move promoting inclusivity, 20 special needs learners from nine schools with specialised units were honoured with certificates and presents. A teacher from Manondwane Primary School provided sign language interpretation for hearing-impaired learners, reflecting the citys commitment to equitable education.\n\nWhile the event celebrated top achievers, concerns were raised about poor performance among some council schools, particularly in peri-urban areas. The Chamber Secretary identified socio-economic challenges as the main drivers of these results.\n\nCouncillors urged council schools to strive for better outcomes, emphasising the need for stronger partnerships to address these issues. The city is already engaging partners to support vulnerable learners with school fees, uniforms, and books.\n\nThe event was made possible by the contributions of 21 stakeholders who donated various items to supplement prizes for learners. The Provincial Education Director, represented by Deputy Provincial Education Director (SECNF) Mr Thabani Sibanda, delivered the keynote address and commended the organisers for a well-executed event.\n\nThe Schools Merit Awards highlighted both the triumphs and challenges faced by Bulawayos education sector, with a strong call for collaborative efforts to enhance performance across all council schools.\n\n",

The two teams chasing Eagles are only separated by net run rate.\n\nIn fourth place there is Mega Market Mountaineers while Tuskers anchor the standings. Both teams are on four points, also separated by net-run rate.The table toppers, Eagles, batting first against Southern Rocks were bowled out for 262 runs in 49.4 overs with Tinashe Kamunhukamwe top scoring with a half century. Eagles went on to secure the win as they bowled out their opponents for 253 runs in 48.3 overs.\n\nThe home side enjoyed a fine start, as their opening pair of Tinashe Kamunhukamwe and Tadiwanashe Marumani scored freely and put up 71 for the first wicket in less than 10 overs.It was a superb spell of bowling by William Mashinge that changed the aspect of the game, as he first dismissed Marumani and Emmanuel Bawa in the same over, and followed this up with the wickets of Dion Myers for nine and Craig Ervine for one.\n\nWhen Dylan Hondo bowled out Kamunhukamwe for 61 runs off 63 balls, Eagles were in some trouble at 114/5 in the 24th over.Wessly Madhevere (28) and Tony Munyonga (42) brought about an improvement with a partnership of 60 in nine overs, but then with more wickets falling the eighth wicket went down at 205.\n\nAgain, another partnership came to the rescue, this time with Faraz Akram (49) and Alex Falao (16) taking on the bowling to add 57 in 11 overs.Both fell to successive deliveries in the final over from debutant Shelton Mazvitorera.Mashinge was the pick of the Southern Rocks bowlers, finishing with figures of 4/37 in his 10-over spell while Roy Kaia took 3/57.\n\nIn their chase, Rocks made a rather poor start, losing three wickets for 44 runs, but Innocent Kaia played well and at last found a worthy partner in Ryan Higgins.Higgins hit hard and well, and they put on 83 for the fourth wicket before Kaia was caught for 51, scored off 84 balls.The eighth wicket fell at 207 and this match seemed lost, but Mashinge was still going well, and Hondo gave him such help from number 10 that they took the score to 251 in the 48th over, giving Eagles much concern in a tight finish.At this point Akram struck again, trapping Mashinge in front for 34 and, with Hondo out in the next over, Rocks fell just short of their target, all out for 253 with nine balls in hand.\n\nAkram was the outstanding bowler with three vital wickets for 53 in nine overs.However, the overall honours belonged to Madhevere, who delivered a standout all-round performance to earn the player of the match award, scoring a vital 28 runs, taking two wickets for 44 runs in his 10 overs and securing two catches in the field.In the other Pro50 Championship match, rain once again proved spoilsport for Tuskers as their game against Rhinos at Bulawayo Athletic Club (BAC) was called off due to persistent rain.\n\nThe game started two hour later than scheduled due to a wet outfield and was reduced to 41 overs. Tuskers, who won the toss and elected to field first restricted Rhinos to 287/7. The match was abandoned with the hosts on 13/1, having lost the wicket of Nkosana Mpofu.This was now the second consecutive time that a Tuskers match yielded no result. Their match against Southern Rocks last week was called off without a ball being bowled at Takashinga Cricket Club.Following the completion of the Pro50 matches, next up is the Logan Cup. Eagles face Southern Rocks at Harare Sports Club while Tuskers host Rhinos at BAC.All matches are free of charge to all spectators.\n\n@brandon_malvin\n\n",

She was 76.\n\nBule is the mother of Ndolwane Super Sounds co-founder Charles Ndebele, a Zimbabwean musical maestro who inherited his talent from his mother, who was also a musician at heart, being one of the founders of the pre-independence music outfit Zimbabwe All-Stars.\n\nCde Phuti stated that the liberation heroine has left a significant void in the ruling party and the Makhulela community at large.\n\nThe loss of heroine Cde Bule is a shattering blow to us. It came at a time when such resilient people were needed the most. She was incredibly upright and very patriotic. She had a blend of political culture that she developed over many years in Harare, ZAPU in the 70s, and later Zanu PF, where she could merge it with the prevailing political climate at Makhulela party district, Bulilima Constituency, and Matabeleland South province. She fitted in exceptionally well.\n\nShe was an excellent mobiliser, never hesitating to approach anyone; she was a master of door-to-door campaigns. She loved the truth and was not a backstabber. She was straightforward and steadfast, said Cde Phuti.\n\nHe remarked that Marujata, as she was affectionately known, was a responsible character who wanted things to be done properly and culturally, in a manner that would leave everyone satisfied.\n\nMarujata was just colourful. Her departure is a sad loss to the party and the Makhulela community in general, as she was a culturally gifted individual, and music mourns her loss because her history is remarkable.\n\nShe was a revolutionary singer, and we are told that they would meet with the late Dr Joshua Nkomo, whereby when he went abroad for negotiations in Geneva and Malta, they would greet him with songs. They produced various albums over the years, led by Owen Ndlovu, and later I produced an album for them in 2005, which did very well, with Marujata as the lead singer. She will be missed for many reasons, said Cde Phuti.\n\n-@mthabisi_mthire\n\n",
