            "content": "WINDHOEK, Feb 9 (Reuters)  Sam Nujoma, the activist and guerrilla leader who became Namibias first democratically elected president after it won its independence from apartheid South Africa, died aged 95 on Saturday, the Namibian Presidency said on Sunday.\n\nNujoma rose to head the thinly populated southern African country on March 21, 1990 and was formally recognised as Founding Father of the Namibian Nation through a 2005 act of parliament.\n\nThe acclaim was balanced out by domestic and international criticism over his intolerance of critical media coverage, his railing against homosexuality and over the 1998 constitutional amendment that let him run for a third term.\n\nHe was a longtime ally of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, backing Mugabes land seizures from white farmers, though at home Nujoma stuck to a willing buyer, willing seller policy.\n\nThe foundations of the Republic of Namibia have been shaken, the presidency posted on X.\n\nOur venerable leader, Dr. Nujoma did not only blaze the trail to freedom  but he also inspired us to rise to our feet and to become masters of this vast land of our ancestors.\n\nThe presidency said Nujoma had been hospitalised for medical treatment over the past three weeks, adding: Unfortunately, this time, the most gallant son of our land could not recover from his illness.\n\nCOMPLEX LEGACY\n\nNujoma served his three terms as president from 1990 to 2005 and sought to project himself as a unifying leader bridging political divides.\n\nIn a country scarred by the legacy of apartheid and German colonial rule, Nujomas SWAPO party oversaw a national reconciliation programme under the motto One Namibia, One Nation.\n\nIn his speeches, Nujoma made a point of repeating the phrase: A united people, striving to achieve a common good for all members of the society, will always emerge victorious.\n\nAdvertisement  Scroll to continue\n\nHis achievements included establishing democratic institutions and prioritising reconciliation, said Ndumba Kamwanyah, a lecturer at the University of Namibia and a political analyst.\n\nBut his autocratic tendencies, on display in his treatment of the media and brutal suppression of the 1999 Caprivi rebellion, cast a shadow over his legacy, Kamwanyah added.\n\nWhile Nujomas presidency was foundational in establishing Namibias independence and governance, it was not without flaws, Kamwanyah said.\n\nCAMPAIGNER AND GUERRILLA\n\nNujoma was born in a village in northwestern Namibia in 1929, when his country was under South African administration. South Africa had controlled Namibia since World War One after a brutal few decades of German colonial rule remembered for the genocide of the Herero and Nama people.\n\nAs a boy he looked after his familys cattle and attended a Finnish mission school, before moving to the coastal town of Walvis Bay and then the capital Windhoek, where he worked for South African Railways, according to a biography posted on the website of Nujomas charitable foundation.\n\nNujoma left his job on the railways to focus his energies on bringing down the apartheid system.\n\nIn the late 1950s he became leader of the Owambo Peoples Organisation, a precursor to liberation movement SWAPO, organising resistance to the forced relocation of Black people in Windhoek that culminated in the police killing 12 unarmed people and wounding dozens more.\n\nNujoma was charged with organising the resistance and arrested.\n\nIn 1960, he went into exile. He travelled across Africa before reaching the United States, where he petitioned the United Nations for Namibias independence.\n\nMade SWAPO leader in absentia, Nujoma established its armed wing and in 1966 launched a guerrilla war against the apartheid government.\n\nIt took more than a decade of pressure from Nujoma and others before a U.N. Security Council resolution in 1978 proposed a ceasefire and elections, and another decade for the ceasefire deal to be signed and elections held in late 1989.\n\nSWAPO won a majority in those elections, and Nujoma took office in March the following year.\n\n",

Additionally, he condemned attacks on diplomatic missions, civilians, and peacekeepers, calling such acts a violation of international law.\n\n",

South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, who is close to Trump, has said that white South Africans have been the victims of racist ownership laws.\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa  who signed into law a bill last month aimed at making it easier for the state to expropriate land in the public interest  has defended the policy. He has said the government had not confiscated any land and the policy was aimed at evening out racial disparities in land ownership in the Black-majority nation. Ramaphosa said South Africa will not be bullied.\n\nAdvertisement  Scroll to continue\n\nWashington has also complained about the case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice, where it accused Israel of genocide over Israels military assault on Gaza that has killed tens of thousands and caused a humanitarian crisis.\n\nIsrael denies the allegations, saying it acted in self-defense following a deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Palestinian Hamas militants.\n\nThe White House cited that case as an example of South Africa taking positions against Washington and its allies.\n\nAdvertisement  Scroll to continue\n\nThe executive order signed by Trump will address human rights issues in South Africa, the White House said. Trump had threatened to cut off funding for the nation soon after taking office.\n\nThe question of land ownership is highly politically charged in South Africa, due to the legacy of the colonial and apartheid eras when Black people were dispossessed of their lands and denied property rights.\n\nWhite landowners still possess three-quarters of South Africas freehold farmland. This contrasts with 4% owned by Black people, who make up 80% of the population compared with about 8% for whites, according to the latest 2017 land audit.\n\n Reuters\n\n",
