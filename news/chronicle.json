            "content": "Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu\n\n[emailprotected]\n\nPOLICE in Matabeleland South Province have launched a manhunt for 11 suspects linked to two separate murder cases that occurred in Beitbridge and Matobo districts.\n\nIn the first incident, three men allegedly fatally assaulted a fellow patron during a drinking spree in Beitbridge. In the second case, eight men attacked and killed a co-worker in Matobo following a dispute over money earned from mining activities.\n\nMatabeleland South acting provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Stanford Mguni, confirmed the two incidents and appealed to the public for information that could lead to the suspects arrests.\n\nHe said the suspects, Prenny Mudau, Francis Ndou and Clive Mudau, are accused of killing Titus Ndou following an altercation.\n\nOn March 23, 2025, at around 10 AM, Francis Ndou and the deceased were drinking traditional beer at a homestead in their village when they got into an argument. Other patrons intervened, and Francis Ndou left the scene, said Asst Insp Mguni.\n\nHowever, at around 4 PM, the three suspects regrouped and confronted Titus Ndou.\n\nThey attacked him, and Prenny Mudau stabbed him once on the right side of the neck with an okapi knife, causing him to bleed profusely. The suspects then fled, said Asst Insp Mguni.\n\nThe victim staggered for a few metres before collapsing. Police were alerted and attended the scene. The suspects are still at large.\n\nIn the second case, Braveman Ndlovu (33) was allegedly killed by Nkosi and seven other unidentified men following a dispute over payment for their mining work.\n\nOn March 25, 2025, at around 3 PM, Ndlovu and the suspects argued over how to share money they had earned from working at a mine in Matobo. The suspects began assaulting him with stones but were restrained by bystanders, Asst Insp Mguni said.\n\nHowever, later that night, at around 9 PM, the group attacked Ndlovu again. Witnesses intervened, but the violence did not stop.\n\nThe following morning, around 4 AM, Ndlovu was found lifeless near a mine shaft, while the suspects had vanished, he said.\n\nAsst Insp Mguni expressed concern over the increasing number of murder cases in the province, saying there is a need for peaceful conflict resolution.\n\nIt is an issue of concern to record two murder cases within a space of just three days. We urge people to find non-violent ways of resolving disputes. Lives are being unnecessarily lost over issues that could be settled amicably, he said.\n\nAs police, we are calling on anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects to inform us or visit any nearest police station.\n\n@DubeMatutu\n\n",

Instead of depositing the money, they converted it for personal use and created fake CBZ deposit slips to mislead Ms Madonko. The scheme was uncovered when the school contacted Ms Madonko about unpaid fees, prompting her to file a police report.\n\nThe prosecutor, Ms Mufaro Ndirayire, said the first incident occurred on 7 February, when Ms Madonko handed Chipeta US$350 to deposit into the schools account. Chipeta then approached Shoko, who enlisted Mhlanga to forge a deposit slip using a fake stamp and printed confirmation slip. A second incident followed on 20 February, involving US$210, which Chipeta again failed to deposit.\n\nChipeta then approached Shoko and asked for a forged CBZ deposit slip. Shoko then engaged the services of Mhlanga, who forged the slip by designing a fake stamp and printing a CBZ bank confirmation of cash deposit slip, said Ms Ndirayire.\n\nThey were represented by lawyer, Simon Mutandi of Sandi and Matshakaile Attorneys who pleaded for leniency, citing their status as first-time offenders and noting that they had compensated the complainant.\n\nChipeta faces additional charges of theft of trust property and fraud in connection with violating a trust agreement with Ms Madonko and misrepresenting the payment of school fees to Gloag High School. These charges stem from her role in producing fake deposit slips and deceiving both Ms Madonko and the school administration.\n\n",

Against the backdrop of a strong gold price, Bilboes remains both compelling and financeable, said Caledonia in a statement.\n\nKey areas of optimisation currently under review include: engaging with the authorities to explore the potential sale of concentrate, which could significantly reduce upfront capital expenditures by deferring the capital expenditure on a BIOX processing circuit, at least in the first few years of production, and evaluating the potential relocation of the Tailings Storage Facility to a more efficient site, including on Caledonias Motapa property adjacent to Bilboes, where the topography could lead to lower initial construction costs.\n\nCaledonia also said is is incorporating near-term opportunities at Motapa into the Bilboes feasibility study, following strong exploration results in 2024 and the additional exploration and development work planned at Motapa this year.\n\nThe gold production giant also saod the exploration at Motapa, which is located directly adjacent to Bilboes, has been particularly promising, indicating the presence of new mineralised zones within a few hundred metres of the proposed Bilboes processing plant. Demonstrating significant resource additions at Motapa has the potential to materially improve the long-term economics of a combined Bilboes-Motapa project said Caledonia.\n\nIn addition, Caledonia continues to assess near-term revenue opportunities across its portfolio. In\n\nparticular, high-grade mineralisation recently identified at the Blanket Mine could make a meaningful contribution to the initial capital requirements for Bilboes, providing further flexibility around funding.\n\nThe board remains fully committed to maximising shareholder value: this means ensuring that Bilboes is optimised both technically and financially, while continuing discussions with funding partners and relevant authorities in Zimbabwe, they said.\n\nThe optimisation work is advancing well, and the company will provide a further update on the expected timing of the feasibility study in due course.\n\nCaledonia chief executive officer Mark Learmonth, said Bilboes has the potential to be truly transformative for Caledonia, and the work we are doing now is about making sure we get it right.\n\nWe are encouraged by the results to date and are taking a disciplined approach to optimisationboth to enhance returns and to ensure we can fund the project in the most\n\nefficient way possible, he said.\n\nWith strong exploration results at Motapa, promising developments at Blanket, and supportive market conditions, we remain confident in Bilboes ability to significantly reshape Caledonias growth profile.\n\n@SikhulekelaniM1\n\n",
