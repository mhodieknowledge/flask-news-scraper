Seventeen people died on the spot, while seven others died upon admission to the Beitbridge District Hospital.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday evening, President Mnangagwa, expressed his deepest and heartfelt condolences, saying Government would assist the victims with a state-assisted burial.\n\nGovernment has therefore declared this incident a National Disaster and will accord the victims of this horrendous crash a State-assisted burial. As I express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the families and relatives who have lost their loved ones in this horrific crash, I also prayerfully reach out to all those injured and hospitalised, wishing them a speedy recovery, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe added that Zimbabwe does not deserve this at all, let alone experiencing such a bloody incident at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe death of 24 Zimbabweans in a head-on collision between an Urban Connect bus and a commercial haulage truck, along the Beitbridge-Masvingo Highway this morning, left me horrified and heartbroken.\n\nFellow Zimbabweans, our nation does not deserve this at all, let alone experiencing such a bloody incident at the beginning of the year. We must do all that is possible to curb this unjustified loss of life, said the President.\n\nHe appealed to all motorists to exercise extreme caution on the road, for the sake of both fellow road users and themselves.\n\nAll arms of the Government that are responsible for ensuring safety on our roads are thus constantly reminded to work around the clock and employ all legal means and powers available to them to reduce and ultimately put an end to such carnage, said President Mnangagwa.\n\n",

This tour will provide us with an objective view of the performance of industries here in Bulawayo.\n\nAt General Beltings Holdings (GBH), General Manager Mr Joseph Gunda highlighted the companys need for US 20 million to acquire machinery for producing steelcoded belts.He revealed that in 2023, Zimbabwe imported US 18 million worth of steel-coded belts, significantly increasing the nations import bill.\n\nOur market share is between 25 to 30 percent, said Mr Gunda.The Government has supported us by restricting the importation of conveyor belts and some local companies have also backed us. However, most of our raw materials are imported from South Africa and China.\n\nMr Gunda also noted that GBH recently acquired a 3D mixer to increase production capacity, improve product quality, and enhance competitiveness. Despite these efforts, the company faces challenges, including the influx of cheap imports disguised as steel-coded belts, which undermines local production.\n\nCde Mashaba expressed concern over the challenges faced by GBH, particularly the issue of imported goods masquerading as steel-coded belts.\n\nIm very much touched by your presentation. There are a lot of interventions the party and the Government are doing. Im touched by these belts that come in as steel-coded belts, so we need to ensure that anything coming in with coded belts is investigated further, he said.\n\nHe added that the party is working closely with border authorities to address these issues and will share insights from the tour to strengthen local industry protection. Each country should protect its own industry by banning anything that is not manufactured here, said Cde Mashaba.\n\n",

They attacked the security guards and threatened them with machetes and pistols they were armed with before beating and tying them up, said Comm Nyathi.\n\nHe said afterward they stripped the guards of their raincoats before wearing them as they clandestinely raided the safe, which they opened using a grinder.\n\nComm Nyathi said the security guards managed to free themselves shortly after 2 AM after the robbers had escaped.\n\nThey were clad in balaclavas and we are appealing to members of the public for information that may lead to their arrest. We suspect that this was an inside job as they were aware that there was money at the premises, said Comm Nyathi.\n\nHe also urged members of the public not to harbor criminals as they may turn on them and rob them.\n\nInvestigations are underway and we want to warn these robbers that we will not hesitate to unleash the full wrath of the law on them. Let this be a final warning to all these gangs and cartels, said Comm Nyathi.\n\nLast Thursday night a gang of armed robbers pounced on a tuck shop in Bulawayos Nketa 6 suburb, where the owner of the facility found himself facing the barrel of a gun as two armed robbers demanded cash and valuables from the small business owner.\n\nFearing for his life and that of his teenage son, Mr Dube handed the days earnings of US$85 and a cellphone.\n\nThe two robbers proceeded to grab soft drinks from a refrigerator in the tuck shop before vanishing into the darkness.\n\nMr Dube in his statement said his son tried to raise the alarm by screaming for help while following them prompting them to fire a single shot to scare him off.\n\nPolice detectives were called to the scene and they canvassed the area in search of a cartridge from the bullet that was fired by one of the armed robbers.\n\nBulawayo police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Nomalanga Msebele said one of the suspects pointed a pistol at the complainant and demanded cash.\n\nShe said the suspects fired one shot into the air before running away.\n\nA fortnight ago, a gang of three armed robbers attacked a Sai Mart outlet in New Lobengula suburb in a botched attempted robbery.\n\nResidents of the suburb pelted the armed robbers with stones forcing the gang to flee on foot.\n\nThe shop manager was shot in both thighs after he told the armed robbers that he did not have keys to the business strong room where cash is kept.\n\nLast year in December three armed robbers struck a Choppies outlet in New Luveve and made off with US$1 000. They fired three shots, injuring the manager and a security guard before fleeing on foot.\n\n",
