            "content": "Vusumuzi Dube, Deputy Radar Editor\n\nMOZAMBIQUE is Zimbabwe and Zimbabwe is Mozambique. We are one!What a powerful statement echoed multiple times by Mozambican President Daniel Francisco Chapo in his keynote address at the official opening of the 65th edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) in Bulawayo yesterday.\n\nThe visiting Mozambican leader was the guest of honour at the countrys oversubscribed premier trade and investment expo.He emphasised that the two neighbouring states not only share a border, but also possess deep-rooted political, economic and cultural ties dating back to pre-independence era.\n\nSpeaking in Portuguese with the aid of an interpreter, President Chapo spoke at length about the relationship between the two countries, and urged further improvement to achieve mutually beneficial trade and foreign direct investment flows.Its a fact that co-operation with the Republic of Zimbabwe has great significance for Mozambique, not only because of the sharing of common borders, but also because of the deep historical ties of political, economic and cultural coexistence, which date back to the times of the national liberation struggle which, over the decades, have translated into active and mutual support in the defence and consolidation of our sovereignties and have crystallised in close co-operation at bilateral, regional and continental levels, said President Chapo.\n\nOur presence at this important fair represents our determination to boost and facilitate trade between Mozambique and Zimbabwe in particular, and with the world in general, as well as to attract foreign direct investment from Zimbabwe and the countries represented here in agriculture, industry, transport and logistics sectors, among other sectors.\n\nHe said the cordial bilateral relations between the two countries should stimulate higher commercial gains through economic complementarity and the creation of economies of scale leveraging available natural resources, existing infrastructure and logistical means, with emphasis on the Beira Corridor.\n\nPresident Chapo noted that the ZITF 2025 was being hosted just a few days after the celebration of the 45th anniversary of Zimbabwes Independence Day, similar to Mozambiques scheduled hosting of the 60th edition of the Maputo International Trade Fair, which takes place from August 25 to 31 this year in Maputo.\n\nThe neighbouring country will be celebrating 50 years of its independence, marking a point of intersection between the two countries.\n\nDespite the geographical proximity, the immense natural and strategic resources yet to be explored, and the historical political ties of friendship between our countries, our trade relations and investments are still incipient and consist of low value-added products, mostly commodities, and with no record of any notable change in their structure or composition over the last few years, as can be seen in the data we present below, in terms of the trade balance and foreign direct investment flows, said President Chapo.\n\nOur participation in this event has the central objective of gathering the experiences of the main stakeholders and interested parties in the industrial, agricultural, transport and logistics sectors, with emphasis on farmers, agribusiness operators, policy makers and international organisations, with a view to promoting economic recovery, innovation and the sustainability and resilience of the agricultural, industrial, transport and logistics sector for the benefit of our private sector, communities and the country in general, said President Chapo.\n\nHe revealed that Zimbabwe has been part of the traditional foreign investors in Mozambique for the last three decades, having reduced its participation in recent years, motivated by the well-known challenges that afflict not only Zimbabwe but most countries in the SADC region and the African continent in general.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2024, 37 projects were approved, which could create 1 649 jobs, involving private investors from Zimbabwe, for a total value of around US$120 million, of which the equivalent of around US$35 million was direct investment, said President Chapo.\n\nZimbabwes investment was directed at 31,7 percent in the aquaculture and fisheries sector, in second place, the tourism and hotel sector with 23,49 percent of the approved investment and, in third place, the industry sector with 21,1 percent.\n\nTherefore, in terms of private investment, between our two countries, we noted with satisfaction the presence of foreign direct investment from Zimbabwean companies in Mozambique, which, although modest, expresses the willingness of businesspeople from our countries to explore intra-African investment opportunities, said the Mozambican leader.\n\nHe further noted that the two nations had vast natural resources, which they could each exploit to boost their individual economies.\n\nZimbabwe has enormous reserves of natural resources, with emphasis on arable land, forests and wildlife reserves, known worldwide, such as Victoria Falls, strategic mineral resources such as gold, lithium, copper, among others that contribute to the positioning of its economy as an economic power and source of foreign direct investment in the region, without leaving aside the role of breadbasket of the region and the continent that it played in the past, said President Chapo.\n\nMozambique, like Zimbabwe, has immense reserves of soil and subsoil resources, including 35 million hectares of arable land, availability of water, natural gas, various types of minerals, a long coastline and logistical infrastructure that facilitates access to the sea for hinterland countries in the SADC region, he added.\n\nAll investors from Zimbabwe and other countries who decide to invest in Mozambique in the various sectors, particularly agribusiness, industry, energy, tourism and hotels, infrastructure, transport and logistics, benefit from the availability of untapped resources.\n\nTurning to the ZITF experience, President Chapo said the platform was critical in promoting opportunities for co-operation and exchange in key economic areas of agriculture and agribusiness, industry, transport and logistics.\n\nWe live in a globalised world, characterised by growing multilateralism in political and economic relations in the international arena, where economic diplomacy plays a fundamental role, he said.\n\nOur presence at this prestigious business event is part of this constant search to strengthen our economic diplomacy from a bilateral and multilateral point of view.\n\nOur participation in this event also aims provides us with a platform for promoting and facilitating business partnerships and investments for companies and investors from both countries, interaction between members of both Governments for the promotion and facilitation of cross-border trade and investment, as well as the creation of a platform for exchanging information on business between Mozambique and Zimbabwe, said President Chapo.\n\n",

It caught the attention of the President himself, who paused mid-stride and turned with a smile.\n\nWho said that? he asked playfully, scanning the crowd. Tinashe, standing proudly beside her sister, waved enthusiastically. The President walked over, leaned in to greet her warmly, and, much to everyones surprise, reached into his jacket pocket and handed her a crisp US$100 note.\n\nTinashe Tsekiso Mutemi who was also given money by President Mnangagwa displays her gift\n\nA wide, beaming smile stretched across Tinashes face as she looked up at the President. Thank you so much, Your Excellency, she said, her voice filled with genuine gratitude.\n\nThe heart-warming moment sparked cheers, with some fairgoers clapping and others capturing the rare exchange on their phones.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Tinashe could hardly contain her excitement. I was so happy to see the President in real life for the first time. I shouted his name hoping he would notice me, and he did! When he gave me the money, I was surprised and happy. This will help my family. I will never forget this day.\n\nHer 13-year-old sister, Kemuso, was equally moved.I tried to hold her back when she shouted, thinking it wasnt safe with all the security around. But she kept going. We never expected the President to stop, let alone walk over and give her money. It was such a kind gesture; it touched my heart, she said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa is known for his warm connection with children, often demonstrated through his annual engagements with young people, particularly during the Independence Day Childrens Party.\n\nHosted together with the First Lady, Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa, the party celebrates the hopes and voices of the nations youngest citizens.\n\nAt these gatherings, the President is often met with cheers and affection, a reflection of the bond he has nurtured with the nations young citizens over the years.\n\n",

            "content": "Brandon Moyo, Zimpapers Sports Hub\n\nWEDNESDAY saw Zimbabwes Chevrons, the senior mens cricket team, clinch a famous and truly memorable Test victory against Bangladesh at Sylhet, winning by three wickets in a tense finish. The record-breaking chase of 174  their highest ever, surpassing 162  marked the first away Test win in seven years (also against Bangladesh at Sylhet in 2018) and the first Test victory in four years, proving emphatically that picking the best eleven makes all the difference.\n\nUnder Justin Sammons guidance, the Chevrons coaching team selected the in-form players, and the evidence was clear for all to see in this memorable victory. Each player who took to the field thoroughly deserved their place and fought tooth and nail for the win.\n\nZimbabwes three-pronged pace attack, led by Muzarabani (match figures 9 for 122) and supported by Ngarava and Nyauchi, proved crucial on a grassy wicket, a decision vindicated by skipper Ervine. Spinner Masakadza took five wickets.Despite some dropped catches by keeper Mayavo, half-centuries from Williams and Bennett, plus handy runs from others, gave Zimbabwe an 82-run first-innings lead (273). In the chase, a 95-run opening stand from Bennett and Curran, and a gutsy unbeaten 19 from Madhevere, saw them to victory (174 for 7) despite a misfiring middle order.\n\nErvine hailed the win as a confidence boost for the final Test in Chattogram.Any Test win is very important and you have to relish every win that you get. In terms of winning Test matches, that doesnt come around very often. We will certainly enjoy this but we have to get to Chattogram and get our heads right for that Test match as well.\n\nWe are really confident. Winning a Test match gives you some confidence that you can get over the line, that you can do it, especially here in Bangladesh. But when we get to Chattogram, we are going to sit down, and reassess. Mindset going there is extremely crucial especially after the win here (Sylhet), said Ervine.According to the Chevrons captain, securing more Test wins will naturally lead to more matches against the top cricketing nations, given that its the highest form of the game.\n\nThe more Test matches you win the more you are going to be on the radar. As tough as Test cricket is, that is what every player wants to play and get better at because it does test you in four or five days of hard cricket. For small teams, you want to play good and hard Test cricket against tougher oppositions, I think thats the only way you can improve as a player and as a team, said Ervine.\n\nBeyond the record chase, Muzarabani became Zimbabwes joint fastest to reach 50 Test wickets (equalling Streak in 11 matches), while Williams now boasts the longest active career in mens international cricket (20 years, 58 days by Tests end).  @brandon_malvin.\n\n",

In June of the same year, he was appointed director of transport for Gaza province.\n\nIn October 1977, he was deployed in the Gaza province Sector Two Operation Front until mid-1978 and continued

travelled to Mozambique to join the war and after enduring a perilous journey, his first encampment was at Chibawawa transit camp, where he received political training until 1978.He then underwent military training at Tembwe camp.\n\nIn late 1978, he was transferred to Posto Gogoi Training Camp and was selected to undergo a nine-month guerrilla military training programme at Tembwe Camp in Tete province.The rigorous military training regime marked his rites of passage into a full-fledged and battle-front-ready Zanla guerrilla fighter.\n\nAfter training, Cde Basopo was deployed to Zanlas security department in Manica province.He served as an assistant to the then deputy chief of Zanlas military security and intelligence.In 1979, he was involved in a road traffic accident on his way to Maputo, Mozambique, which claimed the life of Cde Vicmore.He, together with other comrades had been selected to undergo medical examinations in Maputo, ahead of departure for Yugoslavia for further military training, when tragedy struck.\n\nCde Basopo sustained serious injuries on one of his arms, which necessitated its amputation.Later in 1979, he returned to Zimbabwe during the ceasefire period, and was assigned to Mhondoro communal lands to spearhead the then Zanu political campaigns ahead of the 1980 general election,\n\nAfter independence, Cde Basopo remained focused on defending what he had fought for together with other triumphant heroes and heroines.\n\nThis abiding consciousness largely influenced his decision to be attested into the Presidents Department on November 17, 1980, under the internal branch, at the rank of trainee intelligence officer.After completing his initial training at the School of Intelligence, he was deployed to CIO Gweru.Between 1981 and 1982,

            "content": "Givemore Muzariri\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service (ZPCS)s commitment to education as a cornerstone of rehabilitation has earned praise, most notably from former inmate Admit Mbiriviri, who served time for rape.\n\nMbiriviri lauded the ZPCSs transformation into a centre of educational excellence, expressing gratitude for the noteworthy initiative that empowers individuals nationwide with academic and professional qualifications.\n\nThis positive feedback underscores the ZPCSs broader success in rehabilitation and empowerment. Beyond inmates, vocational training benefits officers, families, and communities, while qualified teachers have significantly boosted educational standards. This dedication was recently recognised at the 3rd African Education Summit in Victoria Falls, where Commissioner General Moses Cyril Ngawaite Chihobvu received a prestigious African Lives Development Award, celebrating his visionary leadership and the hard work of his staff in making the ZPCS a true agent of positive change.\n\nAdmit Mbiriviri\n\nI was imprisoned in 2015 following a serious dispute with my girlfriend, who had discovered my infidelity with a neighbour. Attempts to resolve the situation with both women were unsuccessful. Subsequently, their parents advised them to press rape charges against me as a means of resolution. Upon receiving their report, police officers apprehended me, conducted investigations, and prepared my case before my court appearance.\n\nMbiriviri recounted that while in police custody, the complainants parents approached him, demanding US$300 compensation for the betrayal of their daughter, to whom he was engaged to be married. He complied with their demand, based on their promise to withdraw the charges upon payment.\n\nUpon learning of their proposal, I was eager to comply and urged my parents to provide the demanded sum. Following the payment, however, they disappeared. Consequently, at my court appearance, I was sentenced on the benefit of the doubt, as I maintained that I was being set up for having betrayed the woman.\n\nThe former inmate recounted that upon receiving a 15-year sentence, he initially believed his life was over. However, on arrival at Khami Remand Prison, he encountered friends who informed him about the rehabilitation opportunities available to all inmates. These programmes offered him hope for the future, as he began to see his time in prison as a chance to transform his life by choosing a profession that would improve it significantly after his 15-year incarceration.\n\nAs a driver entering prison, motor mechanics and auto electronics were never a consideration. But the long sentence became an opportunity to learn. Initially struggling to accept my situation, counselling helped. Despite having five O-levels excluding maths, prison management allowed me to start a motor mechanics course, leading to workshop practice and trade tests. I passed Class Three and Two, and now await my Class One practical after completing the theory.\n\nMbiriviri said that working in the Khami workshop on diverse cars gave him extensive experience, prompting him to learn auto electronics. This led to his enrolment in a two-year electronics programme. His strong interest enabled rapid learning, allowing him to be trade tested early.\n\nLearning vehicle diagnosis in prison was challenging but my passion made it enjoyable. After motor mechanics, I immediately enrolled in a two-year auto electronics course. Working with experienced officers and inmates in the workshop allowed me to gain significant experience quickly, leading to me taking my trade test well before the course ended. My rapid understanding of auto electronics impressed my lecturers, who recommended early trade testing, and I achieved my Class Three.\n\nThe former inmate said that he was later shortlisted for presidential amnesty, six months before completing his lengthy sentence. Upon release, he returned to the community that had imprisoned him, where many judged him for the incident that led to his long stay at Khami Prison.\n\nI think the community still needs to be educated on the issue of accepting ex-convicts once they complete their jail terms because if it was not for my supportive family, I dont think I was going to stay in this community. While at home I decided to start my own company called Admit Isheanesu Motors (AIM) and this company specialises on both small and big vehicles. The company has employed one guy who is helping me on the jobs that I do, he said.\n\nMbiriviris dream is to build a workshop that can compete with large enterprises in the central business district. His immediate hurdle is obtaining the capital to buy the tools and machinery needed for the companys daily operation.\n\nTo those stillincarcerated, I urge you to seize this chance to reshape your lives for the better, as society stillexpects us to contribute to the nations development through industrialisation. It is truly encouraging that inmates are not being overlooked by the Government as we strive towards achieving Vision 2030. The skills we acquire while in prison are precisely what we are using to generate employment in our home communities, while simultaneously earning a living to provide for our families without resorting to crime, he said.\n\nMbiriviri said the award presented to Dr Chihobvu reflected his hard work in empowering communities with various essential skills, including motor mechanics, carpentry, bricklaying, and welding, to name a few. He added that these skilled individuals are contributing to the nations development by producing a range of goods for sale locally, regionally, and internationally.\n\nI must take this opportunity to thank Commissioner-General Chihobvu and his management for championing such an initiative, which has been instrumental in transforming\n\n",

            "content": "Mbulelo Mpofu\n\nAsense of unease has settled over Bulawayos creative sector, where artworks and lively performances are central to its cultural identity. The freeze on nearly all foreign aid, enacted two months ago by US President Donald Trumps executive order, has caused widespread anxiety in Africa, a continent heavily reliant on American aid. The concerning impact of the America First policy is now being felt acutely, particularly by Zimbabwes artistic community, which has historically depended on US backing to flourish.\n\nAmid this backdrop, US Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Pamela Tremont, took centre stage at the Natural History Museum during the Fulbright Scholar Annual Address, where she provided clarity on the future of US foreign aid and its impact on the artistic and cultural landscape.\n\nThe event featured a compelling presentation by Dr Jennifer Kyker, an Associate Professor of Ethnomusicology from the University of Rochester, who showcased digitised long-lost photographs by the late renowned Zimbabwean photographer, Chicago Dzviti.\n\nUS Ambassador Tremont and Bulawayo Mayor, Councillor David Coltart\n\nIn a candid exclusive interview with Saturday Leisure, Ambassador Tremont reassured creatives that while US support is undergoing a transformation, assistance for creative work continuesat least for now.\n\nUnder our new administration, we are shifting more from an assistance-based relationship to one based on partnership. Some of our assistance programmes are still continuing, especially the life-saving programmes such as providing HIV medication and emergency food assistance. The vast majority of our cultural programmes are continuing, for now, she said.\n\nHowever, she tempered this optimism with a note of caution, highlighting the uncertainty that lies ahead.\n\nNow, the caveat to all of that is that our programmes are still under review. We have about six more months left of this school year, so we dont know yet what comes in the forthcoming year. But at the moment, we are still getting a lot of mileage out of our support for creatives and for our exchange programmes, she said.\n\nUS Ambassador Pamela Tremont (centre) poses for a photograph with Bulawayo Mayor, Councillor David Coltart (left) during a ride through Matopo Hills\n\nAs Zimbabwes creative sector grapples with the looming threat of funding cuts, voices from the arts community echo the sense of urgency. With funding sources drying up, many artists fear a potential collapse of the vibrant cultural scene that has flourished through international collaboration. Notably, the US has been a steadfast benefactor of diverse arts programmes across Africa.\n\nLast year, local hip-hop artiste Tafadzwa Asaph Afrika Tarukwana had the honour of representing Zimbabwe at the Next Level Global event, a cross-cultural creative exchange organised by the US Department of State and the Meridian International Centre.\n\nOn a brighter note, the US Embassy in Zimbabwe showcased its commitment to cultural exchange by collaborating with the British Council to host the second edition of the Bulawayo Creative Showcase at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe (NGZ) in Bulawayo yesterday (Friday).\n\nThis event, a celebration of artistry and innovation, featured a stellar line-up of performers, including returning artist Indigo Saint, Charles Mahlaba, Brintz, Noluntu J, Novuyo Seagirl, Kyla Blac, Kereng, Lemmzy Beats, Asaph Afrika, and MJ Sings.\n\nAmbassador Tremont, enjoying her first ZITF after her assumption of her diplomatic duty in Zimbabwe, said she has a soft spot for Matabeleland, particularly Bulawayo and the Matobo Hills area where she cycled with Bulawayo Mayor, Councillor David Coltart, to keep fit and discuss investment opportunities in the tourism landscape.\n\nLast year, she spearheaded the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP) to ensure rock art at the Matobo area is preserved for posteritys sake, a sure testament to her dedication to the countrys artistic and cultural scene.\n\n Follow on X @MbuleloMpofu.\n\n",
