            "content": "Sikhumbuzo Moyo,[emailprotected]\n\nTHE Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) has warned the nation over the planned protests by none progressive elements noting that such protests had the danger of disrupting business operations and cause economic instability.\n\nThe national retailers body said while it recognise the right to peaceful demonstration as enshrined in theConstitution, it has been consistently seen that protests in Zimbabwe often result in unintended consequences, including disruptions to business operations, economic instability, and hardship for ordinary citizens.\n\nZimbabwe has experienced numerous protests in the past, and history shows that they have rarely led to constructive solutions but have instead caused significant damage to businesses and livelihoods, said the Confederation president Mr Denford Mutashu, citing the January 1998 protests, led by the Zimbabwe Congress of\n\nTrade Unions under the late Morgan Tsvangirai that resulted in widespread looting and destruction.\n\nHe said many businesses were targeted and shops were ransacked with essential goods such as meat being looted, forcing some enterprises to shut down permanently.Similarly, in October 2000, protests against price increases degenerated into violent riots, causing significant economic disruptions. More recently, in August 2016, demonstrations in Harare led to businesses being looted, property damaged, and innocent traders affected.\n\nThe reality is that protests have often harmed businesses and the economy more than they have addressed the concerns they were meant to highlight, said Mr Mutashu.CZR said those who do not participate in protests especially businesses and workers often bear the brunt of the disruptions, while the economic damage lingers long after the demonstrations have ended.\n\nCZR believes that dialogue remains the most effective way to address national concerns. Zimbabwes economy thrives on stability, investorconfidence, and a supportive business environment, all of which are undermined by unrest.\n\nHe said while grievances may exist, the Confederation strongly encourages engagement between all stakeholders; Government, business, civil society,and concerned groups to find lasting and inclusive solutions.\n\nMr Mutashu said the retail and wholesale sector plays a critical role in Zimbabwes economy,ensuring the availability of essential goods and services while supporting thousands of jobs.\n\nOur priority is to maintain an environment where businesses can operate smoothly, securely, and without disruption. Weurge all parties to consider the broader impact of protests especially on businesses that provide livelihoods for many Zimbabweans, said Mr Mutashu.\n\nHe said the CZR calls upon organizers and participants of the planned 31 March2025 protests to consider peaceful, lawful, and constructive avenues for addressing their concerns.\n\nHe urged stakeholders to come together for dialogue while ensuring that the interests of all Zimbabweans especially workers,consumers, and businesses are protected and prioritised.\n\nMr Mutashu said social unrest and disobedience are not the easy or effective routes topeaceful resolution of national political, socio-economic, and community challenges.\n\nDialogue remains the most viable and effective means ofresolving grievances. By working together, we can address challenges without resorting to actions that may cause long-term harm to businesses, communities, and the broader economy.\n\nThe CZR stands for peace, tranquility, and development and remains committed to fostering a Zimbabwe that thrives on collaboration andunderstanding. We believe that by working together, we can chart a path toward a prosperous and stable future for all, said Mr Mutashu.\n\n",

            "content": "Ray Bande and Lovemore Kadzura\n\nGOVERNMENT is crafting modalities to start paying teachers for invigilating public examinations, a Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education official has confirmed.\n\nTeachers were not being paid for their work during examinations, while other service providers such as security providers were being paid for their duties during the Zimbabwe Schools Examination Council (ZIMSEC) examination processes.\n\nThis situation prompted some School Development Committees (SDCs) to step in and offer incentives to teachers to ensure that exams run smoothly as, without payment, some teachers refused to cooperate and invigilate external candidates, while those who did were often mocked by their colleagues for working for nothing.\n\nIn an interview on the sidelines of a Learning Passport tour of schools in some parts of Manicaland Province this week, Director of Communication and Advocacy in the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, Mr Taungana Ndoro confirmed that Government is seized with the matter.\n\nThe issue of invigilation and payment of teachers for that task (examination invigilation) has been discussed for a while. We are happy that the Zimbabwe Schools Examination Council led by Dr Nembaware has gone on a benchmarking exercise throughout Africa and other countries to find out how best to treat invigilators. So we are hopeful that they will come up with a win-win situation for the issues raised by the teachers about invigilators and their welfare. It is really under consideration, and we are hopeful that something positive will come out of that, said Mr Ndoro.\n\nZIMSEC spokesperson, Ms Nicky Dhlamini said the decision to pay the invigilators rests with the Primary and Secondary Education Ministry, which employees teachers.\n\nZIMSEC actually engaged teachers and the parent ministry way back in 2018 when this issue was first raised, to which the ministry gave a response. ZIMSEC stands guided by the ministry as the main shareholder and parent ministry. So, until such a directive is given by the ministry, ZIMSEC cannot give any direction. Teachers are invigilating at their stations of work so the direction comes from their employer, said Ms Dhlamini.\n\nApparently, some teacher representative organisations had raised with the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education the issue of paying invigilators.\n\nIn its submission to ZIMSEC Strategic Planning Review Sessions of 2025, Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) noted: ZIMSEC must engage teachers through signed contracts. This protects the rights of teachers engaged in ZIMSEC business so that they will not be subjected to abuse. The contracts must clearly spell out the conditions of service and allowances to be paid thereafter.\n\nAll those engaged in ZIMSEC business must be paid as what happened with other parastatals which engage teachers each time they want their services. A case to note is the non-payment of invigilation by ZIMSEC. Invigilation must be paid for, and any teacher who is engaged in invigilation of ZIMSEC examinations must be paid reasonable allowances using standard rates. ZIMSEC has the temerity of paying police officers, resident monitors, item writers and others, but refuses to pay the invigilator who is subjected to a tempting and strenuous exercise which validates the whole examination process.\n\nIn addition to the above, invigilators are subjected to a barrage of rules and regulations, some of which are harsh for those with chronic diseases. For example, an invigilator is not supposed to sit down, is supposed to be standing even if the paper is two or three hours long. We view this as some form of punishment.\n\nPTUZ also submitted that teachers who design CALAs and supervised the recently introduced School Based Projects must also be paid.\n\nTeachers who designed CALAs and supervise the recently introduced School-Based Projects (SBPs) must be paid by ZIMSEC. Honestly, ZIMSEC cannot pay those moderating the CALAs and SBPs and deliberately ignore the teachers doing the donkey work, wrote PTUZ.\n\nZimbabwe Rural Teachers Union (ZRTU) president, Mr Martin Chaburumunda admitted that the issue of paying invigilators has been topical for a long time, and it is high time such concerns are addressed.\n\nThis is a very contentious issue in schools. It is long overdue as we have been complaining as unions that teachers who perform ZIMSEC duties should be paid. Some teachers, especially those teaching practical subjects, start the examination process two or three months before, monitoring learners and safe keeping their products.\n\nEveryone involved in the examination process must be paid because ZIMSEC charges learners to sit the examinations, yet teachers, who make sure that there is order before, during and after exams are not considered.\n\nTeachers work for Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, and not ZIMSEC, which they are being made to provide services for free. If ZIMSEC pays the teachers who do the marking and compiling, why not those who invigilate. We will really appreciate if there are moves to bring this outstanding matter to fruition, said Mr Chaburumunda.\n\nWelfare and Educational Institutions Employers Association Manicaland regional officer, Mr Caiphas Maduku said SDCs should not be arm-twisted to pay for invigilation of ZIMSEC exams.He said it was inappropriate for SDCs to use school fees or centre fees to pay invigilators as all school budgets must be approved by the ministry.\n\nSchools using fees money to pay teachers for ZIMSEC examinations are breaking the law. Schools have budgets approved by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, and if that component is highlighted in the budget then they can go ahead. If it is not highlighted and not approved, then it amounts to misappropriation of funds. It will be a good idea that ZIMSEC pays invigilators so that fees paid by parents is not touched. The fees paid by parents has nothing to do with ZIMSEC, said Mr Maduku.\n\n",
