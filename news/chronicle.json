            "content": "Danisa Masuku, Online Reporter\n\nRodney Tongai Jindu has been sentenced to two life sentences by High Court Judge Justice Nokuthula Moyo for the murder of two close friends in one of Zimbabwes most chilling criminal cases.\n\nJindu was convicted of killing Cyprian Kudzurunga and Mboneli Ncube in 2017. According to court records, he shot Kudzurunga and buried his body at a plot in Burnside, Bulawayo. Days later, he murdered Ncube, dismembered the body, and attempted to destroy the remains by burning and disposing of them.\n\nThe High Court found Jindu guilty of two counts of murder with actual intent committed under aggravating circumstances, citing premeditation and the extreme brutality involved. During sentencing, Jindu reportedly broke down in tears as the verdict was delivered.\n\nInitially sentenced to death in 2018, Jindu appealed the ruling. However, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentence.\n\nJustice Moyos ruling effectively replaces the death sentence with two life terms, ensuring that Jindu will remain incarcerated for the rest of his life.\n\nAs of 2025, he was among 48 inmates on death row in Zimbabwe.\n\nHowever, he escaped the hangman when the death sentence was repealed in 2024.\n\n",

Surprisingly, Mhlanga was reinstated under unclear circumstances, and the hearing was eventually dropped.\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, many parents and staff members are anxious to see how these developments will affect the schools future and the education of its students.\n\nMore to follow\n\n",

His ease and comfort in the environment suggested that this was no longer just a gig; it was personal.\n\nHe kicked off his performance behind the decks, delivering an electrifying set that had the audience on their feet. Adding a creative twist, he also took on the role of photographer during the show, capturing moments with fans and engaging closely with the crowd.\n\nAt one point, Maphuma was spotted dancing and exchanging greetings with local music star Mzoe7, a moment that highlighted the growing camaraderie and creative synergy between Zimbabwean and South African artistes.\n\nHaving performed in Harare multiple times this year and in Bulawayo earlier, Maphumas evolution was evident. Unlike his earlier visits, where he seemed uncertain and disconnected, this time around, he was fully in his element, bold, confident, and clearly at home.\n\nScotts Maphumas comfort and growing fan base in Zimbabwe suggests he is here to stay.\n\n",

            "content": "Chronicle Correspondent\n\nQUEEN Nandi Place, a new multi-purpose tourism and hospitality facility, has been established in Victoria Falls to promote destination Zimbabwe through collaboration among tourism players while tapping into Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Events (MICE).\n\nVictoria Falls Safari Collection, operated by Africa Albida Tourism (AAT), has developed Queen Nandi Place on its estate in Victoria Falls, where it also runs six major businesses: Victoria Falls Safari Lodge, Victoria Falls Safari Club, Victoria Falls Safari Suites, Lokuthula Lodges, The Boma  Dinner & Drum Show, and Victoria Falls Safari Spa. Queen Nandi Place takes its name from Queen Nandi, the mother of Zulu King Shaka.\n\nAATs facilities in Victoria Falls are inspired by Ndebele culture, a central theme in their designs.\n\nSpeaking to tourism executives at the recent official opening ceremony, AATs head of sales and marketing, Mr Anald Musonza, called upon industry players to collaborate and reap the benefits of MICE tourism.\n\nDestinations that are thriving are those that share travel information. We need to share information and work collectively as a destination to ensure we secure big business. We must collaborate, not compete.\n\nAs a business, we made a strategic decision to invest in MICE infrastructure, and this is a new product we have developed for the destination. So, today marks the official launch of Queen Nandi Place, an inspiring multi-purpose venue designed for impactful events and unforgettable experiences. We believe this will help fill up accommodation in the destination.\n\nThis is a multi-purpose facility for dining experiences, meetings, gala dinners, weddings, wellness, and fitness events. This is our contribution to the development of infrastructure, and we believe it aligns with the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1). We intend to focus on high-end events; we dont want to compete with existing businesses but rather bring in new opportunities, said Mr Musonza.\n\nHe stressed that the MICE business brings together the entire destination, including travel, aviation, culinary, leisure, and business and generates billions of United States dollars globally. Hence, there is a need for the local tourism industry to align with market and growth trends.\n\nQueen Nandi Place can accommodate up to 200 people. It is the second events facility on the Victoria Falls Safari Lodge estate, after the 100-seater Indaba Conference Room, which is being renovated to expand its capacity to accommodate up to 150 people.\n\nTwo 50-seater breakaway rooms will also be constructed to complement the MICE facilities on the estate.\n\nThis allows us to bid for niche events that require modern facilities. We are creating new business and employment opportunities for the community. The entire supply value chain benefits; for instance, visitors may also go on village tours or purchase souvenirs. Even the local council benefits from revenue, as businesses pay rates and bills to the City of Victoria Falls, said Mr Musonza.\n\nHe added that the facility was built with 90 percent local materials, thereby boosting the local Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and supporting the downstream industry.\n\nTourism Business Council of Zimbabwe representative, Mrs Barbara Murasiranwa-Hughes, stated that with the right facilities and marketing, Victoria Falls will become a destination of choice.\n\nMICE tourism is effective, but we have not fully explored it yet. What has been lacking was marketing and facilities, and with this new venue, it will undoubtedly help increase traffic to the destination.\n\nVictoria Falls has generally done well, and the service we provide is a cut above the rest. With new facilities coming up, we have realised that we need more players in the sector rather than competing against each other, she said.\n\nMs Kerrith OFee, who runs Yoga wellness activities, said: We have a very strong partnership with the Victoria Falls Safari Collection, and together we aim to market MICE tourism. This is a niche sector, and we want to bring a new way of travelling and help Victoria Falls grow.\n\nMs Tina Mubwandarikwa, founder of Ayana Africa Travel, shared that she already has a group lined up to use the new MICE venue.\n\nWe are particularly interested in the MICE sector, especially incentives and events, and thats where Victoria Falls Safari Lodge comes in. Victoria Falls is no longer just a safari destination; it also offers wellness, meetings, food, sport, and much more. We are marketing the facility to groups, and I see tremendous growth in tourism due to meetings and conferences, she said.\n\n",

The content is being constantly updated to ensure visitors are provided with diverse and rich information about the countrys natural endowments.\n\nUnder the theme Beyond the Limit, Zimbabwe has adopted a hybrid approach to engage the highly technology-savvy Japanese market, where more than 25 million people are expected to visit the expo, with approximately three million anticipated from international markets.\n\nThe country is leveraging its tourism sector as a key attraction to win over these markets, as many people are being mesmerised by Zimbabwes unique tourist destinations, such as the magnificent Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, and the countrys abundant flora and fauna.\n\nZimbabwes exhibitions are centred on three key pillars: (a) Trade with Zimbabwe  exploring trade opportunities; (b) Invest in Zimbabwe  assisting business communities in and outside Japan to discover investment opportunities; and (c) Visit Zimbabwe  showcasing the countrys natural beauty.\n\nSpeaking to Zimbabwean journalists, Zimbabwes Ambassador to Japan, Ambassador Stuwart Nyakotyo, stated that expectations for the country are very high.\n\nLet me begin by thanking our leadership, His Excellency President Dr E.D. Mnangagwa, as well as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Professor Amon Murirwa, and our Cabinet, for making it possible for Zimbabwe to be among the 170 countries exhibiting here. Our leadership deemed it appropriate to be among many nations to showcase our potential in investment, tourism, and trade. Consequently, we have high expectations that this Expo will connect Zimbabwe with all strategic partners. We have already witnessed interest from various individuals who have visited our pavilion and made enquiries regarding tourism and investment.\n\nZimbabwes Commissioner-General to the Expo, Mr Allan Majuru, explained that unlike many other exhibiting countries, Zimbabwe decided to go digital to provide exhibitors with fresh content daily until the Expos conclusion.\n\nThe issue of going digital, I believe, is crucial given the space limitations here  just 55 square metres.\n\nHowever, the most important aspect is to reach our visitors effectively. We are here for six months, and it would not be ideal to showcase the same content from April to October. Therefore, the digital approach allows us to create content that keeps our clients engaged and ensures they learn more about Zimbabwe and the general business landscape. We agreed as a team that our pavilion should be engaging, which is why we opted for a virtual approach, he said.\n\n",
