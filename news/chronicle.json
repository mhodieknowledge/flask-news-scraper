            "url": "https://www.chronicle.co.zw/tiktok-shuts-down-in-the-united-states-hours-ahead-of-a-ban/",
            "content": "TikTok went offline in the United States Saturday night, less than two hours before a ban was slated to go into effect. The extraordinary blackout prevents access to one of the worlds most popular social media apps  one that had been used by 170 million Americans.\n\nVisitors to the app were met with a message reading: Sorry, TikTok isnt available right now. A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you cant use TikTok for now.\n\nTikToks action comes after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a ban that was passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress and signed into law in April by President Joe Biden. The law prevents American companies from hosting or serving content for the Chinese-owned social media platform unless it sells itself to a buyer from the United States or one of its allies.\n\nBut TikTok may not be gone for long. The company suggested it could be back soon  perhaps as early as Monday.\n\nWe are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office, the company posted in its pop-up message to users who opened the app beginning late Saturday night. Please stay tuned!\n\nPresident-elect Trump said he will most likely delay a ban on TikTok for 90 days after he takes office on Monday, adding that he has not made a final decision in a phone interviewwith NBC Newson Saturday.\n\nI think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at. The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because its appropriate. You know, its appropriate. We have to look at it carefully. Its a very big situation, Trump said in the interview.\n\nIf I decide to do that, Ill probably announce it on Monday, he added.\n\nThe blackout from TikTok  and the suggestion that it could soon restore its service  is the latest twist in a saga thats dragged on for months, leaving the fate of the app in limbo.\n\nThe app also has disappeared from Apples App Store and the Google Play store. And other apps owned by TikToks parent company, ByteDance  including CapCut  also displayed a similar message Saturday night.\n\nLawmakers said TikToks ties to China and its access to reams of data posed a threat to national security.\n\nMany US users told CNN they were bracing for an end to the app, including influencers and other small businesses that said theydepended on the platform for a living. Still, they said, they held out hope the app would somehow be saved.\n\nBut the Supreme Courts decision dashed hopes of a last-second judicial assist.\n\nSome of the companies that operate app stores and run computer servers are said to be concerned that they will be held liable for violating terms of the ban. Those service providers pledged to stop carrying the app to avoid legal consequences, a person familiar with companies discussions told CNN.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump  who first warned of TikToks dangers five years ago  is now casting himself as the apps savior. Earlier this month, on his Truth Social account, he posted stats about his own popularity on TikTok and asked, Why would I want to get rid of TikTok?\n\nTikToks CEO Shou Chew has met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in the weeks leading up to the ban taking effect and is expected to attend Trumps inauguration on Monday.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Saturday.\n\nThe law passed last year allows the president to delay the ban from going into effect by 90 days but requires evidence that parties working to arrange a sale of TikTok to a US-owned company have made significant progress.\n\nBut TikToks owner, ByteDance, has rejected would-be buyers. The company has cited its popularity among American users, and its value to small businesses across the country, as it fights to stay online without any change in ownership.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruled, 9-0, to uphold the ban, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre signaled the administration wouldnt enforce the law on Bidens final day in office.\n\nDue to the federal holiday weekend and the inauguration, actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next administration, she said.\n\nBut TikTok wasnt satisfied by that statement. According to a person familiar with the matter, some service providers  companies like Google and Apple that would face exorbitant fines for allowing US access to TikTok once the ban takes effect  told TikTok they believed they were vulnerable under the law starting Sunday.\n\nA person close to TikTok says multiple critical service providers indicated to TikTok that they would no longer carry the app or its data, which forced the app offline. The service providers cited fears that the ban might be enforced starting Sunday, despite the Biden administrations signals to the contrary.\n\nSo TikTok took action to take the app down  at least for now.\n\nThe move, and the pop-up naming Trump, could put even more pressure on the president-elect to negotiate a solution in the days or weeks to come.\n\nTikTok employees were also told by the company on Saturday that the situation was disappointing but that the company was working on a solution.\n\nWe know this is disappointing for you not only as employees, but as users. However, we are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please know our teams are working tirelessly to bring our app back to the U.S. as soon as possible, read the message to employees.\n\nA White House source reiterated to CNN that there will not be any fines by the Biden administration associated with keeping TikTok active on Sunday.\n\nAt the same time, however, some Biden officials are content with TikTok going dark for a day, since the law was passed with strong support from both parties.\n\nThe decision is going to be made by the next president anyway, Biden told reporters Friday.\n\nOn Saturday, the White House called TikToks warning about going dark a stunt.\n\nWe see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday, Jean-Pierre said. We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson had no immediate reaction to the statement from the White House.\n\nThe company said it expected service providers  like companies that operate servers full of videos  to restrict access to the app at 12:01 a.m. ET on Sunday.\n\nOn Apple and Googles app stores, the most popular free apps for the past week have been TikTok-like apps, including two that are also owned by Chinese companies. One of them, photo-sharing app Lemon8, is owned by ByteDance, just like TikTok. But Lemon8 may have the same fate as TikTok in the future.\n\nGiven Trumps public remarks about TikTok any blackout may not last long.\n\nTrump is said to be considering issuing an executive order that could effectively pause the ban and provide some time to sort out a long-term solution.\n\nBut he will face pressure from multiple directions. Some Republican senators, like Josh Hawley of Missouri and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, remain strongly supportive of the ban.\n\nByteDance and its Chinese Communist masters had nine months to sell TikTok before the Sunday deadline, Cotton wrote on X. The very fact that Communist China refuses to permit its sale reveals exactly what TikTok is: a communist spy app.\n\nAnalyst Richard Greenfield of LightShed Partners, who has long followed the TikTok saga, anticipates that TikTok will ultimately stay online in the United States.\n\nOn Saturday, Perplexity AI, a San Francisco-based AI search-engine startup, confirmed to CNN that it submitted a bid to ByteDance to merge with TikTok.\n\nSource: CNN\n\n",

A disproportionate number of these infections were among women aged 2039, highlighting a concerning trend in this demographic.\n\nIn 2023, 2 527 individuals were tested for HIV, leading to 157 new positive cases, with the majority of infections recorded in young women aged 2029. In contrast, data from January to November 2024 indicates that 2 708 individuals were tested, resulting in 130 new infections, with most cases affecting women aged 3039.This represents a decline in new infections from 6,2 percent in 2023 to 4,8percent in 2024, even as the number of individuals tested increased by 7,16 percent.\n\nHowever, the hospital has observed a decrease in the number of patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

            "content": "Online Writer\n\nTHE City of Bulawayo is battling significant challenges in waste management, including vehicle shortages, landfill hazards, and by-law enforcement issues, as highlighted during the November 2024 council meeting, contained in the latest council report.\n\nCouncillors and officials outlined a series of logistical and environmental issues requiring urgent attention to safeguard public health and maintain the citys reputation for cleanliness.\n\nA report tabled during the meeting revealed that only half of the citys 16 refuse trucks are operational, while the other half are out of service. The lone skip hauler, critical for managing high-volume waste areas, remains non-functional, alongside other vital machinery such as tipper trucks.\n\nThese shortages are severely affecting service delivery, noted the Director of Health Services Dr Edwin Mzingwane. Efforts are underway to assemble our own skip hauler, but this will not address the immediate challenges of waste accumulation in high-demand areas.\n\nCouncillor S. Moyo expressed frustration over the lack of progress: High-volume areas no longer have skip bins, and residents are resorting to illegal dumping. This is unacceptable for a city like Bulawayo, which prides itself on cleanliness.\n\nThe Trenance Landfill site, which has been plagued by recurring fires, is posing serious health hazards for nearby residents. Councillor A.R. Moyo raised the alarm during the meeting: The smoke from these fires is affecting the surrounding communities. This is a health disaster waiting to happen.\n\nCllr Moyo proposed innovative solutions to mitigate the risks. The only sustainable way forward is waste-to-energy generation, he said. Relocating the landfill is not an option as it would cost over US$1.8 million. Instead, maintaining the current site and procuring equipment for US$950,000 is more feasible.\n\nThe Director of Health Services added that improved recycling could significantly reduce waste going to the landfill. Currently, only 5 percent of waste is being recycled, yet this could dramatically decrease the volume of waste and reduce fire risks, he said.\n\nStaff shortages in the Central Business District (CBD) have also been blamed for worsening waste management. We currently have only two cleansing supervisors for the entire CBD, said the Dr Mzingwane. This is clearly insufficient.\n\nCllr Moyo praised the citys enforcement of anti-littering by-laws but pointed out obstacles. Political interference is making enforcement difficult, she said. We need a stronger presence on the ground and more support from stakeholders to address lawlessness.\n\nThe council confirmed that it is recruiting security guards to enhance by-law enforcement, with training expected to begin later this month.\n\nA consultative meeting involving stakeholders is planned for January 2025 to address landfill management and explore waste-to-energy partnerships. For these initiatives to succeed, we need partners, Cllr Moyo said.\n\nIn the interim, the council has approached the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) to expedite the hiring of equipment. Additionally, skip bins will be reinstated in high-demand areas, particularly as waste levels increase during the farm produce season.\n\nWhile Bulawayos leadership remains committed to addressing these challenges, councillors stressed the need for swift action. If we do not invest in adequate machinery and enforce our by-laws more effectively, these problems will only escalate, Cllr Moyo warned.\n\nWith solutions such as recycling, waste-to-energy initiatives, and enhanced enforcement, Bulawayo has the opportunity to set a benchmark for sustainable urban waste management in Zimbabwe. However, success will depend on timely implementation and collective effort.\n\n",

After the delivery, a nurse took the child for cleaning and returned it to the mother.\n\nThe mother, who had been taking photographs of her son, noticed the babys identification tag indicated it was a girl, said the source close to the woman, who lives in Cowdray Park.\n\nInitially unaware of the discrepancy, the new mother immediately alerted the nurse, expressing her concern. However, the nurse dismissed her concerns, suggesting that the effects of the anaesthesia for the Caesarean section might have clouded her judgment.\n\nAccording to the source, another expectant mother had been admitted to the ward just fifteen minutes before the operation, but she had already been discharged by the time the alert mother raised the alarm.\n\nShe contacted her relatives to inform them of the situation. Her uncle suggested DNA testing, but the nurse vehemently opposed the idea, claiming it was too expensive and unaffordable for the family. However, the uncle insisted, and they proceeded with the testing at a laboratory in the Bulawayo city centre. The results unequivocally confirmed that the baby girl was not her biological child.\n\nFurious, the family returned to the hospital, demanding answers and demanding the return of their biological son. Hospital staff were compelled to locate the other mother, who resided in Esigodini, Umzingwane District.\n\nA hospital vehicle was dispatched to retrieve her.However, the womans husband was unco-operative, adamantly insisting that the child was his.The police were subsequently involved, and the couple was brought to Bulawayo.\n\nAt the insistence of the aggrieved family, the hospital engaged the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) for DNA testing. The results unequivocally confirmed that the two babies had been exchanged.\n\nZephania Dlamini, head of the Applied Genetics Testing Centre at Nust, confirmed this shocking discovery.In the Bulawayo cases, two women who were in the same ward at UBH delivered around the same time.\n\nThe complainant asserted that her child was a boy, but when it was returned after cleaning, she was given a girl.Dlamini further said that when confronted with the discrepancy, the other mother adamantly insisted that her child was indeed a boy, a claim vehemently supported by her husband.\n\nHe even insisted that the ultrasound scan had confirmed the sex of the child as male. Before approaching Nust, the complainant had sought testing at Global DNA lab in the city centre, which confirmed that the baby girl was not hers.Our results corroborated these findings. Subsequent testing on the couple claiming to be the parents of the boy yielded negative results, while the boys DNA matched that of the complainant, and the girls DNA matched that of the other woman, said Dlamini.\n\nDr William Busumani\n\nDlamini revealed that the entire hospital administration was present at the laboratory during the testing process. UBH chief medical officer, William Busumani, declined to comment on the incident.\n\nWe do not discuss patient information, he stated.Maphios Siamuchembu, Provincial Medical Director for Bulawayo Metropolitan Province, said he was not aware of any reports of baby swapping from UBH.\n\nRenowned medical expert, Solwayo Ngwenya, described baby-swapping errors as tragic but avoidable with proper diligence.Receiving a child who is not your own is a devastating experience, particularly from a cultural perspective. In private medical practice, staff are rigorously trained to prevent such occurrences, and the lower volume of deliveries facilitates closer monitoring. We strive to ensure such errors never occur in private healthcare settings, as they would severely damage the institutions reputation, said Ngwenya.\n\nProfessor Solwayo Ngwenya\n\nHe stressed the importance of rigorous procedures in ensuring that each newborn is correctly identified and returned to their biological mother.\n\nImmediately after birth, each baby should be assigned a unique identification tag. This, combined with meticulous attention to detail and adherence to established protocols, is crucial in preventing these tragic errors.\n\nThere are likely many individuals who have been unknowingly raised by parents who are not their biological parents due to similar incidents. These individuals may have grown up in entirely different environments, speaking different languages, leading to profound and unforeseen consequences.\n\nNgwenya urged healthcare institutions to prioritise staff training on the importance of accurate newborn identification.These tragic incidents are entirely preventable. By adhering to strict protocols and maintaining a vigilant approach, we can ensure that such errors do not occur, Ngwenya stressed.\n\nThe case raises serious concerns about the potential for similar incidents to have occurred undetected, particularly among families who may not have the financial resources to pursue DNA testing.\n\nRichard Ndebele, a cultural expert, said that baby swapping was unheard of in the past due to the traditional system of village midwives.\n\nThose involved in such an act must be prepared to face the consequences, as misfortune may befall both the child and themselves. The child may experience difficulties throughout their life, and the perpetrators may face the wrath of their ancestors, Ndebele warned.\n\nHe further explained that traditional birth rites cannot be effectively performed for a child who is not biologically related to the family, as the ancestors would not recognise the child.\n\nThere can be no righteousness in such an act of deception. You may deceive mortal beings, but the ancestors will be aware of your actions, and any rituals performed will be rendered meaningless.\n\nMargaret Makumbe, a retired nurse with a distinguished career spanning four decades and delivering over 10 000 babies, stressed the unwavering commitment to excellence that characterised her profession.\n\nShe highlighted the paramount importance of meticulous attention to detail, a skill that every nurse and supervisor had to master to prevent any medical errors, such as the tragic case of a mother being mistakenly given the wrong baby.\n\nIn my entire career, I never experienced that wherever I was deployed, neither did I hear of it anywhere else and I think this was because we did what we did out of love. I just wonder how such a mistake can happen because once a baby is delivered the mother is shown the child before its taken away for cleaning with a name tag already strapped on the wrist, said Makumbe who at one time while at Mpilo delivered an incredible 15 babies in a single night.\n\n",
