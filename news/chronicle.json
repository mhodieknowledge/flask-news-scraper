Despite pleading not guilty, he was found guilty based on overwhelming evidence, including a medical report confirming sexual abuse and visible injuries.\n\nIn passing sentence, Ms Mkandla said the offender inflicted severe psychological trauma on the victim.\n\nThe medical report confirmed that the offender sexually abused the victim and there were noticeable injuries. The court has no reason to doubt the victims evidence and the offender has no defence to proffer, she stated.\n\nThe prosecutor, Ms Nomthandazo Mafu said the incident occurred on October 20 last year at around 4PM. The victim and her cousin had visited their grandmother, who lived with the accused. The following night, the grandmother left to attend to a sick relative, leaving the two girls in the custody of the offender. With only one bedroom hut available, all three had been sharing the same sleeping space.\n\nWhile the victim was asleep, the offender undressed and raped her, muffling her screams by covering her mouth with his hands. After the assault, he fled the hut, said Ms Mafu.\n\nThe victims cousin was awakened by her cries, and the traumatised girl recounted the ordeal.\n\nIn aggravation, the prosecution argued that the offenders position of authority and trust over the minor made the crime particularly egregious.\n\nThe offender had authority and direct influence as a result, and the aggravating factors far outweigh the mitigating ones, said Mafu.\n\n",
