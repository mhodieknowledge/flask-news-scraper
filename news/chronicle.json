The event, taking place in Nkayi from Friday to Saturday, will recognise individuals from various fields for their contributions to the community.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the event, Nyathi, who is based in South Africa, expressed his excitement about returning home after 11 years. Growing up in the streets of Emganwini and Sizinda in Bulawayo, Nyathi later relocated to rural Bulilima, koMasendu, before eventually moving to the neighbouring country.Im excited to come back home and step on the soil that gave birth to me. This is an opportunity for me to stand barefoot on the land of my ancestors. Nothing is more important to me right now; the fact that I am home means everything.\n\nAs he prepares to step onto home soil once again, Nyathi is overwhelmed with gratitude, cherishing the moment as a profound homecoming.\n\nBeing at my birthplace, at home, is priceless. This is the one place where, even without a passport, I dont have to prove who I am. Here, I am free and truly accepted, he said.\n\nNyathi revealed that the personal invitation from Chief Dakamela was deeply meaningful to him, especially as he had struggled with imposter syndrome and confidence issues earlier in his career.For a long time, I felt like I wasnt acknowledged enough in Zimbabwe  I felt unseen. This invitation reassures me that my people have always had my back. Many have told me they thought I was unreachable, so this event is very important to me, he said.\n\nThe actor sees the occasion as an opportunity to connect with fellow creatives and industry professionals, which could lead to new collaborations.This event provides a chance to interact and network with people from different backgrounds. You never know what opportunities may come from this, he added.\n\nFor Nyathi, the recognition from Chief Dakamela holds special significance.If the head of a household acknowledges you, it means the entire community also sees you. That is a great honour, he said.\n\nWith the Imiklomelo kaDakamela Awards set to bring together influential figures from across various sectors, Nyathis presence at the event is a powerful reminder of the importance of home, heritage, and recognition.\n\n",

There will be at the time a lot of travellers who will have to be processed through our ports of entry, he said.\n\nDiscussions on migration and border security that will unfold today will, without doubt, prepare us to deal with the influx of such a high volume of travellers. As we gather here today, we are reminded of the complexities and challenges of managing borders in the 21st century.\n\nThe world is becoming increasingly interconnected, and the movement of people, goods, and services across borders is on the rise. This presents both opportunities and challenges for the BMA and for our stakeholders.\n\nHe said the BMA primarily exists to secure South Africas borders and concurrently facilitate legitimate movement of people and goods in all ports of entry and border law enforcement areas.\n\nHe said he organisation was working in collaboration with Government departments including; Home Affairs, Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, South African Police Service (SAPS), the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), and the South African Revenue Service (SARS).\n\nContrary to what some people consider to be the functions of the BMA, Dr Masiapato said their function is not just about stamping passports at the ports of entry, but they play a crucial role in facilitating the smooth movement of people, goods, and services across borders while ensuring the safety and security of the country.\n\nSome of the key functions include managing environmental, port health, agriculture, immigration and general border law enforcement related issues, he said.\n\nWe have also screened millions of travellers who destined for South Africa in the last 24 months for infectious and communicable diseases (those we picked up with diseases have been referred to medical facilities for further medical attention) and have also confiscated a lot of undesirable Agricultural products and got them destroyed.\n\n",
