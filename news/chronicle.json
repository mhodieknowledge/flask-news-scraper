Brownfields are quiet difficult because most of these areas are owned by private sector.\n\nHe said one of the Greenfield projects was Umvumila area, a virgin piece of land covering about 188 hectares and it will be managed by the Council as the operator in terms of getting an operator license, while this meant it becomes easier for BCC to have control over the SEZ.\n\nMr Ngwenya said the other issue was that land designated as SEZ could not be sold.\n\n",

That responsibility lies with us, the leaders and people of this great Continent.As Africa, we must take charge of our development and our destiny. Let us, therefore, re-commit ourselves to the guiding objectives of inclusive development, strengthening human capacities and eradicating poverty, in all its forms. These must remain at the centre of our shared aspirations for a prosperous and peaceful Africa, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa in Uganda\n\nGoing forward, President Mnangagwa said Africa must jointly explore emerging technologies, as the continent stood a better chance of sustained development by maintaining a united front rather than as individuals.\n\nThese should include harnessing Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things to drive productivity, build globally competitive economies, and to boost intra-Africa Trade, said the President.\n\nOn its part, he said, SADC remained committed to the attainment of regional, continental and global goals.\n\nIn the context of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, the collective experiences of our countries are invaluable in nurturing evidence-based leadership, as we reflect, learn and co-create solutions towards a better tomorrow. In Southern Africa, our resolve in this regard, is firmly grounded in the SADC Treaty.\n\nPrimarily our objective is to promote sustainable and equitable socio-economic development as well as the eradication of poverty through regional integration. The SADC Vision 2050 places inclusive development at the heart of the regions long-term aspirations.\n\nWe, thus, continue to strengthen institutions, broaden partnerships and entrench governance models that are responsive to current challenges and emerging opportunities, said the SADC Chair.\n\nThe regions abundant natural resources, he added, offered a unique comparative advantage that must be fully leveraged to create decent jobs, sustainable enterprises and economic development through sustainable value chains, especially in commodity sectors.\n\nIn this regard, through the SADC Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap, the region has identified priority value chains in agriculture and mining. Focus is on scaling up industrialisation, diversifying industrial sectors, infrastructure development, tourism, and ICTs among others, to ultimately stimulate intra-regional trade, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nHe said youth employability and skills development remained top regional priorities.\n\nRiding on the demographic dividend, SADC Member States are undertaking various education sector reforms to make education institutions, Centres of Excellence for innovation, entrepreneurship and skills. The goal is to ensure that our young people are equipped with the appropriate knowledge and skills for jobs of the future.\n\nAdditionally, we are scaling up investments in Technical, Vocational Education and Training, with a renewed emphasis on practical and digital skills to help young people and women to benefit from the ongoing technological and green transitions.\n\nSolutions and new products related to agri-tech, fin-tech, digital health and climate technologies, among others, have the potential to propel modernisation and industrialisation of the continent, he said.\n\nIn the case of Zimbabwe, President Mnangagwa said the Second Republic was leveraging on the energy, creativity and innovativeness of the youth and has thus, established Innovation Hubs which are helping to spur inclusive development.\n\nIn 2024, my Government passed the Science Technology and Innovation Start-Up Bill creating a legal framework for tax incentives, infrastructure access and public procurement reforms that favour youth led enterprises, he said.\n\nThe President said key to Zimbabwes development success milestones towards the realisation of SDGs and Agenda 2063, was Governments adoption of the Whole-of-Government Monitoring and Evaluation System.\n\nThis allows the real-time tracking and performance of national programmes across sectors, enabling data- driven and people-centred governance, improved transparency, accountability and more agile institutional responses.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa in Uganda\n\nAt regional level, efforts by SADC Member States are also reinforced by the regions commitment to peace, security and good governance. We recognise that political stability, the rule of law and peace, within our borders, regionally and globally, are foundational to inclusive development and job creation, he said.\n\nSADC is implementing adaptation and mitigation strategies, which include climate-smart agriculture, practices and the promotion of traditional crops. To accomplish this, the SADC Chair said the establishment of irrigation infrastructure was being scaled up.\n\nIn the case of Zimbabwe, the provision of inputs to small holder farmers that are specific to the respective climatic regions, along with the drilling of boreholes and establishment of nutritional gardens are having positive impacts in incomes as well as food and nutrition security, at the household level.\n\nThis transformational model is in-turn accelerating rural industrialisation, as well as the adoption of relevant technologies which are backed by our strong traditional knowledge systems, all resulting in job creation at the community level, leaving no one and no place behind, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe said the SADC Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan 2020-2030 and the SADC Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap 2015-2063 were the main frameworks adopted to actualise Agenda 2063 and will go a long way in achieving SDGs.\n\nThis includes, in particular, Goal Number 8, on decent work and economic growth.Employment creation and empowerment have been deemed central objectives in national development plans while the mainstreaming of these key cogs, across macroeconomic and sectoral policies, is also a priority.\n\nIn other words, we are of the view that our fiscal and monetary policies should simultaneously promote economic stability and job creation, said the President.\n\nAs climate change remains one of the greatest threats to developmental aspirations, President Mnangagwa said addressing its risks requires global solidarity, synergy, partnerships and investments.Calls for increased climate financing and technology transfer to Africa and the global south towards strengthening resilience and adaptation should remain pronounced. In our pursuit of inclusive growth, renewable energy has emerged as a vital enabler.\n\nThrough the adoption of an energy mix that best suits our realities, our Continent must see more of our communities, particularly those in rural areas, having increased access to affordable and clean energy, said the President.\n\nEnergy transition therefore, presented immense possibilities for green jobs for Africas youth and women, he said.\n\nThe need for infrastructure financing, while being cautious of the risk of debt burden requires us to embrace innovative financing models to leapfrog sustainable development and economic growth.\n\nRegional collaboration in financing large-scale infrastructure projects is essential to drive connectivity and economic integration for shared modernisation, industrialisation and prosperity, he said.Speaking to journalists upon arrival at the Robert Mugabe International Airport yesterday President Mnangagwa said SADC and the East Africa Community (EAC) came together in Uganda to map a way forward towards sustainable development.\n\nSo, in the meeting we held with the President of Uganda, we were able to discuss all these issues. Yes, other heads of state were represented by their foreign ministers, but we were happy that it was a robust debate. And we were happy that both SADC and the East Africa Community were all represented in terms of respective countries from those two regions.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa in Uganda\n\nAnd we resolved to pursue our goals as the two regions. Fortunately, from SADC, the chairman, and from the eastern region, the chairman was there. So, the two chairpersons were present. President Museveni is our elder, so whenever we meet him we pay attention and learn from him. We were able to discuss issues facing our two regions. We are happy of the cooperation that is exiting between the two countries, said the President.\n\nDuring deliberations in Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni said Africa had the solutions to ensure sustained development.\n\nDeputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ms Amina Mohammed, said Africa must confront the hard truths and ensure bold solutions are cultivated for the continents continued development.The Forum brought together Heads of State, former Presidents, Prime Ministers and Ministers, among other delegates.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa, who returned home yesterday, was accompanied by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Professor Amon Murwira, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube and Presidential Spokesperson Mr George Charamba.\n\n",

It will also be developed into a quinary hospital for the purpose of teaching medical students and conducting research.\n\nEkusileni Hospital\n\nQuinary hospitals, as envisioned within the framework of Education 5.0, are designed to foster innovation and create a modern environment conducive to clinical research.\n\nThis development should assist Zimbabwe in reducing its reliance on outbound health services, which currently limits accessibility for many patients in need of improved health outcomes. A brainchild of the late nationalist and Father Zimbabwe, Joshua Nkomo, Ekusileni was constructed in 2001 before it was briefly operational for seven months in 2004.\n\nYesterday, the Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development, Ambassador Frederick Shava, toured Ekusileni Hospital accompanied by the NUST Vice Chancellor Professor Mqhele Dlodlo, university management, and lecturers, and affirmed the Governments commitment to the establishment of a specialist facility at the hospital within the shortest possible time.\n\nMINISTER F SHAVA TOUR\n\nThe bold decision to establish a quinary hospital here at Ekusileni Hospital is an extremely important initiative, he said. The structure that houses Ekusileni Hospital is a magnificent and beautiful structure that has not been utilised for years as a result of various issues along the way since it was constructed.\n\nBut now that NUST has requested to use it as a teaching hospital the Government appreciates that and fully supports the initiative.\n\nThe establishment of a quinary hospital at Ekusileni Hospital will give an opportunity for NUST to do post-doctorate training and Government is happy that the university wants to specialise in areas of the health sector that are lacking in the country, said Dr Shava.\n\nHe said the move also presents a perfect opportunity for the country to venture into medical tourism and generate much needed foreign currency.\n\nWe want the facility to be fully operational by the end of the year and the Vice Chancellor (Professor Dlodlo) was telling me earlier that some of the equipment will be delivered very soon.The arrival of the technical equipment from China will signal the beginning of good things at NUST, said Dr Shava.\n\nIn his remarks, Prof Dlodlo said the university was excited about the grand opening of the hospital this year.\n\nTurning Ekusileni Hospital into a fully-fledged quinary hospital is a major boost to the NUST medical school and we look forward to the grand opening of the facility at the end of this year. The hospital will start operational in 2026 and the fact that people are seeing a lot of activity of movement of stuff in and out of Ekusileni is proof that we are moving in the right direction and its a sign of the excitement of good things to come.\n\nMINISTER F SHAVA TOUR\n\nWe thank the Government and our own ministry for making it possible for NUST to acquire the first phase of the equipment that will be used at the hospital. The equipment will be acquired in batches until all the 200 beds are ready to be used. The supplier has promised to deliver the first batch of equipment in two months. The equipment is for obstetrics, gynaecology, pre and post-natal paediatrics, said Prof Dlodlo.\n\nNUST Dean of Faculty of Medicine, Professor Elopy Sibanda, said the establishment of a maternal health facility at Ekusileni Hospital will bridge the gap of a shortage of such facilities in Bulawayo and Matabeleland region.\n\nWe expect this to address the burdens within the community, where many patients are forced to deliver in floor beds due to inadequate capacity. Our equipment is expected to arrive soon and we aim to commence operations by June.\n\nOne of the significant services we plan to introduce is open-heart surgery, primarily for children, a procedure that is not available in the country. This is crucial for underprivileged children who struggle to access such services. We hope to launch this service by September of this year, said Prof Sibanda.\n\nEkusileni in its current state houses essential components including a pharmacy, administration offices, a boardroom, a kitchen, a physiotherapy unit, a pathology laboratory and a paediatrics department.In total, the hospital comprises four wards, two intensive care units (ICUs) with eight beds combined, a laundry room, six operating theatres and an X-ray laboratory  all designed to enhance patient care and support medical excellence.\n\nThe initiative to establish a quinary hospital will involve transforming the facility into a state-of-the-art specialist teaching and research hospital, thereby revolutionising the countrys healthcare system.The hospital was renovated to handle Covid-19 critical patients a few years ago and Government was already planning beyond the pandemic due to shortcomings in the countrys health sector, characterised by lack of specialists doctors.\n\n",

            "content": "Sikhulekelani Moyo,[emailprotected]\n\nEXPERTS have called upon small and medium enterprises (SMEs), who are increasingly demonstrating innovation that drives economic growth, to register their intellectual property rights (IPR) to safeguard their designs and trademarks. This crucial step will prevent the loss of their creations to other individuals or companies.\n\nThe importance of IPR registration was highlighted at the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) intellectual property rights (IPR) for manufacturing entrepreneurs and SMEs launch, held in Bulawayo on Tuesday.\n\nThe event was facilitated by Intellectual Property Lawyer Mrs Brenda Matanga, who explained the significance of having registered IPR and guided SMEs on the registration process.\n\nMrs Matanga noted that small businesses have often overlooked IPR, mistakenly believing it is relevant only to large corporations.\n\nThere is a perception among small businesses that intellectual property is not important and not relevant to their operations. However, todays attendees have gained the understanding that intellectual property rights are crucial for business competitiveness, Mrs Matanga stated.\n\nIf small businesses aspire to scale up and gain market credibility, they must ensure their IPR are protected, encompassing trademarks, patents, industrial designs, and copyrights.\n\nMrs Matanga emphasised that SMEs are showcasing innovations that should not be underestimated.During her presentation, Mrs Matanga offered practical advice to SMEs, urging them to refrain from exhibiting their innovations without prior IPR protection.\n\nShe pointed out that some large exhibition events attract individuals specifically seeking to pilfer ideas from others.\n\nFurthermore, she advised SMEs to avoid divulging excessive information, such as critical recipes, which could be exploited by others to produce similar products, potentially driving the original creators out of business.\n\nSMEs often possess innovative ideas but lack sufficient funding, making them vulnerable to larger companies that can adopt, refine, and dominate their small market share, she said.\n\nTherefore, it is imperative for SMEs to protect their IPR, ensuring that any unauthorised replication will necessitate compensation.\n\nSMEs have become vital contributors to numerous economies, generating innovative solutions that address local challenges. The sector also makes substantial contributions to the economy through job creation and the provision of diverse goods and services.\n\nBulawayo Chamber of SMEs chairperson Mr Coustin Ngwenya commended CZI for organising the event, recognising it as an eye-opener for SMEs. He estimated that nearly 90 percent of SMEs lack registered IPR for their products.\n\nThis workshop has broadened our understanding. SMEs often find themselves at a disadvantage in this area, with larger institutions tending to benefit, he said.\n\nMr Ngwenya cited an example of an SME in Victoria Falls involved in sculpture production, whose unique designs were registered under the IPR of a UK-based client. Consequently, the client ceased direct purchases from the SME, and the SME struggled to find alternative markets due to the IPR ownership issue.\n\nBulawayo Leather Cluster chairperson Mr Fungai Zvinondiramba highlighted that SMEs often lack the financial resources to commercialise their ideas, inadvertently benefiting others. He stressed that registering their intellectual property would enable them to benefit financially if others utilise their innovations.\n\nIPR is often perceived as the most expensive aspect of business. You encounter SMEs claiming to be broke, yet they possess unregistered IPR that lacks valuation, while others can readily recognise its potential, Mr Zvinondiramba said.\n\nBulawayo Leather Cluster chairperson Mr Fungai Zvinondiramba\n\nUnderstanding IPR can significantly mitigate the risk of financial distress for SMEs, as they recognise the inherent financial value of their generated ideas.\n\nThe lack of intellectual property rights protection has exposed businesses in the SADC region and the African continent to various challenges, including the appropriation of product ownership by manufacturers from other nations.\n\nConsequently, the region has experienced a loss of competitive advantage, jobs, revenue, brand damage, disincentives for innovation, reduced research and development, and stifled creativity.\n\nProtecting IPR is particularly crucial as the continent implements the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, which aims to eliminate tariffs on 90 percent of goods traded between member states over a 10-year period.\n\n",

Emerging from the closed-door meeting with the investors, VP Mohadi, whilst not going into extensive detail, provided a brief overview of their private discussions.We had an engagement with investors that are actually interested in funding the development corridor, the Trans Limpopo Corridor from Beitbridge up to Victoria Falls hence we had the three Ministers of State for Matabeleland South, Bulawayo Metropolitan and Matabeleland North.\n\nWe deliberated on that. They (investors) have a fund that they think they can advance to us. But there are certain technicalities that we have discovered of how we would have wanted it done, said VP Mohadi.\n\nVICE President Kembo Mohadi\n\nAs the Second Republic focuses on transforming the economy towards Vision 2030, the Trans-Limpopo Spatial Development Corridor, a development initiative aimed at unlocking economic potential between Zimbabwe and South Africa, is a key area of interest. It also seeks to ensure that the two countries engage in discussions and collaborate to improve peoples livelihoods in a positive manner. VP Mohadi highlighted that the investment opportunities will further be analysed before a decision to bring them on board is made. So, we have adjourned and we have said to the Reserve Bank Governor and the funders themselves, the people advancing the loan, go and sit down and come and give us a position tomorrow (today) as to which is the legal or the right way to do this, he said.\n\nThe investors pitched their proposals including funding modalities before the Vice President, Ministers of State for the three provinces where development will take place, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe representative and other key representatives to this initiative.\n\nThe investment is set to see the provinces tapping into various developmental projects available that suit their areas. There are job creation opportunities that will be unveiled once investment outcomes are made public, which feeds directly into ensuring no one and no place is left behind. The proposed investor is not new to development initiatives in the country as the Government approved a US$110 million Public Private Partnership investment with them for the construction and upgrading of the 120-kilometre Old Gwanda Road.\n\nThey highlighted in an earlier interview that there are vast investment opportunities within the corridor including, agriculture, industries, mining, tourism and many more.\n\nThe project was initially estimated to cost US$110 million, but it was recently revealed that the figure may be closer to US$150 million, with US$40 million assigned to enhance the roads elements and cultural storytelling.\n\nSome architectural designs, which show how the Old Gwanda Road have been availed, aim at promoting the diverse tourism offerings of Matabeleland South, with prominent tourism facilities and cultural sites integrated into the design.  @NyembeziMu\n\n",

            "content": "Sikhumbuzo Moyo,[emailprotected]\n\nBULAWAYO South Member of Parliament and Minister of Industry and Commerce, Raj Modi, yesterday delivered a much-needed water supply of 22 000 litres to the residents of Sizinda suburb, bringing considerable relief to those who had endured three weeks without any water.\n\nThe water was distributed at three designated points throughout the suburb. Despite the brief interruption of rain showers, residents gathered with their containers to collect the precious supply, expressing profound gratitude to the MP for his timely and crucial intervention.\n\nMrs Egness Sibindi, a local resident, recounted the considerable hardships the community had faced over the preceding three weeks, highlighting the particular difficulties experienced by elderly residents and families with young children.\n\nWe only have one borehole here, and its always overcrowded, with people jostling for water. Its particularly difficult for the elderly. We are grateful to Honourable Modi for his kindness, she said.Another resident, Mrs Sifiso Mwale, said the delivery came at an ideal time, especially with schools closing.\n\nChildren will be home more often now, which means more water will be needed. This bowser came at the right moment. Were so thankful to Honourable Modi, who continues to support uswhether its election season or not, she said.\n\nSizinda residents fetch water from a bowser provided by legislator Raj Modi yesterday\n\nMrs Mthokozisi Tshabalala also expressed her gratitude, describing the past three weeks without water as terrible.\n\nFor 11-year-old Nicky Mhlophe, who cares for her sick grandmother, the water delivery was a huge relief.I usually fetch water from Oceans Factory, carrying a 20-litre bucket every day. Its tough because my grandmother is unwell and cant make the trip. Now, I can rest a bit and spend time with my friends. I heard the water came from Honourable Modi, our MP, said Nicky, a Grade Four pupil.\n\nBulawayo has been struggling with water shortages since last year, caused by low dam levels and outdated pumping equipment. The city is reportedly losing nearly 50% of its water supply due to non-revenue water (NRW)water that is pumped but lost through leaks, theft, or unbilled consumption.\n\nAt the inaugural Bulawayo Economic Development Conference held at a local hotel yesterday, Bulawayo mayor Councillor David Coltart expressed concern about the citys inability to provide water to both residents and industries, despite recent improvements in dam levels.\n\nHe stressed the need for reform in the management of the citys water systems.\n\nWe cannot continue with outdated practices from 30 to 40 years ago. We commend the Government for approving the construction of Glassblock Dam, said Cllr Coltart.\n\nMeanwhile, public consultations held in six city wards on the proposal for a standalone water utility company saw mixed reactions. Four wards16, 17, 19, and 24rejected the proposal, while Wards 25 and 26 supported it.\n\nBCC spokesperson Ms Bongiwe Ndlovu stated that the consultation process was ongoing, and the final outcomes would be shared once completed.\n\n",

            "content": "Trust Khosa, Zimpapers Arts and Entertainment Hub\n\nThe death of Leonard Dembo, the iconic figure whose soulful melodies captivated the hearts of millions, left an irreplaceable void in the Zimbabwean music 29 years ago.\n\nApril 9 marks not only the day he tragically passed away in 1996, but also a time of reflection for his family and the legions of fans who continue to honour his legacy.\n\nThis year is especially poignant, as Dembo would have turned 65. Fenistia Fenny Dembo, his daughter and family spokesperson, expressed the bittersweet emotions tied to the anniversary. Having lost her father at the tender age of five, Fenny carries on his musical legacy through heartfelt renditions of his hit songs.\n\nIt hasnt been easy. Losing a parent, especially one as beloved and influential as my father, leaves a deep gap, Fenny shared.\n\nFenny Dembo at her fathers graveside\n\nBut over the years, his music has been a source of comfort and strength to me. Through his music, he has remained a constant presence in my life, even though hes no longer here with us physically.Though the memories of her father have blurred with time, Fenny cherishes the lessons passed down through the stories of her mother and family.\n\nThrough my mother, I learnt that my father always wanted us to stay united, humble and to work hard in whatever path we chose, she recalled, adding that her father was a man of integrity and passion.Thats why, after every achievement, I make it a point to visit his gravesite in Chirumhanzu and tell him all about it.\n\nThe past 29 years have created a fog of distant memories for Fenny, but through old family videos and photos, the warmth of her fathers laughter and the soothing sound of his music fill the void.\n\nHe had such a calm, grounded way of looking at life, and spending time with him, even in quiet moments, brought a joy thats hard to put into words, she said, reminiscing on the time Dembo spent singing around the house, his music always flowing, even in the simplest of moments.\n\nAs an artiste in her own right, Fenny reassured fans that her fathers legacy is in safe hands.\n\nWeve worked to protect his music catalogue and ensure its available to future generations. My brothers and I have continued in his footsteps, supporting tributes, performances and documentaries in his honour. His legacy lives on, not just through his music, but through the values he instilled in us.\n\nFennys heartfelt thanks were extended to the fans who have remained loyal to her fathers music over the years.\n\nThe late Leonard Dembo\n\nTendai Dembo, Leonards son and leader of Barura Express, shared the familys plans.\n\nWere going to do something as a family, but not a big event. We dont want to spoil his name, Tendai said, sharing their desire to keep the memory of his father pure and untarnished.\n\nFor Tendai, whose catalogue includes iconic albums like Kukura Kwedu, Nhamo Moto, and Ruva Rashe, the focus remains on honouring Leonards values and music.\n\nThe Dembo family, however, still faces struggles beyond the stage. Eunice Dembo, Leonards widow, is among the widows of departed musicians, who have not been receiving royalties from recording companies or collecting boards.\n\nWhile Dembos physical presence may no longer be with us, his memory remains firmly entrenched in Zimbabwes music history. With each year, his influence grows stronger as his songs continue to be sung, loved and passed down to future generations.\n\n",
