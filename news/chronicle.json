The President called for collaborative synergies between SMEs and relevant ministries, departments and agencies, saying such collaboration was important towards the formalisation of small businesses and start-ups.\n\nAs we continue to diversify our economy, the formalisation of this sector must never be viewed as a direct threat to the survival and sustainability of your respective businesses.\n\nOn its part, my Government will continue to improve the ease of doing business, through reducing barriers to entry, as well as streamlining business registration, licensing and compliance levies.\n\nHE commissions Mbare Msika\n\nDialogue with the SMEs sector is an essential building block for enhanced business productivity. There should not be a them and us mentality, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe added that the Government and SMEs sector must act as one for the good of the country.\n\nThe Ministry of SMEs was challenged to deploy innovative initiatives that will see more SMEs becoming fully fledged business entities with footprints beyond Zimbabwe and the SADC region.\n\nGovernment is determined to see the realisation of the Urban Transformation Agenda designed to primarily focus on addressing rapid urbanisation by prioritising safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable cities and human settlements, in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Number 11.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said Phase 2 of the New Mbare Musika is designed to be a multi-storey complex with improved sanitation, fire safety features and organised trading spaces, thus resonating with Vision 2030 and the SDGs.\n\nMbare Musika\n\nHe applauded Masimba Construction and Mkambo Misika Hubs, who partnered the Government in the project, for their professionalism and work ethic, which have ensured the completion of Phase 1 of the Market.\n\nEarlier on, President Mnangagwa commended Mbare residents for their consistent support of Zanu PF that saw the revolutionary party winning in that constituency in the 2023 harmonised elections.\n\nBe assured that the interests of the people of our great motherland, Zimbabwe, remain at the core of my Administration. Two weeks ago, I was pleased to receive, at State House, representatives of Vendors and Tuckshops Associations from across the country.\n\nThat engagement, among many others I have had in the recent past, gave me general insights into matters that concern you and the broader Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises sector.

            "content": "Danisa Masuku\n\nRODNEY TONGAI JINDU. The very name conjures a chilling picture of unimaginable horror of a serial killer.\n\nHis confession to the gruesome murders of his two friends  a macabre narrative amplified by the unthinkable admissions of eating their raw liver and cooking their brains  now casts a long, dark shadow once more.\n\nNext week, his re-sentencing appearance at the Bulawayo High Court threatens to tear open the wounds of the families who suffered the irreparable loss of their loved ones to Jindus murderous rampage, that had started to scab.\n\nAs the legal process revisits the horrific details, a fresh wave of raw grief and trauma is inevitable, forcing the relatives to relive the terrifying final moments of their loved ones, a cruel and unwelcome reminder of the monstrous depravity that stole them away.\n\nThe path to this re-sentencing has been long and fraught. Haunted by two counts of murder, Jindu was initially brought before the courts, where Justice Nokuthula Moyo, at the Bulawayo High Court, delivered a sentence of death. This pronouncement in 2018 condemned Jindu to a life contemplating his final reckoning.\n\nHowever, the immutable hand of fate, in the form of the abolition of the death penalty, has irrevocably altered his destiny.\n\nPresident Mnangagwas signing of the Death Penalty Abolition Bill has granted Jindu and 48 other inmates on death row a new, albeit grim, prospect. The gazetted Act now dictates that individuals convicted of murder in aggravating circumstances shall face a lengthy jail term, ranging from 20 years to life imprisonment.\n\nNow, Jindu, incarcerated within the unforgiving walls of Khami Maximum Prison, is scheduled to reappear in court on April 14 at the Bulawayo High Court for re-sentencing.\n\nThis once flamboyant young man, known for his expensive tastes, designer suits, and top-of-the-range vehicles, first seared his name into public consciousness on February 3, 2017. This publication broke the chilling news of his cold-blooded murder of his childhood friend, Cyprian Kudzurunga, a young man of just 28, whose remains he callously buried in a shallow grave on a plot in Bulawayos affluent Burnside suburb.\n\nJindu disturbingly disclosed to investigators that he murdered Kudzurunga out of fear  the fear of exposure. Kudzurunga, it was alleged, had stumbled upon evidence of Jindus ritualistic murder of Mboneli Ncube. In a calculated attempt to conceal his heinous acts, Jindu even sent a deceitful message to Kudzurungas mother, impersonating her son and claiming a sudden departure from the country.\n\nWhile the public reeled from the sheer horror of this revelation, Jindu, already the subject of morbid fascination both within Zimbabwe and beyond, struck again, plunging the nation into further despair.He chillingly recounted to detectives from the Homicide section how a cross-border transporter had approached him, offering a macabre exchange: US$20 000 or a Toyota Quantum for the body parts of Mboneli Ncube. This grotesque proposition, he claimed, ignited his desire to murder his friend Mboneli Ncube, a 30-year-old who lived a mere four houses away in Bulawayos Glengarry suburb.\n\nSoon after, he delivered Ncubes lifeless body to the transporter, who proceeded to harvest the head, hands, and both legs, leaving Jindu with the torso. This he placed in a plastic bag, transported on a wheelbarrow to the same plot in Burnside, and there, with chilling indifference, burnt and buried the remains in four separate shallow graves, mere metres from Kudzurungas final resting place. The gruesome discovery was swiftly reported to the police, triggering an urgent manhunt that culminated in Jindus arrest.\n\nWith a disturbing lack of remorse, Jindu led detectives to the scene, where the fragmented remains of Ncube were exhumed. When questioned by Homicide detectives, he confessed to the dismemberment. Following this horrifying revelation, he was brought before the court.\n\nHis initial court appearance in 2018 was marked by macabre drama as he openly confessed to shooting his two friends and the unspeakable act of consuming their flesh. This prompted Justice Moyo to order a psychiatric evaluation by two state doctors to ascertain his mental state under the provisions of the Mental Health Act.\n\nThe accused persons conduct is prima facie bizarre and abnormal. It is for these reasons that the court finds it fit that a mental examination be conducted to rule out any possibility of mental issues. This will allow the court to proceed to try the accused person after having been satisfied that he is mentally stable, ruled Justice Moyo.\n\nFollowing that, armed with a medical report certifying his mental soundness and fitness to stand trial, he returned to court. He appeared before Justice Moyo again, and during his initial trial appearance, he confessed to hiring his two neighbours to dig the graves. He also claimed to have been intoxicated by heroin and methamphetamine, a synthetic stimulant at the time of the murders.\n\nHowever, Justice Moyo ultimately rejected this defence, convicting Jindu on two counts of murder with actual intent, committed under aggravating circumstances. In delivering the sentence, Justice Moyo deemed capital punishment the most fitting and appropriate for Jindus heinous crimes.\n\nThe accused person is convicted of two counts of murder with actual intent. You killed two people in a space of three weeks. You mutilated the body of the deceased in count one; you took away property belonging to the deceased in count two.\n\nHe executed the murders meticulously by first of all carrying a gun which should have been kept at his mothers home. He then tried in a very clever way to conceal the murders by first sending text messages to the relatives of his victims as to the deceaseds whereabouts. He also deceived the police.\n\nHe even refused to divulge intricate details of the murders hiding behind his fabricated Lucifer image. He cannot be found to be remorseful. His Lucifer version means that he is still bent on tricking the court right up to the end.\n\nIf the accused person does not deserve capital punishment or if he is spared capital punishment then it means the relevance of capital punishment as enshrined in our law will become meaningless, ruled Justice Moyo.\n\n",

He said Government on its part has embarked on a robust programme to strengthen good corporate governance and accountability in the management of public resources. Integrity committees have been set up at public institutions to prevent corruption and promote good corporate governance.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the private sector, civil society and other stakeholders should also prioritise transparency and accountability through in-house anti-corruption efforts. The Chartered Governance and Accountancy Institute of Zimbabwe (CGAIZ) has trained police officers and Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) officials in forensic accounting, auditing and cyber security.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said such collaboration goes a long away in strengthening public institutions to effectively and efficiently deliver on their mandate. He also urged members of the security sector to constantly upgrade their skills to keep abreast with criminals and corrupt elements modern techniques to evade the law.\n\nGovernment has already announced that plans are underway to introduce anti-corruption curricula from ECD to tertiary education as the nation steps up its fight against corruption.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has said his administration will not shy away from taking corruption by the horns as the scourge has debilitating effects of retarding economic growth and development.\n\n",

He said according to quotations from South Africa, the set of batteries cost just over R1 million.\n\nDr Dzvanga said the hospital had been told to downsize their UPS machine to match that of Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, a proposal that VP Mohadi vehemently rejected.\n\nThat is about US$100 000 needed for the machine. The machine was made like that and it has to run like that. We need to get this machine running, we cannot fail to raise this amount as a country, said the Vice-President. Why do they say it (UPS) machine is too big? No, we do not want that, we want the US$100 000 and Mthuli (Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion) has got to act, said VP Mohadi.\n\nAlmost 50 percent of the cancer patients that visit Mpilo Hospital require radiotherapy but these are not being treated as the machines are down with revelations that the radiotherapy machines were procured and left in storage for many years, causing some of the faults and deterioration of the machines.\n\nThe machines are said to have been locked up at Beira, Mozambique for three years before they were eventually delivered to Bulawayo. All patients requiring radiotherapy are being referred to Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare and are having to endure long waiting periods of up to five months as the hospital is overwhelmed by the demand for the service.\n\nVP Mohadi said it was too much of a burden for one public institution to be treating cancer in the country.\n\nVice President Mohadi tours Mpilo Central Hospital\n\nParirenyatwa cannot carry the entire nation, it is impossible. We need to have other referral hospitals offering the same service. People are dying every day; they are dying because we cannot avail US$100 000 to have these things fixed. We need to get these machines to function, people pay a lot of money to go to India and the Government also pays a lot of money too, that is foreign currency, which is being wasted, said VP Mohadi.\n\nHe said if the ministry wants to buy new machines its fine but what is urgent at the moment is to fix the machines that the hospital has so that people can start receiving the service.\n\nVP Mohadi said the hospital and cancer patients cannot wait for the promised new machines because it is not known when these will be bought.\n\nWe dont know when the new ones will come or when the money will be available. There is no radiotherapy taking place here and we cannot allow that as a Government, he said.\n\nEverybody cannot go to Harare to seek the services as Harare is already overwhelmed hence the long wait, said VP Mohadi.\n\nHead of Radiotherapy Dr Tatenda Chingonzoh said the waiting periods for treatment were too long.The waiting period for a patient to get on the machine at Parirenyatwa is four to five months because of their own burden plus ours from Mpilo. When we treat cervical cancer, a patient receives treatment for up to six weeks and they need to be in Harare,he said.\n\nDr Chingonzoh said in January engineers came to try and get things running but the problem was the issue of power.\n\nThe cancer machines are down again and we have not managed to treat anybody. For the first quarter of the year, we have seen about 1 200 cancer patients and usually about 50 percent of these patients require radiotherapy services, she said.\n\nDr Dzvanga said the hospital was servicing their machines via a South African company but it later engaged local technicians who unfortunately failed to repair the broken-down machines.We got a local company whose technicians came and spent a week here, only to tell us that they had failed to repair the machines, he said.\n\nDr Dzvanga said to address the problem, Mpilo Central Hospital must have comprehensive service contracts.\n\nA service contract mandates that if there is a minor fault to machinery, they (manufactures) come and attend to that fault and without this, no service can be done and institutions have to pay cash upfront for spare parts, he said.\n\nAbout US$80 000 was at one time disbursed for diagnosing the problem when the radiation machines were down but there was no extra funding for the procurement of spare parts for repairs.\n\nWe have a sort of service contract in place, the engineers have been coming but not quite getting things working. They once came but due to power fluctuation, they could not test the machines, said Dr Dzvanga.\n\nDr Chingonzoh said the hospital was offering chemotherapy only yet many of the cancers that they have such as cervical cancer, require radiotherapy.@NyembeziMu\n\n",

Lulu found herself particularly moved by Chief Mbusi Bekithemba Dakamelas unassuming nature and his palpable dedication to the preservation of Ndebele culture, a sentiment that resonated deeply with her.\n\nLulu, known for her work across social media platforms and YouTube, shared with Saturday Chronicle that she was born in Umzimkhulu, a region to the south-east of Durban, 42 years ago.\n\nLulu Njapa at the Chale Wote Street Festival\n\nI was born in Durban and I lived there before going to Johannesburg where this journey of mine began. Ive always loved writing from a tender age which was fuelled by my English teacher who would award us if we did well at school. She taught us how to write poetry pieces.\n\nLulu Njapa (centre) attending the Chale Wote Street Festival in Ghana\n\nWhat started the travel writing in particular was through a friend who was writing for American monthly lifestyle magazine, Essence and she was interviewing travel writers and she knew my obsession with travelling around Africa and encouraged me to go for it after she sent me pieces of how the travel writers went about their business and this was in 2018. Since then, I havent turned back, she narrated.\n\nWriting across lifestyle, tourism, and culture, her portfolio also encompasses the arts and fashion, earning her by-lines in prominent publications such as the Mail & Guardian, Sunday Times, City Press, and The Informer Independent Digest Malawi, where she has contributed features and regular columns.Her travels have taken her to numerous African nations, including Namibia, Zambia, and Ghana on several occasions, the latter being a place where her deep appreciation for the continent first took root.\n\nLulu Njapa (right) with Umntwana uGcina Zulu at the Imiklomelo KaDakamela event. (Picture by Adept Dazz Siziba)\n\nMy first trip outside South Africa was to Ghana (where she attended the Chale Wote Street Art Festival) after I quit my job at a telecoms company, and I felt a profound sense of anticipation. My fascination with Ghana was ignited in 2002 when I met the renowned poet, Atukwei Okai, in Durban. At 20 years old, his words stirred something within me, sparking a desire to explore the heart of Africa, a journey that has shaped my identity ever since, she shared.\n\nLulu Njapa\n\nZimbabwe holds a special affection for her, owing to the warm welcome she consistently receives from its people and the linguistic similarities between iSiNdebele and her native IsiXhosa. Lulu recounted her enjoyment of Imiklomelo KaDakamela, noting that it provided her with a novel experience  her first night spent under canvas, albeit one tinged with a confessed fear of spiders.\n\nKoDakamela was quite a different experience for me, firstly because it was my first time to be in Zimbabwe for a significant amount of time and I had to camp. What intrigued me the most is that the chief himself is one with the people. He doesnt consider himself up there.\n\nLulu Njapa arriving in Zimbabwe for the Imiklomelo KaDakamela event\n\nWhen we slept, I didnt notice that he was there with us but in the morning, I realised that he actually slept where everyone else did, a humble gesture if you ask me. The way he was interacting with everyone showed that he is well-grounded. He didnt treat people like his subjects but rather, people he holds dear, she said.\n\nLulu loves culture but wouldnt call herself a cultural activist or ambassador because in as much as she loves it, there are some parts that she doesnt resonate with, especially those that dont uplift women.Follow on X@MbuleloMpofu\n\n",
