This makes climate change mitigation and adaptation interventions imperative to reduce further deterioration of the climate system.\n\nIn 2015, Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) came together and adopted the Paris Agreement, which aims to transform Parties developmental trajectories and set the world on a course towards sustainable development.\n\nThe Paris Agreement recognises that to significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change, all Parties need to reduce their greenhouse gas emission levels, with the aim of holding the global average temperature increase to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nTo achieve this, the Paris Agreement requires Parties to communicate their greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments through the NDCs every five years, with each submission reflecting increased ambition from the previous one.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, Climate, and Wildlife, Zimbabwe submitted its Intended NDC in 2015, which was effected in 2017 when the country ratified the Paris Agreement.\n\nParties to the Paris Climate Agreement are required to submit updated national climate plans, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), every five years to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat.\n\nThe second iteration of the NDCs was reviewed at the first Global Stocktake (GST1) at COP28, when Parties were mandated to develop updated and more ambitious NDCs (NDC3.0) and 10-year plans, and to submit them to the secretariat by 10 February 2025, including the targets for 2035.\n\nHowever, by Monday, 10 February 2025, only 13 countries globally had met this deadline, according to the African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) in a statement.\n\nFrom the African region, only Zimbabwe made its submission on time. The African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) congratulates Zimbabwe on this achievement and is honoured to have supported Zimbabwe in updating and communicating its NDC3.0, the statement read.\n\nOther countries that met the deadline include the Marshall Islands, Singapore, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Uruguay, the United States of America, Ecuador, Brazil, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe ACPC stated that it will continue supporting other African member states in the lead-up to COP30.\n\nGiven the urgency of the climate emergency, it is disappointing that only 13 out of the 195 signatories to the Paris Agreement have communicated their national contributions to the climate response.\n\nWe also note that it is not sufficient for Parties to communicate NDCs; adequate finance should be made available to enable their implementation if humanity is to have any realistic chance of preventing irreversible interference with the climate system.\n\nIn this regard, we note that countries must submit their plans by September at the latest to ensure they are included in the NDC Synthesis Report to be released ahead of Brazils COP30. The ACPC will support African member states to update and communicate their NDC 3.0 and long-term low-emission development strategies within this timeline, the statement read.\n\nIn addition to supporting countries to reformulate their NDCs, the ACPC will also participate in assessments to ensure the alignment of communicated NDCs with the recommendations of GST1 and with a 1.5C trajectory.\n\n",
