We remain confident of achieving that as we have also largely kept a large proportion of our team that brought us gold last year, said Mlotshwa.The meet will be used to select a provincial team that will represent the province at the national finals set for Chipadze High School in Bindura, Mashonaland Central province next month.\n\nProvincial athletics head in charge, Netha said the province will only take podium athletes to represent the province in national track and field athletics competitions.The only way we can do well as a province is for us to consider quality over quantity. We want to take podium athletes only. It doesnt matter whether one gets gold, as long as we feel the standard will be below what is expected at national level, we will not take that athlete to Bindura, said Netha.Bubi district are the defending champions after amassing 24 gold, 21 silver and 14 bronze medals and were followed by Lupane who managed 22 gold, 19 silver and bronze medals respectively.Hwange were third with 17 gold and silver medals as well as 18 bronze respectively.Umguza had the same number of gold medals but came short on silver after getting 15 while managing nine bronze medals.Nkayi and Tsholotsho came fifth and sixth respectively while hosting district this year, Binga was last.Meanwhile, host province Mashonaland Central province is leaving no stone unturned as they prepare to welcome nine provinces for the national finals from April 1-4.Speaking to New Ziana, Mashonaland Central schools sports inspector, Tinashe Mushore said preparations are 90 percent complete.The ablution block is almost finished with only roofing and piping left to be done. A 500-capacity terrace has been built with final compaction work completed. The terrace will be reserved for guests, while others will be accommodated in tents.The host schools will occupy the open spaces. To address water supply concerns, solarisation has been implemented to power boreholes, ensuring a 24-hour supply.\n\n",

Ms Nkanyezi Xaba represented the State.\n\nCZ pistol model\n\nIt was stated in court documents that the fatal shooting occurred on March 6, when Muradzikwa and the late Hove were part of a team leading a covert operation to apprehend suspected armed robbers in Pumula South suburb.\n\nThe accused was armed with a CZ pistol serial number BSAP 44 when he advanced towards, Fikile Ncube aged 26, a male adult, NR 28-160313 K, residing at house number 14804 Pumula South, Bulawayo, a suspect in a robbery case investigated by CID Homicide, Ms Xaba told the court.\n\nHe corked his firearm and shot at him hitting him once on the left elbow after which the bullet ricocheted and hit the deceased once on the left breast resulting in her death, read the circumstances of the case.\n\nMuradzikwa, who appeared to hold no emotion on the matter, was escorted to the courts by detectives from CID Homicide yesterday morning, with the matter only being heard in the afternoon.\n\nHowever, some of Hoves family members who attended the court hearing said they only learnt of Muradzikwas alleged confession through social media.\n\nThey also expressed dissatisfaction with the police, whom they accuse of not informing them of the developments.\n\nMr Abias Hove, a brother to the late Cassandra, said it would have been prudent for the police to notify them so that all relatives could attend court to hear the series of events of that night.\n\nWe just learnt of this today, after seeing the developments on online papers and social media. Procedurally, I thought police should inform us about this, but we are disappointed that they did not do so, said Mr Hove.\n\nHe said there are many questions that need answering to put their hearts and minds at ease.\n\nIts disenchanting that this man only confessed now, two weeks after the death of our sister. Where and what was he doing all this time?\n\nWhat were the police doing? There are a lot of questions that need to be answered, said Mr Hove.\n\nThe late Hove died at the age of 37 and is survived by four children. A member of Bulawayos elite all-female CID unit known as Team Lozikeyi, she was buried at her rural home in Mataruse Village, Mberengwa District in the Midlands Province.\n\nThe incident occurred around 8:40pm in the Habbek area of Pumula South suburb, where initial reports suggested that Hove and her colleagues were pursuing suspects involved in a series of armed robberies.\n\n",

            "content": "Chronicle Writers\n\nTHE Bulawayo City Council (BCC) has pronounced the relocation of all vendors operating along 5th Avenue to designated places with immediate effect and banned pushcarts from the central business district in line with the recent Government directive to restore sanity and clearing city centres of illegal informal trading activity.\n\nThe decision follows widespread concerns over rampant illegal vending operations in towns and cities including night vending and pushcarts, which have been blamed for frustrating formal business operations, harbouring criminality, indiscriminate littering and violations of public health and safety regulations.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Bulawayo Town Clerk, Mr Christopher Dube, said all traders operating along 5th Avenue will be relocated to the Bhaktas 2 Site, located along Lobengula Street and 2nd Avenue.\n\nPriority will be given to the first 600 trading bays at Bhaktas for those traders who were operating legally at 5th Avenue, he said.\n\nThe additional 460 bays will be allocated to traders who had previously been assigned bays at Bhaktas and have fulfilled all licensing and rental obligations.\n\nCouncil has since advised all vendors operating along 5th Avenue to visit the City of Bulawayo Vending Offices at the former Dugmore Clinic Offices along Basch Street and 6th Avenue today, where compliant traders will be assisted to identify designated bay numbers at the new Bhaktas site.\n\nWe urge all affected traders to co-operate with the authorities during this transition period to ensure a smooth relocation process. Your understanding and compliance with the councils decision are greatly appreciated, said Mr Dube.\n\nThe City of Bulawayo further reminds residents that in accordance with the SI 220 of 2023 Section 7 item 5 that: Push carts shall not be allowed in the part of the central business area bounded by 3rd Avenue, Lobengula Street, 12th Avenue and Robert Mugabe Way, any violation will attract a Level 1 fine plus impounding costs.\n\nLast week, Local Government and Public Works Minister, Daniel Garwe, issued a 48-hour ultimatum for councils to address night vending and clear the streets of all illegal vending operations.\n\nHe said Government was concerned about the surge in unregulated informal trading in the countrys city centres, which has resulted in increased pedestrian traffic, widespread littering and disturbances to established businesses.\n\nWe had already set in motion the process of relocating vendors to designated areas such as Bhaktas and Egodini when the Government issued the ultimatum.\n\nAll registered vendors will be moved to the council-constructed available bays and this relocation process is nearing completion, Deputy Mayor Councillor Edwin Ndlovu said.\n\nCouncil has said it will collaborate with the police to ensure the measures are effectively put into place. Analysts, however, say the compliance gap remains wider as scores of vendors operate illegally and argue that designated spaces do not provide viable business.\n\nReacting to the council directive, Bulawayo Vendors and Traders Association (BVTA) executive director Mr Michael Ndiweni said moving vendors to Bhaktas is a welcome development saying they also support the efforts to decongest the city.\n\nHe called for enhanced awareness to ensure smooth compliance and restoration of order.\n\nFifth Avenue has been a contested space over time now, and as an association, we have been calling for a lasting solution. What we proposed is how do we win and give people Fifth Avenue, but then have other people in other spaces, said Mr Ndiweni.\n\nThe proposed sites, like Bhaktas, are a welcome development as long as the city will put in place measures to increase activities that will then make people stay there and increase sales.\n\nHe suggested collective stakeholder involvement to ensure the issue is solved once and for all.\n\nAs of yesterday afternoon, vendors were still operating as usual and professed ignorance over the councils latest decision.\n\nMs Sheila Mpofu, a registered trader operating along 5th Avenue said: Personally, this is news to me that we will be relocated to the Bhaktas 2 site, and what I know is that most of the stands at that site are already occupied.\n\nSome vendors vowed to resist the move saying relocation means them losing business and income for their families as more customers are at the city centre.\n\nIn one of the incidents witnessed by the news crew, council security teams were wresting with illegal traders at corner Fort Street and 6th Avenue extension, causing chaos as people watched.\n\nBulawayo has 3 416 vending bays in the CBD of which 3 279 are occupied and only 244 of those have the necessary licenses to operate legally, according to official data.\n\nThe highest concentration of unlicensed vendors is located at various sites throughout the city, with significant discrepancies in site allocations. The city has 16 vending sites in the CBD, with the site between Lobengula Street and Herbert Chitepo and 6th Avenue up to 8th Avenue, having the highest number of bays at 814.\n\nThe Highlanders site has 749 bays, with 720 allocated and 184 bays being licensed.\n\nAt Bhaktas (2nd Avenue and Lobengula Street), all 175 bays, despite being allocated, are not licensed with the local authority. The same goes with the site located at corner of 6th Avenue and Lobengula Street where out of the 337 bays available and allocated, none of them are legally licensed to operate.\n\nAt Hyper market, all the 30 vendors allocated are also not legally licensed to operate, while at 6th Avenue Extension, only three vendors out of the 118 that were allocated are licensed to operate at the site.\n\nOnly three out of 121 allocated bays are licensed to operate along Lobengula Street between 5th and 6th Avenue,\n\nAt the Flower Trading Site, which is located adjacent to the Large City Hall, of the 37 allocated bays, just eight are licensed to operate, while the Fruits and Vegetables site located at the corner of Robert Mugabe Way and 8th Avenue of the 96 bays available, 52 have been allocated and of those, just one bay is licensed to operate.\n\n",

Removing Bulawayos busiest market from its heart to its periphery will ensure more order in the city centre as well. It represents an additional street for motorists to use.\n\nA vendor selling cabbages and other vegetables along Fifth Avenue and George Silundika Street in Bulawayo\n\nFifth Avenue is Bulawayos filthiest lane given the dumping of vegetable waste along it by vendors and traders operating on it. Therefore, we expect the removal of the traders from there and their resettlement at Bhaktas to make the city centre smarter.\n\nWe expect traders to comply with the council order. Yes, there have been concerns that Bhaktas is too far away from customers but that concern does not really count. The customers will have no alternative market so they will follow the fresh vegetables to Bhaktas.\n\nIn the event that some traders resist the relocations, we are sure that law enforcement would be on top of the situation in enforcing the directive.\n\nHowever, relocating vendors and other informal traders from Fifth Avenue to Bhaktas is just a tiny part of the big job that council has to do to order the city. The city is heavily populated by people selling all manner of items just everywhere, along pavements, at every street corner and so on.\n\nThe Government recently ordered local authorities to clean themselves of illegal vendors, noting that some of them are engaging in criminal activities. The deadline that the Government had set for councils to have done the evictions passed a few days ago with councils dithering and vendors staying put. We implore Bulawayo to act now.\n\nIndeed, we appreciate that some of our people are surviving through the incomes they earn from illegal vending but vending must be done in an orderly fashion. These, too, must find spots at the various spaces designated for more organised informal trading  at Bhaktas, Egodini and so on. We urge council to designate more new spaces as we anticipate the existing ones will not meet demand.\n\n",

The promoter was also the brains behind Plumtrees Annual Street Bash and DJ Yugoes annual birthday celebration (most attended)  events, which became a flagship of the town as it attracted patrons from Bulawayo and the neighbouring Botswana.\n\nAmong the acts he brought to Plumtree were Generations: The Legacy stars Manaka Ranaka (Lucy Diale) and Ronnie Nyakale (Cosmo), comedian Madluphuthu, actor Israel GP Ma Orange Matsekezulu, and the late Yizo Yizo star Christopher Khubeka, also known as Gunmen, among others.\n\nHowever, these efforts came at a steep cost, as locals failed to fully support his initiatives according to him  ultimately forcing him to step away from event promotion.\n\nMajor events cost money. But for me, hosting all those shows was never really about making a profit. It was about my passion for promotion and putting Plumtree on the map as both an entertainment and cultural hub, he said.\n\nHandsome Sibanda with Aphiwe and Sobancane\n\nIt was also an opportunity to shine the light on our local artistes because, for example, if we bring a high profile guest and we have our local artistes performing there, they would get the visibility they needed.\n\nHandy admitted that some of the biggest disappointments came from those closest to him, who refused to pay cover charges, dismissing those manning entry points with, He is our friend.\n\nThe thing is, everyone here knows me. So, it became difficult to convince people that something great can come out of what I was trying to do. Due to over familiarity, it made it harder for my works to be taken seriously.\n\nPeople would easily pay for an event done by someone they didnt know or had no connection with. If I hosted mine, they would want to enter for free because we are used to him.\n\nThis killed the dream and crippled the vision I had. Honestly speaking, every event was a loss. I kept on pushing with Yugoe because we believed that building something solid takes time.\n\nHandsome Sibanda with Generations The Legacy actress, Manaka Ranaka and DJ Yugoe\n\nHe noted that Madluphuthus appearance was the only event that proved financially successful.\n\nThe only event where I can say we made a profit was when we brought Madluphuthu. For the rest, we barely broke even or suffered losses. I really love my town, Plumtree, but at times, I hate it. Because of the treatment I received, I decided to step away from event promotion, said Handy. Despite stepping back from event promotion, Handy confirmed that he will continue managing and supporting Plumtrees celebrated Maskandi artistes, Aphiwe and Sobancane. The duo has flourished under Handys guidance, as he manages them alongside South Africa-based arts enthusiast, Joyful Ncube.\n\nThose two are my people and Ill never leave them, no matter the odds. The good thing is that theyre managed by both me and Joyful, which makes the work a bit easier, he said.\n\nHe praised Joyful for being a pillar of support and a level-headed leader, adding, We agreed that Aphiwe and Sobancane will continue their journey, along with DJ Yugoe and Babongile Sibanda.\n\n",

            "content": "Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu,[emailprotected]\n\nPLANS are underway to establish a drought mitigation centre at a 19 000ha three-tier model farm in Wanezi, Insiza District in Matabeleland South, which will be a model for other three tier farmers to promote full land utilisation.\n\nThree tier farms are a type of land allocation scheme where communities were given access to former commercial farms as additional grazing land to reduce pressure on communal grazing areas.\n\nUnder the model, land is allocated for homesteads, cropping and grazing to address livestock oriented communities needs.Villagers are restricted from settling within the grazing area. In Matabeleland South, the three- tier model is found in four districts, including Insiza. Wanezi block three tier farm is benefitting the community of Insiza South.\n\nSpeaking recently while addressing community members from the area, Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement Dr Anxious Masuka commended the community for abiding by the three-tier model requirements through preserving their grazing area.\n\nHe said he visited the area to appreciate how the Wanezi block three tier farm could be developed to serve as a learning point for other farmers.\n\nIm here to strengthen the three-tier model and not to destroy it. We have to enhance this three-tier model so we can bring the much needed development, said Dr Masuka.\n\nThere are four wards benefitting from this farm and we will establish four ward drought mitigation centres here. We will start by drilling four boreholes and this should be done next month.\n\nThis three tier farm is meant to support livestock production and we should have mechanisms put in place to support animal production, he added.\n\nWanezi Dam\n\nThe centres will house solar powered boreholes, nutrition gardens, livestock feeding troughs, livestock water troughs, supplementary feeding troughs and livestock sales centres. Each centre will also have fish ponds.\n\nDr Masuka said once the drought mitigation centres have been established other farmers from other three tier farming areas will visit the area to learn.\n\nHe also called on the livestock department to capacitate the farmers on pasture management for proper use of their grazing area.\n\nThe development of three-tier farms is part of efforts by Government to boost the agricultural sector in line with the Rural Development 8.0 Programme.\n\nDr Masuka later unpacked the programme to the community and highlighted the initiatives that have been rolled out by President Mnangagwa to transform rural communities. He said attaining Vision 2030 is about communities utilising their resources to develop themselves and one of the greatest resource of the country is the land.\n\nWanezi Block 3 tier farm caretaker, Mr Collin Siziba, said the community was allocated the farm in 1994 and four wards in the district with about 2 600 households were benefitting.\n\nMr Siziba said the grazing area has been providing relief to community members, especially during drought situations.\n\nWe have people that temporarily stay in the farm in make shift structures to herd cattle but we havent allowed anyone to settle in the farm, he said.\n\nChief Maduna\n\nWe need assistance in developing the farm as we need paddocks and water points to sustain our animals. During drought situations, the farm is a lifeline for our animals hence we know the importance of this place.\n\nChief Maduna said it comes as a huge relief to know that the community will be given title deeds for the farm as it is of sentimental value to the community. He said in the past, some people have tried to take over Wanezi Block 3 tier farm and the title deeds will help the community of Insiza to protect their revolutionary gain.\n\nChief Maduna said traditional leaders have maintained their ground in ensuring that no one settles in their grazing land.The Land Tenure Implementation Programme was officially launched by President Mnangagwa in December 2024 and is expected to grant full ownership to beneficiaries who include 23 000 A2 farmers and 280 000 A1 farmers.\n\nGovernment has established a one-stop centre to streamline the issuance of title deeds for landholders. It is part of efforts to enhance land tenure security and productivity in the country.-@DubeMatutu\n\n",

            "content": "Africa Moyo and Freeman Razemba,Harare Bureau\n\nZIMBABWES infrastructure development agenda is gaining momentum, with public-private partnerships (PPPs) adopted for road projects and US$2,5 million released to accelerate the construction of Lake Gwayi-Tshangani, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube, has said.\n\nThe transformative Lake Gwayi-Tshangani construction project aims to enhance water supply to Bulawayo and its surrounding areas.\n\nMooted in 1912 by the settler colonial regime, the construction project failed to take off on several occasions until the advent of the Second Republic in November 2017.\n\nOut of the 72 metres of the dam wall to be constructed, 39 metres had been completed as of last year.\n\nNot much work was done on the dam wall last year, with most efforts dedicated towards the 10-megawatt hydroelectric project being developed on site.\n\nLake Gwayi-Tshangani, designed by the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) and constructed by China Water and Electric Corporation, will have a capacity of 650 million cubic metres.\n\nZimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa)\n\nIn an exclusive interview with our Harare Bureau, Prof Ncube said there was no going back on infrastructure projects, which have been the signature of the Second Republic, adding that Government is also embracing a public-private partnership model for road construction.\n\nPPPs are critical in funding infrastructure projects as they reduce the burden on Treasury.\n\nThe Government is still focused on the public sector investment programme for roads, dams and other areas. Now, its also true that last year we had quite a cluster around the SADC Summit on the northern side of Harare, also around the New City, to get ready for the summit and that was a good thing, but infrastructure still needed to be done, said Prof Ncube.\n\nThe general infrastructure programme is still on course and the Government is focused on it. I mean, there are still some points of completion to be done on the Harare-Beitbridge Road, we have started on the Harare-Chirundu Road as well, but also, we are now blending the model for road construction with the public-private partnership model.\n\nYou will notice that, for instance, for the Harare-Nyamapanda Road, including the border post, that has been concessioned out to the private sector, with a 25-year concession, and the private sector will invest and then recoup its investment through the toll fees.\n\nHe said the same model applies for the Beitbridge-Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Road, some of whose stretches are presently in bad shape.\n\nProf Ncube said Government is concessioning the modernisation of that highway although in the meantime, there will be some work to patch up the worst parts of the road, especially near the Hwange area, while the private sector player mobilises resources and contracts are finalised.\n\nWe also continue to invest in the water sector. For example, last week, we released about US$2,5 million towards the Lake Gwayi-Tshangani Dam, as an example. And then for the Glass Block Dam in Bulawayo, we are again saying the (Bulawayo) City Council should go ahead and have that done on a public-private partnership basis.\n\nWe continue again to work on Kunzvi Dam, to supply water to Harare. So really, the infrastructure agenda continues. By the way, it is infrastructure investment that also drives economic growth. That is how you invest in future growth in the first place.\n\nSo as a Government, we cannot afford to pull back on that, because then we will be pulling back on investment and growth, said Prof Ncube.\n\nThe Second Republic led by President Mnangagwa has prioritised completion of the Lake Gwayi-Tshangani as it is primed to provide essential water resources and support agricultural activities, ultimately contributing to food security.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by limited resources, the Government remains resolute in its commitment to infrastructure development.\n\nAnother key project, the Mbudzi Interchange in Harare, set to be named Trabablas Interchange on completion, is also on track to be finalised by May 31, according to Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona.\n\nMinister Felix Mhona\n\nThis US$88 million project, located at the intersection of Simon Mazorodze Road, Chitungwiza Road, and High Glen Road, is a key infrastructure development aimed at alleviating traffic congestion in southern Harare.\n\nIt features 15 bridges, all of which have been completed.\n\nThe Mbudzi Interchange is expected to significantly improve traffic flow, reduce transit times, and minimise accidents in the area.\n\nIt is being funded through local financial institutions and executed by a joint venture of three local construction companies: Tensor Systems, Fossil Contracting, and Masimba Construction, operating under the banner of Tefoma Construction.\n\nMinister Mhona said other major road projects, including the Harare-Beitbridge Highway, which has 88km remaining to be completed, are progressing well.\n\nContractors have already mobilised to finish this stretch, which includes 15 bridges, mini-interchanges at Rothmans and ZBC, and other critical infrastructure.\n\nMinister Mhona expressed confidence that the entire highway, including all bridges and interchanges, will be completed this year.\n\nYou have seen that the strategy of the ministry is to attend to our trunk roads. We shall then connect with other neighbouring countries, he said.\n\nNow you have witnessed the North-South Corridor and the Beira Corridor, where we are connecting with other countries. I am happy, again, to say we are completing the Beitbridge-Harare section.\n\nContractors have started mobilising again back to site and as we speak, they are attending to their sections. So we assure the people of Zimbabwe that come this year, the road will be complete with all the 15 bridges.\n\nWe are talking of bridges across rivers, bridges over rail. We have got two on that particular stretch. We have got also mini-interchanges.\n\nMinister Mhona said they have been monitoring the project since it is one of their flagship projects.\n\nHe also confirmed that they were starting to progress on the Harare-Chirundu Road and they were already working on a finance arrangement so they do the entire 352km right up to the border post and also rehabilitate the Chirundu Border Post.\n\nThe Makuti section of this road is already being worked on by the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA), and contractors have mobilised to complete the remaining sections.\n\nMinister Mhona said another significant project in the pipeline is the Christmas Pass bypass in Mutare, aimed at diverting heavy traffic away from the accident-prone area.\n\nGovernment has partnered Leengate (Private) Limited to construct a 26km road that will provide an alternative route to the Forbes Border Post.\n\nBut Prof Ncube called on contractors to do a thorough job to avoid being asked by the Ministry of Transport to redo any stretches that get damaged quickly.\n\nFossil Contracting has already been ordered to redo Mama Mafuyane Drive, formerly Lorraine Drive in Harare, after the road crumbled in no time.\n\nSaid Prof Ncube: There have been a few cases where the Ministry of Transport has instructed contractors to come and redo or revamp roads. Thats not abnormal for them to act in that way.\n\nSo this is clearly an area where, again, we have to always set aside budgets for upgrades, for maintenance, but also be tough on the quality of the roads in the first place.\n\n",

Feeling great to be back and looking forward to the upcoming games. I have seen a lot of quality in the team, and I think the future is bright for the Warriors. I am looking forward to helping some of these youngsters and contributing to their development. Its quite exciting, and I really hope they can come up and represent the national team to the highest level.\n\nKnowledge Musona\n\nThe 35-year-old has been an integral part of Zimbabwes footballing history, scoring 24 goals in 49 matches for the national team.\n\nHis return to the fold comes at a critical time, with the Warriors languishing at the bottom of Group C in the World Cup qualifiers.\n\nWith just two points from four matches, the team faces a daunting task to claw their way back into contention.\n\nHowever, Musona remains optimistic, emphasising the importance of focusing on the upcoming fixtures.\n\nIn football, anything is possible, and I think the most important thing now is to take three points from the upcoming game and also try and collect points in Nigeria. The focus now has to be on Benin. With the quality in this group, I believe we are capable of collecting maximum points, and it all depends on the work we put in at training.\n\nPersonally, I would love to win both games to stay in contention.\n\nMusona also praised the leadership of coach Michael Nees, who has been at the helm since August 2024.\n\nMichael Nees\n\nHe is a great coach. He is quite clear in terms of his vision and everything he wants to do. I think its going to be an exciting journey with him and the crop of players we have, said Musona.\n\nHowever, the squad will be without captain Marvelous Nakamba, who is sidelined by injury.\n\nThe Warriors will face Benin in Durban tomorrow, with tickets for the match pegged at R50 for the 6pm kick-off, before Zimbabwe meets Nigeria in Uyo on March 25.  @innocentskizoe\n\n",

This statement is laudable and statesmanlike and Bravura is committed to this economic growth and development, said Mr Macjuile.\n\nBravura is poised to make a significant impact on the continents mining industry, unlocking Africas vast mineral resources for the benefit of all Africans.\n\nHe said the companys commitment to Zimbabwe has seen it employing the majority of Zimbabweans to enjoy investment spin-offs.\n\nAs you know Bravura is a company registered here in Zimbabwe and about virtually 98 percent of our staff currently, are from the nation of Zimbabwe, said Mr Macjuile.\n\nHe said Bravura shares President Mnangagwas vision that Africa needs African solutions to its challenges.We are a pan-African company, pan-African in the sense that the management and the leadership of Bravura is very concerned and believes in the continent of Africa that Africans are able to cater for themselves. Africans are well-endowed with resources that will enable the continent to develop itself, he said.\n\nMr Macjuile commended the Zimbabwean Government for supporting its projects in the country.He said the company has since introduced a graduate trainee programme as part of its efforts to ensure that Zimbabweans become part of the company.\n\nWe have a graduate trainee programme whereby young Zimbabweans, who just left universities have been absorbed into our group. They undergo a training whereby there is a transfer of knowledge and this goes for two years, said Mr Macjuile.\n\nWe have persons who have been with us, we call them graduate interns. Theyve been with us for a year plus now and the plan of the company is that by the time they complete two years, they will be reintegrated into the company and another set will be taken, he said.\n\nMr Macjuile said when the Bravura Lithium Project comes to life, it will also prioritise the employment of locals in line with the national policy and its development agenda that locals should benefit from its resources within their communities. @nqotshili\n\n",
