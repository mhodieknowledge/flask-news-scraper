This comes following the development of a huge pothole at the corner of Lobengula Street and Third Avenue, a very busy intersection, which is now a nightmare for motorists navigating their way in and out of the Bulawayo city centre.\n\nThe busy intersection is mostly used by commuter omnibus operators who use Luveve Road to link several suburbs such as Emakhandeni, Cowdray Park, Entumbane, Njube, and Nguboyenja, among others, to the city centre. The intersection is littered with potholes, and social media users have now named this large one the King Pothole.\n\nIn a statement, the City of Bulawayo said the works will comprise pothole patching, localised pavement reconstruction, overlays, stormwater drainage improvement works, reinstating of carriageway markings, and other cyclical maintenance works.\n\nThe City of Bulawayo would like to advise members of the motoring public of the proposed Lobengula Street Improvement Works, between 3rd Avenue and 6th Avenue, approximately 800 metres, reads the statement.\n\nThe works will commence on Monday, 24 March 2025, for approximately 30 weeks. Once completed, these works will prolong the life of the carriageway and improve road safety and ride quality.\n\nTo ensure the safety of both the motoring public and workforce whilst carrying out the works, the local authority said a traffic management system will be in place, which includes full carriageway closure of Lobengula Street between 3rd and 6th Avenue and lane closures where necessary.\n\nEvery effort has been made to ensure disruption to traffic, businesses, and residents is kept to a minimum. However, the road closure will inevitably cause some disruption, and for this, the City of Bulawayo wishes to apologise in advance, said the City of Bulawayo.\n\nThe motoring and the general public are advised to exercise extreme caution when entering and leaving the works locations, observe all warning signs, and follow the diversion route signs.\n\n@SikhulekelaniM1\n\n",
