Increased government spending has driven rapid expansions in school enrollment, including for girls.\n\nHowever, despite improvements, the World Bank says the region is facing a growing learning crisis, education outcomes remain low, with the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent shocks further dragging down learning results.\n\nToday, only 11 percent of children in the countries to be addressed by AIM4Learning can read and understand a simple text by age 10, and 14 million basic school-age children are out of school. The programme aims to halve this population, to 7 million by 2034, reads the statement.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa has the worlds fastest-growing child population, making foundational learning for all more critical than ever.\n\nAIM4Learning is an ambitious regional programme dedicated to ensuring quality education for every African child. By investing in education, we invest not just in individual futures, but in the prosperity, stability, and dignity of the entire continent, said Victoria Kwakwa, vice president for the World Banks Eastern and Southern Africa Region.\n\nThe AIM4Learning programme will be implemented in phases over a 10-year period and the first phase will include participation from Comoros and Ethiopia.\n\nAcross the world, technology is increasingly seen as an accelerator for learning, particularly for hard-to-reach and vulnerable children, said Laura Frigenti, CEO of the Global Partnership for Education.\n\nBut deploying technology and resources to tackle the grave education crisis and prepare children for the jobs of the future is no easy task. Partnerships are key to offer countries context-relevant technology support that can help them transform their education systems and make them fit for the 21st century.\n\nThe World bank said AIM4Learning is built on four pillars  transforming learning spaces, developing an effective teacher workforce, strengthening education systems and financing, and encouraging cross-country collaboration.\n\nIt said each participating country will select from a tailored set of options under each pillar, aligning with its specific context and most pressing challenges.\n\n",

Picture  BELIEVE NYAKUDYARA\n\nIn his keynote address, President Mnangagwa, chair of SADC, emphasised the importance of discipline and vigilance among the youth. The event was attended by Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga, Cabinet ministers, top Government officials, and representatives from sister liberation parties, including the ANC (South Africa), Frelimo (Mozambique), Chama Cha Mapinduzi (Tanzania), and CNDD-FDD (Burundi).\n\nI extend a special welcome to you, our young people, as well as delegates from other countries. Your presence here is a testament to the unity and solidarity that define us, the SADC region, and indeed the continent of Africa. I urge you, our young people, to guard jealously this long-standing tradition of unity, solidarity, and peaceful co-existence. The current development era equally demands that you constantly learn from each other, sharing knowledge and experiences for the betterment of your respective communities and countries. None but yourselves has that responsibility, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe underscored that the prosperity and future of the region and Africa lie in the hands of the young generation.\n\nWe, the older generation, played our part to bring about independence, freedom, and peace. The ball is now in your court. You must deliver. In unity, the youth of Africa can do more for the realisation of the Africa we want and deserve.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa reaffirmed the older generations belief in the youths potential.\n\nThis National Youth Day is set aside and dedicated to recognising the potential of you, the young people of our country. We, your leaders, believe in your potential and will continue to ensure that your zeal and energy are harnessed so that you accomplish your dreams and aspirations and ultimately, our national Vision 2030. The huge turnout, peaceful, jovial, and electric atmosphere characterising this gathering is a reflection of our collective unity and defining national character as an independent and sovereign people.\n\nEmphasising unity, he urged the youth to remain hardworking, patriotic, and loyal to the country.\n\nResist and reject machinations of those who would want to divide you and divide our nation.\n\nThe President said the celebrations were a chance to reflect on past generations contributions and stressed the importance of discipline, commitment, and hard work for Zimbabwes future.\n\nWe also have a chance to chart and refine the journey we are taking for a brighter future, particularly the role of you; our young people. In undertaking this critical task, remain emboldened by the virtues of courage, selfless sacrifice, and bravery which were defining among the youths of yesteryear. They took up arms against the oppressive colonial regime and brought us independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, freedom, and democracy.\n\nThese historical milestones, including the rich liberation war heritage, are indispensable and must be safeguarded and passed down from generation to generation, he said.\n\nI, further, call upon you, the young people of this great nation, to continue displaying utmost discipline, commitment, and hard, honest work for the collective good of our country. In doing so, you must be aware that the unity and peace we enjoy today is a fundamental inheritance of the liberation struggle. No one must jeopardise or endanger these critical national aspects.\n\nNational Youth Day, a public holiday under the Second Republic, has become an inclusive platform for youth expression and engagement.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa reaffirmed the Governments commitment to youth empowerment through leadership roles in Government and other key institutions. He stressed that National Youth Day should be a platform for hope, unity, and safeguarding Zimbabwes heritage and freedoms.\n\nIn view of these achievements, I challenge the young people deployed in various leadership positions to continue displaying principles of servant leadership and discipline while galvanising the youth to fully participate in the socio-economic and cultural affairs of our country. As the vanguard of our country, you must take the initiative and develop synergies and partnerships while building a common united front to advance the aims and objectives of our peoples revolution and development thrust.\n\nHe implored the youth to remain vigilant and patriotic.\n\nDefend the integrity and dignity of our country, leadership, and its people. Stand firm, and inculcate a culture of volunteerism and service among all the young people in our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe. The young people both within our country and in the diaspora are called upon to leverage their potential, competencies, and skills towards the pursuit of fulfilling careers.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa urged young people to embrace technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship to create wealth, jobs, and economic growth, expressing confidence in their ability to make Zimbabwe a success.\n\nThe future of our country lies in your hands, he said.\n\nThe celebrations also saw the launch of the Zimbabwe Digital Skills Development Programme, an ambitious initiative implemented in collaboration with the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThis initiative will train 1,5 million young people across the country as software engineers, developers, and programmers. This will enhance digital literacy and skills among Zimbabwean citizens and empower a new generation of professionals who can contribute to technological innovation, he said.\n\nThe programme will train young people in programming, data science, and Android development, fostering innovation and supporting local tech solutions and start-ups.\n\nThis must enhance the countrys competitiveness in the global market, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Vusumuzi Dube,[emailprotected]\n\nHIGHLANDERS, Bulawayos iconic football giants, are a year away from their centenary.\n\nHopes for a celebratory season were briefly dashed when Fifa slapped them with a transfer ban for unpaid wages to former coach Baltemar Brito and his assistant.\n\nBrito was owed US$14,778 plus interest, and Torres US$11,788 plus interest, both accruing further penalties.\n\nJust when it seemed Bosso faced a prolonged crisis, socialite Wicknell Chivayo stepped in, paying off the debts in full.While this saved the clubs blushes, it exposed worrying questions about financial management.\n\nThe debt was notably absent from discussions at last months AGM, leaving fans in the dark.\n\nClub chairman Kenneth Mhlophe said they were relying on sponsors to resolve the issue before Fifas punishment, but the near miss has raised serious concerns about transparency as Bosso approaches its 100th year.\n\nKenneth Mhlophe\n\nWe engaged our sponsors over the issue. Going into the annual general meeting week, all appeared in place for the debt to have been paid, and we counted on their usual support, Mhlophe said.\n\nMhlophe deflected criticism by blaming his predecessor, Johnfat Sibanda, for the stalled Inyathi gold mining venture.\n\nThe project, intended to generate club revenue, reportedly made no progress under Sibandas leadership.\n\nThere was no action at all on the mining venture.\n\nThings were still as I had left them, and we then began to chase paperwork. As we speak, the papers have been lodged with the Ministry of Mines. Once they respond, we will be fine, Mhlophe said.\n\nBossos crisis has sparked scrutiny of Mhlophe and Sibandas leadership.Fans and stakeholders are comparing their tenures, achievements, and failures.\n\nThis week, Saturday Chronicle will analyse their impact on the club.\n\nMhlophe, the current chairperson, is no stranger to the Highlanders community, having previously served as the clubs chair from 2018 to 2021 before losing to Sibanda. His return to the helm of the club was seen as an opportunity to build on his earlier tenure and address lingering issues.\n\nHits:\n\nSecured more sponsorship for Highlanders\n\nMhlophe continued the Sakunda deal and secured a Better Brands sponsorship from Pedzai Scott Sakupwanya. Sakunda remained the main sponsor, while Better Brands covered costs for the Highlanders Academy (including all junior teams and the womens team, Highlanders Royals), paying staff and players.\n\nInfrastructure Development\n\nDuring his earlier tenure, Mhlophe initiated plans to renovate the clubs facilities, including the training grounds and the clubhouse. These efforts have continued in his current term, reflecting his commitment to improving the clubs infrastructure.\n\nImproved relations with fans\n\nMhlophe has worked tirelessly to restore trust and goodwill between the club and its fan base. Through community outreach efforts and fan engagement programmes, he sought to re-establish Highlanders as the peoples team. Last year, they held a successful fundraising initiative that was well-supported by both local and international fans.\n\nMisses:\n\nLimited success on the field\n\nDespite the perceived financial stability and structural improvements, Highlanders have yet to translate these gains into major success on the pitch. The club has not won the league title since 2006, and fans are growing increasingly impatient as the wait for a championship continues. In 2024, Highlanders failed to retain the Independence Trophy, were knocked out of the Chibuku Super Cup via a boardroom decision, and finished sixth in the league.\n\nFifa ban after failing to pay former coaches outstanding salaries\n\nThe biggest failure that has marred his leadership was the Fifa ban on registering new players after they failed to pay their former coaches. What makes this a greater stain on his tenure is the manner in which he hid this from the clubs membership during their AGM. A question on everyones mind is how many skeletons in their closet were not revealed to its membership; what else is Mhlophe and his executive hiding?\n\nFailure to negotiate meaningful contracts with players\n\nHighlanders continue to lose players on free transfers due to poor contract negotiations. Under Mhlophe, Marvelous Chigumira, Godfrey Makaruse, Peter Muduhwa, Lynoth Chikuhwa, and several juniors left for free after their contracts expired. This costly mismanagement, despite a prior AGM resolution against it, forces the team to rebuild without transfer revenue.\n\nLack of a clear plan to help finance the club\n\nMhlophes corporate experience hasnt translated into success for Highlanders. The club remains financially unstable, reliant on handouts, and lacks a clear survival plan.Proactive leadership is absent; Mhlophe mainly reacts to problems.The long-promised mining venture offers little immediate hope.\n\nFailure to provide replica jerseys\n\nLast season, fans made do with purchasing replica jerseys from the streets. The club continuously promised that the replicas were coming in a few weeks right up to the last game. We are now in 2025, and no sign of the replicas. Mhlophe has no plan at all on how he will counter the sale of these replicas on the streets. All that the club provided were woollen hats and scarves, which ironically were released during the summer season.\n\nNo movement in the transfer market\n\nIt is clear to all that Highlanders need to boost its squad, but a few weeks before the season starts, there is little or no movement on the transfer market. Other teams are busy bolstering their squad, but Mhlophe and his team are just silent. We will just give them the benefit of the doubt; maybe they are preparing to unleash a secret weapon that will once again bring smiles to its legion of fans\n\nSibanda took over the reins of Highlanders Football Club in March 2021, after defeating Kenneth Mhlophe in a closely contested election. His tenure was marked by high expectations, as he campaigned on a platform of change, accountability, and financial stability for the club.\n\nHits:\n\nSecured Sakunda sponsorship\n\nSibanda secured a lucrative Sakunda sponsorship, providing US$420 000 for player salaries, US$60 000 each for sign-on fees and operational expenses, a potential US$200 000 league-winning bonus, and Ford Everest and Ranger vehicles for the coach and captain.\n\nAvailed replica jerseys for fans\n\nThrough sponsorship from Sakunda, replica shirts were available in three colours for Bosso fans to purchase.\n\nBrought in Brito\n\nSibanda hired foreign coach Baltemar Jos de Oliveira Brito, who nearly won the league, and brought in Joel Luphahla as assistant, with a succession plan. Luphahla later left, finding success at Dynamos and now coaching Simba Bhora.\n\nBaltemar Jose De Oliveira Brito\n\nRenovation of the Highlanders Clubhouse\n\nThe Highlanders Clubhouse had gone for years without any notable renovations; it was now an eyesore, with non-functioning toilets, broken furniture, and everything in a state of disrepair. However, Sibandas administration secured a partnership deal with local businessman Phathisani Nkomo to modernise the clubhouse. This has made it a popular venue for Bosso fans after matches.\n\nBrought some cup glory to Highlanders\n\nDuring his tenure, Sibanda saw the team win the Independence Cup in 2022 and 2023.\n\nRevenue generation through the selling of players\n\nHe sold Daniel Msendami and Nqobizitha Masuku to Jwaneng Galaxy, thereby generating much-needed revenue for the club.\n\nMisses\n\nFailure to strengthen the squad, despite interest from players like Kuda Mahachi and Bruce Kangwa, resulted in a goal drought (just 24 goals) and cost Highlanders the league title.The championship remained elusive.\n\nFailure to produce audited results\n\nHe failed to produce audited accounts for the 2023 AGM, something that had not happened at the club in years. This eroded the trust of potential sponsors.\n\nFailed to get the clubs mining project in Inyathi off the ground\n\nHighlanders Inyathi gold mine claim, awarded in 2020 by President Mnangagwa, saw little development under Sibanda, despite plans to use proceeds for facilities and junior teams.A designated mine manager made no progress.\n\nInternal Divisions\n\nSibandas leadership was also marred by internal divisions within the clubs structures. Reports of factionalism and disagreements with board members occasionally surfaced, undermining his ability to lead effectively\n\nUltimately, Highlanders remain in a rebuilding phase, and the true measure of any chairpersons success will be the clubs ability to reclaim its status as a dominant force in Zimbabwean football. Both leaders have contributed to the clubs journey in different ways, and their legacies will hinge on whether the foundation they have laid can lead to sustained success in the future.\n\n",

May I take this opportunity to recognise my fellow youthful ministers, said Minister Machakaire.\n\nAs part of your strategic innovations towards achieving Vision 2030, we recognise and celebrate the progress made in key areas for youth development. One remarkable step has been establishing Youth Focal Desks. We commend you, Your Excellency, for creating these desks, important points of contact for youth engagement. However, further optimisation is needed to ensure they function more efficiently and effectively, ultimately becoming more responsive to young peoples needs.\n\nMinister Machakaire acknowledged Zimbabwes youth potential but stressed the need for further empowerment. He said his ministry is modernising Vocational Training Centres (VTCs) to equip young people with practical skills for national development.\n\nHe lobbied for a local scholarship programme to support students lacking the financial means to attend tertiary institutions.\n\nYour Excellency, you will be pleased to know that, thanks to your support for underprivileged students in ZimFEP schools, 13 students from Binga, who benefited from this initiative, successfully completed secondary education and have applied for the 2025 Presidential Scholarship Scheme. While this is commendable, we acknowledge that not all deserving students can be accommodated under the Presidential Scholarship Scheme.\n\nBuilding on this success, we humbly propose, through your wisdom and guidance, that we also create scholarships for our local state universities. This initiative would resonate with your core principles of devolution and the commitment to ensuring that no one and no place is left behind.Minister Machakaire said the Ministry is also prioritising digital skills training for young people.\n\nIn todays digital age, digital literacy is crucial for empowering young people to access education, employment, and economic opportunities. The ministry continues to prioritise digital literacy and skills development, ensuring our young people are well-equipped to thrive in our increasingly interconnected world, he said.\n\nMinister Machakaire called for improvements to the Youth Empowerment Bank and suggested the Government prioritise employing graduates from the Youth Service Zimbabwe programme, which has trained over 1 000 young people since last year.\n\nWe wish for a policy prioritising the employment and placement in higher learning institutions of these graduates. Such a policy would ensure that our home-grown talents contributions are not only recognised but prioritised in driving our country forward. It is worth mentioning, Your Excellency, that our Youth Service in Zimbabwe graduates are qualified in several fields.\n\nGone are the days when it was assumed this programme was only for the uneducated. Under your astute leadership, Your Excellency, we have trained qualified graduates who are more than able and ready to serve their country, he said.\n\nHe commended First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa for initiating programmes addressing social ills like drug and substance abuse and gender-based violence among young people.@nqotshili\n\n",

This years festival is especially significant as it honours the theme: Celebrating Women.\n\nThe festival has always showcased the best of European cinema while highlighting the talents of Zimbabwean and African filmmakers.This year, for the first time in several years, the festival will be held in May, coinciding with both Europe Day (May 9th) and Africa Day (May 25th).\n\nMovie lovers taking notes at a EuroFilmFestZW workshop\n\nThese dates hold historical importance, marking the anniversary of the Schuman Declaration, which paved the way for the European Union, and the formation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), now the African Union (AU).\n\nThis timing provides a perfect opportunity to foster a stronger cultural dialogue between Europe and Africa, right here in Zimbabwe. We invite audiences to celebrate not just cinema, but the arts, music, culture, and food that connect and inspire us all, Gwaze said.\n\nCompetition gongs\n\nTo recognise and encourage Zimbabwean filmmakers, the prize pool for the Bioskop Competition has been doubled from US$400 to US$800. This increase aims to further inspire creativity and participation, particularly among women.\n\nWhile we typically receive 50 to 60 entries each year, weve noticed a concerning trend: fewer entries from female filmmakers.The theme Celebrating Women is therefore a deliberate and passionate focus to amplify womens voices and stories, Gwaze said.\n\nThe Bioskop Short Film Competition invites filmmakers to explore the theme Celebrating Women, encouraging interpretations ranging from personal stories to historical tributes. Films that depict women challenging norms and inspiring change are particularly welcome.\n\nThe Bioskop Short Film Competition offers prizes in the following categories: Best Narrative Short (US$800), Best Documentary Short (US$800), Best Sound Editing (US$400), Best Cinematography (US$400), Best Diaspora Film (US$400), and Best Actor/Actress (US$400).\n\nMovie lovers enjoy film screenings\n\nThe competition is open to Zimbabwean residents, and those of Zimbabwean heritage living in any European or African country.\n\nFor a decade, the festival has been a launchpad for talented filmmakers, providing a platform to showcase their work and connect with industry professionals. The winning film receives a cash prize and is screened at EuroFilmFestZW.\n\nLast years winners included My Husband Joe by Derby Bheta (Best Narrative) and Chasing Levels by Dumie Manyathela (Best Documentary). The addition of the Best Actor/Actress category last year broadened the festivals scope and recognised on-screen talent.\n\nFilmmakers have until April 6 to submit their entries via FilmFreeway. The competition welcomes all genres, including animation, documentary, and live-action. Films will be judged on content and creativity, with a focus on innovation, regardless of the filmmakers resources.\n\nAsaph performs at one of the EuroFilmFestZW sessions\n\nAs EuroFilmFestZW celebrates its tenth anniversary, it aims to highlight womens contributions, not only in cinema but across all industries.\n\nThis festival is an opportunity to shine a spotlight on the remarkable women who inspire, break barriers, and redefine societal roles, both in front of and behind the camera, Gwazesaid.\n\nThis years festival also coincides with the ongoing Zimbabwe Film Strategy 2025-2030, launched by the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) last year, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the local film industry.  @MbuleloMpofu.\n\n",
