The childs body was recovered days later in the Gwayi River after an extensive search involving villagers and the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) sub-aqua unit.Godzo Stream, where the incident occurred, flows into the Gwayi River. The Civil Protection Unit (CPU) Tsholotsho District chairperson, Mr Aaron Gono, reiterated the importance of exercising caution near water bodies during the rainy season.The incident happened in Nhlangano Village under Chief Magama. A male juvenile was playing with other children, and due to heavy rains, Godzo Stream was flooded. He was swept away, he said.Mr Magama noted that the other children, likely panicked and confused, only reported the incident a day later when questions arose about the boys whereabouts. Villagers immediately alerted the police, and a search party was formed to locate the childs body.The search party, comprising local villagers and the police sub-aqua unit, combed through the flooded stream and downstream areas. The boys body was eventually retrieved from the Gwayi River by villagers.\n\nMr Gono commended the communitys disaster risk reduction structures for their ongoing efforts to raise awareness and improve safety.This is an unfortunate incident, but we strongly believe our local disaster risk reduction structures have been effective in disseminating information. We encourage people not to attempt crossing flooded rivers or streams, especially at night, as this increases the risk of being swept away, he said.Mr Gono added that siltation and muddy, slippery bridges pose additional dangers during the rainy season.Tsholotsho is one of Zimbabwes districts most prone to flooding. The area has experienced heavy rainfall since last month, with the Meteorological Services Department (MSD) warning of potential flooding across the country.A few years ago, severe floods in Sipepa displaced hundreds of villagers and caused widespread destruction. The Government responded by relocating affected families to safer, higher ground and constructing modern houses for them.The CPU has activated its local structures to respond to incidents in the district during this rainy season@ncubeleon\n\n",

In addition, the hospital handles an average of 350 baby deliveries per month, including caesarean sections, which require consistent and adequate water supplies.Crossborders for ED chairperson, Mr Blessing Mureyani, said the group had decided to collaborate with fellow transporters to help restore and enhance health services at the hospital.We have started mobilising resources, and our immediate plan is to drill one solar-powered borehole with a water tank, said Mr Mureyani.We believe this initiative is critical in complementing the Governments efforts to provide quality services at the hospital.He added: As Crossborders for ED, we are deeply concerned about the challenges faced by members of our community, which is why we are stepping in. We also intend to fundraise to provide further support to this vital institution, which serves not only Beitbridge but also a significant number of travellers, including cross-border transporters and visitors from various SADC countries.Mr Mureyani appealed to other community members to join in supporting the hospital to ensure the continuity of quality health services.In addition to their planned borehole project, the group has already donated over 500 plates and cups to the local correctional facility and 10 bicycles to traditional leaders in the district.\n\n",

Amid the pandemonium Peter Sithole was fatally shot.After the shooting, the aggressors leapt over the counter, making off with the till containing R528, as well as speakers and an amplifier. They also stole two cell phones before fleeing the scene.One of the aggressors, Thabani Solomon Mahlaba was apprehended in Zvishavane on 24 April 2010, following a shootout with detectives. He subsequently led authorities to his residence, where they seized two pistols, speakers, and an amplifier, linking him to the crime.Fifteen years after the crime, detectives received a tip on 11 January 2025, that the accused was planning a secret visit to his in-laws home in Nkulumane, Bulawayo, prompting police to act swiftly and apprehend him.In an official Press Statement Bulawayo police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Nomalanga Msebele said, A search was carried out in his white Toyota Mark X resulting in the recovery of a black pellet pistol and a silver flip knife. He was also found in possession of a valid Zimbabwean plastic drivers license with his portrait in the name of Ryan Ncube.Same was interviewed about the whereabouts of his co-accused Shadreck Zvigo and he mentioned that he last saw him during the commission of the murder offence.\n\nShe appreciated members of the public for supplying information that led to the arrest of the accused person.We also warn the public that no matter how long one plans to flee after committing an offence, they should bear in mind that the long arm of the law will finally catch up with them.The accused person thought that he is clever by running away for 15 years not knowing that his case is still pending as they say Icala aliboli. We urge members of the public to desist from violent conduct as this lead to unnecessary loss of lives. We appeal to anyone with information that may lead to the arrest of Shadreck Zvigo to visit any nearest police station.\n\n",

This charitable endeavour, unique in both the suburb and the wider Bulawayo area, is poised to make a transformative impact on the lives of talented but disadvantaged children.\n\nTwo colleges which agreed to take two orphans each who are being assisted by the Entumbane community.\n\nMr Mlilo reached out to two local institutionsZenith Christian College and Bright Future Collegeboth of which welcomed his request to provide the children with an opportunity to continue their studies. Each college has committed to supporting two children, ensuring they receive the same quality education as their peers.There is no formal committee for this project, said Mr Mlilo. Im simply the coordinator, and its the community that makes the donations. People contact me, and I collect the contributions. I approached the colleges, and Im grateful to Zenith Christian College, led by Mr Desire Maguta, and Bright Future College, led by Mr Ndethi, for agreeing to help. They understand the potential these children have, and they also recognise that as orphans, these children belong to the entire community.Mr Mlilo continues to tirelessly seek donations from both the local community and other potential supporters, hoping to expand the programme to include more children.My goal is to find more donors so that we can send even more orphans to school, he said. I speak to schools, and if they agree to participate, I then approach the community for contributions. I also use my personal contacts to gather support. The more people donate, the more orphans we can help. Its fulfilling to know that were making a difference at the community level.Mr Mlilo has a list of 15 orphans eager to attend school but unable to afford the fees.Whats particularly heart-breaking is that these children are exceptionally talented. For instance, two sisters recently enrolled passed their Grade Seven exams with outstanding resultsone with 10 units and the other with seven. Unfortunately, financial constraints almost stopped them from continuing their education. We appeal to more donors to help us support these children, he said.One beneficiary of the programme, Mrs Nokuthula Ncube, whose orphaned niece has now returned to school, expressed her heartfelt gratitude to the community.I am deeply thankful to the people of Entumbane, especially Mr Mlilo, for hearing our plea and ensuring our niece can go to school, she said. She lost her mother, and her father is unable to care for her. The community has truly shown love and care, and we are confident that she now has a bright future ahead. We pray that those who are donating will be blessed abundantly.This latest initiative follows another recent charitable effort in which Entumbane residents donated Christmas hampers to 50 disabled community members. The continued support for orphans and other vulnerable groups highlights the unwavering commitment of the Entumbane community to uplift those in need.Ends\n\n",
