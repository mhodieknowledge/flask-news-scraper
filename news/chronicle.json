President Nujoma was a selfless, courageous and visionary leader who dedicated his life to the liberation and development of his country, he said.\n\nOur thoughts and love are with the family and the people of Namibia at this time of grief. Rest in peace, Africas hero!\n\nZambian President Hakainde Hichilema posted on his X page: Deeply saddened by the passing of Dr Sam Nujoma  freedom fighter, nationalist, Pan-Africanist, and founding President of Namibia. His legacy will live on forever.\n\nDr Nujoma was the founding leader of the South West Africa Peoples Organisation (SWAPO), which spearheaded Namibias fight for freedom. His leadership and vision played a pivotal role in shaping modern Namibia and advancing the cause of Pan-Africanism.\n\nDr Nujoma was born on 12 May 1929, in a village in northwestern Namibia when his country was under South African administration. South Africa had controlled Namibia since World War One after a brutal few decades of German colonial rule, remembered for the genocide of the Herero and Nama people.\n\nAs a boy, he looked after his familys cattle and attended a Finnish mission school, before moving to the coastal town of Walvis Bay and then the capital, Windhoek, where he worked for South African Railways, according to a biography posted on the website of Dr Nujomas charitable foundation.\n\nDr Nujoma left his job at the railways to focus his energies on bringing down the apartheid system. In the late 1950s, he became leader of the Owambo Peoples Organisation, a precursor to the liberation movement SWAPO, organising resistance to the forced relocation of Black people in Windhoek, which culminated in the police killing 12 unarmed people and wounding dozens more.\n\nDr Nujoma was charged with organising the resistance and arrested. In 1960, he went into exile. He travelled across Africa before reaching the United States, where he petitioned the United Nations for Namibias independence.\n\nMade SWAPO leader in absentia, Dr Nujoma established its armed wing and in 1966 launched a guerrilla war against the apartheid government.\n\nIt took more than a decade of pressure from Dr Nujoma and others before a UN Security Council resolution in 1978 proposed a ceasefire and elections, and another decade for the ceasefire deal to be signed and elections to be held in late 1989.\n\nDr Nujoma was the last of a generation of African leaders who brought their countries out of colonial or white minority rule, including the late former President Robert Mugabe, South Africas Nelson Mandela, Zambias Kenneth Kaunda, Tanzanias Julius Nyerere, and Mozambiques Samora Machel.\n\nDr Nujoma spent nearly 30 years in exile as the leader of Namibias independence movement before returning for Parliamentary elections in late 1989, the first democratic vote in the country.\n\nHe was elected president by lawmakers months later in 1990 as Namibias independence was confirmed.\n\n",

            "content": "Raymond Jaravazam,[emailprotected]\n\nCOWDRAY Park, one of Bulawayos largest and fastest-growing suburbs, is grappling with a severe shortage of schools, clinics, and other essential amenities.\n\nWhile the suburbs population continues to expand rapidly, infrastructure development has failed to keep pace with the growing demand.\n\nAccording to the 2022 Population and Housing Census, Cowdray Park is home to 75 000 residents, spread across more than 27 000 stands, including residential, commercial, and industrial zones.\n\nYet, as the number of houses rises daily, residents are left facing major challenges in accessing basic services, including education.\n\nDespite being the citys largest suburb, Cowdray Park only boasts three secondary schools, comprising the Government-run Cowdray Park Secondary School and two privately owned institutions.\n\nThis scarcity of educational facilities forces many parents to send their children to schools in nearby areas like Luveve, Emakhandeni, or even the city centre  locations that are often miles away from their homes.\n\nIn the Hlalani Kuhle/Garikai area, a makeshift secondary school  Onxy Academy  has emerged to fill the gap. The school, constructed with walls made from metal sheets, currently enrols over 100 students.\n\nSince opening its doors in January 2024, Onxy Academy has become the only educational institution serving the western part of Cowdray Park, known as Esgodweni. The school offers a range of subjects but lacks practical classes like Agriculture, Woodwork, Metalwork, Food and Nutrition, and Fashion and Fabrics.\n\nWe are the only school in this part of the suburb, and our vision is to provide quality education and adequately prepare students for public exams. We opened in January 2024 with an enrolment of just over 100 learners, said Mr Elton Tofa, the school principal.\n\nOur long-term goal is to develop the school into a fully-fledged institution, complete with science blocks, workshops, and sports facilities.\n\nThe schools current infrastructure is modest, and it relies on a staff of just seven educators to manage the diverse needs of its students. Despite these limitations, Onxy Academy has become a lifeline for many families, especially for students like Sipho, a Form Four learner.\n\nSipho, who resides at the far end of Cowdray Park, shared his experience:\n\nIts not easy to get a place at Cowdray Park Secondary School because its always full, and my parents cannot afford to send me to a school in the city centre. Im grateful for Onxy Academy because its close to my home, and many of my friends are here.\n\nLocal resident Orlando Mlilo expressed concern over the lack of sufficient educational options in the area.\n\nCowdray Park is growing at an alarming rate, but the construction of schools is not keeping up. Two years ago, I tried to enrol my son at Luveve High, but they told me that the school only accepts children from the local area, he said.\n\nAccording to 2023 statistics from the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, Zimbabwe has 10 517 schools. Ideally, the ratio of schools to population in the country should be about one school for every 1 500 people, based on a 95 percent gross enrolment rate in primary education and a national population of 15 million.\n\nHowever, Cowdray Parks rapid expansion has left the suburb with a severe shortage of secondary schools.\n\nWard 28 Councillor Ntandoyenkosi Ndlovu highlighted the urgency of the situation, particularly during the rainy season when mud and poor road conditions make commuting to schools even more difficult.\n\nThe situation becomes even worse in the rainy season, when learners from the far end of the suburb must walk long distances to Cowdray Park Secondary.\n\nNot all parents can afford to send their children to private schools in the area, so its critical for the government to expedite the construction of additional secondary schools, said Clr Ndlovu.\n\nWith a population of 75 000, Cowdray Park is now the second most populous urban ward in Zimbabwe, after Harares Budiriro, which has over 89 000 residents.\n\nThe suburbs population is larger than that of towns like Gwanda (27 000 residents) and Hwange (40 000 residents). As the population continues to grow, the demand for essential services like education, healthcare, and shopping facilities becomes increasingly urgent.\n\n",

technical direction that will ensure immediate ceasefire enforcement in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), facilitate humanitarian aid and develop a security plan for Goma and surrounding areas.\n\nAt the same time, African countries that were backing rebels in the DRC were also directed to immediately leave to give the people of the vast and resource-endowed nation a chance to live in sustainable peace.\n\nSpeaking to journalists upon his return from the joint SADC-EAC summit on Saturday night, President Mnangagwa said the meeting underscored the need for regional co-operation in addressing insecurity in the eastern parts of DRC.\n\nHe said the two blocs had resolved that no individual country should support armed groups responsible for conflict and displacement in the region.\n\nThe summit, co-chaired by President Mnangagwa in his capacity as SADC chairperson and Kenyan President William Ruto as EAC chairperson, focused on strategies to restore peace in the conflict-riddled region.\n\nWell, it was a joint summit of SADC and East African communities and the main issues were the issues of insecurity in the Eastern DRC, said the President.\n\nIt was an attempt by the two blocs  SADC and East African Community  to deal with that in security, trying to find ways where the two blocs can help create peace in that region and identify the parties that are involved in the military contestation in the Eastern DRC.\n\nDespite the complexity of the situation, President Mnangagwa said, consensus was reached that all member States must refrain from supporting or arming any militant groups operating in the region.\n\nOf course, it was very difficult but in the end, it was resolved that all member States should make sure that they do not support groups, armed groups in the region, to cause insecurity on the continent and in that particular area.\n\nOf course, no Member State came forward to say they were supporting an army, but it was very clear that these (rebel) groups were actually allowed to operate from a certain Member State.\n\nIt was agreed that everything must be done to silence the guns, and that they (armed groups) should not be rendered any support by any member State.\n\nIn its communiqu, the joint summit directed that modalities for the withdrawal of uninvited foreign armed forces from the territory of the DRC, be developed and implemented by the two regional bodies top military officials.\n\nThe joint summit reaffirmed solidarity and unwavering commitment to continue supporting the DRC in its pursuit of safeguarding its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as sustainable peace, security and development, read the communiqu in part.\n\nThe summit decided that similar consultations shall be convened at least once every year and as and when the need arises to review matters of common interest to the two regions.\n\nApart from that, the summit directed that a joint meeting of ministers of EAC and SADC convenes within the next 30 days to deliberate on:\n\n(a) the report of the joint meeting of CDFs on the ceasefire and cessation of hostilities\n\n(b) establishment of a secretariat-level technical coordination mechanism to monitor implementation of the joint summit decisions\n\n(c) an elaborate road map detailing immediate, medium- and long-term implementation measures, including financing modalities, and address all other residual issues relating to the attainment of sustainable peace and security in the eastern DRC and make appropriate recommendations to the next joint meeting of the EAC-SADC Summit.\n\nThe regional leaders also directed the resumption of direct negotiations with all State and non-State actors, including M23, within the Luanda/Nairobi process framework, while calling for implementation of the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) to neutralise the FDLR and facilitating Rwandas disengagement from the DRC.\n\nSADC and the EAC convened Saturdays joint summit to try and find a lasting solution to the DRC crisis, which has seen rebel groups taking over towns in the eastern parts of the vast country.\n\nApart from SADC Chairman President Mnangagwa, his EAC Counterpart President Ruto, and the host Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan, there was a huge turnout of regional leaders.\n\nDRCs President Felix Tshisekedi, who accuses Rwanda of backing the rebels in his country, attended the joint summit virtually.\n\nRwandan President Paul Kagame, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, South African leader Cyril Ramaphosa, Somalian President Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud and Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, attended the high-stakes joint summit.\n\nLeaders of Burundi, Angola, Malawi, South Sudan and Madagascar were represented by ministers.\n\nOn Saturday President Mnangagwa told his fellow leaders that Africa must draw from its shared historical solidarity and the unity it used to dismantle colonialism to free the people of the DRC from internecine wars and conflict that undermine development.\n\nAddressing the opening session of the joint summit, President Mnangagwa said Africa should not let the people of DRC down but must, through honest dialogue, find a solution to silence the guns and engender enduring peace in the Great Lakes region.\n\nThe unity, solidarity and unbreakable bonds of the peoples of the continent must stand the test of such trying times, he said.\n\nWe must remain as solidly united as we were during the struggle for the complete emancipation and independence of Africa from colonialism.\n\nWe, thus, have a duty and collective responsibility to comprehensively, frankly, tackle and address the various challenges that are impeding the realisation of peace and security for the people of Eastern DRC.\n\nDrawing from our rich African values and heritage, and further emboldened by the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter; the Constitutive Act of the African Union as well as the treaties of both SADC and the EAC; let us seize this opportunity to ensure convergence and a coordinated response which is mutually reinforcing towards one common objective.\n\nTowards the ultimate objective of finding last peace in the DRC, President Mnangagwa said talks among regional leaders must always be carried with openness, honesty, flexibility and a commitment to building lasting peace.\n\n",

In the sixth, blood was continually dripping off the eye, so the referee was forced to momentarily halt the bout.\n\nAfter being checked by the doctors, Chisora did not let up the intensity and unleashed several shots on Wallin in the seventh, before an incredible attack in the eighth with around 30 consecutive swings rocked his opponent.\n\nHe glanced Wallin with a right hand in the ninth to send the Swede tumbling, then tactically drew him into the corner over the rest of the bout to land more blows to the body, including another knockdown in the final round before the bell went.

At the centre of it all is God, my biggest circle.\n\nHer unique musical style is deeply rooted in her upbringing, influenced by her grandfather, who was a traditional healer. She grew up singing with her family during ceremonies and celebrations, where she would imitate the singing and dancing of her elders.\n\nShe described how each song carries a spiritual story, citing Isavunguzane as an example.That song is about the whirlwind. I had a mysterious and divine encounter with a whirlwind, which inspired the track.The musician, a former Black Umfolosi dancer and ex-Albert Nyathi lead vocalist is planning a live album launch in April, which will include a full video recording of the performance.\n\nIll also select a few songs for official music videos. Some exciting collaborations with other artistes are on the way, so people should keep an eye out!\n\nBusi Mhlanga\n\nShe praised the dedication of her production team, particularly Trust Samende.We worked tirelessly, with many sleepless nights and busy days. Trust is an incredibly talented, calm, and collected producer who understood the vision from the beginning. Since we live in different parts of the world, I would record song ideas on my phone, send them to him, and hed create the beats.\n\nI recorded the vocals in London with Ghanaian producer Kobby from Kingsbeat before sending them back to Trust for final production. We were on the phone every day for four months!\n\nOther contributions came from Pastor Sony Ncube in Birmingham, where Mhlanga travelled for recording sessions. His wife, Rue, provided backup vocals on four songs.\n\nDJ Ntu2Kay from Bulawayo also contributed beats to Bhubesi and Igidelamphakathi. Im grateful for his work, she said.A standout collaboration on the album is Ingqobe, featuring legendary poets Albert Nyathi and Obert Dube.\n\nAlbert Nyathi is someone I deeply respect. I was the lead vocalist of Albert Nyathi & Imbongi for five years and learnt so much from him. It was a marvel to work with these poetic gems, she said.\n\nMhlanga, the leader of the Shosholoza band, has performed at major festivals such as WOMAD in England and has been featured on BBC shows. She also performed in honour of the late South African leader Nelson Mandela in London at one point.  @mthabisi_mthire\n\n",
