Thousands of jubilant kids from around the country attended the event. Indeed, this was a large party (and kids like them so much!), where food, drink, music and fun flowed; but it has a more profound meaning  it symbolises the continuity of Independence through the young.\n\nThe climax was yesterday when tens of thousands of citizens from all over the country gathered at the Mutora Open Ground to witness the main Independence Day celebration, again led by the President.\n\nA big downpour on Mutora blessed the event ahead of the beginning of proceedings, holding back later to allow the celebration to be staged.\n\nIndependence Day is a thoroughly important moment for us. That is the day when Zimbabwe was born 45 years ago after nine decades of struggle against British colonial misrule.\n\nThe first war of liberation in 1896 ended in defeat for the owners of the land. Spear, bow and arrow and the burning spirit to liberate the land were inadequate against the oppressors gun, dynamite and malevolent spirit.\n\nAlthough the masses fell, that uprising was a massive statement of what was to follow.\n\nSeventy more years of oppression ensued. Blacks were kicked out of their ancestral lands and left to wander and settle elsewhere.Whites soon zoned the fertile lands as theirs. They, too, grabbed gold workings and made much money out of them.They enacted multiple unjust laws to cement the misrule.\n\nThe injustice angered blacks more. Better trained and armed and with the spirit to liberate themselves now greater, the second war of liberation erupted in 1966 and ended in a crushing victory for the masses.\n\nThat is the long, difficult, sweaty and bloody road that the brave people of Zimbabwe walked to attain Independence on April 18, 1980, the 45th anniversary of which we marked yesterday.\n\nThe mood was celebratory all over the country yesterday as we reflected on the forgettable 90 years of colonialism, the peoples brave fight against it and the 45 years of post-Independence national development.\n\nWe are now governing ourselves in peace and unity. There is a growing consciousness among our people on the centrality of our nationhood, which is the basis for any people to thrive socially, politically and economically.\n\nZimbabweans own their land and are doing wonders on it. They are driving their economy, thanks to the indigenisation and economic empowerment policy championed by the Government most earnestly since 2000.\n\nInvestment in schools, colleges and universities since 1980 have made our people some of the most educated in Africa.There is massive investment in the health services sector as well, ensuring greater public access to health care.\n\nYesterday was certainly yet another moment for us as a nation to look back, celebrate the progress we have made over the past 45 years and look ahead with hope and commitment to overcome any challenges that come our way so we continue to progress.\n\nSynonyms for Presidentchairmanchairchairpersondirectorchief executiveCEOpresidingprincipalchairedmasterheadpresided\n\n",

He underscored that workers welfare remains a top priority, while also paying tribute to the security forces for the peace and stability prevailing across the country.\n\nAs the Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, the President urged the nation to embrace innovation, technology and skills development as the foundation of future success, with Vision 2030 now within reach.\n\nBefore addressing thousands gathered at Mutora Open Grounds in Gokwe for the main Independence Day celebrations, the President, accompanied by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa, inspected the Independence Parade mounted by the ZDF. Vice-President Dr Constantino Chiwenga and his wife, Cabinet Ministers, and Service Chiefs were among the dignitaries present.\n\nVice-President Dr Constantino Chiwenga and his wife\n\nIn his keynote address, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwes journey since independence has been one of inspiration, marked by significant progress across all sectors.\n\nAfter 45 years of independence, the Zanu-PF Government remains committed to building a future that honours the sacrifices of the past, while securing prosperity for generations to come. To ensure Zimbabwean products remain competitive both locally and globally, technical and vocational education, particularly in Science, Technology, and Innovation, is critical, he said.\n\nThe President said food security would always be prioritised, with the Agriculture Transformation Strategy deepening rural reforms to enhance grain production and efficiency.\n\nLand, which is our inalienable heritage, is being productively utilised, and we anticipate a bumper harvest from the 2024/25 summer cropping season. This will allow us to replenish the Strategic Grain Reserve, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa noted that while last seasons El Nio-induced drought affected many districts, the nation managed to feed itself.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa accompanied by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa\n\nThe Food Deficit Mitigation Programme, which included cash transfers to urban households, significantly reduced vulnerability, he said.\n\nWhile saluting the security forces, President Mnangagwa called on all citizens to protect the nation from both internal and external elements that threaten national development.\n\nHand-in-hand, with focus and discipline, let us defend and work harder for our motherland, Zimbabwe. We salute our security services for their loyalty and patriotism, and for steadfastly defending our sovereignty and hard-won independence, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the Second Republic is entrenching the rule of law and protecting law-abiding citizens while decisively dealing with rogue elements.\n\nHe also wished the nation a happy Easter holiday.\n\nDivisive and alarmist elements will never triumph over a nation such as ours, born from a rich liberation history and the blood of brave sons and daughters. Law enforcement agencies will always act in accordance with the law and the best interests of our sovereign motherland, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa delivers his remarks at the 45th Independence celebrations at Nembudziya Stadium in Gokwe yesterday.  Picture: Believe Nyakudjara\n\nZimbabwe being a unitary State, the President called for unity and development, encouraging every citizen to contribute positively.\n\nAs communities, let us uphold values of love, unity, compassion, empathy, discipline and hard, honest work  qualities for which Zimbabweans are known. These values must be passed on to all, young and old.\n\nRegardless of political affiliation, religion, race, gender or age, let us all put Zimbabwe first. It is the only country we call home, and so shall future generations, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said that just like culture and tradition, values such as love, trust and mutual support must be handed down through generations. He further highlighted how Zimbabweans, under the Second Republic, are defying odds and achieving remarkable development successes from household to provincial level.\n\nThe policies of the Second Republic are bearing fruit. The mining sector is leading in value-addition, with a projected 5,6 percent growth this year, spurred by new mines and favourable commodity prices, noted President Mnangagwa.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa inspects a parade at the Independence celebrations in Nembudziya, Gokwe\n\nThe accelerated implementation of the National Development Strategy has had a positive effect on the manufacturing sector. The pharmaceutical sector, for example, has seen capacity utilisation rise to 50 percent from 43 percent.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said Governments efforts to achieve energy security are yielding results, with rural electrification of schools, clinics, and administrative centres improving service delivery.\n\nOn veterans of the liberation struggle, he said the Government continues to honour their contributions by creating inclusive opportunities for socio-economic participation.\n\nMany programmes are underway, including Presidential Borehole Drilling, Rural Solarisation, Housing Schemes, and Youth Empowerment Initiatives. Communities must be actively involved in these programmes championed by the ruling Zanu-PF. All Zimbabweans regardless of gender, tribe, age or political affiliation must benefit. Zanu-PF is a peoples party, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe also highlighted the ongoing rehabilitation and upgrading of infrastructure, particularly in disaster-prone areas like Gokwe. Issuing a stern warning against the misuse of social media, the President urged Zimbabweans to remain vigilant and united.\n\nI commend you, my fellow compatriots at home and abroad, for remaining patriotic and steadfast, never allowing yourselves to be misled by shadowy elements with dubious agendas, he said.\n\n",
