            "content": "Online Reporter\n\nTHE Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) has made significant contribution to development of power infrastructure which has increased trade and regional integration among Sadc member states.\n\nThe SAPP was created in August 1995 at the SADC summit held in Kempton Park, South Africa, when member states signed an Inter-Governmental Memorandum of Understanding for the formation of an electricity power pool in the region.\n\nA revised Inter-Governmental MoU was signed by Ministers responsible for Energy in the SADC Region on 23 February 2006 to allow private sector players to become members of SAPP, and now has 22 members across 12 Sadc states.\n\nOfficiating at the 64th SAPP Management Committee Meeting in Victoria Falls recently, Energy and Power Development Minister July Moyo said in the last 10 years, a total of 14 546 GWh were traded on the SAPP competitive markets resulting in the exchange of US$986 million among members.\n\nHe said trading on the competitive electricity market is continuing and SAPP has five products namely the Day Ahead Market, Intra Day Market, Week Ahead Market, Month Ahead Market, and Balancing Market which was launched in April 2022.\n\nFrom the time that the SAPP was created, several transmission projects have been successfully completed including key transmission projects such as the 400kV Matimba-Phokoje-Insukamini interconnector. This line was commissioned in 1995 and is one of the flagships projects in the region as it opened for trading of electricity from as far to the North as the DRC and as far South as Lesotho and Namibia through Zimbabwe- Botswana and South Africa.\n\nNumerous electricity trading transactions continue to be traded along this cross-border transmission line which gave birth to the operationalisation of the Southern African Power Pool in 1995. The SADC Regions economies are continuing to grow in fulfilment of the SADC industrialisation thrust and hence the region needs more power, said Minister Moyo.\n\nHe said currently nine out of the 12 mainland Sadc countries are inter-connected while work is underway to connect the remaining three namely Angola, Malawi and Tanzania.\n\nMinister Moyo said the interconnection of Malawi to Mozambique is under construction and the project is expected to be commissioned in September this year while construction of the Zambian portion of the Zambia  Tanzania interconnection will start this year.\n\nThe completion of these projects will result in the 12 mainland states of Sadc being electrically inter-connected marking a significant milestone allowing the region to fully benefit from regional integration in the power sector.\n\nThese market products are providing opportunities for power utilities to trade among themselves over and above the bilateral contracts that exists. It is quite remarkable to note that, the SAPP competitive market is being used by various utilities to meet their short and medium-term power requirements and providing opportunity for those with excess power to generate additional revenue, said the Minister.\n\nZimbabwe is a leader and top developer in power generation in the region, with the country implementing various power project including renewable energy nationwide to increase capacity from about 2 1000MW to about 6 000MW.\n\nZesa Holdings hosted the meeting whose purpose was to look at various issues from planning, project preparation, operations, markets and environmental areas.\n\nMinister Moyo said apart from the transmission inter-connectors, the SAPP has achieved other milestones including establishment of a Co-ordination Centre in Harare in 2000 as an International Development Organisation and nerve centre of SAPP.\n\nOthers include the Markets Sub-Committee (MSC) and Day Ahead Competitive Electricity Market (DAM) implemented in 2009 as a step towards migrating from a cooperative power pool to a competitive power pool.\n\nThere is also the custom-made market trading platform, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition/Energy Management System (SCADA/EMS) Project, setting up of a SAPP Project Advisory Unit, and purchase and setting up of the SAPP offices in Harare.\n\nMinister Moyo said the region has huge energy resource potential in the form of coal, gas, nuclear, hydro and renewable energy that need to be exploited in an economically sound and sustainable manner for the benefit of the whole region.\n\nHe bemoaned the impact of climate change that has over the years affected hydro power generation at Kariba dam due to reduced water allocation, hence affecting availability of electricity in the whole region.\n\nI need to register my appreciation for how the Southern African Power Pool is assisting in meeting some of the power shortfalls of the Sadc countries through the regional electricity power market clearly illustrating the benefits of regional integration.\n\nElectricity is one of the critical driving forces for economic development and you are at the centre of making it work. As we go into the future, the huge and diverse power generation resources in our region need to be tapped. I hope that as experts in the power sector you will come up with solutions that will look at risk mitigation for such scenarios. I therefore call upon you as experts in the field to continue to apply your minds and bring to the table solutions that will keep the lights on, commerce ticking, industry running and agriculture flourishing even in these challenging environments, he said.\n\nThe Minister bemoaned prevalence of vandalism of transmission infrastructure and said Ministers responsible for Energy were prioritising strategies to combat the scourge.\n\nHe said the industry faces insufficient generation capacity to meet the growing power demand where the current generation capacity shortfall is close to 4 000 MW, lack of adequate transmission and distribution infrastructure, high transmission and power distribution losses, limited regional trade of power due to transmission constraints, and the the effects of climate change on generation production.\n\nMinister Moyo said the region can save up to US$37 billion in net present value terms if coordinated planning is followed.\n\nHe said SAPP is also working on the Regional Transmission Infrastructure Financing Facility to unlock transmission constraints through promoting the blended financing and development of new transmission infrastructure.\n\nHe called for more private sector participation riding on changing regulatory environment, and commended some independent power producers for development of renewable energy projects.\n\nHe urged member states to invest more in electricity supply infrastructure for additional power generation.\n\nThis SAPP committee meeting came soon after the 10th Africa Partnership Summit held in Washington, US where the critical role of energy in driving economic growth was underscored while the US government expressed commitment to partnering with Africa to eliminate energy poverty.\n\n",

            "content": "Online Reporter\n\nTHE Association of Healthcare Funders of Zimbabwe (AHFoZ) has expressed reservations about the proposed Insurance and Pensions Commission (IPEC) Amendment Bill of 2024 which it says will disadvantage healthcare seekers.\n\nIPEC publicised on its social media platforms that the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Budget, Finance and Investment Promotion will conduct public hearings on the Insurance and Pensions Commission Amendment Bill in major parts of the country starting this Monday 24 March.\n\nThe first meeting will be in Gweru on Monday followed by the Bulawayo meeting the next day on 25 March while Harare and Bindura will be the last on 28 March after Masvingo and Mutare during the week.\n\nIn a statement, AHFoZ said it had noted with concern that there will be countrywide Public Hearings on the Amendment Bill which it says seeks to classify Medical Aid Societies under financial services for regulation under IPEC as is the case with other insurances.\n\nThe Public Hearings will be hosted by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Budget, Finance, and investment Promotion from 24-28 March 2025 countrywide.\n\nAHFoZ said it was concerned that the change will bring significant disruption which may be detrimental to the sustainability of the medical aid system.\n\nMedical Aid Societies are in the business of health and they focus on a holistic approach to peoples well-being by prioritising prevention, wellness, treatment and rehabilitation and they are run by their members.\n\nTypically, medical aid societies rely on member contributions whereas insurance companies have shareholders who provide capital and manage the affairs of the insurance fund. Insurance corporations are established with the primary objective of generating profits while Medical Aid Societies are predominantly non-profit entities and they are tax exempt.\n\nThe principal purpose of these societies is to facilitate the funding of private healthcare services for their members through pooling funds, as opposed to generating profit. These societies are owned by their members, and any surplus funds are typically reinvested into the society to enhance services and benefits for the members, said AHFoZ Chief Executive, Ms Shylet Sanyanga.\n\nShe said the essence of Medical Aid Societies lies in their voluntary nature.\n\nShe said over-regulation by classifying them as financial entities threatens their continuity, as restrictive regulations may lead members to opt out and collapse of the sector.\n\nMs Sanyanga said the proposed Bill introduces regulatory oversight that may not align with the unique operational framework of Medical Aid Societies and the entire ecosystem, which includes Healthcare Service Providers.\n\nSubjecting these societies to the same regulatory framework as insurance entities whilst Healthcare Service Providers are under Ministry of Health and Child Care could create a mismatch and discord which could compromise health outcomes.\n\nA unified regulatory authority is essential for the healthcare sector, not only for monitoring health outcomes, but also for effective dispute resolution and ensuring the interests of the Health Citizen are prioritised, she said.\n\nMs Sanyanga said among other things, the Bill mandates Medical Aid Societies to maintain an asset register and notify IPEC prior to selling any assets, imposing an unnecessary administrative burden. The punitive fines for non-compliance, potentially equating to the asset value, are excessively high and could stifle the operational efficiency of these societies and increase costs of medical aid, she added.\n\nRegulation under Financial services puts emphasis on Profit and Financial compliance. This poses a risk of insufficient coverage for healthcare needs, stringent Global limits and expensive Medical Aid contributions as the priorities will be forced to shift from People to Profits, bemoaned Ms Sanyanga.\n\nShe said when comparing medical aid and insurance, there is a need to note that with funeral cover, there is one incident as a person dies once, with motor vehicle insurance, there are few incidents as people hardly get involved in road traffic accidents while with medical aid, there are numerous incidents as people fall sick numerous times and in some cases the treatment requires extensive investigations, surgery, rehabilitation and follow-ups, among other things.\n\nMedical aid treatment might be obtained locally or outside the country.\n\nMs Sanyanga said Medical Aid Societies have over the years complimented the Government in facilitating access to healthcare services, with 80 percent of Healthcare Service Providers income coming from Medical Aid societies.\n\nThe collapse of this sector would impact on the entire healthcare sector, she said.\n\nMs Sanyanga said AHFoZ has not yet been consulted on the issue.\n\nAHFoZ represents medical aid societies across the nation with the mission to promote sustainable healthcare funding solutions and advocate for policies that enhance the quality and accessibility of healthcare in Zimbabwe\n\n",
