            "content": "Ronald Mpofu, Online Reporter\n\nAN investigation is ongoing for eight suspects who stole eleven 50kgs of gold-loaded carbon at a mine in Bindura.\n\nThe unidentified suspects were armed with a rifle when they attacked a security guard on duty before breaking into the carbon room.\n\nThe police said in a statement on X that on December 22, 2024, a case of a robbery occurred at a mine in Bindura where eight suspects stole gold-loaded carbon valued at US $36 000 after assaulting the security guard who was on duty.\n\nAnyone with information to report at any nearest Police Station, said the Police in a statement.\n\nWhat is gold-loaded carbon?\n\nIt is just carbon (like charcoal) that has gold stuck to it. Gold in Ore: When gold is found in the ground, its mixed with other materials, so you cant just pick up gold chunks. Its in a form thats hard to get to.\n\nUsing Carbon to Catch Gold: To separate the gold from the rest of the materials, one common method is to use a special kind of carbon. This carbon is very porous (kind of like a sponge), which allows it to catch or trap tiny particles of gold from a solution where the gold is dissolved.\n\nGold-Loaded Carbon: Once the carbon has trapped the gold particles, its called gold-loaded carbon. Its like a sponge holding gold.\n\nGold Recovery: To get the gold back from the carbon, the gold-loaded carbon is treated in a way that lets the gold come off, and then it can be refined and turned into pure gold.\n\nIn short, gold-loaded carbon is carbon thats been used to collect gold from a solution, often during a mining process.\n\nWhy is gold-loaded carbon valuable?\n\nEfficient Gold Extraction: In the mining industry, gold is often found in low concentrations in ore (rock) and must be separated from other materials.\n\nThe carbon used in gold-loaded carbon is highly effective at capturing tiny particles of gold from a liquid solution, making it a crucial part of processes like Carbon-in-Leach (CIL) or Carbon-in-Pulp (CIP).\n\nThis allows miners to extract gold efficiently, even from ores that contain only small amounts of gold.\n\nCost-Effective: The process of using carbon to capture gold (through adsorption) is relatively inexpensive compared to other methods of gold extraction.\n\nOnce the gold is bound to the carbon, it can be easily removed and refined, which saves money for the mining operation.\n\nRecovery of Precious Gold: Gold is a rare and precious metal with high value, so anything that helps recover gold from ore more effectively or efficiently has intrinsic value.\n\nThe carbon itself may not be valuable until it holds the gold, and once its loaded with gold, it can be treated to recover the metal.\n\nReusability: After the gold is recovered from the carbon, the carbon can often be reused in the process, which makes it an economical material for gold extraction.\n\nGold-loaded carbon is valuable because it is an effective tool for extracting gold from ore in a cost-efficient way, helping to recover precious gold that would otherwise be difficult to access.\n\n",

The agreement ended the post-independence conflict of the early 1980s, ushering in an era of peace that endures today.\n\nWhile the Unity Accord is credited with addressing political challenges, some social issues stemming from the conflict remained unresolved. President Mnangagwas Second Republic has taken further steps to address these challenges, including mandating traditional leaders to spearhead the Gukurahundi Community hearings as the Second Republic takes a bold step towards finding a lasting solutions to the Gukurahundi disturbances. Government is presently procuring resources to facilitate these hearings, which aim to address the lingering social effects of the conflict.\n\nIn October 2022, President Mnangagwa launched a manual on the Gukurahundi community engagement processes by chiefs including a report on their consultative meetings. The manual, which is a product of inclusive engagements between chiefs and various stakeholders, is a culmination of traditional leaders meetings with President Mnangagwa, which started in March 2019. The document will guide chiefs on how to conduct the consultative and engagement process.\n\nIn his Unity Day speech on Saturday, President Mnangagwa acknowledged that the post-independence unrest disrupted Zimbabwes development trajectory. However, he emphasised that the signing of the Unity Accord paved the way for sustainable peace and national development.\n\nThe late President Mugabe and the late Vice-President Nkomo hold hands after signing the Unity Accord on 22 December, 1987\n\nThe accord ushered in unity, peace and stability in our great motherland, Zimbabwe, and laid a firm foundation for national cohesion and development that subsists to this day. Those early years of post-independence unrest unnecessarily delayed our socio-economic growth and cast a dark cloud of disharmony among our people, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe said Unity Day serves as a reminder of the collective duty to uphold peace, unity and love as the guarantors of sustainable development.This day, therefore, will forever be etched on our national calendar as a sombre reminder of our individual and collective duty to defend, promote and consolidate the grand national heritage of peace, unity and love. This is the guarantor for sustainable multi-pronged development, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nSince the 1987 Unity Accord, our nation has stood firm and united even in difficult times.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the Second Republic is leveraging the prevailing peace to promote inclusive development, ensuring that no one and no place is left behind.\n\nPresently, our nation is moving forward with fervent hope and determination to build a more prosperous future for all Zimbabweans, leaving no one and no place behind. We remain inspired to continue demonstrating unparalleled national strength, resilience and unflinching patriotism to our country, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa commended Zimbabweans for their resilience in the face of external attempts to sow division, noting that self-belief and confidence remain key to the countrys progress.\n\nHe reiterated his administrations commitment to transforming Zimbabwe into an upper middle-income economy by 2030.\n\nThis national consciousness is now imprinted in our individual and collective mindset, embodied by our national development philosophy: Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatirwa nevene vayo/ Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa added that the policies and programmes of the Second Republic are driving increased production and productivity, propelling the country toward Vision 2030.\n\nBrick by brick, stone upon stone and step by step, we are unapologetically marching forward. As the people of Zimbabwe, we are entrenching our identity as an independent, sovereign, free, united and truly liberated African people, he declared.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa highlighted the implementation of the devolution policy as a key driver of inclusive development. The policy has facilitated the funding of development projects across all districts, including the construction of clinics, schools, roads and the installation of piped water systems in rural areas. Additionally, the Government has increased social protection for vulnerable communities, further demonstrating its commitment to inclusive growth. @nqotshili\n\n",

The hustle and bustle at Bulawayos bus termini reflected the excitement and determination of travellers eager to spend the holidays with loved ones in their rural homes.\n\nWhen a Chronicle news crew visited long-distance bus termini in Makokoba, Entumbane and Nkulumane suburbs, the scenes were vibrant as passengers sought transport to destinations such as Binga, Nkayi, Tsholotsho, Plumtree, Filabusi and Gwanda.\n\nMost passengers expressed excitement about reuniting with their families for Christmas and New Year celebrations.\n\nUnlike in previous years when bus operators took advantage of the high demand for transport to hike fares, this year fares have not been increased.\n\nWe could make more money by increasing fares during this busy period but we must not forget that these are the same people who support our businesses throughout the year, said Mr Michael Khabo, a CAG bus driver on the Bulawayo-Nkayi route.\n\nMr Khabo said his companys management had instructed crews not to increase the fares despite the high demand for transport.\n\nOur customers have been loyal to us and its unfair to take advantage of the high demand for transport during the Christmas season to increase the fares, he said.A trip from Bulawayo to Nkayi costs US$10, with additional charges for luggage. At Renkini Bus Terminus, Mr Emmanuel Phiri, who was transporting a newly purchased scotch cart to his rural home in Gwelutshena, Nkayi, shared his excitement.\n\nThey charged me US$60 for the scotch cart. Ive been saving for months to buy it, and Im happy to finally take it home, he said. Vendors at Old Renkini Bus Terminus also enjoyed brisk business, capitalising on the surge in travellers.\n\nAt Entumbane Complex Bus Terminus, buses to Lupane, Binga, and Tsholotsho were packed with passengers, many of whom had bought groceries for their families back home.\n\nMiss Lisa Bukhosi, travelling to Lupanes Sivalo Village, said: I bought sugar, cooking oil, mayonnaise, flour and rice so that my family can enjoy on Christmas. Ill get bread from the local shops at Sivalo. Christmas and New Year are about family, and I cant wait to see my grandparents.\n\nHowever, some travellers, especially those heading to Binga, faced challenges due to high demand and limited transport availability. Mrs Elina Zombe, travelling with her three children, had been waiting for a bus since early morning.\n\nThe bus we usually use broke down on its way from Binga last night. Theyve promised it will arrive by noon but if not, well take any bus that can drop us at Binga Centre and then we look for transport to our area, she said.\n\nA Galaxy Bus Company driver, who identified himself as Kudzi, said business had picked up significantly since Friday.\n\nThis time of the year is always busy. We have another bus on standby for passengers travelling on the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls route, he said.\n\nAt Nkulumane Complex Bus Terminus, a similar rush was observed, with passengers heading to places such as Matopo, Plumtree, Filabusi and Gwanda.\n\nMr Isaac Mlalazi, travelling to Plumtree, said he preferred buses for their convenience, especially when carrying heavy luggage. It costs me US$3 or R50 to get to Plumtree. Its affordable and convenient, he said.\n\n",
