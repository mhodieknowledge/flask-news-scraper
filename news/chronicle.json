Upon reaching the bridge, the vehicle ran out of fuel at around 1:30pm and he left it in the middle of the bridge as he rushed to get fuel from Victoria Falls town.He returned about 30 minutes later and there was a traffic jam on either side of the bridge as vehicles comprising taxis and haulage trucks were blocked.Drivers and vendors who operate around the two borders attempted to lift the vehicle and put it against the bridge rails but failed.The bridge has a single lane and only a single vehicle at a time is allowed in one direction.\n\nSome agitated men prepare to lift the Honda Fit off the drive lane on the bridge\n\nThe driver had gone with the keys but even though he had left the windows open, pushing the vehicle was not an option as the hybrid model of Honda Fit cannot move as long as its mechanical system is off.They tried to lift the vehicle and move it closer to the rails but failed.An attempt to tow it away also failed as the small two-tonne truck could not move it.\n\nRefueling the vehicles on the no mans land on the Victoria Falls Bridge\n\nThe driver then arrived with some fuel in a container.He was met with the anger of the crowd including the Emerged Railways Property manager Mr Logan Nyasulu who said the vehicle owner was going to be charged for blocking the bridge.How can you do this? Why would you leave your vehicle blocking the bridge? This car will not be cleared at the border before you pay for this, he said.In response, the man said: We tried to push it with the curio vendors but you know these hybrid vehicles have high security. The challenge is that the person who had gone to pick it up from Tanzania did not top up fuel and when I got it I think it had nothing. I have gone to Tanzania more than five times myself and this is what these people do, the moment they give you the car you cant even drive to the next fuel station before the fuel is finished, he said before being allowed to drive off towards the Zimbabwean side of the bridge to the border.\n\n",

            "content": "Online WriterHARARE, 12 December 2024  Stanbic Bank Zimbabwe Chief Executive Mr Solomon Nyanhongo has been named the overall Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Year and the Banking Sector CEO of the Year at the prestigious annual CEO Round Table Awards.The awards, determined by a five-member adjudication committee comprising experts in banking, law, accounting, media, and investment, assessed nominees across eight categories: business performance, corporate strategy, digital transformation, customer experience, risk management, product innovation, ethical leadership, and product mix.Chaired by lawyer and educationist Mr Canaan Dube, the committee recognised Mr Nyanhongo for steering Stanbic Bank to exceptional business performance, as evidenced by significant revenue growth and strategic foresight. Under his leadership, the bank prioritised three strategic goals: transforming client experience, executing with excellence, and driving sustainable growth and value.Mr Nyanhongos digital transformation efforts were a standout, with 48% of Stanbic Banks clients now fully digitized. This year alone, 94% of the banks 14.1 million transactions were conducted through digital channels, showcasing customer trust and the institutions commitment to efficiency and accessibility.Stanbic Bank has won the Best Customer Experience Award in the Banking Category from the Customer Experience Association of Zimbabwe for the past two years. Customer satisfaction across its segments averaged 8.5 out of 10, indicating high levels of client approval.The bank excelled in risk management, maintaining an impressively low 0.7 percent non-performing loan (NPL) ratio, which demonstrates robust financial health. Revenue diversification also played a significant role, with 36 percent of its total revenue as of October 2024 coming from transactional revenues.Innovation has been another hallmark of Mr Nyanhongos leadership. This year, Stanbic Bank launched several customer-focused products, including: A Loyalty Programme for Private Banking clients, featuring perks such as free travel insurance and airport lounge access. The low-cost Blue Ease account, designed for financial inclusion, with 743 accounts opened to date. Green Energy Financing for clients in renewable energy, as part of the banks sustainability drive.The adjudication committee, adhering to strict conflict-of-interest guidelines, used a predefined set of criteria to ensure a fair evaluation. Mr Nyanhongos recognition was based not only on sectoral leadership but also on Stanbic Banks impact at the national level.The awards process was thorough, and we are proud of the outcomes. Each nominee demonstrated excellence, but Nyanhongos achievements stood out, said Mr Dube.The awards spanned multiple sectors, including agribusiness, education, health, ICT, manufacturing, real estate, and tourism, making Nyanhongos selection as overall CEO of the Year particularly noteworthy.Despite Zimbabwes economic challenges, Stanbic Bank posted a historical cost profit of ZWG27.1 million for the six months ending June 30, 2024. Adjusted for technical losses related to investment property portfolio valuations, the banks headline earnings stood at ZWG346 million, reflecting its sustainable financial performance.Mr Nyanhongo noted that the banks financial adjustments followed the shift in its functional currency from the Zimbabwe Dollar (ZWL) on January 1, 2024. This change led to accounting recalibrations reflecting differences in property asset valuations.Stanbic Bank ended the first half of the year with a net interest income of ZWG374 million, largely driven by new foreign currency lending assets amid high demand for forex facilities.These accolades highlight Mr Nyanhongos visionary leadership and the transformative impact of Stanbic Bank on Zimbabwes financial landscape. His focus on innovation, sustainability, and customer experience sets a benchmark for the banking sector.EndsCAPTION: Stanbic Bank Chief Executive Solomon Nyanhongo (second from right) with (from left): CEO Africa Roundtable Board Chairman Oswell Binha, US Ambassador to Zimbabwe H.E.

He was born and grew up in a football family as his father Dingilizwe Dingani was a team medic for Hwange Football Club from 1993-2019.A staunch Liverpool fan, Dingani said he owed his success to not only his father but former Hwange players that he admired on and off the field.So basically I am a soccer fanatic whose love for the game was inculcated in me by my father. I used to escort him to camp as I wanted to watch the likes of Walter Chuma the 1997 Soccer STAR of the Year, Chenjerai Dube, Brian Njobvu, Method Mwanjale and Nation Dube, who were my heroes back then.I had aspirations of playing soccer at a professional level after having represented my secondary school Marist Brothers Dete but my father would have none of that as he had concerns with my physical fitness. My former schoolmate at Marist Brothers, Winston Mhango was one of the key advisers and influencers into taking this course as I always desired to represent him because of his amazing soccer exploits at school, said Dingani.He said his ambition is to contribute to the game hence a keen interest in becoming a Fifa licenced agent.Dingani said he will work hard to identify talent and open opportunities for soccer players in Zimbabwe.An advert was flighted on Zifas Facebook page and a friend alerted me as he knew I was keen to take up the challenge. I registered on the FIFA platform and went through their study materials until we wrote the exams on 20 November 2024.I sought guidance and advice from people in the field such as George Deda who continues to selflessly guide me, Adonis Sithole the first to pass exams at their inception last year and I highly regard him as my tutor, Gilbert Sengwe and Lindela Tshuma who is the only other agent from this region, said Dingani.He said he is from a soccer family as his maternal uncles Stanley Nkomo and Lovemore Mwetwa played for Hwange FC and Railstars FC respectively.He said football agency seeks to bring professional guidance in negotiating soccer players contracts and ensuring that players are educated about their contracts and also assist them exploit the future.Dingani was born and raised in Hwange and with his elder sister Rebecca, they grew up supporting Liverpool FC.He said he has turned down numerous pleas to join local soccer team executives as his goal was to become an agent.He wrote the final examination a day before his graduation with a Master of Arts in Strategic Communications at Midlands State University last month.@ncubeleon\n\n",
