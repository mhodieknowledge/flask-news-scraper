I also recommend those in the catering sector to embrace our local dishes, she said\n\nChef Sharon Ngoma from Enterprise Hotel won in the professional chef category. She said, I wasnt expecting to be a winner. The process was tough because we started cooking at 2AM, but it was worth it.\n\nI give thanks to Amai, this cookout competition is a game changer for the industry.\n\nFor the tertiary student category, the winner and first runner-up were students from Bulawayo Polytechnic School of Tourism and Hospitality.\n\n",

We have every season to believe that most of the guns being used by robbers were either stolen or smuggled into the country from neighbouring countries such as South Africa.\n\nThe criminals committing the robberies live in communities and it is therefore incumbent upon each and every citizen to report these criminals to the police. Residents should assist the police to flush out these undesirable elements that are terrorising them by providing information.\n\nIn a bid to fight crime, police in Bulawayo in October last year launched closed-circuit television (CCTV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in the city to enhance their policing activities.\n\nThe system leverages artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies to reduce reliance on physical police presence. Under the system which at the moment just covers the Central Business District (CBD), cameras which have sophisticated features such as facial recognition, night vision and vehicle plate recording devices are strategically positioned to record data.\n\nThis is in line with modern policing that provides real-time monitoring and analysis of activities in a given area. Due to limited resources, it is not feasible to have the entire city monitored by CCTVs hence the need for residents to continue complementing police efforts to fight crime by providing information. We have already alluded to the fact that the armed robbers that are terrorising residents live in communities and these communities should reject them.\n\nCommunities, we want to emphasise, should not be safe havens for criminals. At this juncture, we want to once again implore the police to undertake another clean up exercise to get rid of guns in wrong hands.\n\n",

As the population continues to grow, the demand for essential services like education, healthcare, and shopping facilities is becoming increasingly urgent.\n\nWard 15 Councillor, Ashton Mhlanga, whose area covers Cowdray Parks Phase I and 2, as well portions of Phase 3 called upon Government to expedite the construction of a new magistrates court to decentralise judicial services.\n\nCowdray Park is facing a sharp increase in crime and desperately needs a big police station, similar to what residents of suburbs such as Nkulumane and Pumula have, and a magistrates court so that our residents can easily access essential services.\n\nThe suburb keeps growing leading some people to call it a city within a city and we are calling for Government to decentralise essential services such as the judiciary and the registrars offices, said Clr Mhlanga.\n\nOn the education front, he said his ward only has two primary schools, an untenable situation that forces pupils to attend classes in the afternoon under trees because of shortages of classrooms.\n\nWe cannot continue having a situation where our children attend classes in the afternoon under the hot-sitting arrangement where grades are divided into morning and afternoon classes.\n\nTo address the shortage of schools in my ward, we need about four new primary schools to cater for the ever growing population, he added.\n\nClr Mhlanga also bemoaned poor roads and lack of sewer reticulation system in some sections of the suburb where residents are still using Blair toilets and access into the suburb is difficult as a result of poor roads.\n\nThe Member of Parliament for the area Cde Arthur Mujeyi, concurred that the rapid growth of the suburb has resulted in a severe shortage of schools, clinics and other essential amenities.\n\nWhile the suburbs population continues to expand rapidly, infrastructure development has failed to keep pace with the growing demand.\n\nGovernment is aware of the challenges of social amenities faced by Cowdray Park residents hence the construction of Cowdray Park Clinic which has seen residents accessing services at their doorsteps, said Cde Mujeyi.\n\nHe said individuals had identified investment opportunities in the education sector and were building primary and secondary schools in the suburb to complement Government and Bulawayo City Council (BCC)s efforts to build schools.\n\nThe growth of Cowdray Park is presenting business opportunities in the health and education sectors with the establishment of private schools and privately run clinics and pharmacies, said Cde Mujeyi.\n\nHe said there were two clinics built by Government and council but there is still a lot that Government must do to provide essential services to the people.\n\nThe shortage of schools in the suburb is forcing many parents to send their children to schools in Luveve, Emakhandeni or town.\n\nIn the Hlalani Kuhle/Garikai area, a makeshift secondary school  Onxy Academy  was established last year to fill the gap. The school has 100 students.\n\nA resident, Mr Orlando Mlilo, expressed concern over the shortage of schools in the suburb.\n\nCowdray Park is growing at an alarming rate but the construction of schools is not keeping pace.\n\nTwo years ago, I tried to enrol my son at Luveve High but they told me that the school only accepts children from their suburb, he said.\n\nAccording to 2023 statistics from the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, Zimbabwe has 10 517 schools. Ideally, the ratio of schools to population in the country should be about one school for every 1 500 people, based on a 95 percent gross enrolment rate in primary education and a national population of 16 million.\n\n",

Of course, encourage creativity and participation from designers and football enthusiasts, as well as showcase our national pride through unique and inspiring designs, said Magwizi.\n\nAccording to Zifa, the competition is open to graphic designers and artists, football fans, Zimbabwean youth, social media creatives, advertising agencies and all talented Zimbabweans.\n\nParticipants will be asked to submit a brand name and a logo/icon design with a description of the inspiration behind it; three jersey designs  a home kit (yellow), an away kit (green), and an alternative kit (white), incorporating the colours of the Zimbabwean flag, and additional branded merchandise like caps, souvenirs and t-shirts.\n\nDeadline for the submissions is May 15.\n\nThe adjudication panel is led by renowned academic and branding expert Christopher Sachikonye.\n\nIt also includes communications industry entrepreneur Sapi Bachi, Faithwear founder Brett van Rooyen, Ebenezer Ayisa, Danayi Madondo, Carl Joshua Ncube and Footballers Union of Zimbabwe president Desmond Maringwa.\n\nMagwizi said the campaign was more than just a competition as it seeks to rally the cross-section of Zimbabweans behind the national teams.\n\nThis is more than a competition . . . It is a celebration of our national pride, our creativity and our passion for football.\n\nWith the hashtags #WarriorPride and #ZimKitChallenge, let us turn this into a national movement that unites Zimbabweans through design and football. This is our opportunity to leave a lasting legacy for Zimbabwe and football.\n\nOf course, I will expect people to submit their designs before the 15th of May and be part of this history. I hope we are all up for the challenge. The countdown starts now, said Magwizi.\n\nHe said the winning brand and kit designs could be on display when Zimbabwe play at the upcoming Afcon 2025 in Morocco this December.\n\nThe first aspect we are looking at is a brand that will be owned by Zifa. This brand will then be applied to the kits. The first assignment or the primary application that were looking to proliferate this brand is on the 2025 Afcon kits.\n\nSo, were going to have a brand which were going to own for a long time as an association and this brand will be applied to various merchandise. But our first product will be the kits, said Magwizi.\n\nWe are looking at a situation whereby annually we design new kits. But the brand wont change.\n\nAnnually, well be looking to have new kits and of course, we are going to look at the various teams, the Under-17s etc.\n\nI know we are looking at the 2028 Olympics as well, where we need to start building those teams again and they must also have their own kits.\n\nBut, at this point, we are looking at the national team thats going to Afcon.\n\nThose are the three kits that have been requested by the competition. But beyond that, of course, other designs can then be applied elsewhere, added Magwizi.\n\nThe Zifa executive committee have since their election in January come up with various initiatives aimed at giving the national game a professional outlook and commercial value.\n\n",

The event transformed into a grand celebration, bringing together stars, sports administrators, and music lovers for an evening of delicious food and heartfelt camaraderie.\n\nVarious speakers offered glowing tributes to Coventry, who is set to leave Zimbabwe soon to take up her new role as the president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). This historic achievement, following her victory on March 20, saw her become the first woman and the first African to assume the role of IOC president, succeeding Thomas Bach of Germany.\n\nHaving served in the Cabinet of Zimbabwe for seven years, Coventrys contributions have left a lasting mark on the countrys sporting and cultural landscape.\n\nLieutenant General (Retired) Anselem Nhamo Sanyatwe, the new Minister of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture, was the guest of honour. He expressed his admiration for Coventry, noting her immense contribution to both sports and society.\n\nKirsty Coventry joins in dance with the new Minister of Sports, Recreation, Arts, and Culture, Lieutenant General (Retired) Anselem Nhamo Sanyatwe (left), and the Ministrys Permanent Secretary, Nicholas Moyo (right)\n\nIts a special night for all of us as we gather to celebrate a remarkable individual. This is your life  a true champion both on and off the field, a beloved friend and sister, the golden girl. We are here to bid you farewell and not goodbye, as you embark on a new and profoundly significant chapter as the president-elect of the International Olympic Committee, he said.\n\nThe minister showered her with praise, recognising her Olympic achievements.\n\nAs a swimmer, she graced the world stage with exceptional talent, bringing immense pride and glory to Zimbabwe. Her Olympic medals are a testament to her sheer determination and hard work. She has inspired generations of young athletes to pursue their dreams and strive for excellence.\n\nShe brought a fresh perspective and a deep understanding of how sports can unite and uplift communities, he added.\n\nIn an emotional farewell speech, Coventry expressed her deep affection for young talent in Zimbabwe.\n\nI was so priviledged to see young people in our country who have an extraordinary amount of talent, and its our job to ensure that we create an environment for those young talents to succeed and reach their dreams. So, please, keep working hard on their behalf; keep pushing forward the Ministry.\n\nVeteran filmmakers Joe Njagu and Eddie Sandifolo attentively following proceedings\n\nKeep pushing forward all of the different councils and boards because every decision you make today will ensure that the youth of our community reach their full potential.\n\nDeputy Minister of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture, Emily Jesaya, who introduced the guest of honour, reflected on the privilege of working with Dr Coventry.\n\nI got to know you when I was young, and I never thought I would work with you one day. It has been a priviledge working under you all these years, Jesaya said.\n\nRenowned musician, Jah Prayzah delivered a flawless performance that left the audience in awe. The night was made even more special when Minister Sanyatwe and Coventry were seen dancing in the auditorium alongside Permanent Secretary Nicholas Moyo, who later delivered a heartfelt vote of thanks.\n\nCoventry, visibly enjoying the moment, danced to Jah Prayzahs songs, demonstrating her love for Zimbabwean music. The auditorium was alive with top artistes, including Albert Nyathi, Hope Masike, Chirikure Chirikure, Sarah Dhliwayo, Peter Churu and award-winning music promoter Partson Chimbodza. Soccer administrators, including new Zifa president Nqobile Magwizi and Simba Bhora Football Club owner Simba Ndoro, also attended.\n\nRepresentatives from the Ministry of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture, as well as the National Cultural and Creative Industries, attended the event, underscoring the importance of collaboration in enriching Zimbabwes cultural landscape.\n\nThis gathering was not just a farewell; it was a celebration of Coventrys remarkable achievements and the collective spirit of Zimbabwes sports and arts communities. She was presented with gifts, including artefacts and portraits, which she will keep as mementos from the memorable evening.\n\nCredit for the successful event goes to NACZ director Napoleon Nyanhi, and his team, who worked tirelessly to organise the affair.\n\nI want to thank everybody who came on board on short notice as we organised this event. I had a lot of faith that it was going to be a success, as it turned out to be, Nyanhi said, expressing his gratitude to all who attended.\n\nAs Coventry embarks on her new role at the IOC, she has every reason to reflect on her journey with pride. The night was a fitting tribute to a woman whose dedication to sports and arts administration has left an indelible mark on Zimbabwe and inspired countless young athletes and artists.\n\nWith her leadership, the IOC is poised for transformative changes that reflect inclusion and diversity  values that Coventry holds dear. The world now looks forward to seeing how she will shape the future of the global sporting community.\n\n",
