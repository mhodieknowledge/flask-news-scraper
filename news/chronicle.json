This, he believes, will help to boost morale and motivate staff, ultimately contributing to a more efficient and effective administration.\n\nFinally, Gwesela has proposed the establishment of a tripartite agreement involving ZIFA, local authorities and the Central Government. This partnership will focus on driving infrastructural development, with the aim of creating modern, state-of-the-art facilities that can host international matches and provide a fitting platform for Zimbabwean football to thrive.\n\nAs a passionate advocate for Zimbabwean football, I am committed to creating a more sustainable and equitable future for our beloved sport, Gwesela said.\n\nThese proposals are designed to unlock the full potential of our football ecosystem and I am excited to work with stakeholders to turn this vision into a reality.\n\nGweselas qualifications make him a strong candidate for the Zifa board.\n\nHe holds a Masters of Science in Media and Society Studies, a Postgraduate Diploma in Media and Society Studies and a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Administration.\n\nGweselas experience in football administration is impressive, having worked as a Caf General Co-ordinator, a Cosafa General Co-ordinator and a Zifa Administration Instructor. He has also held various positions within Zifa, including Chief Operations Officer, Communications and Competitions Manager and Acting CEO.\n\nWith his wealth of experience and qualifications, Gwesela is confident that he has what it takes to contribute to the success of Zifa.\n\nThe elections are scheduled for January 25.\n\nGwesela will face competition from several other candidates for the Zifa board member post, including veteran administrator Chris Mtungwazi, former Warriors manager Sharrif Musa, Alois Bunjira, Highlanders secretary Morgen Dube, former Warriors coach Sunday Chidzambga, ex-Zifa Southern Region chairperson Andrew Tapela, Tizirayi Luphahla and womens football administrator, Sibekiwe Ndlovu.  @innocentskizoe.\n\n",

We are recalling the reform of the global financial architecture in the sense that we need to scale up development financing, said Prof Ncube.\n\nIt should be more concretionary going forward. This is critical to support economic development, especially in areas around infrastructure.\n\nProf Ncube said similar calls will be amplified at discussions at G20 level under South Africa on various strategies on how it could be achieved.\n\nSouth Africa is this year hosting G20, an inter-governmental economic forum comprising 19 countries and two regional unions  the European Union (EU) and recently the African Union (AU).\n\nIt represents 85 percent of the global economy, 75 percent of world trade and 67 percent of the global population.\n\nDuring the X engagement, Prof Ncube noted that WEF presents a platform for Zimbabwe to showcase its vast new energy minerals.\n\nWe are faced with a wonderful opportunity in terms of opportunities created by the fast-paced development in artificial intelligence, new technologies, new minerals of the future and bio-technology, he said.\n\nAt Davos, we will also discuss climate change issues as climate shocks are an issue which are real issues to us. Another area is on industrialisation and the issue of new energy minerals comes into play and Zimbabwe is a key global player with our endowment in rare earth minerals.\n\nProf Ncube said Zimbabwe will be contributing to how Africa should be contributing with its natural endowment in terms of the new energy minerals for maximum benefit.\n\nGlobal demand for critical minerals is projected to grow three-fold by 2040, presenting a strategic opportunity for African producers including Zimbabwe to increase output and the development of untapped mineral deposits.\n\nZimbabwe has been working to grow mining to a US$12 billion industry, supported by its vast mineral resources especially gold, platinum, lithium and chrome, which should anchor economic upturn and the countrys Vision 2030 of becoming an upper-middle-income economy.\n\n",

            "content": "Harare Bureau\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Republic Police has expressed concern over the increase in new commuter omnibus associations, a development that will contribute to chaos and lawlessness in urban transport.\n\nThe sudden creation of a lot of new small associations, riding on the reputation that few older and larger associations had established, shows the lack of a legal framework to regulate the formation of kombi associations and ensure they can perform specified functions rather than just being a voice for kombi owners.\n\nAuthorities suggest that the Government needs to expedite legislation to allow for self-regulation within the industry with legally recognised and established associations, ensuring proper operations on designated termini and bus stations.\n\nIn Bulawayo, the situation is somewhat better, with only three main kombi associations, making self-regulation feasible.\n\nIn contrast, Harare is experiencing a proliferation of associations, with new ones emerging daily. Despite this, two major associations are beginning to dominate the market amid fierce competition from independent operators and illegal mushikashika taxis and most authorities would welcome the two only.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has indicated plans to introduce a Statutory Instrument to regulate commuter omnibus operations.\n\nAt the moment, the registration process is not overseen by the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development or the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works, leading to confusion and unjustified fare hikes, especially during peak hours.\n\nPolice have announced efforts to target over 13 500 unregistered kombis and pirate taxis as part of an operation to restore order in Harare.\n\nReports indicate there are about 16 500 commuter omnibuses in the city, with only 2950 registered.\n\nNational police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi, called for a structured operation among associations.\n\nHe added that the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development is working on an appropriate Statutory Instrument to govern the operations of commuter associations.\n\nHowever, the police support the activities of associations in terms of road safety, but it becomes a challenge with the proliferation of some of the so-called public service vehicle associations in terms of how they conduct their activities, he said.\n\nMr Ngoni Katsvairo, chairman of the Greater Harare Association of Commuter Operators (GHACO), one of the two major associations, said some of the associations were fly-by-night, with no proper members and not attempt to regulate member services.\n\nHe suggested that there should be a minimum number of commuter omnibuses required to start an association, contrasting Harares situation with Bulawayo, where a route authority letter is mandatory for association membership.\n\nMr Frederick Maguramhinga, president of the Zimbabwe United Deregulated Commuter Operators (Zudco), the other major association in Harare, applauded the polices efforts.\n\nThis has always been our prayer to have compliant association vehicles protected from illegal operators taking our business, he said.\n\nHe expressed hope that the polices focus on reputable associations would lead to a more orderly transport system.\n\nThe ZRPs concerns underscore the urgent need for regulation in the transport sector to enhance safety and order.\n\nAs discussions continue regarding legislative frameworks, the perspectives of operators and law enforcement will be crucial in shaping the future of commuter transport in Zimbabwe.\n\n",
