The USA will never support the shenanigans of attempting to topple the Zanu PF Government.\n\nPeople want confidence in a leader before they follow him. Then Geza expected people to follow him  perhaps it was those behind him who gave him the courage. You cannot simply wake up and think you can change a Government in Africa; systems and circumstances have changed.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has addressed the majority of challenges in Zimbabwe; for instance, the marginalisation of War Veterans is being tackled, said Cde Mutsvangwa.\n\nSomeone (Geza) was wearing a military uniform at the age of 70, trying to act as a saviour. Zimbabweans are not interested in the farce that occurred yesterday. The revolution is very much alive, he added.\n\nZanu PF, Cde Mutsvangwa reaffirmed, remains committed to the security, stability, and economic progress of Zimbabwe.\n\nAs a Government that serves the interests of the people, we take security issues seriously and remain steadfast in ensuring that Zimbabweans can continue to improve their lives and livelihoods without disruption.\n\nHe noted that Zimbabweans are fully aware of the severe damage caused to the economy by previous so-called demonstrations, which only served to cripple progress and undermine national development.\n\nCde Mutsvangwa concluded by stating that the Government remains focused on implementing policies that empower citizens, strengthen the economy, and uphold peace and security.\n\n",
