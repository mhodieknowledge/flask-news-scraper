He was remanded in custody to April 17 for trial.\n\nProsecuting, Mr Ngonidzashe Shumba told the court that in February this year, Ncube lured the young girl into his house under the pretext of giving her sweets, before allegedly raping her.\n\nOn the day in question, the complainant was playing outside her home with other children when the accused called her into his house, claiming he wanted to give her sweets to share with her friends, said Mr Shumba.\n\nOnce inside, the court heard, Ncube directed the girl to his bedroom where he allegedly raped her. He then gave her sweets and instructed her to return outside and continue playing.\n\nThe following day, the girl began complaining of pain in her private parts, prompting her to confide in her mother. A police report was made, leading to Ncubes arrest.\n\nIn his defence, Ncube denied the allegations, claiming they were fabricated by the complainants mother due to a personal grudge.\n\nYour Worship, I didnt rape the complainant, and I have never summoned her into my bedroom. The complainant is young enough to be my daughter. I am a principled person and would never do such a thing.\n\nHe further told the court that he had previously had a dispute with the complainants mother, which he believes led her to make false accusations against him.\n\n@DubeMatutu\n\n",

The matter was postponed to Friday for continuation.\n\nThe case surfaced after his wife, 39-year-old Anna Sibanda, reported persistent abuse that she said has severely affected her mental health, leading to depression.\n\nThe prosecutor, Mr Samuel Mpofu, told the court that the most recent incident occurred on April 6, following a dispute about a broken window.\n\nOn Sunday, the accused returned home and was served food by their daughter. He then summoned one of their sons to question him over the broken window, said Mr Mpofu.\n\nAfter receiving an explanation, Mbondiah allegedly became violent, accusing the boy of being a troublemaker and a burden to the family. He then began assaulting him.\n\nWhen Ms Sibanda intervened to protect their son, the court heard, Mbondiah turned his anger towards her.\n\nHe threatened to kill both his wife and their son, saying he would squash their heads, said Mr Mpofu.\n\nMbondiah is also accused of emotionally abusing his wife, including forcing her to call a relative and falsely confess to mismanaging his money. Ms Sibanda told the court this was not the first time she had received threats from her husband.\n\nShe added that the toxic relationship has left her battling severe depression and that she fears the situation will continue to deteriorate if left unaddressed.\n\n",

This will contribute to the competitiveness of the industrial sectors by building their capacity to adopt, invest in and utilise energy-efficiency.\n\nUnder the mining sector which is strategic in the national economy, the policy says that the sector is a massive consumer of electricity accounting for more than 20 percent of the utility generated power.\n\nThe implementation of the energy efficiency in mining will not only improve their international competitiveness but can also deliver significant benefits to other energy consumers, it says.\n\nThe Government shall encourage the mining sector to improve on their energy intensities. This will be enhanced by establishing institutional energy efficiency policies and energy management programmes.\n\nTurning to the artisanal and small-scale miners energy efficiency improvement, the policy encourages the establishment of an energy consumption baseline for small-scale and artisanal miners.\n\nThis data shall be a reference point in the continuous improvement of their energy intensities.\n\nOn agriculture Government undertakes to promote energy-smart Argo-chain systems that will take full advantage of available renewable energy and waste-to-energy technologies.\n\nThe Government undertakes to explore, integrate, and apply various energy efficiency technologies in specified value chains as enshrined in the Agriculture Food Systems and Transformation Strategy (AFSTS), reads part of the document.\n\n",
