            "content": "Trust Khosa, Zimpapers Arts and Entertainment Hub\n\nFollowing lobbying from various music institutions addressing concerns over the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (Zimura)s announcement that all cover bands should pay a US$150 licensing fee per show, a decision that faced opposition from some musicians and industry professionals, Zimura has expressed willingness to revisit the tariff if proper lobbying processes are followed.\n\nThis comes after the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) recently facilitated a productive dialogue with Zimura and various music industry stakeholders to address the controversial US$150 licensing fee imposed on cover bands. The meeting, held in Harare last week, focused on creating a fair and sustainable tariff structure for cover bands operating within the country.\n\nStakeholders present at the meeting included representatives from NACZ, Zimura, academics, associations, unions, composers, cover band leaders, and beneficiaries of intellectual property rights.\n\nNACZ communication and marketing manager Aggabu Nyabinde issued a statement following the meeting, expressing satisfaction with the outcome and the willingness of all parties to continue the dialogue. The National Arts Council of Zimbabwe is pleased to announce the successful conclusion of a productive stakeholder meeting with Zimura and other music industry representatives. This meeting was prompted by lobbying from various music institutions who sought to address concerns following Zimuras announcement that all cover bands should pay a US$150 licensing fee per show, Nyabinde said.\n\nHe added that Zimura has expressed openness to revisiting the tariff if the proper lobbying processes are followed, including engaging with the composers whose music is performed by the cover bands.Zimura indicated that there is room for revisiting the tariff if the proper lobbying process is followed. They will engage the composers whose music is being performed by the cover bands for their input.NACZ will work closely with Zimura to facilitate the necessary processes and come up with a solution that brings unity and harmony to the music industry, Nyabinde said.\n\nThe National Arts Council is committed to fostering a vibrant and inclusive arts sector. This meeting marks a significant step forward in addressing the concerns of cover bands while upholding the rights of copyright holders.The NACZ highlighted the importance of aligning all stakeholders understanding of intellectual property rights and incorporating international standards for royalty collection from cover bands.\n\nA key point of the discussion centred on reaching an agreement on fair fees that respect both the rights of composers and the operational realities of cover bands.All attending parties agreed that music is intellectual property and should be compensated when used in any form. It is both legal and just for composers to seek compensation for the public performance of their work, Nyabinde said.The conversation also addressed the role of venue owners and festival organisers, who typically handle royalty payments for cover bands as part of their copyright licenses.In Zimbabwe, our law provides for Collective Management Organizations (CMOs) to collect directly from artists, Nyabinde outlined.\n\nThe meeting aligned with the National Music Strategy launched in 2022, which advocates for a well-structured copyright system that ensures fair distribution of royalties to all contributors, including songwriters, performers, producers, and publishers.This collaborative approach will not only benefit all stakeholders but will also contribute to the growth of Zimbabwes creative economy in line with the national vision for 2030, Nyabinde added.\n\nNotable attendees included NACZ executive director Napoleon Nyanhi, Zimura executive director Polisile Chimhini, and Zimbabwe Musicians Union representative Chioneso Rutsito.\n\nThe meeting marked a significant step towards resolving the ongoing concerns surrounding the licensing tariffs for cover bands and further strengthening the music industrys copyright framework.\n\n",

On the first quarter Manyame Falcons dominated but Imbizo Queens came back with a different strategy through the second and third quarters after half time.

With its youthful team of fast players, Black Rhinos inflicted early pain on Tongogara Queens which had old and young players. Besides being dominant last year in Division One, they found the going tough through the first, second and part of the third quarter before Rhinos hammered them 53-23.Black Rhinos were not finished as they locked horns with Manyame Falcons in the last game of the bubble.

            "content": "Langalakhe Mabena, Zimpapers Arts and Entertainment Hub\n\nBulawayo-based Gospel outfit Vocal Ex recently found themselves embroiled in a heated argument with former South African Joyous Celebration member Ayanda Shange after the group posted a cover of his song Phostoli Medley on their social media pages without giving proper credit to the original composer and producer.\n\nThe issue arose when Vocal Ex shared a video of their rendition of the popular track, prompting a response from Shange, who expressed his frustration over the lack of acknowledgment.Why is it so difficult for you to credit the owner of the song? This is the second time, if not the third time, you guys are doing this, Shange commented, visibly upset.\n\nAyanda Shange\n\nThe post, which was later edited and deleted by Vocal Ex, sparked further debate in the comments section, with some followers praising the groups talent while others pointed out the lack of originality, suggesting that Vocal Ex should focus more on their own compositions instead of posting constant cover songs.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Vocal Ex reassured their fans, asking them to be patient as they are working on original material.\n\nScreenshots from the argument between Vocal Ex and Ayanda Shange\n\nThank you. Keep watching this space for details on the projects in the pipeline, the group said.\n\nA lesson to creatives who often post cover songs on social mediaPosting cover songs on platforms like Facebook requires proper legal steps, including obtaining a mechanical license from the copyright owner (usually the music publisher) or a third-party licensing service. If the cover is used in a video, a synchronisation license is also necessary.\n\nScreenshots from the argument between Vocal Ex and Ayanda Shange\n\nFor those who wish to share cover songs without legal issues, it is important to give credit to the original artiste and songwriter by tagging them or including a disclaimer. A simple statement clarifying that the music is not owned by the poster and that no copyright infringement is intended can help avoid legal complications.\n\n",
