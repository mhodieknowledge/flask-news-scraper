            "content": "Mbuyiseni Ndlozihas become the latest member of theEconomic Freedom Fighters(EFF) to resign from the party following his suspension.\n\nNdlozi confirmed his resignation in an interview with the SABC on Sunday night, saying he had decided to leave party politics and make contributions outside that arena.\n\nI have handed over my resignation. I have left the EFF, I have left party politics. EFF is a political party. I have handed in my resignation as a member, and it is because where I want to go and contribute, I cant hold a single-party membership, he said.\n\nBut overall, I think that Ive made my contribution, and I think that there are brilliant young men and women, old men and women in the space who will continue in that category, as it were, of party politics.\n\nNdlozis move comes after months of speculation about his future in the Red Berets.\n\nHis departure follows those of other high-profile EFF members this year, including former deputy leader Floyd Shivambu, former national chairperson Dali Mpofu, former public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane and former government spokesperson Mzwanele Manyi, all of whom defected to Jacob ZumasuMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party.\n\nIn January, Ndlozi resigned as an MP after losing his position in the EFFs central command team during the partys national elective conference in December. The rift between Ndlozi and the Red Berets came after thedeparture of his close ally Shivambu, which saw the former being sidelined from EFF discussions.\n\nEFF leader Julius Malema criticised party members for not pledging allegiance to the party after alleging that Ndlozi was aware of Shivambus plans to defect to the MK party but did not say anything.\n\nIn one instance, Malema indirectly criticised Ndlozis wife, actress Mmabatho Montsho, after she liked an Instagram post by Shivambu announcing his defection.\n\nIn his interview, Ndlozi confirmed that he was barred from attending the EFF national peoples assembly in December and had been suspended six weeks before it. He said this was because of reports that he was among the EFF leaders waiting for the right moment to defect to the MK party. Ndlozi said it was not his responsibility to inform the EFF leadership of Shivambus plans to leave the party.\n\nHe described the suspension as irregular, arguing that it did not align with the partys constitution.\n\nI was told to stay at home and not participate in parliament and the rest of the activities of the EFF. It was very important for me because they said that the investigation is still ongoing; when it is finished, Ill then be given an opportunity to respond. I think we can agree that these are very serious allegations, he said.\n\nNdlozi said his decision to speak out was aimed at clearing his name.\n\nThe EFF has not issued a formal response to his resignation, but party spokesperson Sinawo Thambo said his public pronouncements constituted a resignation and that the party wished him well.\n\nNdlozi was a founding member of the party and previously served as its national spokesperson and an MP.\n\n",

After that, he sent me another beat just as I was returning from a seminar, where a speaker emphasised the importance of loving without expecting anything in return.Inspired by that, I crafted the lyrics for Ungamthanda, flipping the message to highlight the pain of loving someone who doesnt love you back.\n\nI also featured the incredibly talented Macala. Nurturing young talent is crucial because we wont be here forever. Its important to leave behind a solid legacy, and I believe these two artistes represent the future of our music industry. Their talent is out of this world.\n\nMzoe 7 further explained that the song tells the story of a young man who has given up on love, only for his friend to encourage him to remain hopeful but not to expect the same level of affection in return.\n\nOn the choice of locations for the video shoot, Mzoe 7 said it was important to showcase local landmarks and tell authentic stories.This soulful song speaks to the inner person, and Im confident that people will love it.

Rest in peace, Africas hero!\n\nZambian President Hakainde Hichilema posted on his X page: Deeply saddened by the passing of Dr Sam Nujoma  freedom fighter, nationalist, Pan-Africanist, and founding President of Namibia. His legacy will live on forever.\n\nDr Nujoma was the founding leader of the South West Africa Peoples Organisation (SWAPO), which spearheaded Namibias fight for freedom. His leadership and vision played a pivotal role in shaping modern Namibia and advancing the cause of Pan-Africanism.\n\nDr Nujoma was born on 12 May 1929, in a village in northwestern Namibia when his country was under South African administration. South Africa had controlled Namibia since World War One after a brutal few decades of German colonial rule, remembered for the genocide of the Herero and Nama people.\n\nAs a boy, he looked after his familys cattle and attended a Finnish mission school, before moving to the coastal town of Walvis Bay and then the capital, Windhoek, where he worked for South African Railways, according to a biography posted on the website of Dr Nujomas charitable foundation.\n\nDr Nujoma left his job at the railways to focus his energies on bringing down the apartheid system. In the late 1950s, he became leader of the Owambo Peoples Organisation, a precursor to the liberation movement SWAPO, organising resistance to the forced relocation of Black people in Windhoek, which culminated in the police killing 12 unarmed people and wounding dozens more.\n\nDr Nujoma was charged with organising the resistance and arrested. In 1960, he went into exile. He travelled across Africa before reaching the United States, where he petitioned the United Nations for Namibias independence.\n\nMade SWAPO leader in absentia, Dr Nujoma established its armed wing and in 1966 launched a guerrilla war against the apartheid government.\n\nIt took more than a decade of pressure from Dr Nujoma and others before a UN Security Council resolution in 1978 proposed a ceasefire and elections, and another decade for the ceasefire deal to be signed and elections to be held in late 1989.\n\nDr Nujoma was the last of a generation of African leaders who brought their countries out of colonial or white minority rule, including the late former President Robert Mugabe, South Africas Nelson Mandela, Zambias Kenneth Kaunda, Tanzanias Julius Nyerere, and Mozambiques Samora Machel.\n\nDr Nujoma spent nearly 30 years in exile as the leader of Namibias independence movement before returning for Parliamentary elections in late 1989, the first democratic vote in the country.\n\nHe was elected president by lawmakers months later in 1990 as Namibias independence was confirmed.\n\n",

The school, constructed with walls made from metal sheets, currently enrols over 100 students.\n\nSince opening its doors in January 2024, Onxy Academy has become the only educational institution serving the western part of Cowdray Park, known as Esgodweni. The school offers a range of subjects but lacks practical classes like Agriculture, Woodwork, Metalwork, Food and Nutrition, and Fashion and Fabrics.\n\nWe are the only school in this part of the suburb, and our vision is to provide quality education and adequately prepare students for public exams. We opened in January 2024 with an enrolment of just over 100 learners, said Mr Elton Tofa, the school principal.\n\nOur long-term goal is to develop the school into a fully-fledged institution, complete with science blocks, workshops, and sports facilities.\n\nThe schools current infrastructure is modest, and it relies on a staff of just seven educators to manage the diverse needs of its students. Despite these limitations, Onxy Academy has become a lifeline for many families, especially for students like Sipho, a Form Four learner.\n\nSipho, who resides at the far end of Cowdray Park, shared his experience:\n\nIts not easy to get a place at Cowdray Park Secondary School because its always full, and my parents cannot afford to send me to a school in the city centre. Im grateful for Onxy Academy because its close to my home, and many of my friends are here.\n\nLocal resident Orlando Mlilo expressed concern over the lack of sufficient educational options in the area.\n\nCowdray Park is growing at an alarming rate, but the construction of schools is not keeping up. Two years ago, I tried to enrol my son at Luveve High, but they told me that the school only accepts children from the local area, he said.\n\nAccording to 2023 statistics from the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, Zimbabwe has 10 517 schools. Ideally, the ratio of schools to population in the country should be about one school for every 1 500 people, based on a 95 percent gross enrolment rate in primary education and a national population of 15 million.\n\nHowever, Cowdray Parks rapid expansion has left the suburb with a severe shortage of secondary schools.\n\nWard 28 Councillor Ntandoyenkosi Ndlovu highlighted the urgency of the situation, particularly during the rainy season when mud and poor road conditions make commuting to schools even more difficult.\n\nThe situation becomes even worse in the rainy season, when learners from the far end of the suburb must walk long distances to Cowdray Park Secondary.\n\nNot all parents can afford to send their children to private schools in the area, so its critical for the government to expedite the construction of additional secondary schools, said Clr Ndlovu.\n\nWith a population of 75 000, Cowdray Park is now the second most populous urban ward in Zimbabwe, after Harares Budiriro, which has over 89 000 residents.\n\nThe suburbs population is larger than that of towns like Gwanda (27 000 residents) and Hwange (40 000 residents). As the population continues to grow, the demand for essential services like education, healthcare, and shopping facilities becomes increasingly urgent.\n\n",

            "content": "Fungi Kwaramba recently in DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania\n\nChiefs of Defence Forces (CDFs) from SADC and the East Africa Community (EAC) have been given five days to provide technical direction that will ensure immediate ceasefire enforcement in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), facilitate humanitarian aid and develop a security plan for Goma and surrounding areas.\n\nAt the same time, African countries that were backing rebels in the DRC were also directed to immediately leave to give the people of the vast and resource-endowed nation a chance to live in sustainable peace.\n\nSpeaking to journalists upon his return from the joint SADC-EAC summit on Saturday night, President Mnangagwa said the meeting underscored the need for regional co-operation in addressing insecurity in the eastern parts of DRC.\n\nHe said the two blocs had resolved that no individual country should support armed groups responsible for conflict and displacement in the region.\n\nThe summit, co-chaired by President Mnangagwa in his capacity as SADC chairperson and Kenyan President William Ruto as EAC chairperson, focused on strategies to restore peace in the conflict-riddled region.\n\nWell, it was a joint summit of SADC and East African communities and the main issues were the issues of insecurity in the Eastern DRC, said the President.\n\nIt was an attempt by the two blocs  SADC and East African Community  to deal with that in security, trying to find ways where the two blocs can help create peace in that region and identify the parties that are involved in the military contestation in the Eastern DRC.\n\nDespite the complexity of the situation, President Mnangagwa said, consensus was reached that all member States must refrain from supporting or arming any militant groups operating in the region.\n\nOf course, it was very difficult but in the end, it was resolved that all member States should make sure that they do not support groups, armed groups in the region, to cause insecurity on the continent and in that particular area.\n\nOf course, no Member State came forward to say they were supporting an army, but it was very clear that these (rebel) groups were actually allowed to operate from a certain Member State.\n\nIt was agreed that everything must be done to silence the guns, and that they (armed groups) should not be rendered any support by any member State.\n\nIn its communiqu, the joint summit directed that modalities for the withdrawal of uninvited foreign armed forces from the territory of the DRC, be developed and implemented by the two regional bodies top military officials.\n\nThe joint summit reaffirmed solidarity and unwavering commitment to continue supporting the DRC in its pursuit of safeguarding its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as sustainable peace, security and development, read the communiqu in part.\n\nThe summit decided that similar consultations shall be convened at least once every year and as and when the need arises to review matters of common interest to the two regions.\n\nApart from that, the summit directed that a joint meeting of ministers of EAC and SADC convenes within the next 30 days to deliberate on:\n\n(a) the report of the joint meeting of CDFs on the ceasefire and cessation of hostilities\n\n(b) establishment of a secretariat-level technical coordination mechanism to monitor implementation of the joint summit decisions\n\n(c) an elaborate road map detailing immediate, medium- and long-term implementation measures, including financing modalities, and address all other residual issues relating to the attainment of sustainable peace and security in the eastern DRC and make appropriate recommendations to the next joint meeting of the EAC-SADC Summit.\n\nThe regional leaders also directed the resumption of direct negotiations with all State and non-State actors, including M23, within the Luanda/Nairobi process framework, while calling for implementation of the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) to neutralise the FDLR and facilitating Rwandas disengagement from the DRC.\n\nSADC and the EAC convened Saturdays joint summit to try and find a lasting solution to the DRC crisis, which has seen rebel groups taking over towns in the eastern parts of the vast country.\n\nApart from SADC Chairman President Mnangagwa, his EAC Counterpart President Ruto, and the host Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan, there was a huge turnout of regional leaders.\n\nDRCs President Felix Tshisekedi, who accuses Rwanda of backing the rebels in his country, attended the joint summit virtually.\n\nRwandan President Paul Kagame, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, South African leader Cyril Ramaphosa, Somalian President Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud and Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, attended the high-stakes joint summit.\n\nLeaders of Burundi, Angola, Malawi, South Sudan and Madagascar were represented by ministers.\n\nOn Saturday President Mnangagwa told his fellow leaders that Africa must draw from its shared historical solidarity and the unity it used to dismantle colonialism to free the people of the DRC from internecine wars and conflict that undermine development.\n\nAddressing the opening session of the joint summit, President Mnangagwa said Africa should not let the people of DRC down but must, through honest dialogue, find a solution to silence the guns and engender enduring peace in the Great Lakes region.\n\nThe unity, solidarity and unbreakable bonds of the peoples of the continent must stand the test of such trying times, he said.\n\nWe must remain as solidly united as we were during the struggle for the complete emancipation and independence of Africa from colonialism.\n\nWe, thus, have a duty and collective responsibility to comprehensively, frankly, tackle and address the various challenges that are impeding the realisation of peace and security for the people of Eastern DRC.\n\nDrawing from our rich African values and heritage, and further emboldened by the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter; the Constitutive Act of the African Union as well as the treaties of both SADC and the EAC; let us seize this opportunity to ensure convergence and a coordinated response which is mutually reinforcing towards one common objective.\n\nTowards the ultimate objective of finding last peace in the DRC, President Mnangagwa said talks among regional leaders must always be carried with openness, honesty, flexibility and a commitment to building lasting peace.\n\n",
