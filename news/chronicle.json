True to its name, the riddim invites artistes from Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Zambia to showcase their courage and creativity.\n\nLast year, Danica Studios released the Creative Actions2 Riddim, which celebrated and thanked Culture Fund Zimbabwe and the European Union Delegation to Zimbabwe for their support of local artistes through the Creative Actions2 funding initiative. This riddim was launched on Africa Day at Mfelandawonye Grounds in Victoria Falls and drew a crowd of over 3 000 people, supporting local artistes featured on the project.\n\nMuffia King, the director of Danica Studios, said the Kasongo Riddim aims to inspire artistes to persevere despite challenges.As Danica Studios, were encouraging artistes to be brave like the warthog, Kasongo, and to never give up on their dreams, regardless of the economic challenges or other hurdles they face in their musical journey, said Muffia King.\n\nThe Kasongo Riddim was composed by DJ Bruno and Tony Witness at Danica Studios. Recording has already begun, not only in Victoria Falls but also at various locations, including Hwange (Danica Studios branch), Bulawayo (T Flow Da Producer), Masvingo (Savil Music), Muruwa (Elevate 1 Studio), Harare (Lavaz of Oskid Productions), Zambia (Plush International), and Botswana (TK Swizz).\n\nMuffia King revealed plans to record over 100 artistes on the riddim, with a live launch event scheduled for next month in Victoria Falls.By February, Danica Studios aims to have recorded close to 100 artistes for the Kasongo Riddim in preparation for its official launch at Mfelandawonye Grounds in Victoria Falls.Over the years, we have built a reputation for discovering and nurturing talent while helping artistes and producers make a name for themselves, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Weve organised shows for emerging artistes, giving them a platform to showcase their skills.Danica Studios has established strong relationships with other studios, promoters, radio stations, and influencers. As a label, weve consistently placed our province on the map and continue to raise the bar, added Muffia King.  Follow Mthabisi Tshuma on X:@mthabisi_mthire\n\n",

The album features a diverse collection of tracks, including Sofa Silahlane featuring Bara, Konke Kuzolunga, Pfugama Unamate, Amany featuring Ntu2kay and Vuyo Brown, Mota featuring MJ Sings, Batidzai Mwenje, U Dokotela featuring Butholezwe, Uyu Ndiye  DJ Jabs & Da Grooveman and Ndikaita Mari\n\nSpeaking about the project, DJ Jabs described it as a collaborative effort brewed in the City of Kings and Queens (Bulawayo).Tomorrow is the big day when the album will be available for streaming, downloads, and on radio. Were also working on visuals, which will follow around February, said DJ Jabs.\n\nHe shared the albums broad appeal.This album is tailored for everyone. It features gospel songs, inspirational tracks, love songs, and club anthems, with clean lyrics to accommodate all audiences.\n\nOriginally intended to be a shorter EP, the project evolved into a full-length album to reach a broader audience.This is an Afro-house/Afro-tech dance album. Initially, it was set to be an EP for release in December 2024, but we decided to expand it into an album, which delayed the release. The inspiration came from the fast-growing house music culture in Bulawayo, Harare, and internationally. Events like Garden of House, House in CBD, and BYO Shutdown have shown that house music has a vibrant following, despite challenges in the local music scene, DJ Jabs explained.\n\nHe added that their aim was to address the scarcity of locally produced house music in indigenous languages.House music is loved globally, but quality house music in our local dialects, like IsiNdebele and Shona, is limited. Many songs played at events are foreign. This album bridges that gap.\n\nThe duo also hopes the album will reach international audiences.When we made this album, we had Zimbabwe and the international market in mind. The IsiNdebele and Shona lyrics, paired with Afro-house and Afro-tech beats, create a unique sound that appeals both locally and globally. Despite challenges like power cuts and tight schedules, we pushed through, thanks to our determination and support from our sponsor, IBM (Ideal Black Man), said DJ Jabs.\n\nDa Grooveman echoed these sentiments, highlighting the seamless creative process.In my 15-year career, Ive never been part of such a swift and collaborative process. Initially, I was skeptical about extending the EP into an album within the given timeframe, but we exceeded expectations. The quality speaks for itself, said Da Grooveman.\n\nThe duo plans to embark on a promotional tour, with dates to be announced soon. Follow Mthabisi Tshuma on X: @mthabisi_mthire\n\n",

The school which has one block is housing ECD B learners. It was constructed using devolution funds. A second block is under construction. Alderman Moyo said the target for council is to build three classroom blocks and then hand over the school to the SDC to further develop the school.\n\nAlderman Moyo said devolution funds have gone a long way in assisting council to meet its obligations.\n\nThis town is rapidly growing and the population at schools is too high with Jahunda Primary School sitting at 2 300 pupils while Senondo is at 1 700 and St Christophers is at 900. We need about four more primary schools and we have identified a site for a secondary school. The distance walked by some children is very long hence the need for these schools.\n\nWe needed to construct a new school in Garikai/ Hlalani Kuhle and devolution came in the handy is seeing us build Phakama Primary School. Once we have constructed three classroom blocks we will hand over the project to the SDC to continue developing the school and we will move on to Spitzkop Primary School. We look forward to receiving devolution funds for this year which will help up to make progress with these projects, he said.\n\nIn 2020, residents decided to spearhead the construction of Phakama Primary school by mobilising resources. The residents from the ward contributed US$1 each towards buying building material which was used to construct a slab for the classroom block.\n\nGwanda Municipality later came in and used devolution funds towards constructing the classroom block and purchasing furniture.\n\nWith social amenities and infrastructure development being some of the major pillars of the National Development Strategy (NDS1), local authorities have used devolution funds to augment efforts by communities and other stakeholders through ensuring that projects are completed timeously.\n\nDevolution funds are assisting local authorities fulfil their obligation across the country through development of key infrastructure such as clinics, classroom blocks, roads, bridges among other facilities. Devolution funds have transformed several districts in the Matabeleland region as the Second Republic steps up the inclusive developmental philosophy of leaving no one and no place behind.\n\nThe devolution programme is one of the key pillars under the NDS1. The overarching goal of the NDS1 is to ensure high, accelerated, inclusive and sustainable economic growth as well as socio-economic transformation and development as the country moves towards an upper middle-income society by 2030.@DubeMatutu\n\n",

We have updated them now.\n\nRegmi did not specify how the extra revenue would be used.\n\nThe rise in permit fees came as no surprise, said British mountaineer Kenton Cool, who has reached the summit of Everest 18 times.\n\nIn the grand scheme of the cost to climb Everest it wont impact most foreign climbers, he told the BBC.\n\nHopefully, the extra revenue will be put to good use.\n\nIn April 2024, Nepals Supreme Court ordered the government to limit the number of mountaineering permits issued for Everest and other peaks, saying that the mountains capacity must be respected.\n\nThe preliminary order did not set a maximum number, though.\n\nAmid concerns about overcrowding on Everest and climbers queuing in dangerous conditions to reach the summit, the Nepalese army in 2019 began conducting an annual clean-up of the mountain, which is often described as the worlds highest garbage dump.\n\nIn that time at least five clean-ups have collected 119 tonnes of rubbish, 14 human corpses and some skeletons, according to the army  but it is estimated that a further 200 bodies remain on the mountain.\n\nNepal is home to eight of the worlds 14 highest mountains, including Everest.BBC\n\n",
