            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza ,[emailprotected]\n\nAS Bulawayo residents endure a gruelling 170-hour water-shedding schedule due to dwindling dam levels amid an El Nio-induced drought, a suspected water leak at the Criterion Water Works in Burnside suburb has been wasting vast quantities of water for over a year.\n\nResidents of Burnside accuse Bulawayo City Council (BCC) of failing to address the persistent leak, which has turned into a lucrative opportunity for some individuals and companies.\n\nConstruction firms and residents from Burnside and Douglasdale are reportedly capitalising on the situation, with some selling the leaked water to farmers.\n\nChronicle crews observed private water bowsers collecting water from a stream formed by the leak yesterday.\n\nOne bowser, emblazoned with the name of a local bulk water supplier, had a capacity of 10 000 litres. Another belonged to a construction company that builds low-cost homes in suburbs such as Pelandaba West and Mbundane.\n\nA driver of one of the bowsers revealed that the collected water is sold to peri-urban farmers in areas like Kensington and Douglasdale, whose boreholes have dried up due to the drought.\n\nThe farmers use the water for their cattle and farming activities. As long as its not contaminated by sewage, its suitable for livestock, he said.\n\nHe also mentioned that chicken breeders, who manage thousands of birds, rely on this bulk water for their operations but declined to disclose the price for a 10000-litre tank.\n\nIn addition to commercial use, the leaked water is being utilised by residents.The news crew observed three young girls fetching water from the stream.\n\nOur home is far from here, but we come twice a day to collect water for drinking and cooking. Our mother boils it before storing it in 5-litre bottles, one of the girls explained.\n\nHowever, it was unclear whether the water was treated or raw, raising concerns about its safety.The BCCs communications department had not responded to inquiries by the time of publication.\n\nThe continued wastage of water comes at a time when residents are grappling with severe shortages, with many resorting to unsafe sources for their daily needs. The citys water supply has been under strain for years due to factors such as population growth, climate change, and poor resource management.\n\nIn September, the Upper Ncema Dam was decommissioned after reaching a critical level of 2,08 percent.It was the second dam to be shut down following the decommissioning of the Umzingwane Dam in November 2023.\n\nA recent survey revealed that residents in suburbs like Old Lobengula have been using water from leaking pipes for drinking and household chores.\n\nMs Mulape Mbela, a mother of two, expressed her frustration.\n\nWe havent had tap water for almost a month. We are forced to fetch water from a burst pipe, even though it poses health risks. Boiling water is difficult because of frequent power cuts, so most people use it without taking precautions, she said.\n\nMr Ricky Mafu voiced fears of a potential cholera outbreak, noting that residents often use unclean containers to fetch water from communal boreholes.\n\nMany people bring dirty buckets to collect water, and this compromises the safety of a shared resource, he said.Bulawayo Progressive Residents Association (BPRA) executive director, Mrs Permanent Ngoma, said some suburbs have gone for weeks without running water.\n\nThe decommissioning of dams further exacerbates the water availability challenge.The situation is really bad as some areas go up to three weeks without tap water. We have engaged the council to frequently provide water bowsers, she said.\n\nAccording to a recent council report, the decommissioning of Upper Ncema in September and Lower Ncema in November has reduced the daily water abstraction capacity to 93 megalitres, sourced from Insiza, Inyankuni, Mtshabezi, and Nyamandlovu dams.\n\nAs the rainy season approaches in December, stringent measures are required, including a 170-hour water-shedding schedule.\n\n",

A good road is an economic enabler, and this road tremendously shortens the distance from Beitbridge to Chirundu and vice versa, he said.\n\nMinister Mhona said his ministry will continue with its mandate of ensuring that the countrys major roads are trafficable and navigable.\n\nWe are not only going to end on trunk roads but will also be revisiting other locations so that at the end of the day the road network across the country will be enhanced, he said.\n\nMidlands Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Owen Ncube said the rehabilitation of the road marked the commitment by the Second Republic to modernise and industrialise the country in pursuit of an upper-middle-income economy by 2030.\n\nShurugwi-Mhandamabwe Road had become a concern to the leadership, motorists, and Shurugwi residents, but because of a listening President we have, it has been rehabilitated. The reconstruction of the road confirms the New Dispensations development approach of leaving no one and no place behind, he said.\n\nMinister Ncube said the rehabilitation of the Shurugwi-Mhandamabwe Road will help accelerate economic development in the Midlands including contributing to the provincial GDP growth.\n\nAs the shortest and most cost-effective route to international markets via South Africa and Mozambique, the road is crucial for corporates and mining giants operating in the province, he said.Minister Ncube stressed the importance of modernising the countrys road network, saying it is critical in facilitating tourism, trade, and investment.\n\nTo achieve this, Minister Ncube urged local authorities to prioritise infrastructure repair and upgrade, acknowledging the roads strategic importance.\n\nWe are targeting the modernisation of our road network as it is a key economic enabler that facilitates the growth of tourism, trade, and investment. I urge local authorities, in particular, to move with speed to repair and upgrade their infrastructure, he said.\n\nUnder the Infrastructure, Utilities and Digital Economy cluster, Zimbabwes economic blueprint, the NDS 1 prioritises the completion of road rehabilitation projects.\n\nThe main aspirations of NDS1 include infrastructural development as a key enabler in attaining Vision 2030 of having an upper middle-income economy.\n\nNDS 1 notes that a road can become an economy and in this regard, the focus is on the development of feeder roads into communities as a way of developing underdeveloped remote areas.\n\n",

The ultimate goal is to earn a place in an NFL roster.\n\nMaguranyanga is only 21 years old and has been selected alongside 13 others to carry out a 10-week training programme, which involves on-field and classroom education at the elite IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nAfter their training, they will display their skills in front of NFL club scouts as part of the University of South Floridas Pro Day in March.\n\nThe IPP programme has historically welcomed athletes from a variety of sporting backgrounds, including rugby, basketball, Gaelic football, track and field, and other codes. It is reinforced by esteemed football coaching staff.\n\nThe Class of 2025 is an exciting one and we are delighted to welcome these talented athletes from around the world to the International Player Pathway programme. Focusing on our global football development efforts and fostering international talent is crucial to growing our game globally.\n\nThe IPP programme offers life-changing opportunities for international talent, and we look forward to following their progress in the weeks and months ahead, said NFL executive vice-president of international, events and club business, Peter OReilly.\n\nThabani TJ Maguranyanga\n\nMaguranyanga had been making waves in the world of rugby playing in France.After earning international recognition for his performances in rugby Sevens at the Africa Mens Sevens in Mauritius, he had been due to make his Sables debut in the Africa Cup in Uganda. However, an injury prevented him from doing so.\n\nDespite the setback, Maguranyanga refused to be deterred. Instead, he set his sights on a new challenge: securing a spot in the NFL. Should he make it, he would become only the second Zimbabwean to play in the competition, following in the footsteps of Nate Landman.\n\nLandman, whose father had played international rugby for Zimbabwe, was already making a name for himself in the NFL, having joined the Atlanta Falcons after a successful college career at Colorado. Now, Maguranyanga is hoping to follow in his footsteps.\n\nTo achieve this dream, Maguranyanga had to overcome several obstacles. Injuries had plagued his time at top French side ASM Clermont Auvergne. But he persevered and, despite a season out of action and a potentially career-ending injury, he had made a remarkable recovery.\n\nHis efforts paid off with his international debut earlier this year, paving the way for his selection for the NFLs IPP programme.\n\nIf he can continue to demonstrate the same determination and resilience that brought him this far, theres no telling where his career might take him next.\n\n",

Streets such as 6th Avenue Extension and Herbert Chitepo Street from 5th to 11th Avenue have become no-go zones for ordinary motorists due to illegal activities by pirate taxi operators, commonly known as mushikashika.\n\nIn the ongoing operation, police are working in conjunction with the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) and the Vehicle Inspectorate Department (VID).\n\nBulawayo provincial acting police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Nomalanga Msebele said they are also targeting motorists not adhering to road traffic rules and vehicles without number plates and those with unsafe modifications such as bars and spotlights.\n\nShe said they capitalising on the recently installed CCTVs in the city centre to nab traffic offenders.We have since the launch of the blitz arrested 494 offenders of 76 are mushikashika drivers. We also impounded 109 vehicles, and 100 of them had no number plates, said Asst Insp Msebele.\n\nShe said the operation also targets non-passenger carrying vehicles being used to carry passengers and unroadworthy vehicles and touts.\n\nMost of the mushikashikas that we impounded had no number plates, and in most cases, we suspect these are the cars used in robberies and kidnappings.\n\nUnlicensed operators are undermining the regulated public transport system and posing safety risks to passengers, said the police spokesperson.\n\nAsst Insp Msebele said the operation forms a crucial part of the ongoing efforts to maintain road safety and order in the city during the festive season.\n\nThis operation involves comprehensive inspections of commuter omnibuses to ensure that they meet the necessary safety standards and regulatory requirements, she said.\n\nAsst Insp Msebele said public transport operators who violate the law will face appropriate penalties, including fines and possible operating licence suspensions.\n\nThe rampant proliferation of Mushikashika and touting poses a serious threat to public safety and order. We are committed to restoring law and order on our streets and ensuring the safety of all citizens, she said.\n\nWe are working with various stakeholders who include public transport providers and Government organs such as the Judicial Services Commission. We have noted that most of these people who are arrested are repeat offenders and therefore there is a need for them to face the full wrath of the law.\n\nAsst Insp Msebele warned that offenders would face stiff penalties, including court appearances and potential prison sentences for repeat offenders.\n\nThis time around there will not be an option to pay a fine but instead will be taken to court where upon conviction they will sentenced to prison, she said.\n\nAsst Insp Msebele urged members of the public not to interfere with operations as they would likely be arrested on charges of inciting public unrest and obstruction of justice.\n\nThis follows the arrest of dozens of onlookers who found themselves on the wrong side of the law this morning as police cracked down on illegal taxis and kombis operating in the city centre.\n\nThe operation aimed at ridding the CBD of unlicensed vehicles, as well as restoring sanity on the roads took an unexpected twist when members of the public began filming the police as they carried out their duties.\n\nAssistant Inspector Nomalanga Msebele\n\nWitnesses reported that the police were actively engaged in stopping and checking vehicles that were not adhering to designated pick-up and drop-off points.\n\nHowever, instead of just watching, many bystanders took their phones and started to capture the action as it unfolded.What started as a casual curiosity quickly escalated into a flurry of arrests as officers deemed the filming as interference with their operation.\n\nWe understand that people are curious, but when it starts to disrupt our work, we have to take action. These operations are crucial for maintaining safety in our city, and we cannot allow distractions, said Asst Insp Msebele.\n\nEarlier this year police launched a nationwide campaign code-named no to touts and mushikashika, where thousands of individuals were arrested and their vehicles impounded.\n\nThe operation sought to reclaim public spaces and enhance commuter safety by cracking down on unauthorised transport services and illegal touting practices.\n\n",

The farm is owned by Mr Mike Querl, his wife Ms Kerrie Mitchell, and their business partner Mr Graeme Jansen van Vuuren.\n\nDuring the visit, Dr Kumbirai Mateva, a scientist at the Kutsaga Research Board, emphasised the significance of ongoing research in cannabis seed cross-breeding. This research aims to integrate foreign genetics with native seeds, ensuring that the resulting seeds can adapt and flourish in the local environment.\n\nZimbabwes climate is particularly well-suited for cannabis cultivation. The countrys optimal growing environment allows for the production of cannabis that meets international standards, which is crucial for both medicinal and recreational markets. The use of greenhouse conditions and advanced agricultural techniques, such as mechanised drip systems and specialised lighting, ensures that the cannabis produced is of the highest quality.\n\nIn 2018, Zimbabwe became one of the first African countries to legalise the production of medicinal cannabis. This regulatory foresight has positioned the country to tap into the burgeoning global cannabis market, which is projected to be worth US$272 billion by 2028.\n\nZimbabwe aims to capture at least US$1 billion of this market, with the potential to significantly boost its economy through job creation, increased revenue, and overall economic development.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (Zida) has been instrumental in attracting investors to the cannabis sector. As of 2022, approximately 60 companies had been licensed to cultivate medicinal cannabis.\n\nZimbabwe Investment Development Authority (Zida)\n\nBy leveraging its natural advantages and regulatory framework, Zimbabwe is well on its way to becoming a key player in the global cannabis industry. The countrys commitment to quality and sustainability in cannabis production is expected to attract international buyers and investors, further solidifying its position in the market.\n\nStrategic planning, favourable conditions, and a commitment to quality mark the countrys journey toward becoming a global leader in cannabis farming. With continued investment and support, the country is poised to make significant strides in the global cannabis market, contributing to its economic growth and development.\n\n",

All Comesa member states, joined by other countries such as Namibia, Mozambique, and East African Community, Intergovernmental Authority of Development, Indian Ocean Commission, SADC, and secretariats of different regional ICT associations, are attending the workshop, which ended yesterday.\n\nComesa states hired a consultant, Cerfodes, in February to review existing instruments related to regional ICT development and institutional co-operation.\n\nDr Chirume said Zimbabwe was pushing a capacity agenda to train and impart ICT skills to everyone to effectively use technology in their own areas.\n\nThe workshop aims to validate a framework of cooperation which can be used to foster synergy, address shared goals, and ensure accountability in implementing set strategies. Let me emphasise the importance of a sustainability strategy and framework for cooperation as it focuses on connectivity and infrastructure, policy and regulation, digital inclusion, and capacity building.\n\nThe plan aims to address critical challenges such as broadband connectivity in underserved areas, cross-border inter-connectivity, cybersecurity, digital literacy, and climate resilience. We must continue to work together as a continent to benefit from partnerships, said Dr Chirume.\n\nShe said having a regional digital plan will enhance integration.The pervasive nature of ICT means that it can work as an enabler of all sectors of the economy, be it in financial, smart education, or health.\n\nSo we are saying in all aspects of the economy, ICT is crucial and a backbone, and will enable efficient delivery of services. This is what we want to see Zimbabwe doing in line with Vision 2030, and that can only happen when we have fully embraced ICT, she said.\n\nShe said Zimbabwes economy will leapfrog and move faster in terms of regulating ICT, riding on sound policies and collaboration with other players and organisations locally and regionally.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary said Zimbabwe has made significant strides in terms of mobile penetration rate, which stands at 96,7 percent, 78,55 percent for internet penetration rate, and broadband penetration at 76,37 percent as of the second quarter.\n\nShe said this was crucial as it has capacitated ordinary citizens, especially in under-served areas.The Government also came up with the Universal Services Fund to improve ICT development and is enhancing the setting up of passive infrastructure for communities.\n\nChirume said: It is a very crucial initiative that promotes growth and development of ICT and telecommunications in our region and entire communities as we all move towards the digital economy. As partners in Comesa and Africa, we can work together to harmonise policies across our borderless ICT countries.\n\nICT, Postal and Courier Services Permanent Secretary Dr Beullar Chirume says ICT is a key enabler to development in Zimbabwe and the region as it enhances every economic sector and fosters regional integration\n\nThe Republic of Zimbabwe acknowledges the value of ICT, in particular their pervasive nature and contribution to economic growth and sustainable development across any sector. As Zimbabwe, through the Ministry of ICT, we are at the forefront of ensuring that all Zimbabweans have access to affordable and reliable internet connectivity through targeted digital access and infrastructure expansion.\n\nShe said the Government had put in place policies and regulations that enhance the sector.Comesa Director of Infrastructure, Dr Bernard Dzwanda, said the overall objective of the EGEE-ICT programme is to deepen regional integration and the growth of the ICT sector in the region.\n\nHe said the EGEE-ICT programme would benefit member states and help in the socio-economic and sustainable development of the region through digital development, poverty reduction, and infrastructure, among others.\n\nIt is vital that the enabling environment for ICT sector development is supported given the role it plays in economic development through a multi-stakeholder approach involving RECs and countries.\n\nICT plays a pivotal role in enabling socio-economic development by driving innovation, increasing efficiency, and improving accessibility to essential services.\n\nThe ICT sector, as we know it, is a key enabler that promotes the development of other sectors such as health, education, transport, among others. Comesa considers ICT as one of its priority sectors in enabling development and overall regional integration and therefore, ensures that initiatives such as the EGEE-ICT programme are given utmost attention to succeed, he said.  @ncubeleon\n\n",

Other components include the Accelerator Model, Pfumvudza/Intwasa, Presidential Poultry Scheme, Presidential Fisheries Scheme, Presidential Blitz Tick Grease Scheme and the Presidential Cotton Inputs Scheme, which feed into Vision 2030.\n\nSACP is being implemented in five provinces; Matabeleland North, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland East, Mashonaland West, and parts of Midlands, which did not benefit from another project, the Small Holder Irrigation Revitalisation Programme( SIRP) that started in 2017.\n\nThe SIRP targeted Matabeleland South, Masvingo, Manicaland, and parts of the Midlands.SACPs scope is to promote market-led and climate-smart value chains and a small component of irrigation schemes. The idea is to cushion farmers against the effects of climate change through climate-smart initiatives as well as assist the value chains.\n\nSmart climate agriculture project being implemented through the SACP project in Lupane to boost food security and address climate change impact\n\nThe SACP targets to help 100 VBUs in the five provinces but starting with Matabeleland North as a pilot programme.SACP national project co-ordinator Dr Godfrey Nehanda said the project involves equipping nutrition gardens and VBUs in the five provinces. In Matabeleland North, it is being implemented in Lupane and Hwange.\n\nIn Lupane the projects will be in Lupanes Mabhikwa and Jabatshaba areas.The project focuses on developing and fencing 1,25-hectare gardens, polarised boreholes, drip irrigation, drinking troughs for livestock, taps for domestic water supply and laundry facilities.\n\nThe one hectare is for commercial purposes while the 0.25ha is for a nutritional garden.Dr Nehanda said SACP is a six-year project running from 2021-2027 to improve household incomes and nutrition through smallholder agriculture transformation as well as improve smallholder farmers participation in the agriculture market value chain.\n\nHe said the project is being implemented in 18 districts in the five provinces focusing on value chain development.\n\nThis project comes under the Ministry of Lands where we are complementing Government efforts. The target is to have 100 VBUs and this year we are supposed to accomplish 70 and to date, we are finalising 20 in Lupane and Hwange, said Dr Nehanda.\n\nThe project also involves water provision for domestic and irrigation use in partnership with the Zimbabwe National Water Authority and the Rural Infrastructure Development Agency.\n\nWe are trying to respond to drought issues in collaboration with the Government and we are at an advanced stage of implementing the VBUs, said Dr Nehanda.Matabeleland North Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Richard Moyo said the VBUs are part of President Mnangagwas vision to transform the socio-economic state of every community through the rural industrialisation agenda.\n\nThis is part of President Mnangagwas vision to have these village business units.These are the partners we want as Government to develop the country through empowering people, he said.Minister Moyo said capacitating the nutritional gardens will help improve food security and income.  @ncubeleon\n\n",
