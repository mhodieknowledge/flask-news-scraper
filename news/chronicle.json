Its also a competitive preparation, helping teams adjust to the higher level of competition before the season starts.\n\nThe tournament for us is for fan engagement whereby we are building excitement among supporters through showcasing the promoted teams in a special event. We also want to strengthen relationships between teams, fans and local businesses, said Mpofu.\n\nMawabeni FC head coach Nkosi Moyo said the tournament will help them finalise their squad for the upcoming season.\n\nWe havent finalised our squad as some players are still being assessed. As much as we are going into the tournament to come up with combinations and to see if some players can make the grade  it doesnt mean we will just be push overs.\n\nMawabeni FC\n\nYes going into the tournament we are underdogs as our opponents feel coming from a rural set up will disadvantage us. But football is the same world over as long as the principles of play are effected accordingly, he said.Moyo said there are ready to play either of the teams.\n\nAs for Gwanda Pirates, we have been playing in the same league and thats the game to watch if ever it happens that we face each other. It will be unpredictable if then we face Nust FC or Eagle Life FC as we have been playing in different regions. I am appealing to our fans and all football lovers to come and have a great day watching the beautiful game of football meant to foster good relations, friendship and unity.\n\nAt the end of it all may the best team win  which in this case is Mawabeni FC hopefully, said Moyo.Eagles Life FC vice chairman Themba Ncube said they started training last week, they will use the opportunity to assess players.\n\nGwanda Pirates\n\nThe preparations for this coming season are going on smoothly. This week is our second week into training. We started a bit late but hopefully we will catch up.\n\nThis tournament has come at the right time for us to assess and see where we are in terms of the preparations. As a team coming from Division Two, we want to assemble a team that will compete not just to add numbers. So the tournament will give us an insight on where we are plus the coaches will be trying new players that want to join the team, said Ncube.\n\nNust FC head coach Lima Khabo said: Its true tomorrow we will be participating in the tournament with other winners from the Division 2 Leagues. On January 6 we started our training with also one week long trials to accommodate outsiders.\n\nWe managed to select about 10 and they will blend with the other guys. The tournament will give us a good reflection of how to see the way we will manage with other teams in the upcoming season. It will help us a lot,saidKhabo.\n\n",

            "content": "Leonard Ncube ,[emailprotected]\n\nThe newly formed Lift African Woman Up Foundation will this Saturday hold a special session for the first time in Victoria Falls to empower women and girls in conflict management and building confidence.\n\nFounded by Mrs Lwazi Mbowa, the founder of Miss Big Matofotofo, the foundation seeks to address challenges faced by women as a result of often-overlooked struggles such as relationships, depression, anxiety, domestic violence, and infidelity.\n\nThe foundation was launched in Bulawayo and is now expanding to Victoria Falls, with three speakers: Ms Mejury Maphosa, Mr Ezra Tshisa Sibanda, and Ms Gertrude Ndlovu, while Mrs Mbowa will be the host. The venue will be Irock Lodge.\n\nThe focus will be on family feuds, conflict management, victim support, managing infidelity, instilling confidence in vulnerable women and girls, and teaching survival skills.\n\nThe theme for the programme is: Lift her up and set her on.\n\nMrs Mbowa said she founded the organisation after attending a workshop where she realised that women were facing numerous challenges, with many lacking the knowledge of how to address them.\n\nThe Saturday event is targeting women, while men can attend to listen, as the focus is on starting by building up women in the home before extending to men.\n\nMrs Mbowa said women should be empowered to handle domestic violence, particularly infidelity by men, and not simply opt out, as most of them end up becoming girlfriends to married men and go through similar traumatising experiences.\n\nThe focus is to uplift every woman because they take responsibility for things that happen in their families. When children get into drugs, this affects women, and sometimes some children are affected by domestic violence at home, which in turn impacts their mothers.\n\nSome children are abused by elderly men who give them money and even infect them with diseases, leaving them as victims, and this affects their mothers. Some men even have girlfriends, and this causes depression in their spouses, who carry the burden. So, we have a speaker who will unpack why men have girlfriends and how women can relate to cheating men other than fighting or giving them love potions, said Mrs Mbowa.\n\nShe said another speaker will address how women can rise up, be smart, and take pride in themselves without confronting the so-called girlfriend.\n\nThe speaker will focus on how women whose husbands are cheating can become independent, find something to do, and stay busy. We want women to know how they can conduct themselves before their husbands, family, children, society, and the girlfriend herself. We will also focus on how depression affects life, and obviously, people will have an opportunity to interact and ask questions, she said.\n\nWe want to uplift women and the girl child so they dont leave their marriages but seek to be educated, employed, and have a strategy to deal with a cheating man because fighting only leads to trouble with the law, and leaving a marriage may see one ending up becoming a girlfriend to another married man.\n\nMrs Mbowa urged women not to live in pretence but to face challenges head-on with respect, peace, and humility.\n\nShe said she and others are also advocating for leniency on behalf of women who get arrested for domestic violence caused by cheating men.\n\n",

As theatre practitioners, we discussed how important basic first aid training is for communities in line with lifes emergencies. We realised that we could use the power of theatre to engage and empower communities while teaching first aid, said Mnkandla.\n\nThe project will share the importance of immediate, informed action during accidents or health crises. Through interactive theatre performances, Fatal will depict real-life scenarios requiring urgent medical intervention and teach audiences how to administer first aid effectively while waiting for professional help.\n\nThese performances, developed and enacted by trained community youth, will cover common emergencies like road accidents, snake bites, choking, burns, and fainting, Mnkandla explained.\n\nThe aim is to ensure people know how to act in an emergency situation.\n\nIn addition to teaching first aid, Fatal seeks to challenge misconceptions about first aid and integrate culturally relevant narratives to resonate with local communities.\n\nThe use of theatre as an edutainment tool makes the message not only informative but memorable, using storytelling to create a lasting impact, he added.\n\nGanja Mnkandla, a creative entrepreneur with a disability, brings a wealth of experience to the project. His journey in the arts began in school drama and later evolved into community theatre, where he became the founding director of the nationally acclaimed Zalabantu Theatre Arts. He also played a key role in the production of 1983-The Dark Years, which was nominated for Outstanding Theatre Production at the 2019 National Arts Merit Awards (Nama). Mnkandla is also a professional filmmaker trained at the Zimbabwe Film and Television School of Southern Africa. His notable work includes the short film Nompilo and the 13-episode documentary series Ezenkosi, funded by the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe.\n\nAdditionally, Mnkandla holds a certificate in basic industrial first aid training from the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society. His versatility as an artist, both behind and in front of the camera, enriches the Fatal project with his passion for storytelling and dedication to community empowerment.\n\n Follow on X: @mthabisi_mthire\n\n",
