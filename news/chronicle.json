The agents arrived in Victoria Falls on Friday, with their travel facilitated by Qatar Airways, Thompsons Africa, and Gateway Singapore.\n\nThe agents were expected to visit the Victoria Falls National Park to tour the Rainforest and sample local cuisines and culture at the Boma Dinner and Drum Show. They were also scheduled to tour hotels and lodges to better understand what the countrys prime destination has to offer.The ZTA said the Asian market is highly lucrative, with Hong Kongs outbound tourism market for 2025 estimated at $863.2 million.\n\nThis visit underscores the growing appeal of Zimbabwe as a destination for both traditional and new markets.

I take the word woman to mean a worker, an organiser, a mother, one who aids or empowers others, and a nurse who nurtures the community. We represent the community.\n\nIf we look in the Constitution there are sections that empower us such as Section 80 and Section 71. however, we have fewer women in political or top positions because we dont support ourselves. Dont wait to be handpicked, advance yourselves and fill up the space, she said.\n\nShe said there is no law that takes away womens rights.\n\nDuring discussions, issues of child custody and property rights became topical as women claimed lack of equal rights.\n\nMrs Daka-Mungombe said: Lets unite as women. Women should be pro-active and take up opportunities.\n\nCity of Victoria Falls acting director of Spatial Planing Ms Ntombizami Ncube encouraged women to take up their rights especially on property issues as she reiterated that they should be pro-active.She was responding to concerns that most women have limited access to housing stands which is given to men.\n\nCouncil has a policy that says a family should benefit not more than once on housing stands so that everyone gets a stand since we have no land. So women should be pro-active and make sure on those stands we apply for our names are there, she said.\n\nPathways was founded by Mr Trymore Ndolo and his partner Lisa.\n\nHe said the organisation focuses on women empowerment and girl child support.\n\nHe said the organisation has rolled out several projects including sewing, borehole drilling and nutritional gardens in the greater Victoria Falls environs.\n\nWe have drilled and installed solar to about 25 boreholes, including upgrading some old handpump ones, where communities are now doing nutritional gardening and fish farming. These are projects literally brought by the girl child to the community because that is where our focus is, said Mr Ndolo.\n\nEvery woman and girl who attended was handed a menstrual cup, a new method of addressing menstrual cycle issues. Pathways is distributing the menstrual cups and targets to distribute 10 000 of them to women and girls.\n\nThe organisation which employs a group of women tailors, has been making and distributing reusable sanitary pads which are distributed to schools in Hwange and Binga, while slowly making inroads into the whole of Matabeleland north.\n\n",
