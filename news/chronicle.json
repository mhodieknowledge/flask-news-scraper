A disproportionate number of these infections were among women aged 2039, highlighting a concerning trend in this demographic.\n\nIn 2023, 2 527 individuals were tested for HIV, leading to 157 new positive cases, with the majority of infections recorded in young women aged 2029. In contrast, data from January to November 2024 indicates that 2 708 individuals were tested, resulting in 130 new infections, with most cases affecting women aged 3039.This represents a decline in new infections from 6,2 percent in 2023 to 4,8percent in 2024, even as the number of individuals tested increased by 7,16 percent.\n\nHowever, the hospital has observed a decrease in the number of patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). In 2023, there were 3,960 patients on ART, but this number dropped to 3,864 by November 2024.The decline in ART numbers could be attributed to patients lost to follow-up, deaths, or transfers, said Miss Samukeliso Moyo, the Health Information Assistant for Plumtree District Hospital. She also noted that a newly established clinic at Izimnyama opened in August 2023, might help address some of these issues by improving accessibility.\n\nThe data highlights the need for targeted interventions to address the high prevalence of HIV among young women in Plumtree and to ensure sustained ART coverage for all affected individuals.\n\n",

            "content": "Online Writer\n\nTHE City of Bulawayo is battling significant challenges in waste management, including vehicle shortages, landfill hazards, and by-law enforcement issues, as highlighted during the November 2024 council meeting, contained in the latest council report.\n\nCouncillors and officials outlined a series of logistical and environmental issues requiring urgent attention to safeguard public health and maintain the citys reputation for cleanliness.\n\nA report tabled during the meeting revealed that only half of the citys 16 refuse trucks are operational, while the other half are out of service. The lone skip hauler, critical for managing high-volume waste areas, remains non-functional, alongside other vital machinery such as tipper trucks.\n\nThese shortages are severely affecting service delivery, noted the Director of Health Services Dr Edwin Mzingwane. Efforts are underway to assemble our own skip hauler, but this will not address the immediate challenges of waste accumulation in high-demand areas.\n\nCouncillor S. Moyo expressed frustration over the lack of progress: High-volume areas no longer have skip bins, and residents are resorting to illegal dumping. This is unacceptable for a city like Bulawayo, which prides itself on cleanliness.\n\nThe Trenance Landfill site, which has been plagued by recurring fires, is posing serious health hazards for nearby residents. Councillor A.R. Moyo raised the alarm during the meeting: The smoke from these fires is affecting the surrounding communities. This is a health disaster waiting to happen.\n\nCllr Moyo proposed innovative solutions to mitigate the risks. The only sustainable way forward is waste-to-energy generation, he said. Relocating the landfill is not an option as it would cost over US$1.8 million. Instead, maintaining the current site and procuring equipment for US$950,000 is more feasible.\n\nThe Director of Health Services added that improved recycling could significantly reduce waste going to the landfill. Currently, only 5 percent of waste is being recycled, yet this could dramatically decrease the volume of waste and reduce fire risks, he said.\n\nStaff shortages in the Central Business District (CBD) have also been blamed for worsening waste management. We currently have only two cleansing supervisors for the entire CBD, said the Dr Mzingwane. This is clearly insufficient.\n\nCllr Moyo praised the citys enforcement of anti-littering by-laws but pointed out obstacles. Political interference is making enforcement difficult, she said. We need a stronger presence on the ground and more support from stakeholders to address lawlessness.\n\nThe council confirmed that it is recruiting security guards to enhance by-law enforcement, with training expected to begin later this month.\n\nA consultative meeting involving stakeholders is planned for January 2025 to address landfill management and explore waste-to-energy partnerships. For these initiatives to succeed, we need partners, Cllr Moyo said.\n\nIn the interim, the council has approached the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) to expedite the hiring of equipment. Additionally, skip bins will be reinstated in high-demand areas, particularly as waste levels increase during the farm produce season.\n\nWhile Bulawayos leadership remains committed to addressing these challenges, councillors stressed the need for swift action. If we do not invest in adequate machinery and enforce our by-laws more effectively, these problems will only escalate, Cllr Moyo warned.\n\nWith solutions such as recycling, waste-to-energy initiatives, and enhanced enforcement, Bulawayo has the opportunity to set a benchmark for sustainable urban waste management in Zimbabwe. However, success will depend on timely implementation and collective effort.\n\n",

            "content": "Sikhumbuzo Moyo,[emailprotected]\n\nShocked to be discharged with a baby girl after giving birth to a boy via Caesarean section, a new mother from Bulawayos Cowdray Park suburb confirmed her suspicions through DNA testing about a month later.\n\nThe incident happened at United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) where the mother, who cannot be named due to ethical concerns, was discharged with a baby girl whose parents had already travelled to Esigodini in Matabeleland South with her son.\n\nThe testing, which cost a considerable US$220, was conducted at a laboratory in Bulawayos city centre to prove that the child given to the insistent mother by a maternity nurse at the hospital was not her biological offspring.\n\nThe day before the birth, she underwent a scan which confirmed she was expecting a boy. After the delivery, a nurse took the child for cleaning and returned it to the mother.\n\nThe mother, who had been taking photographs of her son, noticed the babys identification tag indicated it was a girl, said the source close to the woman, who lives in Cowdray Park.\n\nInitially unaware of the discrepancy, the new mother immediately alerted the nurse, expressing her concern. However, the nurse dismissed her concerns, suggesting that the effects of the anaesthesia for the Caesarean section might have clouded her judgment.\n\nAccording to the source, another expectant mother had been admitted to the ward just fifteen minutes before the operation, but she had already been discharged by the time the alert mother raised the alarm.\n\nShe contacted her relatives to inform them of the situation. Her uncle suggested DNA testing, but the nurse vehemently opposed the idea, claiming it was too expensive and unaffordable for the family. However, the uncle insisted, and they proceeded with the testing at a laboratory in the Bulawayo city centre. The results unequivocally confirmed that the baby girl was not her biological child.\n\nFurious, the family returned to the hospital, demanding answers and demanding the return of their biological son. Hospital staff were compelled to locate the other mother, who resided in Esigodini, Umzingwane District.\n\nA hospital vehicle was dispatched to retrieve her.However, the womans husband was unco-operative, adamantly insisting that the child was his.The police were subsequently involved, and the couple was brought to Bulawayo.\n\nAt the insistence of the aggrieved family, the hospital engaged the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) for DNA testing. The results unequivocally confirmed that the two babies had been exchanged.\n\nZephania Dlamini, head of the Applied Genetics Testing Centre at Nust, confirmed this shocking discovery.In the Bulawayo cases, two women who were in the same ward at UBH delivered around the same time.\n\nThe complainant asserted that her child was a boy, but when it was returned after cleaning, she was given a girl.Dlamini further said that when confronted with the discrepancy, the other mother adamantly insisted that her child was indeed a boy, a claim vehemently supported by her husband.\n\nHe even insisted that the ultrasound scan had confirmed the sex of the child as male. Before approaching Nust, the complainant had sought testing at Global DNA lab in the city centre, which confirmed that the baby girl was not hers.Our results corroborated these findings. Subsequent testing on the couple claiming to be the parents of the boy yielded negative results, while the boys DNA matched that of the complainant, and the girls DNA matched that of the other woman, said Dlamini.\n\nDr William Busumani\n\nDlamini revealed that the entire hospital administration was present at the laboratory during the testing process. UBH chief medical officer, William Busumani, declined to comment on the incident.\n\nWe do not discuss patient information, he stated.Maphios Siamuchembu, Provincial Medical Director for Bulawayo Metropolitan Province, said he was not aware of any reports of baby swapping from UBH.\n\nRenowned medical expert, Solwayo Ngwenya, described baby-swapping errors as tragic but avoidable with proper diligence.Receiving a child who is not your own is a devastating experience, particularly from a cultural perspective. In private medical practice, staff are rigorously trained to prevent such occurrences, and the lower volume of deliveries facilitates closer monitoring. We strive to ensure such errors never occur in private healthcare settings, as they would severely damage the institutions reputation, said Ngwenya.\n\nProfessor Solwayo Ngwenya\n\nHe stressed the importance of rigorous procedures in ensuring that each newborn is correctly identified and returned to their biological mother.\n\nImmediately after birth, each baby should be assigned a unique identification tag. This, combined with meticulous attention to detail and adherence to established protocols, is crucial in preventing these tragic errors.\n\nThere are likely many individuals who have been unknowingly raised by parents who are not their biological parents due to similar incidents. These individuals may have grown up in entirely different environments, speaking different languages, leading to profound and unforeseen consequences.\n\nNgwenya urged healthcare institutions to prioritise staff training on the importance of accurate newborn identification.These tragic incidents are entirely preventable. By adhering to strict protocols and maintaining a vigilant approach, we can ensure that such errors do not occur, Ngwenya stressed.\n\nThe case raises serious concerns about the potential for similar incidents to have occurred undetected, particularly among families who may not have the financial resources to pursue DNA testing.\n\nRichard Ndebele, a cultural expert, said that baby swapping was unheard of in the past due to the traditional system of village midwives.\n\nThose involved in such an act must be prepared to face the consequences, as misfortune may befall both the child and themselves. The child may experience difficulties throughout their life, and the perpetrators may face the wrath of their ancestors, Ndebele warned.\n\nHe further explained that traditional birth rites cannot be effectively performed for a child who is not biologically related to the family, as the ancestors would not recognise the child.\n\nThere can be no righteousness in such an act of deception. You may deceive mortal beings, but the ancestors will be aware of your actions, and any rituals performed will be rendered meaningless.\n\nMargaret Makumbe, a retired nurse with a distinguished career spanning four decades and delivering over 10 000 babies, stressed the unwavering commitment to excellence that characterised her profession.\n\nShe highlighted the paramount importance of meticulous attention to detail, a skill that every nurse and supervisor had to master to prevent any medical errors, such as the tragic case of a mother being mistakenly given the wrong baby.\n\nIn my entire career, I never experienced that wherever I was deployed, neither did I hear of it anywhere else and I think this was because we did what we did out of love. I just wonder how such a mistake can happen because once a baby is delivered the mother is shown the child before its taken away for cleaning with a name tag already strapped on the wrist, said Makumbe who at one time while at Mpilo delivered an incredible 15 babies in a single night.\n\n",

In a display of both love and remarkable bravery, Alois publicly proposed to Siphilisiwe at her workplace at So Sweet in Bulawayo on December 28.\n\nWitnessing the heartfelt moment were her superiors. Alois, aware of the potential for public rejection that often goes viral on social media, meticulously planned this special moment over two weeks, aiming for a truly unforgettable and cherished experience.\n\nTheir love story began six years prior, on December 28, 2018, within the sacred walls of their church. While their journey together has not been without its challenges, their unwavering love has endured.\n\nSiphilisiwe Mangena and Alois Mutambu on the day he proposed\n\nOver the past five years, I have been nurturing the woman I wish to spend the rest of my life with. We faced numerous obstacles, with many disapproving of our relationship, said Alois.\n\nSiphilisiwe echoed his sentiments, revealing that their bond blossomed from friendship.\n\nI first met my fianc in early 2018 at church. Back then, he was just another face in the crowd, and I paid him little attention. Every girl seemed infatuated with him, but I couldnt see what they saw in him. I wasnt particularly interested in dating at the time.\n\nThen, one of his friends introduced us, and we began to converse. Our friendship deepened, and eventually, he expressed his interest in me. Thats when I started to understand the appeal he held for others. It was on December 26 that he asked me out, and I agreed to a date on the 28th. He was my first boyfriend, she recounted.\n\nWith the help of Siphilisiwes boss, her uncle, and Aloiss brother, a beautiful surprise was orchestrated. Siphilisiwe vividly recalls the day.\n\nAlois informed me that he had an event to MC, so he needed to look his best. I assisted him in selecting shoes and an outfit, you know, the usual preparations. He told me the event was on December 28 and that I should also prepare myself. He wanted me to accompany him. So, I ensured I looked my best. On the day, I was at work  Im a barista at So Sweet Coffee Shop.\n\nWe finished work, but we were instructed to stay for a meeting with the boss, even though no meeting was scheduled. I was becoming impatient, eager to join my boyfriend. Suddenly, my uncle and a friend arrived at the workplace. I bombarded them with questions, and then I saw Alois enter, looking dapper, though there was something slightly off about his demeanour.\n\nSiphilisiwe said that despite the unexpected nature of the proposal, which left her speechless, she never hesitated in her response.\n\nHe presented me with roses, and before I could even react, he was kneeling. I was completely taken aback. I didnt know what to say, and when I saw the red box, I was simply staring at him, unable to utter a word until everyone started shouting yes! And there I was, saying yes before he even asked.\n\nI didnt feel nervous or pressured because Im accustomed to being in the spotlight  I sing in church. However, in that moment, I felt completely frozen.\n\nSiphilisiwe beamed as she described the ring.\n\nSiphilisiwe Mangena stunned\n\nI adore everything about it. It reflects my personality, exuding elegance and maturity. Im completely smitten with it. The amusing part is that it fit perfectly. This proposal holds immense significance for me because it marked our fifth anniversary. He has been an incredible partner throughout these years, making me feel cherished and valued.\n\nThe fact that he chose my workplace, the place where I pour my heart and soul into my work, to create this unforgettable memory makes it even more special. This proposal has positively impacted our relationship. We now command greater respect from those around us and have grown even closer. Being engaged is the most incredible feeling. If I feel this way now, I can only imagine how Ill feel on my wedding day.\n\nAlois acknowledged that proposing in public was a daunting prospect, filled with uncertainty about the outcome. He also faced financial challenges but persevered.\n\nAs the moment approached, my foot was tapping nervously, and my mind was racing. I was constantly wondering if it would go well, and my heart was pounding. When I knelt down, my mind went blank for a moment as I tried to gauge her reaction.\n\nI remember calling my brother to discuss my plan to propose to her at her workplace. He advised me to speak with her boss and explain my intentions, as a sign of respect for my partner. The entire planning process took two weeks. The most challenging aspect was when I lost the money I had saved for the event. However, by the grace of God, I was able to recover it, and everything went according to plan.\n\nI received invaluable support from my friends, and her boss was incredibly helpful. Even my pastors stood by me. The event was a complete surprise, and I am grateful to everyone for keeping it a secret.\n\nHe shared his thoughts on his partner and their relationship.\n\nMy partner is someone I can trust and rely on completely. She embodies 90 percent of the qualities I desire in a woman. No one is perfect, but I feel safe with her. My favourite moments are those early days of our relationship  you know how girls are when a relationship is new, those moments are priceless.\n\nWe are praying for Gods guidance and alignment with His plan. As the scripture says, For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord. My partner is honest, respectful, empathetic, courageous, responsible, kind, humble, confident, hardworking, and a woman of prayer, he said.\n\nAlois further expressed his apprehension leading up to the proposal.\n\nThe thought of being rejected was nerve-wracking. I experienced moments of anxiety, constantly praying for a positive response. Thankfully, she said yes before I could even utter the words, and it was a dream come true.\n\nAlois voiced his gratitude to the individuals who have been pillars of support throughout their journey:\n\nI am deeply grateful to my pastors, Keith Bhehane and Talent Bhehane of Rhema Word Ministries. They have provided us with unwavering support, along with all our friends who came to celebrate with us. And, of course, my family  they are the best team ever.\n\nHe concluded by sharing that plans for the traditional bride price and a grand wedding are currently underway.\n\n",

            "content": "During the past few days the country has witnessed a new culture of opposition politics that respects and advances the countrys interests as opposed to being stooges of the West. This is as it should be because members of opposition political parties are Zimbabweans first and foremost hence should work for Zimbabwes development and prosperity.\n\nZimbabweans should have a shared vision when it comes to national interests regardless of ones political affiliation. The engagement between the ruling party Zanu-PF and opposition political parties is very commendable as it is meant to promote the countrys development.\n\nThe ruling party and opposition Members of Parliament should be guided by what is in the best interest of Zimbabweans because they were elected into office to serve all citizens.\n\nDelegates at the Zanu-PF Gwanda inter-district party meeting\n\nWe totally agree with the interim secretary-general of the Citizen Coalition for Change (CCC), Senator Sengezo Tshabangu that engaging the ruling party Zanu-PF does not only enhance democracy but also promotes national development. Sen Tshabangu who is also the leader of the opposition in Parliament, dismissed claims that engaging the ruling party was tantamount to betrayal.\n\nIt is certainly strange reasoning to suggest that an opposition party which engages the ruling party is selling out, said Mr Tshabangu.\n\nIn the past the opposition political parties were criticised for their penchant for confrontation and violence which caused destruction. The situation has completely changed now, much to the chagrin of the countrys detractors.\n\nPresident Mnangaggwa has said the opposition legislators must give their ruling party counterparts a hard time in Parliament to build and develop Zimbabwe.\n\nHe said the ruling party MPs must be made to account so that they deliver for the general citizenry. The developments witnessed during the past few days confirm that the opposition political parties now realise that they have an obligation to contribute to the social and economic development of the country and this is very encouraging.\n\nZimbabwe is endowed with abundant natural resources that can make a difference and what is required is for citizens to unite and exploit these resources regardless of their political persuasions.\n\nIt is therefore incumbent upon each and every Zimbabwean to act responsibly and refuse to be used by the countrys detractors to disturb peace, a prerequisite for economic development.\n\n",
