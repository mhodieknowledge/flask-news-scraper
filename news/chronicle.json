Transport operators continued to ply their routes without disruption and the city centre was a hive of activity in the afternoon.\n\nEarlier in the morning, Tshova Mubaiwa Transport Co-operative chief executive officer, Mr Ndaba Masunda, reassured commuters that there would be no interruption in transport services.\n\nWe did not withdraw our vehicles, we are operating normally as per our timetable and routes. We have no reason to ground our fleet, said Mr Masunda.\n\nA Chronicle news crew visited western suburbs to assess the situation and observed residents going about their daily routines undisturbed. In Cowdray Park, vendors set up their stalls at designated sites around 10AM, resuming their trade without incident.\n\nI wasnt sure what to expect in the morning, especially after what happened last time when shops were looted and cars were burnt. But after seeing that the situation was calm and the police were out in full force, I came to my stall, and its business as usual, said a vendor at the terminus site.\n\nAt Entumbane, Sai Mart Supermarket opened at its usual opening time, serving customers without interruption. Similarly, in Mpopoma, near the Western Commonage Magistrates Court, vendors and shops were fully operational. A similar atmosphere was observed at New Lobengula and the popular koChigumira Shopping Centre in Luveve, where businesses opened their doors to customers. In the city centre, big supermarkets, including OK Zimbabwe, Pick n Pay and Greens were open throughout the day.\n\nIn the Midlands Province, a peaceful atmosphere prevailed in Gweru as residents ignored calls for protests. Minister of State for Midlands Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Owen Ncube, later addressed the media, saying the planned demonstrations had failed to materialise.\n\nI have checked the situation and all districts have reported that its peaceful and people are going about their business,he said.\n\nMinister Ncube said the agenda of the countrys detractors who are calling for the demonstrations, is to disturb the prevailing peace and tranquility that the country is enjoying.\n\nOur people, who have a well-documented history of fighting colonialism know the value of peace and will never be part of this subversive agenda, he said.\n\nMinister Ncube said they will continue to stand with President Mnangagwa to lead the country adding that any attempts to remove a constitutionally elected Government is an insurrection and will be regarded as subversion.\n\nI therefore urge the entire Midlands community including business, public and private sector workers, residents, church fraternity, vendors and civic society to ignore the calls from these misguided individuals who want to destabilise the country, he said.\n\nMinister Ncube said Zimbabwe in general and the Midlands Province in particular, remains united, resolute in support of President Mnangagwas leadership.\n\nIt is, therefore, business as usual here in the Midlands province. Our security sector is on high alert and will deal decisively with any malcontents bent on undermining security, peace and tranquillity being enjoyed by our law-abiding citizens, he said.\n\nIn small towns such as Tsholotsho the shops and other businesses were open.\n\nMr Melusi Ndebele, who runs a lodge and a grocery shop at the business centre, said it was business as usual.\n\nThings are normal here, there was a slow start but shops are open, said Mr Ndebele.Police also issued a statement in the morning urging citizens to go about their normal business as their safety was not only assured but guaranteed.\n\nAt the weekend, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Dr Jenfan Muswere urged Zimbabweans to go about their business saying law-enforcement agents were on high alert to guarantee security and ensure peace across the country.\n\nHe urged Zimbabweans to ignore calls for protests that are being made by cyber terrorists and fanned through social media, saying the countrys security sector is well-equipped to deal with any mischief.\n\n",

Some transport operators also withdrew their vehicles from the road, fearing they could be attacked by hooligans who take advantage of such demonstrations.\n\nWe want at this juncture to commend Zimbabweans who have refused to be used by selfish individuals who relish to see chaos in this country.\n\nIt has been proved in the past that such senseless demonstrations worsen the peoples plight and it is encouraging that citizens now realise this. Those who are usually hit hard by such demonstrations are businesspersons whose properties are damaged and vendors whose stalls are destroyed and wares looted.\n\nZimbabwe is not a doomed or failed state as alleged by the organisers of yesterdays failed demonstrations. It is a fact that Zimbabwe is endowed with abundant natural resources that can make a difference but this is only possible if investors are confident that their investments are secure.\n\nIt is therefore incumbent upon each and every Zimbabwean to act responsibly and refuse to be used by the countrys detractors to disturb peace, a prerequisite for economic development.\n\nLaw enforcement agents should continue to be on alert, to ensure peace prevails across the country.

            "content": "Mbulelo Mpofu,Zimpapers Arts and Entertainment Hub\n\nJust when it seemed that the heated debate surrounding the US$150 cover band tariff imposed by the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (Zimura) had settled following a recent dialogue, new developments have reignited tensions.\n\nThe National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) intervened yesterday, calling for the suspension of the contentious fee, but Zimura remains resolute in its stance.\n\nThis dispute stems from Zimuras decision to impose a US$150 licensing fee per show for cover bands, a sharp increase from the previous annual fee of US$50. This move comes despite a meeting two weeks ago that brought together key stakeholders, including representatives from NACZ, Zimura, academics, associations, unions, composers, cover band leaders and intellectual property beneficiaries. Discussions focused on establishing a fair and sustainable tariff structure for cover bands operating in Zimbabwe.\n\nAccording to NACZ, following lobbying from various music institutions addressing concerns over Zimuras proposed tariff, NACZ facilitated what seemed like a productive dialogue with Zimura and other music industry stakeholders. Following the meeting, NACZ expressed satisfaction with the progress and stated that Zimura had shown a willingness to reconsider the fee structure if proper lobbying processes were followed, including direct engagement with composers whose music is performed by cover bands.\n\nLast week, on March 27, NACZ followed this up with a meeting with representatives of copyright holders, who strongly expressed their views on the matter and challenged both NACZ and Zimura to arrive at a solution that holistically protects their rights, ensures copyright infringement is taken seriously and guarantees fair compensation.\n\nThe conclusion was that, at the wider consultation, users of copyrights would be adequately educated on the sanctity of copyrights and their views would be respected. They believe the $150 tariff should be the entry level, and Zimura should charge more for bigger concerts.\n\nNACZ said they had shared with Zimura their intention to invite rights users for this engagement before convening a broader dialogue forum.\n\nHowever, in an unexpected turn of events, Zimura issued a public notice on Friday, reaffirming its stance.\n\nEffective immediately, all performers and organisers must obtain the necessary licences before staging any event featuring protected musical works, Zimura communicated on their social media platforms.\n\nThey also warned they would be conducting nationwide monitoring in collaboration with law enforcement agencies, with legal action against those found violating copyright regulations.\n\nIn response, through a statement issued on Monday, March 31, NACZ executive director Napoleon Nyanhi, criticised the tariff, labelling it punitive. He raised concerns over its implementation process, the change in licence periods and its deviation from international best practices.\n\nNapoleon Napster Nyanhi\n\nFollowing this, NACZ suspended all directives regarding the US$150 tariff, pending further discussions and negotiations.\n\n. . . All directives for payment of the $150 tariff are suspended immediately, pending the conclusion of the registration, dialogue and negotiation processes, Nyanhi said in the statement.\n\nHe also directed Zimura to regularise its registration with NACZ as an arts association.\n\nWe direct that the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association regularises its registration with the NACZ as an arts association, in line with the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe Act Chapter 25:07, read in conjunction with section fourof Statutory Instrument 87 of 2006.\n\nThe National Arts Council of Zimbabwe takes seriously its mandate to foster, develop, and improve the knowledge, understanding, and practice of the arts in Zimbabwe, concluded Nyanhi in the statement.\n\nIn response, Zimbabwe Musicians Union (Zimu) founding president, Edith WeUtonga Katiji, welcomed NACZs intervention.\n\nWe are grateful for this stance by NACZ. It reinforces our concerns about Zimuras mismanagement. In the coming weeks, the real issues surrounding Zimura must be exposed in the best interests of the Zimbabwean music sector. They have acted in bad faith, and this must stop, she said.\n\nHowever, Zimuras executive director, Polisile Ncube-Chimhini, dismissed NACZs position, asserting that Zimura is not legally obligated to register with NACZ.\n\nThe NACZs press statement has no bearing on us. We are not an arts organisation; we are a royalty-collecting body registered under the Companies and Intellectual Property Office of Zimbabwe (CIPZ), a department within the Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs.\n\nWe do not report to the Ministry of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture.\n\nIn apparent response to Nyanhis claim that Zimura had been engaged regarding the meeting with rightsholders, Ncube-Chimhini said: We were not engaged in any discussions  NACZ simply posted their statement on social media. This holds no legal weight for us. We see this as more of a rant than a directive, she said.\n\nZimuras Board echoed this stance, stating that NACZ had misrepresented the legal requirements governing the organisation.\n\nZimura has operated for 43 years without NACZ registration because it has never been a statutory requirement. We are not obligated to register under two separate Acts of Parliament, the board asserted in a statement.\n\nAs NACZ attempts to mediate the issue, striking a balance between protecting copyright holders and fostering artistic growth remains a challenge. The suspension of the US$150 tariff marks a pivotal moment, but the broader conversation is far from over.\n\nNyanhi appealed for patience and professionalism in discussions surrounding the matter.\n\nWe urge restraint and civility on social media and in all engagements while we work to ensure the intellectual property of musicians is protected and fairly compensated.\n\nZimbabwes music industry is at a crossroads and with neither party willing to back down, the licensing debate continues to unfold with new twists and turns.  @MbuleloMpofu\n\n",

Some suburbs are now going for weeks without water and the situation is even worse for those residents in high-lying areas that have gone for months without water.\n\nA Chronicle news crew yesterday visited selected suburbs in the western areas and observed long winding queues of residents fetching water at boreholes and wells.\n\nResidents could be seen pushing wheel barrows and pushcarts laden with water containers.In Pumula East, some residents were fetching water from unprotected sources such as puddles in swampy areas while some women were spotted washing clothes using water from shallow wells they had just dug in the same area.\n\nOne of the residents in Cowdray Park, Mr Gerald Siziba, said their normal water rationing schedule has been interrupted for the past two weeks and were now receiving water for less than three hours per week.\n\nWe normally start receiving water on Wednesday evening up until Saturday morning. However, in the last two weeks, water has been coming once a week for less than three hours, he said.\n\nIn Sizinda suburb, Mr John Banda described the situation as unbearable.\n\nWe are spending hours chasing water bowsers or digging into our pockets to buy water from vendors. Our area has not received water since last year, he said.\n\nMr Banda said they had been told that they were in a high-lying area hence they had gone for months without water yet residents in other parts of Sizinda were receiving water. Residents said due to the prevailing water crisis, they were using the bush to relieve themselves, which was a health risk.\n\nOur taps have been dry since last week and it appears council is no longer following the water shedding schedule. We have now resorted to these fountains although the water is not safe for drinking, said Ms Priscilla Moyo of Pumula East.\n\nMrs Betty Moyo (68) of Pumula North said she is forced to travel about 5km daily to fetch water from the unprotected sources.\n\nI wake up as early as 4AM and walk all the way to either Pumula East or Pumula South to fetch water from the fountains. The water is dirty but we have no choice because we are not getting municipal water, she said.A Mabutweni resident, Ms Linda Khumalo, said their taps have been dry for weeks.\n\nWhen the water comes, the pressure is very low, you can hardly fill a bucket.\n\nSome residents have resorted to fetching water from unprotected sources such as open wells, she said.In Mpopoma, residents said water comes on Thursdays until Saturday.\n\nThis past week our schedule was not interrupted because we had water until Saturday, said a resident who declined to be named.\n\nBarbourfields has also been largely spared, with residents saying there has been minimal disruptions.In a notice issued yesterday, Bulawayo Town Clerk Mr Christopher Dube confirmed that repairs of the Umzingwane raw water pipeline were completed last week but the Sulzer pump remains out of service, leaving the city operating at just 50 percent capacity.\n\nThe city is facing significant water supply challenges attributed to the aging and dilapidated condition of its bulk water infrastructure.\n\nDue to the infrastructures frequent breakdowns, residents are continuing to experience erratic water supply interruptions, he said.\n\nMr Dube said the repairs on the Umzingwane raw water pipeline at Mzinyathi were completed last Thursday.\n\nThe Sulzer raw water pump repairs are still outstanding. At the moment, the city is working on mobilising materials which are essential to repair the Sulzer raw water pump, he said.\n\nMr Dube said the Sulzer raw water pump failure adversely affects the pumping capacity and ultimate raw water delivery to the city at Criterion, Burnside.\n\nDaily delivery has been reduced by 48 mega litres per day. Currently, one pump-set has been running delivering about 56 mega litres. The city is pumping half capacity in terms of raw water delivery, he said.\n\nMr Dube said residents will continue to face supply interruptions in all residential, industrial and Central Business District (CBD) areas.\n\nHe said the local authority is committed to addressing these infrastructure challenges through timely repairs to ensure a reliable water supply for its residents.  @nyeve14\n\n",

While they may have let slip two points in a heart-wrenching manner, they left with cash in their coffers.\n\nA total of 90 police officers were deployed to manage the game, with two sets of escorts accompanying the teams from their respective lodgings.\n\nHighlanders CEO, Brian Moyo, confirmed the figures and praised the crowd that attended the match, which grossed over US$70000.\n\nIt was a good crowd that we witnessed, said Moyo.\n\nThe Bulawayo City Council, owners of the facility, had every reason to smile, having pocketed US$12 000 from the game. Moyo, however, could not disclose the amounts paid to the PSL, Zifa, the Sport and Recreation Commission, Zimra, private security, ticket checkers, cashiers and the treasurer.\n\nSundays turnout was one of the best at the stadium in recent years, confirming Scottlands stature and impact on the domestic scene. The Harare side had attracted crowds of 7 000 and 8 000 in their opening home fixtures at Rufaro Stadium. Bulawayo was to be the litmus test, and they passed it with a determined performance in front of a vociferous home crowd that exceeded expectations, demonstrating remarkable discipline despite three controversial decisions, including a penalty call that the referee and his assistant did not make.\n\nHighlanders will consider themselves lucky that their goalkeeper, who struggled with aerial balls all afternoon, survived with just a yellow card after a dangerous lunge at an opponent in the second half.\n\nThe goalkeeper had rushed out of goal early and, in a desperate situation, made a seemingly deliberate and dangerous challenge. Despite his performance, he proved a hero by preventing a goal, as his area remained unguarded. Had he been beaten, Scottland would have scored.\n\nScottlands influence on the local scene received the biggest endorsement when Barbourfields Stadium responded. It wasnt just the numbers on the terraces, but also the quality of the game, the refereeing, and the superb discipline of the fans of both teams.\n\nBarbourfields Stadium\n\nDespite the tension and the heavy expectations of the more than 14 000 (according to media estimates) in attendance, the contest went smoothly.\n\nA draw, in the end, may have been the fairest result.\n\nThe match, which was played in front of the largest crowd of the season in the Premiership, was a hard-fought affair with limited goalmouth action. Most of the build-up play took place in midfield, where Mason Mushore for Highlanders was particularly impressive. For the visitors, Simba Bhoras Tichaona Chipunza stood out as a dominant defensive force, and his partnership with Vassil Kawe in midfield was notable.\n\nWhile the scoreline was disappointing for the Bosso faithful, it was perhaps a fair reflection of two clubs that gave their all in search of victory.\n\nThe atmosphere at the stadium was electric, though the match may not have been quite the spectacle of past games at Barbourfields featuring clubs like AmaZulu, Dynamos, CAPS and Zimbabwe Saints, where the terraces would be ablaze with excitement and breathtaking performances on the field.\n\nKhama Billiats much-anticipated Barbourfields Stadium debut came in the 66th minute with a 24-minute run, but he failed to finish off a cross from the left flank, with the goalkeeper beaten at the far post.\n\nAndrew Mbeba, now wearing the captains armband, created an emotional moment, when his40m free-kick was fumbled by Nelson Chadya under challenge from substitute Nqobile Ndlovu,in the 81st minute.\n\nHowever, in the dying moments, there was appalling goalkeeping from Pitisi, who failed to react to a cross from the right. The ball was headed home by Mthokozisi Msebe, a talent that Highlanders had failed to retain. This marked the third occasion this season that the goalkeeper had been found wanting.\n\nFor the second consecutive match, Highlanders conceded a last-minute equaliser. A fortnight ago, Greenfuel had also scored in the dying seconds, taking advantage of Highlanders defensive lapse.\n\nOverall, the crowd and atmosphere served as an excellent advertisement for the local game.\n\n",

            "content": "Business Writer\n\nPADENGA Holdings agribusiness division, a cornerstone of Zimbabwes luxury exports economy, continues to chart a profitable course despite a maturing crocodile skins market.\n\nWhile the segment remains a significant revenue generator for the diversified mining and agribusiness group, executives are signalling a strategic shift towards cost discipline as global demand softens and competition intensifies.\n\nPadenga Agribusiness (PAB), renowned for its premium Nile crocodile skins, reported a mixed yet resilient performance for 2024. Despite a 40 percent year-on-year slump in skins sold, the division leveraged its niche positioning in high-end markets to drive a 79 percent increase in the average price per centimetre, underscoring the enduring appeal of its top-tier products.\n\nRevenue from skin exports reached US$30,4 million, bolstered by fair value adjustments on biological assets and inventory optimisation.\n\nOur ability to command premium pricing, even in a depressed market, highlights the quality and reputation of our skins, said Padenga Chief Financial Officer Mr Oliver Kamundimu, during the groups annual analyst briefing on Friday. However, we cannot rely on pricing alone to sustain growth.\n\nOperational efficiencies also played a key role, as agribusiness operating costs fell to US$15,4 million (from US$16,6 million in 2023), while capital expenditure surged by 106 percent to US$2,2 million, mainly allocated to breeding infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the luxury skins sector, once a high-growth driver for the company, is now showing signs of saturation.\n\nPost-pandemic inventory gluts, shifting consumer trends, and lacklustre demand from China  a key buyer  have forced PAB to trim production.\n\nSkins harvested in 2024 dropped by eight percent to 46 560, with unsold 2022 stock cleared at discounted rates, last year.\n\nThe days of volume-driven expansion are over, acknowledged chief executive officer Mr Mike Fowler. Were now focused on margin preservation and operational efficiency.\n\nIndustry analysts agree. Padengas crocodile business is entering a maturity phase, said Walter Mandeya, equity analyst at Harare-based Trigrams Investments. Growth will now depend on cost optimisation, not just premium pricing. The luxury markets volatility requires agility.\n\nPadengas 2025 blueprint reveals a clear shift towards austerity, with capital expenditure slashed by 31 percent. Further agribusiness investments will drop to US$1,5 million, prioritising automation and feed efficiency over expansion.\n\nProduction will also be aligned with demand, with annual harvests capped at 45 000 skins to prevent oversupply. Additionally, the company plans to target new tanneries in Europe and Asia to reduce its reliance on traditional luxury buyers.\n\nThe groups mining division, which contributed 86 percent of 2024 revenue, offers valuable lessons. A 20 percent reduction in debt to $56 million and solar energy investments at gold mines highlight a group-wide focus on lean operations  a model that PAB aims to emulate.\n\nLooking ahead, management remains optimistic about the long-term viability of crocodile skins but acknowledges near-term challenges. The 2025 forecast warns of lower average prices as PAB taps broader markets, with luxury demand expected to remain subdued.\n\nYet, Mr Kamundimu strikes a balanced tone: Were confident in our niche, but were not complacent. Our roadmap combines premium quality with ruthless cost discipline.\n\nPadenga Agribusiness stands at a crossroads. Its ability to profit in a maturing market is commendable, but sustaining returns will require more than just premium branding.\n\nAs global luxury consumers pivot towards synthetic alternatives and economic uncertainty persists, PABs success will depend on its ability to do more with less, proving that even in a slowing market, profitability is possible with precision and prudence.\n\n",

            "content": "Nqobile Bhebhe,[emailprotected]\n\nZIMBABWE recorded 1,5 million arrivals in the fourth quarter of 2024, with 70 percent of the traffic consisting of returning residents from abroad, highlighting the countrys strong ties with its diaspora.\n\nThe number of visitors showed a slight decline compared to the same period in 2023, but the increase in returning residents painted a contrasting picture of growth.\n\nVisitors play a vital role in the countrys economy by helping to boost economic activity, create jobs, generate foreign exchange and attract investment, all of which contribute to overall economic development and improved quality of life.\n\nThis is particularly significant for countries like Zimbabwe, where the tourism sector provides substantial employment in hotels, restaurants, transportation, attractions and related industries.\n\nTourist arrivals bring in foreign currency, which is essential for the economy, enabling the country to import goods and services and build up reserves. Additionally, a thriving tourism sector can attract foreign direct investment (FDI) as businesses see opportunities to expand and invest in the industry.\n\nAccording to the Zimbabwe National Statistical Agencys latest migration figures, the country recorded 472 745 visitors from abroad in the period under review, a decrease of about five percent compared to 496 645 visitors during the same period in 2023. While the drop in foreign arrivals is notable, it was overshadowed by the surge in the number of returning residents.\n\nA total of 1 109 320 residents returned from abroad during this period, up from 847 889 in the fourth quarter of 2023, marking an increase of 30,8 percent, the report shows.\n\nAn interesting aspect of the arrivals was the mode of travel chosen by visitors. While the number of business arrivals has decreased, foreign visitors showed a strong preference for road transport over air travel.\n\nIn the period under review, 368 478 visitors to Zimbabwe chose road transport, accounting for arrivals. This represents an increase from 327 688 road arrivals in the same period, in 2023.\n\nThe prominence of road transport as the primary entry point to Zimbabwe is largely due to the countrys strategic location within the Southern African region, with several neighbouring countries using road access to enter Zimbabwe.\n\nThe bulk of road arrivals came through Beitbridge, the countrys busiest border post, which accounted for 103 838 arrivals. Other key road entry points included Victoria Falls (54 369) and Chirundu (45 651), further highlighting the vital role these border posts play in Zimbabwes regional connectivity.\n\nIn contrast, air arrivals saw a marked decrease, with 104 267 visitors flying into the country, representing only 22 percent of total arrivals. This reflects a sharp 38 percent decrease from 168 794 visitors in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAmong those who arrived by air, Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport was the busiest port of entry, handling 52 percent of air arrivals, followed by Victoria Falls Airport (34 percent) and Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport (13 percent).\n\nEconomic analyst, Mr Gilbert Khuzwayo, explained that the preference for road transport reflects both practical and economic factors.\n\nRoad travel is often more affordable and flexible than air travel, especially for visitors coming from neighbouring countries like South Africa, Zambia and Mozambique. For these visitors, overland travel offers a more convenient and cost-effective means of reaching Zimbabwe. Additionally, the regions economic dynamics, such as the ease of cross-border trade, may encourage road-based entry for both business and leisure visitors, he said.\n\nAccording to ZimStat, visitors in the fourth quarter of 2024 came to Zimbabwe for various reasons, with holidays remaining the most common purpose. Approximately 47,4 percent of visitors during this period came for leisure purposes, slightly down from 49,7 percent in 2023. However, the country saw growth in other categories of arrivals, particularly in-transit visitors.\n\nThere was a noticeable increase in in-transit visitors, who numbered 145 483, up 25 percent from 116 204 in the same quarter of 2023. This indicates that Zimbabwe is increasingly being used as a transit point for travellers heading to other destinations in the region or beyond.\n\nOn the other hand, business-related arrivals fell significantly. The number of visitors coming for business purposes dropped by 26 percent, from 118 258 in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 87 536 in 2024.\n\nVisitors arriving for shopping purposes also saw a sharp decrease. There were 13 496 shopping visitors in the quarter ending December 2024, down from 21 904 in the same quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of approximately 38 percent.\n\nHoliday tourism, while still accounting for a significant portion of visitors, also experienced a slight decrease of one percent. The number of holidaymakers dropped from 226 851 in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 223 852 in 2024.\n\n",
