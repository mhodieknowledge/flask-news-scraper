            "content": "Nqobile Bhebhe, Zimpapers Business Hub\n\nGOVERNMENT has stepped up preparations for a successful winter wheat production, by ensuring that critical inputs are delivered to farmers on time.\n\nLast year, the country achieved a record-breaking wheat harvest of 563 961 tonnes, surpassing the previous years 467 000 tonnes.\n\nThis marked the highest wheat yield since the advent of commercial wheat farming in 1966, securing Zimbabwes wheat self-sufficiency for the third consecutive year.\n\nRiding on this momentum, Zimbabwe seeks to leverage the upcoming winter cropping season to further expand output.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the Winter Crop Revolution Conference in Bulawayo, which was hosted by the Zimpapers Group, in partnership with the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water, Fisheries, and Rural Development, chief director in the ministry, Mr Leonard Munamati, said it was critical for the country to adequately prepare.\n\nThe recent record-breaking wheat harvest of 563 961 metric tonnes, surpassing last years 467 000 metric tonnes against the national requirement of 360 000 metric tonnes, is a testament to our commitment to sustainable food production, he said.\n\nThe country has made remarkable strides in winter crop production, securing its place as a formidable agricultural force.\n\nBuilding on this success, the ministry, in collaboration with Zimpapers and other key stakeholders/partners, now seek to expand this achievement to potatoes, barley and other vital winter crops in the upcoming 2025 planting season, he said.\n\nMr Munamati said the consumption basket now largely includes potatoes, essential to Zimbabwes food security, offering nutritious and affordable food nationwide.\n\nAs such, this conference serves as a platform to explore strategies to sustain our successes in wheat production while scaling up the cultivation of potatoes and other winter crops, he said.\n\nOur collective goal is to increase wheat production to 600 000MT this season, by expanding the cultivated area to 120 000ha and improving productivity from 4.7t/ha to 5t/ha.\n\nVarious stakeholders including Arda  estates, irrigation schemes, Joint Ventures banks (AFC, CBZ Agro-Yield, NMB), PIP; self-financed farmers; and FCCA  are playing a crucial role in achieving this milestone.\n\nAdditionally, our Wheat-Based Food Security Strategy aims to meet national wheat demand, generate surplus for export and stablish a strategic wheat reserve of 250 000MT, as approved by the Cabinet.\n\nMr Munamati said on barley production, the country was targeting 6 500ha, with an estimated yield of six tonnes per hectare, translating to 39 000mt.\n\nPotato production is set to cover 8 750ha, with an ambitious yield target of 27t/ha, culminating in 236 250mt.Achieving these production goals requires critical enablers, including reliable power supply, with wheat production clusters ring-fencing 150 megawatts for winter cropping, adequate water resources, with Zinwa ensuring seasonal billing and efficient irrigation management.\n\nAccess to essential inputs, such as high-quality seeds, fertilisers, fuel and mechanisation, financial support, ensuring timely farmer payments and adequate funding for expansion, enhanced security, infrastructure development and land management is critical.\n\nMore importantly, there is need to strengthen partnerships amongst government, farmers, processors, academia, and industry stakeholders, which is the backbone for these enablers.\n\nThrough these partnerships, working together, Zimbabwe is poised to achieve Vision 2030, ensuring food security for every household, everywhere, everyday, said Mr Munamati.\n\nIn his remarks during the conference, Zimpapers Intake Editor in Bulawayo and Acting Principal of the Zimpapers Training Institute, Limukani Ncube, stressed the need for more collaboration, innovation and shared learning.\n\nWe are truly delighted to have such a dedicated group of Government officials, farmers, researchers, agronomists, policymakers, and industry leaders gathered here today, united by a shared commitment to advancing winter crop production, said Ncube.\n\nThis conference is not just an event  its a platform for collaboration, learning, and innovation, he reiterated.Ncube said as Zimbabwe faces increasingly complex climate conditions, shifting market dynamics and mounting pressure on agricultural systems, there is a pressing need to focus on sustainable and high-yield winter cropping strategies.\n\nAs we face evolving climate conditions, market dynamics and growing demands on our agricultural systems, the importance of resilient, productive, and sustainable winter cropping has never been greater, he said.\n\nThe conference explored the latest research, cutting-edge technologies, and practical strategies that are shaping the future of winter crop production in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe one-day conference gathered to a broad cross-section of agricultural stakeholders, including farmers, tertiary institutions, seed companies, agricultural parastatals, and representatives from water and power utilities.\n\nThe gathering sought to strengthen collective understanding of both the challenges and untapped opportunities in Zimbabwes winter cropping sector, with a particular focus on actionable, scalable solutions to enhance productivity and food security.\n\n",

            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza,[emailprotected]\n\nFARMERS in the Mangwe and Bulilima districts involved in a pioneering commercial tobacco farming project, have been given the thumbs up by the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (Timb), in recognition of their work to spread tobacco production across Zimbabwe.\n\nThe initiative, which has spread to several villages in the Matabeleland Province, is now in its second season. In the 2023/24 season, 17 villagers joined the pioneer tobacco production project launched at Syringavale Farm, Marula in Mangwe District.\n\nThe project has now grown to accommodate over 170 farmers, who heeded the call to switch from traditional small grains and maize to commercial tobacco farming.\n\nIn the 2024/25 tobacco season, the project has expanded to villages deep in the Mangwe District, including areas such as Ingwizi and Tshitshi. Additionally, more farmers from the neighbouring Bulilima District have joined the project.\n\nTobacco Industry and Marketing Board\n\nTobacco is predominantly grown in Mashonaland provinces, with only a few farmers involved in the Midlands Province and a sprinkling in the Matabeleland regions, which major in cattle ranching, doing the crop.\n\nTimb said the expansion of tobacco farming beyond the traditional strongholds of Manicaland and the Mashonaland provinces was a potential game-changer in changing the national economic balance.\n\nThe Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (Timb) is proud to announce a significant milestone in the decentralisation of tobacco production in Zimbabwe. For the second consecutive season, tobacco is being successfully grown in Marula, Mangwe District, Matabeleland South, an important step in expanding the crop beyond its traditional strongholds in Manicaland and the Mashonaland provinces.\n\nThis regional expansion is more than a geographical shift, it represents Timbs commitment to inclusive growth, sustainability and national economic balance, said Timb in a statement.\n\nTimb said a local tobacco sales floor that it approved and inspected had been established in Mangwe.Small-scale farmers are currently growing 84 hectares of Natural Cured Virginia (NCV) tobacco under a contract system with Atlas Agri, one of Zimbabwes leading tobacco contractors. The contractor has also established a local tobacco sales floor, which has been inspected and approved by Timb and will facilitate sales this season.\n\nThe establishment of a local tobacco sales floor in the southern region will drastically reduce the distance farmers must travel to market their harvest, lowering costs and increasing access to markets, said Timb.\n\nUnlike traditional Flue-cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco, the one being grown in Marula requires no firewood or coal for curing. Farmers use sunshades and drying racks, which significantly reduce production costs and environmental impact, making the crop a sustainable option.\n\nBy removing the need for curing fuel, the tobacco in Mangwe offers a cost-effective and climate-smart alternative. The tobacco produced still shares the same chemical composition and smoking characteristics as flue-cured tobacco, offering buyers a viable, high-quality product.\n\nTimb is exploring solar-powered borehole systems to improve seedbed irrigation for the 2025/26 season. With proper infrastructure, training and support, Timb said, Matabeleland South Province had the potential to become a force to be reckoned with in Zimbabwes tobacco industry.\n\nUnder Timbs Tobacco Value Chain Transformation Plan, which aims to grow national production to 300 million kilogrammes by 2025, tobacco farming in the southern region is key to meeting the target. As of April 16, the country had sold 81 million kilogrammes of tobacco worth US$279 million, averaging US$3.43 per kg, against a target of 280 million kilogrammes.\n\nWomen make up the majority of local farmers, who are part of the tobacco revolution in Mangwe and Bulilima districts. One such female farmer is Mrs Ellen Sibanda, a first-time tobacco farmer at Greenfield Farm, who planted half a hectare for a start.\n\nI started planting on December 17, 2024 and in a week, I had planted 8 300 plants, although the figure fell short of my target of over 9 000 plants. Tobacco farming is hard, but together with the one employee that I hired, we persevered and finished planting on time as advised by Mr Rodrick Musiiwa, Mrs Sibanda told Chronicle two months ago.\n\nMr Musiiwa is a tobacco specialist, who has been leading the tobacco revolution in Mangwe and Bulilima since the inception of the pioneer project two years ago.\n\nAnother farmer, Mrs Sibonele Mathe, planted 14 900 tobacco plants on one hectare and is confident she will reap the rich pickings of the cash crop.\n\nIm a first-time tobacco farmer and I was inspired to try the crop when I walked past a tobacco farm at Syringavale Farm in Marula, last year. I told other villagers that I would try tobacco farming but they did not take me seriously.\n\nThere was a time when we had a long dry spell and I almost lost hope. We are happy now because we have been receiving good rains during the past few weeks. Im hopeful that we will get a good harvest, said Mrs Mathe.\n\n",

The display is adorned with traditional reed mats, crocheted hats and a variety of utensils typical of a rural African homestead.\n\nAccording to Sipho Mazibuko, founder of the pageant, the initiative aims to celebrate and educate the world about Zimbabwes rich and diverse cultural heritage.\n\nWere here to showcase the richness of Zimbabwean culture, and Ive brought along models, who represent 16 of the countrys tribes. We have representatives from the Kalanga, Xhosa, Tonga, Ndebele, Ndau, Sotho, Jahunda, and Karanga communities, with more models expected to arrive from their respective rural homes, said Mazibuko.\n\nMany of the participating models expressed their excitement and gratitude at being part of the event, which, for most, marks their first time attending the exhibition.\n\nMbwalimuumi Simugwagwa, a finalist for Mr Rural Zimbabwe Matabeleland North from Binga, expressed his appreciation for the opportunity.\n\nIm grateful to be part of this pageant. As rural youth, were often overlooked and many of us face financial challenges that hinder our ability to pursue further education. This often pushes some of my peers towards risky paths, such as illegal mining or immoral behaviour, out of desperation.\n\nMusawenkosi Nkala from Tshabanda in Tsholotsho said her participation is inspired by a passion for combating drug and substance abuse among rural youth, while also promoting Kalanga culture.\n\nIve seen many of my peers fall victim to alcohol and drug abuse. In my village and neighbouring communities, many young people also lack access to basic amenities like education, clean water and decent shelter, which is a violation of their rights, said Nkala.\n\nThrough this pageant, weve been given a platform to shine and access opportunities usually reserved for urban youth. Its a stepping stone towards achieving my dreams and building a career. Weve even been introduced to scholarship opportunities and skills development programmes to help us create sustainable futures.\n\nDeborah Munkuli from Hwange, representing the Nambya culture, echoed similar sentiments.\n\nShe said the pageant had not only allowed her to showcase her cultural identity, but also offered the chance to network with her urban counterparts and highlight her talents.\n\nRepresenting the Xhosa tribe, Mbongeni Hadebe from Mbembesi said the pageant helped him discover a hidden talent, modelling.\n\nI never knew I had it in me until I joined this pageant. If I win Mr Rural Zimbabwe, Ill use the title to empower young people in my community, advocate against drug abuse, and push for the establishment of rehabilitation centres in rural areas.\n\nIf we dont address these issues now, we risk losing an entire generation.He added, This platform has given me a sense of purpose. I want to inspire other young people to embrace our culture and believe in their dreams.\n\n",

In a condolence message, addressed to the acting Head of the Vatican, His Holiness Cardinal Kevin Farrell, yesterday, the President said the pontiff had greatly impacted global spirituality and moral leadership. He described him as a dedicated servant of the Apostolic See.\n\nIt is with a heavy heart and profound sadness that I extend, on behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Zimbabwe, as well as on my own behalf, our most sincere and deepest condolences on the passing of The Holy Father, His Holiness, Pope Francis.\n\nIn this solemn hour, the world reflects, with reverence, on the life and legacy of a devoted servant of the Apostolic See, who dedicated himself to the service of God and humanity at large, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nHe highlighted how Pope Francis spirit of grace and theological insight had elevated the spiritual consciousness of the world.\n\nThe late Pope, President Mnangagwa said, had left behind a legacy that will continue to inspire future generations.\n\nHis voice, which resonated within and beyond the hallowed walls of the Vatican, shall, forever, remain an embodiment of his spirit of grace, moral leadership and theological insight that uplifted the spiritual consciousness of our time.\n\nAs we join you in this time of mourning, we pray that Almighty God grant eternal rest to his soul and give the entire Catholic family strength and comfort to overcome this loss.\n\nPlease accept, Your Holiness, the assurances of my sympathy and highest consideration, said the President.The Pope was admitted to the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital in mid-February due to bronchitis.\n\nHis health worsened, and by the end of February, he was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia. After spending 38 days in hospital, he returned to his residence at Casa Santa Marta in the Vatican, where he later passed away.\n\nAgostino Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital\n\nTomorrow, the Popes body will be moved to St Peters Basilica for public mourning. His funeral will take place at the Vatican on Saturday. Tributes continue pouring in from across the world. Pope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio on December 17, 1936, in Argentina, was known for his humility and progressive views. He was a champion of interfaith dialogue and environmental stewardship.\n\nHis advocacy for the poor resonated with many, making him a beloved figure beyond the Catholic Church.\n\nAs the eldest of five children, he grew up in a loving family that instilled strong values in him from an early age.\n\nIn 1969, he was ordained as a Jesuit priest, embarking on a path that would lead him to significant challenges and triumphs. During Argentinas brutal dictatorship from 1976 to 1983, he took on the leadership of the Jesuit order in the country, navigating a perilous landscape where faith and courage were paramount.\n\nHis dedication and leadership earned him the position of Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998. Just a few years later, in 2001, he was elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II, marking a pivotal moment in his ecclesiastical career.On March 13, 2013, he was elected the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic Church, taking the name Francis.\n\nThis choice was significant; he became the first pope from the Americas, the first to hail from the Jesuit order, and the first to adopt the name of St. Francis of Assisi, a symbol of humility and compassion.\n\nPope Franciss commitment to humility and simplicity was evident even before his papacy.As Archbishop, he chose to forgo the luxuries enjoyed by his predecessors, opting to ride the bus, cook his own meals, and regularly visit the slums of Buenos Aires.\n\nThis lifestyle of simplicity continued as a Pope. He lived in a Vatican hotel instead of the opulent Apostolic Palace, wore his old orthotic shoes instead of the traditional red loafers, and used compact cars, setting a powerful example for the clerical community.\n\nThroughout his papacy, Francis made headlines for his efforts to promote peace and dialogue. Notably, in 2021, he became the first pope to visit Iraq, where he met with the countrys top Shiite Muslim cleric, fostering interfaith understanding and co-operation.\n\n",

This modernised approach to billing and compliance streamlines operations for users and improves businesses efficiency.\n\nLike a carefully assembled Swiss Army knife with many functionalities packed into a compact design, Snappy Ex beautifully balances the technical rigour of the system and the sense of security it provides to the user.\n\nWith the newly introduced Zimra Harmonised System (HS) Codes for fiscal devices, Ms Bitota said their software has perfectly integrated these Zimra codes, allowing users to select relevant codes for their industry once.\n\nShe said the system then automatically prompts them when creating future invoices, helping taxpayers meet Zimras standards without breaking a sweat and saving time and costs.\n\nSnappy Ex, a well-designed and integrated system, addresses the complexities of Zimras fiscalisation requirements by offering a reliable solution for taxpayers, said Ms Bitota.\n\nIts precise computations, comprehensive validation checks, and smooth processes, ensure compliance is no longer a challenge, allowing users to focus on their core activities stress-free.\n\nWith over 4200 HS codes to consider, navigating over to find the correct code for each invoice item can feel overwhelming even for seasoned professionals.\n\n",

            "content": "He preached world peace and love, denounced growing inequality and the new tyranny of capitalism and idolatry of money, and remained humble.\n\nHe was for equality thus departed from the norm, when appointing women to influential positions that used to be exclusively held by men.Due to his love for all, he embraced even the homeless, whom he referred to as the nobles of the street.\n\nSpeaking on Easter Sunday, he denounced the fighting in Gaza and called for a cessation of hostilities.\n\nHe advanced these and other values in his 33 years as a Catholic Bishop, Archbishop and Pope until he rested aged 88 on Monday at the Vatican, Rome, Italy.\n\nThe 1,4 billion Catholic faithful across the world as well as non-Catholics are mourning the death of Pope Francis following a prolonged respiratory illness.The 266th Pope, who assumed that role in March 2013, will be buried on Saturday at the Papal Basilica of St Mary Major, just outside the Vatican.\n\nIn his message of condolences on Monday, President Mnangagwa highlighted some of the values that Pope Francis espoused.\n\nI join the world in mourning the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis, a man of profound humility who stood for peace, compassion and justice. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the Catholic Church and Catholics across the globe. May his soul rest in eternal peace, he posted on X.\n\nThe world has lost one of its more consequential voices.Women, the poor, the vulnerable and the oppressed have lost one of their biggest backers.\n\nWe urge the world to take note of what Pope Francis preached and stood for and strive to live by that.\n\nIf all of us shun the relentless pursuit for wealth and wealth for its sake and stop idolising money, traits which we are seeing across the globe, we think most of the ills that we are grappling with as humanity will be resolved.We will have a more just and equitable world in which prosperity is shared.\n\nStill on riches, we learn a lot from Pope Francis choice of a humble life.He preferred to travel in smaller, utilitarian vehicles instead of large, luxury ones.He eschewed elaborate clothing such as silk robes, which we have come to associate with the clergy, opting for ordinary garments.\n\nIf all of us take after Pope Francis to be modest, the showiness and gapping inequalities that we are seeing in society would end.\n\nIf we take care of the poor as he preached and practised, we will have fewer and fewer people wallowing on the streets with no food, clothing, security and dignity.We will have more decent homes, enough food and a more secure existence for all of us.\n\nIf we heed his calls for peace, the fighting in Gaza and the resultant suffering and deaths on that strip would end, life in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo would return to normal and Sudan would be calm.We will be a world of tolerance and peace.\n\nOn a visit to predominantly Islamic Morocco in 2019, Pope Francis preached unity between faiths.\n\nThat message resonated worldwide then and remains important now, given the religious intolerance that sometimes escalates into armed conflict and terrorism in countries like Nigeria, Somalia and Mozambique as well as discrimination against Christians in Britain, Spain, Germany and elsewhere.\n\n",

Were here to promote and market our game, but more importantly, to connect with people who believe in football, from fans and sponsors to potential partners, said PSL communications officer, Kudzai Bare.\n\nRunning under the theme Industrialisation: Crafting an Integrated Economic Landscape, this years ZITF has brought together top players across mining, technology, agriculture and energy. For the PSL, its a golden chance to learn, align and grow.\n\nCastle Lager Premier Soccer League\n\nWe want to learn from how companies are run, how they sustain themselves and how they think long-term. This will help us think differently about football  not just as a sport, but as a business, Bare said.\n\nThe leagues stand is hard to miss, featuring classic PSL match clips, league history and fan-friendly give-aways  all aimed at drawing the crowd and stirring debate around how the local game can rise again.\n\nWere using this platform to listen. What do our fans want changed? What are our sponsors looking for? Its not just about talking, but also about taking ideas on board and evolving as a league, said Bare.\n\nFor Bulawayo fans, long considered some of the most passionate and loyal in the country, the PSLs presence is a nod to the citys vital role in shaping Zimbabwean football.\n\nWe know the Bulawayo crowd loves its football. We want to reignite that passion, to make sure PSL is something people are proud to associate with, said Bare.\n\nZITF 2024 comes as the PSL seeks to reposition itself as a modern, commercially attractive product, capable of drawing consistent crowds and long-term investment. Earlier this year, the league held workshops with clubs and partners to realign its strategic direction and, the ZITF is now serving as a public-facing follow-up.\n\nThis is only the beginning. We want to keep improving, to build a PSL that excites people, that brings sponsors on board and makes people look forward to matchday, Bare said.\n\nIn a city steeped in football tradition, the PSLs ZITF campaign feels like a homecoming of sorts, a rekindling of ties and a call for all hands on deck to take the game forward.\n\n",

This being our first time exhibiting at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair, we are optimistic about securing lucrative deals from the companies and individuals, who have shown significant interest in our products, said Mr Sinaga.\n\nThis was Indonesias first appearance at the ZITF, underlining how the re-engagement strategy is unlocking previously untapped economic relationships with Asian markets.\n\nMs Jun Yamazaki, Second Secretary of the Embassy of Japan, highlighted Japans dual focus of promoting Japanese innovation and building long-term trade relations with Zimbabwe. She noted the synchrony between ZITF and the upcoming Osaka Expo 2025, which is set to serve as another vital platform for bilateral engagement.\n\nOur aim here is to promote Japanese products, and we are pleased that the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair is running concurrently with the Osaka Expo 2025. The Osaka Expo is a collaborative event involving Osakas local government, the Japanese national government, numerous other nations and businesses from both the domestic and international private sectors, said Ms Yamazaki.\n\nJust as the Osaka Expo serves as a business forum to discuss trade and bilateral relations between Zimbabwean Government officials, private sector players, Japanese officials and leading firms from Japan, ZITF here also provides a platform for Japanese entities to engage with their Zimbabwean counterparts to deepen the two countries bilateral relations.\n\nMrs Yamazaki said their presence at the ZITF is not just about exhibiting products but also strengthening long-term ties between Zimbabwean and Japanese enterprises.\n\nHere at ZITF, we have companies such as Fujifilm, a Japanese multinational conglomerate involved in healthcare, materials and imaging, which has successfully diversified its business over the decades, she said.\n\nFujifilm is showcasing cutting-edge medical solutions intended to improve diagnostic capacity and access to healthcare, an area of increasing relevance for Zimbabwes developing health infrastructure.\n\nMr Isaac Morifi, a representative of Schreder Company from Portugal, said the firm is actively building on existing relationships with Zimbabwes mining sector.\n\nWe already have existing mutual relations with some mining companies in Zimbabwe, and we are expecting more new clients to approach us so that we can secure deals and establish new relationships.\n\nFurthermore, leveraging the bilateral business relationship between Portugal and Zimbabwe, we are already supplying our products to mining companies such as Zimplats and Unki Mine, and we are poised to clinch new deals with other mining companies, he said.\n\nZITF Company board chairperson, Mr Busisa Moyo, described the ZITF 2025 edition as one of the most promising in the events 65-year history. He said the event is a major milestone in Zimbabwes diplomatic and economic repositioning.\n\nGiven the unprecedented international interest witnessed at this 65th edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair, we are curating various platforms to spotlight different sectors within our economy, he said.\n\nThis facilitates crucial re-engagement with foreign suppliers in these areas and allows us to showcase products with the potential to satisfy diverse regional and global markets.\n\nMr Moyo cited the Zimbabwe-India Dialogue held on the sidelines of ZITF, as a critical platform for building strong trade and industrial links.\n\nThe event brought together over 10 high-level Indian business leaders from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), who engaged with local industry captains from the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI).\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has consistently reiterated that Zimbabwe is a friend to all and an enemy to none.Under his leadership, the Second Republic has sought to repair and restore diplomatic ties that had weakened over the past two decades, particularly with Western countries.\n\n",

Both aged 15, the learners come from different schools and backgrounds, yet share a common thread of resilience and academic excellence. Their ascent to international acclaim began in 2022, when they claimed victory at both the World and European Moot Court Championships.\n\nMoot court is a simulated legal process that cultivates learners skills in legal research, writing and oral advocacy. More than a contest of argument, it is a platform where young voices evolve into agents of change.\n\nTheir coach, Nqobile Dube, originally from Bulawayo and now based in Harare, has played a crucial role in shaping this trailblazing team. He emphasised the importance of nurturing talent regardless of background.\n\nI meet each student where they are. Some come from rural schools with limited resources, while others may have stronger academic foundations. What they all share is potential, and our role is to unlock it, said Dube.\n\nHis mentorship goes beyond preparing for competition; it is about instilling discipline, confidence and belief.Moot court is not just about learning how to argue; its about giving students a voice, a platform, and the tools to shape their world, he said.\n\nIn a country where the educational infrastructure often faces immense challenges, such as erratic electricity supply, lack of moot court facilities and unreliable internet, Dube finds profound meaning in guiding learners to international success.\n\nOur students rise every single day, with determination and brilliance, despite odds that would halt many others, he said.\n\nThis perseverance has attracted global attention. These students have not only competed, they have excelled, demonstrating that African excellence does not wait for ideal conditions. It creates its own spotlight.\n\nAs they prepare for the upcoming championship, the team is crafting arguments around two pressing legal issues: whether a private citizen can sue a fossil fuel company under the Warm Claims Act, for its role in climate change and whether a federal judge should recuse himself from a case after making potentially biased public remarks.\n\nApproaching this with gratitude, but also with confidence, is key, said Dube.Were not just preparing them to compete, were preparing them to make a statement. They will enter that virtual courtroom carrying the dreams of a continent.\n\nDube believes these achievements are redefining how the world views Zimbabwean learners.Were no longer just participants in global discourse; were leaders in it. Bear in mind, we are competing against students from countries with long-established moot court traditions and civic education programmes. And were doing this within the framework of a foreign legal system.\n\nThis landmark accomplishment follows another major milestone: the Zimbabwe National Debate Teams recent triumph at the East Africa World Schools Debate Championships, and their participation at the World Schools Debate Championship in Vietnam.  @MbuleloMpofu\n\n",
