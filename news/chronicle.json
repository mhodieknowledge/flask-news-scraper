The doctor advised me that my heart wasnt in the kind of shape that I should be putting it under any stress.\n\nHackman underwent angioplasty, a procedure to widen narrowed or blocked arteries, due to congestive heart failure in 1990.

The speed of thought is amazing.\n\nIve never got tired of work Gene Hackman on his love for acting.\n\nHackman met Arakawa, a classically trained pianist who grew up in Hawaii, when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s. They soon moved in together, and by the end of the decade had bought their home in Santa Fe.

Its similar in some ways to acting, but its more private and I feel like I have more control over what Im trying to say and do.\n\nTheres always a compromise in acting and in film, you work with so many people and everyone has an opinion.  I dont know that I like it better than acting, its just different. I find it relaxing and comforting.\n\nLocals in Santa Fe have shared photos of Gene Hackman who moved there in the 1980s.

Property records indicate that oneis owned by Betsy Arkawa and the otheris owned by a family trust for Hackmans agent\n\nA deeply complicated man, Hackman was strangely squeamish about on-screen violence but loved a real-life scrap, according to Hoffman.\n\nHoffman recalled his friend once announcing I gotta go and disappearing off to a bar because he had to get in a fight.\n\nHe was still getting into fights in his seventies. In 2001, a 71-year-old Hackman started a fist fight with two men over a minor traffic accident in West Hollywood.\n\nHe brushed against me and I popped him, he recalled. Then the other guy jumped on me. We had this ugly wrestling match on the ground.\n\nThe police came  I got a couple of good shots in. The guy had me around the neck. Thats the ugly part. When youre down on the ground and youre nearly 72 years old.\n\nEven so, Hackman was hardly one to believe that placid, well-adjusted people necessarily made great actors.\n\nHis instinctive rebelliousness, he claimed in a rare 1994 interview, was seeded in a traumatic and unhappy childhood in which his violently disciplinarian father abandoned the family when he was 13 and his alcoholic mother eventually died in a house fire in 1962, reportedly passing out while holding a lit cigarette.\n\nHackman played Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde\n\nPhilip DAntoni (left) and Gene Hackman, producer and star, respectively, of The French Connection, hold Oscars they won at the 44th movie Academy Awards\n\nHackman admitted that like so many successful actors always away filming he had seriously neglected his family.\n\nYou become very selfish as an actor. You spend so many years wanting desperately to be recognized as having the talent and then when youre starting to be offered these parts, its very tough to turn anything down, he said.Even though I had a family, I took jobs that would separate us for three or four months at a time.\n\nHackman met his first wife, Faye Maltese, in 1955  when Hackman was only 25 and nowhere near success. As reported by theNew York Times Magazinein 1989, he and the pretty and dark-haired secretary atRockefeller Center initially crossed paths at aY.M.C.A. dance in the Big Apple.\n\nTheir first few years as a young family were marked by struggle  the couple lived in a cold water walk up  meaning there is no hot water supply available,in the city.\n\nHisromance with his first partner Maltese, a bank clerk, was understood to be troubled due to his determined, but overwhelming, rise to fame.\n\nThe pair divorcedin 1986 after spending 30 years together and raising three children son Christopher Allen and daughters Leslie Anne and Elizabeth Jean.\n\nHe andArakawa, who was 32 years her husbands junior,reportedly began dating in the mid-1980s after meeting at a gym inCalifornia.\n\nArakawa, who is believed to have been born inHawaii, waspursuing a career in classical music at the time while working shifts in the gym.\n\nFive years later, he walked down the aisle with Arakawa.The pairsettled down in a two-bedroom house in Santa Fe.\n\nHackman later insisted that their relationship began after his divorce from Maltese, who he was married to from 1956 to 1986.\n\nDiscussing what he had in common with his character Harry Mackenzie, who leaves his wife for a barmaid in the 1985 film Twice in a Lifetime, he told the SouthFloridaSun-Sentinel: By the way, I did not leave my real-life wife for a younger woman.\n\nWe just drifted apart.We lost sight of each other. When you work in this business, marriage takes a great deal of work and love.\n\nGene Hackman in 1992 film Unforgiven, where he playedbrutal sheriff Little Bill Daggett\n\nGene Hackman acted alongside Dustin Hoffman in 2003 film Runaway Jury\n\nDustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman at the 1968 Academy Awards, where Hoffman was nominated for Best Actor in The Graduate and Hackman was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in Bonnie and Clyde\n\nHackman announced his retirement from acting in 2004, leaving Los Angeles for a quieter life in New Mexico  and resisting any overtures to return in front of the camera.\n\nHe told of how his decision was influenced by the strain he suffered when acting, as well as health issues concerning his heart. He told of receiving a health warning from a doctor, while saying in a statement at the time: The business for me is very stressful.\n\nHe revealed, during a CNN interview that year, that he was afraid of dying. Hackman said: I dont have a lot of fears, I have the normal fear of passing away.\n\nHackman had previouslyundergone surgery after facing problemswith his heart  having been rushed to the hospital with chest pain and needing to have a balloon catheter inserted to help open an artery that had dangerously narrowed.\n\nIn 2009 he opened up more, telling an interviewer that his doctor advised me that my heart wasnt in the kind of shape that I should be putting it under any stress.\n\nHe said: When Im actually on the set or on a stage, actually doing the work, I loved that process and I loved the creative process of trying to bring a character to life.\n\nAnd then, when youre actually shooting or performing, there is a kind of a feeling that comes over you, a confidence and kind of a wonderful, washed-over feeling of wellbeing, if you will, when its going well.\n\nWhereas, the business part of show business is kinda wicked. You jump from trying to be a sponge, if you will  in terms of input from other actors and the director and everything thats surrounding you.\n\nThe Oscar-award winning actor, pictured at the Academy Awards in 1993, actually quit acting because of the severe stress he was under, which became too much to handle after he started to have issues with his heart\n\nRaquel Welch, Gene Hackman and Cloris Leachman (holding her Best Supporting Actress Oscar) at the 44th Academy Awards in Hollywood April 17 1972\n\nGene Hackmans heartbroken fans shared a plethora of emotional tributes to the star on Thursday following the news of his and wife Betsy Arakawas deaths [pictured in 1983]\n\nIn 2011, he was asked by GQ if he would ever come out of retirement to do one more film, to which Hackman responded: If I could do it in my own house, maybe, without them disturbing anything and just one or two people.\n\nHis old friend Robert Duvall described him as a tormented guy, always into his own space, his own thing.\n\nHackman did not stay completely away from the industry, however, as he narrated two Marine Corps documentaries: The Unknown Flag Raiser of Iwo Jima (2016) and We, The Marines (2017).\n\nHe did, however, insist that he never thought of himself as a star  that was Warren Beatty, Robert Redford and Brad Pitt, he said.\n\nThe actor believed that celebrity was ruinous, observing: If you look at yourself as a star youve already lost something in the portrayal of any human beingYou need to remember youre not a movie star and that you shouldnt be too happy.\n\nVesuvius said hed rather just be remembered as a decent actor.\n\nSOURCE: daily mail\n\n",

            "content": "Prosper Ndlovu[emailprotected]\n\nTHE World Bank has commended the Zimbabwean government for rolling out of key policy reforms aimed at restoring macro-economic stability and urged the Treasury to identify ways to strengthen this to move Zimbabwe towards a sustainable medium-term fiscal pathway.The suggestions are informed by the new Public Finance Review (PFR) paper titled: Anchoring Macroeconomic Stability through Fiscal Policy released by the World Bank this week, which considered the performance of Zimbabwes public finances between 2019 and 2023.It supports the Government of Zimbabwe in its fiscal consolidation efforts by identifying policy options to improve expenditure and revenue mobilization to create fiscal space, improve efficiency, and strengthen equity considerations.This is expected to help move Zimbabwe towards a more sustainable medium-term fiscal pathway, stabilize the macro-economic environment, and support sustainable economic growth and job creation.The PFR emphasizes the World Banks commitment to providing timely and responsive support to the Government of Zimbabwe and is a testament to our strong and ongoing partnership, World Bank country manager, Eneida Fernandes, said.This comprehensive analysis of public finance will guide our efforts to assist the Government in improving domestic revenue mobilization, enhancing efficiency, and ensuring pro-poor outcomes.The PFR recommends several measures to create fiscal space and return Zimbabwes fiscal accounts to a prudent trajectory.The report further highlights that stabilizing prices and eliminating exchange rate distortions can significantly and swiftly boost Government revenue. Enhancing price stability could help recover inflation-related tax losses promptly. Potential reforms to increase tax revenue efficiently and equitably include streamlining corporate tax incentives, strengthening mining, property and wealth taxation, aligning health excise taxes in line with international standards, and improving tax administration using digital technologies, said the bank.It also called for improvement in the efficiency of public spending ass essential for supporting fiscal consolidation and achieving long-term sustainable and inclusive growth.There is potential to improve the Governments allocative efficiency to improve value-for-money in areas such as health care and capital investments.Improvements in procurement systems, including the use of e-procurement, also present significant opportunities for efficiency savings, said the World Bank.Efficiency in public services administration is also key, as the Government of Zimbabwes jobs evaluation report suggests there are opportunities to streamline the civil service.The progressivity of expenditure policy can also be improved through more and better targeted spending on social protection. The operationalization of a national social registry could help improve targeting of Zimbabwes current social protection systems and help improve climate resilience.The PFR shows that fiscal policy can be a critical anchor for macro-economic stability that can ensure a credible and efficient national budget and assist a stable and competitive currency.Jointly, this would lead to higher growth, major poverty reduction, and a major step toward achieving Zimbabwes development objectives, said the Bank.\n\n",

However, her journey wasnt without challenges.I always loved music, but I struggled with low self-esteem and feared rejection, she shared.My music journey truly began in 2022 when a friend encouraged me to pursue my talent. I started writing and recording songs, though my first track, Ama2000, was low-budget and low-quality, so I never released it.\n\nHer breakthrough came with Why, a Dancehall track sung in Shona to appeal to a broader audience. Since then, she has built a diverse catalog spanning Afro, Hip-Hop, Dancehall, and Amapiano. Her notable releases include Why, Badgyal, Ngilombuzo (2023), Kamuendero Kawakazoita, Ndozvandinomudira, Moses, and the hit Mntanami (2024).\n\nNow, with Thilo Lilo, she continues to solidify her place in the music industry.
