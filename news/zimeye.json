Zimbabwe will host Benin on March 21 at the Moses Mabida Stadium in Durban, South Africa, before traveling to Uyo, Nigeria to face the Super Eagles at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium four days later.\n\nIn a significant boost to the team, Knowledge Musona has ended his international retirement and returns to the Warriors fold. Musona had retired from national duty in May 2022 to focus on his club career and give younger players a chance. However, after convincing from Nees, the midfielder has reconsidered his decision and rejoins the squad.\n\nCurrent captain Marvelous Nakamba and goalkeeper Washington Arubi, who have both struggled with injuries recently, have been named in the squad. Other notable inclusions are Wolves new signing Marshall Munetsi, Huddersfields on-loan signing Tawanda Chirewa, and Khama Billiat, who plays for Scotland FC in the Castle Lager Premiership.\n\nThe Warriors squad for the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers is as follows:\n\nGoalkeepers:\n\nDefenders:\n\nMidfielders:\n\nForwards:\n\n",

            "content": "In our fast-paced world, impatience often seeps into our daily lives, including how we behave behind the wheel.\n\nBut the road is not a place for rash decisions or hasty actionsits a place where patience can literally save your life. If you refuse to exercise patience while riding or driving, you might find yourself in a far worse situation: as a patient in a hospital bed, a casualty in a morgue, or another statistic in a graveyard.\n\nThe roads are filled with vital signs and markings that serve a critical purpose. Road signs, signals, and lane markings arent just there for decorationthey are messages designed to guide and protect you. When you choose to ignore them, whether by speeding, overtaking dangerously, or neglecting to follow traffic rules, you put yourself and others at risk.\n\nPatience on the road means taking the time to properly assess your surroundings, respecting speed limits, yielding when necessary, and abiding by the rules set forth to ensure everyones safety. These guidelines are not meant to slow you down or ruin your day; they are meant to preserve your life. A single moment of impatience could lead to an irreversible consequence.\n\nFor example, ignoring a red light or failing to yield could lead to a tragic collision, leaving not only you but also others involved suffering the consequences. If youre driving too fast for road conditions or overtaking on blind corners, you might be tempting fate. That sudden moment of impatience can result in an accident that could change your life foreveror end it prematurely.\n\nThe road messages are clear. The speed limits are there to keep you safe. The warning signs are there to prepare you for potential hazards ahead. The lane markings are there to help you stay in your lane and avoid dangerous intersections. Respecting these messages is an act of self-preservation. Ignoring them could place you in a hospital bed, or worse, a morgue.\n\nSo, the next time you find yourself behind the wheel, take a deep breath and remind yourself of the consequences of impatience. Your life is worth more than reaching your destination a few minutes earlier. Be patient. Respect the road, its messages, and the safety of those around you. It could mean the difference between life and death.\n\nDrive safe. Be patient. Save lives.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

As a concerned cadre the effects of such utterances has got a negative bearing which poses a security threat. Infact he seems to imply the President is above the law and can interfere with issues before the courts.\n\nCde Mutsvangwa in his utterances brought the party into disrepute and will now destabilise the political environment which will in turn affect the social life of the masses. The Direct attack on VP Chiwenga has got a negative implication on our international relations and the nation at large eroding the gains of the new dispensation.\n\nHon Vice President CDGN Chiwenga is a Presidential Appointee and the attacks by Cde Mutsvagwa might seem as if the President has made a mistake in Appointing him which is also a direct attack on President Mnangagwa.\n\nWe have lower level cadres who were expelled from the party due to purpoted social media abuse. I strongly advocate for a corrective action against Cde Mutsvangwa.\n\nSuch actions should be strongly condernmed as they undermine the Authority of Cde Chiwenga and cause serious divisions within the Zanu Pf party.\n\nMashonaland West Province leadership cannot look aside at this Gross Indiscipline.\n\nWe hope and trust that your office shall take this matter with the importance and urgency it deserves\n\nYours Concerned Cadre\n\nCde Gifford Gomwe\n\nCc: First Secretary of the Party Cde ED MnangagwaCc: Second Secretary of the Party Cde CDGN Chiwenga.Cc: Second Secretary of the Party Cde KCD Mohadi.Cc:Secretary for legal Affairs Cde P.ChinamasaCc: Secretary General of the Party Cde O.Mpofu.Cc: Secretary for Security Cde L.Matuke.\n\n",

Allow me to put the 21st National Peoples Conference resolution number one under spotlight. Party leadership has observed, with dismay, the abuse of the resolution and the weaponisation of the 2030 slogan, she said.\n\nShe emphasized that the resolution was a collective decision and should not be hijacked by a few for personal interests. The resolution is a collective outcome that cannot be monopolised by a few individuals for personal gain and glory. These few individuals are now exploiting the resolution and the 2030 slogan to provoke discord and petty disciplinary cases. This must stop forthwith.\n\nMuchinguri-Kashiri also reiterated that the resolution had broad support within the party, calling for patience as proper party protocols were followed. Youre all aware that the resolution was and is supported by everyone hence let us give the requisite party protocol time to process it accordingly, she added.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nOpposition leader Advocate Nelson Chamisa has expressed his concern over the ongoing brain drain in Zimbabwe, attributing it to the actions of the Zanu PF regime. In a statement released on Friday, Chamisa lamented the worsening plight of citizens, emphasizing how the country continues to lose its brightest minds.\n\nChamisa shared his personal frustration, stating, Just this morning, I received four different calls from some professionals, all planning on leaving the country to seek opportunities in other countries. He described the constant distress of receiving calls from Zimbabweans desperate to leave, adding, My daily agony is waking up every day to the lived nightmare of receiving yet another call from a fellow Zimbabwean desperate to leave the country searching for what is believed to be greener pastures. This is a story I have experienced repeatedly for the past 20 years.\n\nThese calls, according to Chamisa, are not mere conversations but often pleas for help. Often, these calls are not just conversations, they are pleas for assistance, requests for guidance on finding a way to exit and escape to a perceived better life and future, he explained.\n\nHe criticized the countrys leadership for failing to address the crisis, pointing out the negative impact of the brain drain on the nations future. The sheer scale of brain drain we are experiencing is staggering. As a nation, we are hemorrhaging talent and gifts, losing the very citizens we have invested in and educated (with meager resources for that matter), to other economies, where they go to build and strengthen economies elsewhere.\n\nChamisa described this as plainly heartbreaking and blamed the lack of leadership in the country. Leadership is the missing link. Those in leadership have let the people down. By leadership, I mean everyone within the ecosystem of governance and influence. Any serious leadership would not allow this hemorrhaging to continue untamed or unchecked, he said.\n\nHe further stressed the unsustainable situation, noting, We cannot continue with a situation where all of us, as a people, are perennially preoccupied with finding a way out of our own country. I am yet to see a nation that thrives when the bulk of its best minds are outside it. It cant!\n\nChamisa also commented on the widespread belief that opportunities lie outside the country, saying, It has become a common disposition for citizens to go seeking opportunities in other countries. The motivation being that the grass is greener elsewhere. Granted, the grass always seems greener elsewhere, but it should be greenest wherever we are. Yet, right now, that green grass is benefitting no one hereexcept a select few.\n\nHe concluded by calling for a collective effort to address the issue and work towards Zimbabwes transformation and prosperity. This must stop. It will take all of us a collective effort to win Zimbabwe for transformation and prosperity, and end this nightmare, he urged.\n\n",
