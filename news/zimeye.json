Charges are going to belevelledagainst this media house in respect of the same allegations Mhlanga is facing.\n\nMhlangas trial is now scheduled to begin on May 14.\n\nHis legal team had objected to further delays, but prosecutors abruptly announced they were ready for trial following a lunch adjournment.\n\nMhikealso noted that the trial date was set despite prior notice that his preferred counsel would be unavailableat that time.\n\nThe charges against HSTV come amid growing tensions between Mnangagwa and Ncube, who publicly disavowed the regime he once supported.\n\nNcube resigned from the Presidential Advisory Council (PAC) in 2019, saying his advice was consistently ignored.\n\nSpeaking recently at the BizNews Conference in Drakensberg, South Africa, Ncube admitted regret over backing the 2017 coup. I was one of those people who said give Emmerson Mnangagwa a chanceand how wrong I was, he said. I thought maybe, having witnessed Mugabes failures up close, he [Mnangagwa] would turn things around. Again, I was disappointed.\n\nNcube owns several media outlets under AMH, includingThe StandardandNewsDay.\n\n",

Luis Enriques side maintained control early on and showed resilience late in the match to preserve their lead.\n\nArsenal, appearing in their first Champions League semi-final since 2009, struggled to find rhythm in the opening half but grew into the contest. Mikel Merino thought he had pulled the hosts level in the second half, only for his goal to be ruled out. PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma was also key, producing several crucial saves to deny the Gunners an equaliser.\n\nDespite surviving a period of intense Arsenal pressure, PSG missed chances to extend their advantage. Bradley Barcola and Gonalo Ramos both failed to convert clear opportunities late in the match, leaving the tie finely balanced ahead of the return leg in Paris.\n\nIf PSG can hold onto their lead in next Wednesdays second leg, they will book a spot in the final in Munich, where either Inter Milan or Barcelona awaits. With momentum on their side, the Parisians are daring to dream of their first Champions League crown.\n\nIt was a great night for the group, PSG midfielder Vitinha said after the match. We had the ball for most of the game. We had to adapt to the different circumstances of the match and we did, defending and attacking well.\n\n",

Behind our highly productive workforce is a vast stock of natural resources, he said.\n\nMutsvangwa also highlighted current partnerships with international firms, singling out U.S.-based Starlink as a symbol of confidence in Zimbabwes business environment. Starlink is operating successfully in the country, providing internet as a product and bridging digital access gaps in both rural and urban areas, he said.\n\nHis remarks, however, come amid widespread criticism of the governments crackdown on dissent, continued political arrests, and a deteriorating economyfactors many believe undermine the very investment climate Mutsvangwa seeks to promote.\n\n",

People must understand where Tagwireis riches came from. He began with one fuel station called Takunda, Geza said. Then came Command Agriculture. Turns out, that was public money he never gave back.\n\nGeza painted a picture of a corruption empire built on the backs of ordinary citizens, with military-linked companies and national assets allegedly handed over to Tagwirei. Among the state resources named were Sandawana Mine, shares in Great Dyke Investments, and firms in financial distresstransferred, according to Geza, with government approval and no accountability.\n\nHe came back later saying he was selling off Kuvimba, Geza recounted. Then his own outfit, CBZ Capital, steps in and revalues it at 5.4 billion U.S. dollars. And from that cooked-up figure, he and Mnangagwa walked away with 1.9 billion dollarscorrupt money, no lessthrough the Mutapa Investment Fund.\n\nGeza also claimed that Tagwirei was trying to manipulate religious institutions, alleging that the tycoon was now targeting the Seventh-Day Adventist Church for influence through financial donations. He contrasted this with Zimbabwes failing education and healthcare systems. Civil servants are surviving on crumbs, he said. Yet someone who never passed Grade Seven walks off with 540 million dollars just for standing next to Mnangagwa. What kind of system is that?\n\nThe outspoken activist called for nationwide mobilization, urging citizens to back striking lecturers and students. People of Zimbabwe, its time to rise, he declared. Shutdown the country so Mnangagwa is removed. Lets stand together and rebuild our nation.\n\nGeza assured listeners that plans are already in motion to hold corrupt elites accountable. Make no mistakeaction is happening, he insisted. Were moving carefully to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Our progressive forces are already active on the ground.\n\nAt the time of writing, neither President Mnangagwa nor Tagwirei has issued any response to the damning claims.\n\n",
