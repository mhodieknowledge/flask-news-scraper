            "content": "By Crime and Courts Reporter  President Emmerson Mnangagwa has retired Police Commissioner-General (CG) Godwin Matanga, and replaced him with Deputy Commissioner-General (DCG) Stephen Mutamba.\n\nIn October, Mnangagwa dismissed the head of the Zimbabwe Republic Polices (ZRP) paramilitary Support Unit, with sources suggesting it was a forced retirement.\n\nTwo deputies from the unit were also reassigned to ZRP headquarters in Harare.\n\nSources told ZimEye that these moves are linked to power struggles within Zanu PF, as police operations may have conflicted with the interests of politicians aligned with Mnangagwas faction.\n\nSources said Matanga, appointed in 2018 after Robert Mugabes ouster in the 2017 military intervention, could be reassigned to a diplomatic post.\n\nMatanga took over from Augustine Chihuri, who fled into exile following the 2017 coup.\n\nA senior government official stated, These changes aim to revitalise law enforcement and align it with Mnangagwas anti-corruption agenda. The official added that Matanga may not complete his second term, and hinted at further restructuring within the police force, part of a broader pattern of changes Mnangagwa has made across Zimbabwes security apparatus.\n\nMatanga, during the Desiel PaChinhoyi era, was in charge of the Support Unit, known as the Black Boots,.\n\nHeadquartered at Chikurubi, it operates across multiple districts, including Chikurubi Urban and Rural, Fairbridge (Bulawayo), Buchwa (Zvishavane), and Changadzi.\n\nIts mandate includes crowd control, disaster response, border patrol, and high-profile security details.\n\nMatanga transformed the Support Unit to became increasingly militarised and effectively functioned as a paramilitary arm of Zanu PF, often tasked with suppressing protests and intimidating opposition, especially around election periods.\n\nThe Black Boots gained infamy for their heavy-handed tactics, regularly deployed against opposition supporters, students, and civil society.\n\nAs public dissent grew, especially from the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the police became a central instrument in Mugabes strategy to retain control.\n\nWhen Mnangagwa assumed power in the 2017 coup, he initially sidelined the police, whose loyalty had been closely tied to Mugabe.\n\nFollowing the contested 2018 election, Mnangagwa deployed the military to suppress opposition protests in Harare, leading to the tragic killing of at least six unarmed civiliansa rare and dramatic escalation in civilian repression that echoed the violent Gukurahundi massacres of the 1980s.\n\nThis recent reshuffle within the ZRPs Support Unit could indicate Mnangagwas attempt to reestablish police as the primary force for handling civilian protests, possibly learning from the international backlash that followed the militarys 2018 intervention.\n\n",

Efforts to disqualify certain candidates have intensified, creating a contentious atmosphere.\n\nThis week, the ZIFA Ethics Committee, which will review candidates before announcing the final list on December 23, was presented with objections against Machana, popular cleric Walter Magaya, and Northern Region Soccer League chairman Martin Kweza. A letter from K. Mugadzaweta, also sent to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), accused Machana of financial misconduct and fraud related to a forensic audit of ZIFAs finances from December 2018 to November 2021.\n\nIn response, Machana, through his legal team at Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, dismissed the allegations as unfounded and politically timed, noting that the complaints were lodged with ZACC only after the ZIFA election nominations had closed.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has strongly condemned the misuse of social media platforms by Zanu PF members to air the partys internal issues, calling for an immediate halt to the practice.\n\nHis remarks came during the 380th Ordinary Session of the Politburo, held at the Revolutionary Party HQ in Harare on Thursday.\n\nMnangagwa acknowledged that some members of his party had been using social media to expose internal divisions and conflicts, which he described as damaging to the partys unity and reputation.\n\nThis habit of using social media to attack the party must stop with immediate effect, Mnangagwa said firmly. Such behaviour is unacceptable.\n\nThe Zanu PF leader emphasized the importance of maintaining discipline within the party and adhering to its constitution, making it clear that internal disputes should be resolved within the party structures rather than on public platforms.\n\nThose who are doing it, spit on the ground and never do it again, Mnangagwa added, sending a stern message to party members who have been engaging in such behavior. Every party member must adhere to the party constitution.\n\nThe comments come amidst rising tensions within Zanu PF, where internal divisions have been increasingly evident. Social media, often a space for public debate, has become a battleground for party members to express their discontent, contributing to the deepening rift at the top levels of the ruling party.\n\nMnangagwas call to restore discipline within Zanu PF is seen as an effort to regain control over the partys narrative and prevent further damage to its image.\n\nHowever, his statement also raises questions about how the party intends to address the underlying issues fueling such public outbursts.\n\nWith political infighting growing, Mnangagwas warning signals a tough stance on party loyalty and unity in the face of mounting internal challenges.\n\n",
