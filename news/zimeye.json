            "content": "By Sports Reporter |Harare, Zimbabwe  A formal objection has been raised against the nomination ofWalter Magayafor the presidency of the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA). The objection, submitted to the ZIFA Electoral Committee and Ethics and Integrity Committee Chairperson, cites multiple criminal, civil, and disciplinary allegations that question Magayas ethical, legal, and financial suitability for the role.\n\nCriminal Matters: Pending and Past Cases\n\nThe letter highlights a series of unresolved criminal charges and past convictions that could potentially disqualify Mr. Magaya. These include:\n\n1.Pending Criminal Charges: Walter Magaya faces charges underSection 81 of the Income Tax Actfor alleged tax violations. The matter,State v Walter Magaya (CRB1848/19), is scheduled for hearing at theRotten Row Magistrates Courton 21 January 2024.\n\n2.Asset Forfeiture Investigation: In the caseState v Walter Magaya (PPs Ref 1193/22), financial mismanagement and potential illicit activities are under scrutiny by theAsset Forfeiture Department.\n\n3.Conviction Under Medicines Control Act: Magaya, through his companyMagaya Aretha Medical Private Limited, was convicted and fined US$700 for promoting a false cure for HIV and AIDS. This act was deemed unethical and dangerous to public health.\n\nCivil Matters: Financial Instability and Property Seizure\n\nThe objection also outlines civil cases that question Magayas financial stability and capacity to lead ZIFA responsibly:\n\nIn the caseGet Bucks Microfinance Bank Ltd v Walter Magaya (HCHC657/24), the High Court ordered the sale of Magayas property on 9 October 2024 to settle a significant debt of US$420,140.72.\n\nThis ruling underscores his inability to meet financial obligations, a critical concern for someone vying to manage ZIFAs finances and affairs.\n\nFIFA Disciplinary Sanction: Yadah Football Club\n\nFurther complicating Magayas candidacy is a disciplinary sanction imposed by FIFA on 6 August 2024.\n\nFIFA bannedYadah Football Club, owned and chaired by Magaya, from registering international players due to violations of FIFA club licensing rules.\n\nThe objection emphasizes that, as owner and leader of Yadah FC, Magaya bears ultimate responsibility for governance lapses. The precedent of FIFA holding leaders accountable for ethical breaches, as seen in theSamson Siasiacase, has been cited to stress Magayas ethical shortcomings.\n\nImplications for ZIFA Leadership\n\nThe objection raises concerns about Magayas integrity, financial management, and accountabilitycritical traits required for ZIFAs top leadership role. The letter suggests that his history of legal troubles and FIFA sanctions reflects poorly on his ability to restore credibility to the countrys football administration.\n\nWhats Next?\n\nThe ZIFA Ethics and Integrity Committee is expected to assess the merit of these objections before determining whether Walter Magayas candidacy will proceed. Football stakeholders and fans alike will be watching closely as this controversy unfolds, given ZIFAs ongoing efforts to clean up its image and improve governance.\n\nReporters Note\n\nWalter Magaya, a prominent businessman and football club owner, has yet to comment on the allegations. The developments surrounding his candidacy will likely spark debates over ethics, governance, and the future of Zimbabwean football.\n\nThis is a developing story. Updates will follow as more information becomes available.\n\n",

President Boko has never been involved in farming, either as a cattle rancher or in any other capacity.\n\nDescribing the claims as baseless propaganda, Mutapati emphasised that theywere designedto mislead the public, disrupt the governments work, and undermine the strong diplomatic ties between the two nations.\n\nShefurthercalled on media institutions, particularly the Botswana Editors Forum, to guard against misinformation and hold rogue elements accountable.\n\nMutapati concluded by reaffirming the professional and developmental focus of the relationship between the two presidents:\n\nThe relationship between President Boko and President Mnangagwa remains diplomatic, focused solely on strengthening cooperation and fostering mutual development between the two nations.\n\nThe statement serves as a reminder of the importance of accurate reporting in safeguarding the integrity of both nations and their leaders.\n\n",

            "content": "Road safety is not just a matter of government policy or law enforcement; it is a collective responsibility that falls on every individual. While authorities play a crucial role in setting rules, providing infrastructure, and enforcing traffic laws, the safety of our roads depends on how each of us behaves behind the wheel or as a pedestrian.\n\nIts easy to assume that road safety is solely the responsibility of lawmakers and authorities, but the reality is that every person who uses the road contributes to creating a safer or more dangerous environment. Drivers, passengers, cyclists, and even pedestrians all have a part to play in ensuring that our roads remain safe for everyone.\n\nThe Importance of Safe Driving\n\nOne of the most significant contributors to road safety is the way we drive. Speeding, distracted driving, and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs are all actions that put not only the driver but also other road users at serious risk. Being aware of road conditions, following traffic signals, wearing seat belts, and respecting speed limits are some of the simplest yet most effective ways to avoid accidents.\n\nDriving safely involves more than just adhering to the lawit means being conscious of other drivers and pedestrians, maintaining a safe distance, and reacting calmly in emergency situations. The decision to drive responsibly can prevent countless accidents and save lives.\n\nPedestrians and Cyclists: Sharing the Road\n\nRoad safety isnt just about cars. Pedestrians and cyclists also need to be vigilant and responsible. Pedestrians should use crosswalks, avoid jaywalking, and stay alert when walking near busy streets. Similarly, cyclists must wear helmets, signal their turns, and follow traffic rules to minimize the risk of accidents.\n\nEveryone, regardless of how they travel, plays a part in maintaining road safety. Drivers must be aware of pedestrians and cyclists, while pedestrians and cyclists should respect the rules designed to protect them.\n\nA Culture of Responsibility\n\nBuilding a culture of road safety starts with individuals taking responsibility for their actions. Whether you are driving, cycling, or walking, your behavior on the road can have a direct impact on others. Everyone should recognize that safety is not just a matter of personal well-being but also the well-being of everyone else on the road.\n\nConclusion\n\nRoad safety is not only about laws and regulations; it is about creating a culture where everyone takes responsibility for their actions. To ensure that roads are safe for everyone, we must all participatedrivers, pedestrians, cyclists, and law enforcement. The message is simple: Drive safely, save lives. Lets make road safety a shared priority for all.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

Edgar Moyo, and other distinguished guests to the Midlands Province, highlighting the importance of the project.\n\nIt is an honor and privilege for me to warmly welcome our Guest of Honour, the Minister of Energy and Power Development, Hon. Edgar Moyo, and all invited guests to the Midlands Province on this auspicious occasion of the commissioning of the Gweru Provincial Hospital LED Retrofit Project, Ncube said.\n\nHe noted that the commissioning of the LED Retrofit Project marks a significant step towards promoting energy efficiency and adopting alternative energy technologies, aligning with the broader goals of modernization and industrialization under the governments Vision 2030.

He also praised ZERA for establishing an electric car charging point at the Petro-trade Fuel Service Station in Gweru, aligning with the countrys goal to embrace global energy trends.\n\nHonourable Minister, energy efficiency is our low-hanging fruit that creates excess power for the productive sectors of our economy, such as mining, agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and tourism, which are crucial for GDP growth in the Midlands Province, Ncube said. He also highlighted the importance of the provinces abundant lithium deposits, which contribute to the energy value chain through value addition and beneficiation.\n\nNcube commended the Ministry of Energy and Power Development for advancing energy access in the Midlands Province, citing the successful connection of 957 public institutions through the Rural Electrification Fund (REA). Additionally, Ncube praised REAs efforts in promoting alternative energy technologies, including the deployment of 66 solar mini-grids, 47 solar units, and 16 biogas digesters in the province.\n\nAs part of our commitment to transforming the livelihoods of communities, we continue to focus on ensuring access to quality and affordable social services, such as health, education, and rural development, Ncube noted.\n\nHe also lauded the groundbreaking construction of a USD 1 billion, 720-megawatt coal thermal power plant by Titan New Energy in partnership with ZESA, which is expected to eliminate load shedding in Zimbabwe.\n\nIn conclusion, Ncube urged Gweru General Hospital and all stakeholders present to actively participate in energy efficiency initiatives and safeguard the investments being made.
