It camepic.twitter.com/MJdFKnRAun\n\nUntil it emerged as the unanimous all around resolution of all the delegates who came here, not a dissenting voice. They call upon the president to say you have done a good work, you have turned around an economy which was comatose, we had no currency, we were a pariah state. We were spending all our money on social welfare. Now the economy is vibrant, we are the fastest growing, we have sinews of the economy which points to affect that the middle incomes goal status is achievable, this is why they want the president to continue and they have appointed the president to continue. Thats what they did; they called upon the president. Of course the president is a constitutionalist; he still sticks to the position that he will save two terms, but it does not dispense the wish of the democratic people, that the president could save or should save longer than that.\n\nWhat becomes of it, we are going to make sure that all the constitutional aspects to make this resolution realisable, are addressed, and this is the call by the conference. They not only passed the resolution, but they said mechanisms should be instituted to make sure that this resolution is realized. So this is the goal of the party. As to what will happen 2028, its up to the president. It is choice. He is a constitutionalist and he is a free man. He may want to comply with the resolution or he may not want to comply with the resolution, but that is another thing, because its a choice. In any event, in any way, in 2028, will always be on the calendar of God. The time will come to decide on that matter. For the time being, we have work to do, which is to deliver a vibrant economy, which will make Zimbabwe the shining star of Africa. We are doing well on the African stage. We are doing well on the global stage. This president is delivering on all those aspects; ticking every box of virtues in terms of what is doing for Zimbabwe. So let the man do his job. If it aint broke, dont fix it.\n\n@AnesuMasamvu @ZiFMStereo\n\n",

Their collective push for what they dubbed the ED2030 Agenda marked a decisive moment  one that buried Chiwengas long-nurtured presidential ambitions.\n\nThe Mutare conference endorsed a controversial resolution to extend Mnangagwas rule until at least 2030, a move that tightens his grip on power and sidelines his deputy. In doing so, Zanu PF has effectively shut the door on succession discussions  at least for now.\n\nGovernment spokesperson Nick Mangwana confirmed the resolutions on X (formerly Twitter), stating:\n\nMain Highlights of the 22nd ZANU PF National Peoples Conference Resolutions: In recognition of the extensive development achieved under the leadership of His Excellency, President Mnangagwa, his term of office be extended from 20282030.

Chiwenga, who led that military operation, was reportedly promised the presidency after Mnangagwas first term  a promise that now seems irretrievably broken.\n\nSince taking office, Mnangagwa has systematically consolidated his power  restructuring key state and party institutions, promoting loyalists, and sidelining top military figures perceived to be aligned with Chiwenga. His dominance over the politburo and provincial structures has left the former army commander increasingly isolated.\n\nAnalysts say the Mutare conference resolutions represent a strategic knockout.\n\nMnangagwa has used the party machinery to crush Chiwengas ambitions while portraying himself as indispensable to Zanu PFs survival, said a Harare-based political analyst.\n\nBy the time the conference ended on Saturday, it was clear: MnangagwasZviganandafaction had once again outmaneuvered its rivals  pushing Chiwenga further to the margins of power and cementing Mnangagwas dominance in Zanu PFs succession narrative.\n\n",

His statement claiming he would have been a better General than Chiwenga has the potential to cause dispondency among military personnel.\n\nAs you are aware, General Chiwenga commanded the army since its inception and rose to the rank of General before retiring. As the commander in Chief who appointed Chiwenga to be Vice President Mutsvangwas comments are an affront to your judgment.\n\nMoreover, Mutsvangwas statements disrespect the current generals and the Zimbabwe Defence Forces as a whole, given that they all served under Chiwengas administration. His lack of regard for the rank and file of the defence forces is evident.\n\nNotably, during Chiwengas tenure as Commander of the Defence Forces, significant milestones were achieved such as the attestation of the first group of female cadets in the army.\n\nI strongly appeal to your esteemed office to consider requiring Mutsvangwa to withdraw his statements and face reprimand. Given his track record of being recalled from various government positions, including ambassador, minister, and presidential advisor, its questionable whether he can claim to be better than Chiwenga.\n\nYours Faithfully\n\nCde Bvanzu Bvanzu\n\nConcerned Citizen\n\n",

            "content": "By Engineer Jacob Kudzayi Mutisi-Once again, Zimbabwe finds itself stuck between a rock and a hard place, where political power seems to overshadow the will of the people. The ruling Zanu PF party appears to be defying the National 2013 Constitution  the very document that Zimbabweans overwhelmingly voted for in the hope of building a democratic, transparent, and accountable nation.\n\nWhat we are witnessing today mirrors what happened during the early years of independence. When Robert Mugabe was Prime Minister, he pushed through constitutional changes that transformed his office into the presidency, consolidating power and setting a precedent that has haunted our politics ever since. Today, Zanu PF seems to be walking down that same dangerous path  manipulating the law to serve political interests rather than the peoples will.\n\nDuring his 22nd conference address, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga made an emotional appeal about the need for integrity in leadership. He said,We must always remember that we are not the Alpha and Omega of Zimbabwes journey.These are powerful words that should resonate across all political ranks  but they must also be backed by action. The same Constitution that Chiwenga speaks of so eloquently must be protected, not violated.\n\nThe 2013 Constitution was a hard-won victory  a product of national dialogue, citizen participation, and a collective desire to prevent the excesses of the past. It represents the peoples voice. Yet, recent legislative amendments and political manoeuvres raise serious concerns about whether Zanu PF still respects that social contract.\n\nChiwenga also reminded the nation thatthe fallen are watching us.Indeed, the liberation heroes who sacrificed their lives did not fight for a country where a few individuals could twist the Constitution for personal gain. They fought for a Zimbabwe where law and order, fairness, and justice would prevail.\n\nA local political analyst put it plainly when he said,The bond between the party and the people must remain unbroken. Citizens are becoming increasingly aware of their rights, and they will not stand idly by.His words reflect a growing national sentiment  Zimbabweans are awake and watching. They are tired of seeing their Constitution treated as a political tool rather than the supreme law of the land.\n\nWe have seen this story before. In the 2000s, constitutional amendments were used to extend power and crush dissent. The same cycle of constitutional defiance now threatens to undo the progress made over the past decade. As a nation, we cannot afford to return to that dark chapter.\n\nZimbabwe now faces a defining moment. The leadership must choose between upholding the peoples Constitution or repeating the mistakes of the past. Our democracy depends on this choice.\n\nThe Constitution is not a Zanu PF document  it is a peoples document. It must be defended, respected, and lived by all who swear to serve under it. The struggle for true liberation continues, not through war or slogans, but through the defence of the rule of law.\n\nEngineer Jacob Kudzayi MutisiWhatsApp: +263 772 278 161\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nVice President Constantino Chiwenga delivered a fiery address at the ZANU PF Annual National Peoples Conference in Mutare on Friday, warning against corruption, betrayal, and moral decay within the ruling party.\n\nIt is my profound honor and privilege to stand before you today to introduce the guest of honour, His Excellency the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe and First Secretary of ZANU PF, Chiwenga began. This is not merely another conference. It is a moment of reflection, renewal, and recommitment to the timeless values that have carried our revolutionary party from the liberation struggle to the future we envision.\n\nHe said holding the conference in Manicaland was deeply symbolic, as the province played a historic role in the liberation struggle. It was a crucial gateway through which thousands of brave sons and daughters crossed into Mozambique to wage the struggle for our independence, he said.\n\nChiwenga paid tribute to the freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for Zimbabwes independence. Through these mountains behind us, they slipped across the border  young, determined, and full of conviction  to bases such as Chimoio, Nyadzonya, and Tembwe in Mozambique. Many died in the bush and under aerial bombardment, not in battle but in hope, believing that their sacrifices would purchase a just, dignified, and prosperous Zimbabwe for all, he said.\n\nHe described the liberation camps in Mozambique and Zambia as altars of sacrifice, places where pain, courage, and faith fused into the spirit of liberation.\n\nThe cries of those who fell still echo across these hills, he added. Their blood speaks from the soil, reminding us that our freedom was not inherited  it was earned through suffering and consecrated by unwavering conviction.\n\nIn a direct warning to those he described as betraying the legacy of the struggle, Chiwenga said, Their voices cry out against greed, corruption, laziness, and moral decay. The liberation struggle was a collective mission in which the people  the youth, the women, and the workers  played a decisive role. That bond between the party and the people must remain unbroken.\n\nHe urged unity and discipline within ZANU PF, saying, The same unity and singleness of purpose that drove our liberation struggle must now be the moral compass guiding us into the future. We must continue to move forward as one party, one people, one destiny  bound by a shared vision.\n\nTurning to the conference theme,Attainment of Vision 2030 Through Economic Empowerment and Value Addition,Chiwenga emphasized that economic progress must be inclusive. The central task before us is to build a people-centered economy that empowers every Zimbabwean and ensures that our national wealth benefits all, not just a few, he declared. Economic empowerment must be genuine  equipping our people with the means to produce, innovate, and own their destiny. That is the essence of Vision 2030 and the essence of revolutionary continuity.\n\nHe also invoked the sacrifices of liberation heroes like the late General Josiah Magama Tongogara. Some of them knew they would not see a free Zimbabwe, Chiwenga said. They fought for the future, not for themselves.\n\nConcluding his address, Chiwenga called for recommitment to the partys founding principles. ZANU PF stands where it is today because it has traveled a long, demanding journey of vision, unity, sacrifice, love, and singleness of purpose, he said before inviting President Emmerson Mnangagwa to the podium. Pamberi neZANU PF! Pamberi naPresident Comrade Emmerson Mnangagwa! Pasi nemhandu!\n\nChiwengas speech came amid mounting tension between him and President Mnangagwa over the succession battle, as reports continue to suggest that Mnangagwa seeks to extend his term of office beyond constitutional limits.\n\n",

Im telling you, Mnangagwa is loved, my brothers and sisters  Ive never seen anything like this since 1980!\n\nHe added that the atmosphere in Mutare was electric, with party members chanting, dancing, and singing in praise of the 81-year-old leader. Mazizi vachiti Tonho Zvinoo, he exclaimed, celebrating what he called an unprecedented show of unity.\n\nMukungunugwa further claimed that the chants reflected a peoples resolution for Mnangagwa to stay in power until 2030.\n\nBecause the people have spoken!
