            "content": "By A Correspondent A Zanu PF faction pushing the controversial ED2030 agenda is reportedly lobbying for President Emmerson Mnangagwas birthday to be declared a public holiday, in yet another attempt to entrench his cult of personality amid fierce succession battles within the ruling party.\n\nAccording to party insiders, tomorrows Munhumutapa Day commemorations in Zvishavane, Midlands Province, will serve as a springboard for this campaign. The faction wants the event institutionalised as an annual national holiday to honour Mnangagwa, who turns 83 on Monday  although his exact age has long been a subject of fierce controversy.\n\nOfficially, Mnangagwa was born on 15 September 1942, which would make him 83 this year. However, there have been persistent claims that he could be older than that. In the 1960s, when Mnangagwa was arrested by Rhodesian authorities for sabotage, records reportedly listed his age as higher than what he later claimed. Critics argue that his shifting birth records were deliberately adjusted to align with political narratives and retirement thresholds. During the 2017 coup that toppled Robert Mugabe, speculation about his age resurfaced, with some suggesting he was closer to 86 or 87 at the time, raising questions about his capacity to serve long into the 2030s. Despite these doubts, Mnangagwa has embraced the title Munhumutapa, likening himself to the ancient rulers of the Mutapa Empire, further fuelling criticism that he is cultivating a personality cult.\n\nThe push for a Mnangagwa holiday comes as Zanu PF is deeply divided over succession. Mnangagwas loyalists, grouped under the ED2030 agenda, are campaigning for constitutional amendments that would allow him to remain in power well beyond the current 2028 limit. Vice President Constantino Chiwengas faction, however, views 2028 as the natural point for a leadership transition, given his role in orchestrating the 2017 military coup that brought Mnangagwa to power. This rivalry has already led to purges of provincial leaders accused of siding with Chiwenga, the elevation of Mnangagwas allies such as Chief Secretary Martin Rushwaya and Information Minister Jenfan Muswere, and fierce behind-the-scenes battles ahead of next months 22nd National Peoples Conference in Mutare, where succession and Mnangagwas future are expected to dominate debates.\n\nConfirming the joint celebration of Mnangagwas 83rd birthday and Munhumutapa Day, Muswere described the President as a visionary and global statesman. We are celebrating the life of a statesman, a visionary, a man of the people who has dedicated his life to the freedom and prosperity of the people of Zimbabwe, Muswere said. He is not only committed to achieving an upper-middle-income society by 2030 but is also a champion for global peace and security.\n\nAnalysts say such lavish praise and the proposal for a Mnangagwa holiday highlight how bootlickers within Zanu PF are using symbolic gestures to bolster Mnangagwas authority while silencing dissent. Yet, the unresolved age controversy, combined with worsening factional infighting, risks casting these celebrations as more about consolidating power than about genuine national pride\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent Zanu PF is demanding US$5 million to bankroll its 22nd National Peoples Conference scheduled for October 1318 at Mutare Polytechnic, a target that has once again revived public anger over the ruling partys long-standing practice of coercing teachers, civil servants, parastatals, and private companies to bankroll its activities under the guise of patriotic contributions.\n\nThe party says the high-profile gathering will draw 4,000 delegates, with money set aside for accommodation, catering, and venue upgrades. But critics warn that the burden of funding such lavish political events usually falls on the shoulders of ordinary workers and businesses that can ill afford it.\n\nZanu PFs reliance on forced fundraising dates back to the early 1980s, when teachers were compelled to contribute to state-driven war funds that often ended up financing party programs. During the 1990s, the practice expanded, with government ministries, parastatals, and schools routinely arm-twisted into selling fundraising raffle tickets or deducting solidarity levies from salaries to support Zanu PF projects.\n\nBy the 2000s, this pattern had become institutionalised. Companies seeking government tenders or licenses were often pressured into donating fuel, vehicles, and cash for party events. The 2013 general elections exposed the extent of this system when teachers unions revealed that educators were forced to donate part of their meagre salaries towards Zanu PF campaign activities. Reports also surfaced of provincial education officers ordering schools to buy conference regalia and transport delegates to rallies.\n\nCivil society watchdogs such as Transparency International Zimbabwe have repeatedly criticised this coercive fundraising, describing it as extortion disguised as patriotism, which blurs the line between state resources and party financing.\n\nAt the heart of this years preparations is Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Martin Rushwaya, who has emerged as a key figure in Zanu PFs Manicaland structures. He is spearheading the provinces controversial revival of the ED 2030 agenda  a push to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas rule beyond constitutional limits.\n\nOver the last two weeks, Manicaland party structures have passed resolutions calling for Mnangagwas tenure to be extended and adopting a hardline stance on drug and substance abuse. Provincial chairman Tawanda Mukodza claimed the resolutions reflected grassroots sentiment, declaring: The people desire that President Mnangagwa remains in office beyond 2030, and are calling for the necessary constitutional amendments to facilitate this.\n\nRushwaya, together with Zanu PF Secretary for Legal Affairs Patrick Chinamasa, is tasked with consolidating these resolutions ahead of the Mutare conference. Analysts say Rushwayas prominent role underscores Mnangagwas attempt to tighten control over provinces and close the door on Vice President Constantino Chiwengas succession ambitions.\n\nThe October conference, which will cost US$5 million, is shaping up to be more than just a logistical showcase. It is a test of Mnangagwas grip on the party, as provinces line up behind or against the ED 2030 agenda. The heavy financial demands  met through coercion of teachers, civil servants, and private firms  highlight how Zanu PF has historically blurred the line between state and party, turning national institutions into fundraising vehicles for its political survival.\n\nObservers warn that as in 2017, unresolved succession disputes could destabilise the ruling party, while the coercive fundraising model risks alienating both workers and businesses already buckling under Zimbabwes economic crisis.\n\n",

His sudden death left a power vacuum in the family and local politics, fueling tension that has now erupted publicly.\n\nWithin Zanu PF, Barbara has cemented her position as one of President Emmerson Mnangagwas staunchest allies in the Midlands, a province long regarded as his political stronghold. Her growing influence, however, has reportedly unsettled rivals, including Aaron, who is now being painted as a casualty of the broader purge of dissenting voices.\n\nParty insiders say Aarons expulsion is not just a family feud gone political but part of a calculated attempt to silence figures perceived to be sympathetic to Vice President Constantino Chiwengas camp.\n\nFactional struggles within Zanu PF are escalating ahead of a crucial congress set for Mutare next month, where Mnangagwas controversial bid to extend his stay in office beyond 2028 is expected to dominate proceedings. The battle lines between Mnangagwas loyalists and Chiwengas faction are becoming sharper  with purges, betrayals, and personal vendettas increasingly defining the partys internal wars.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZanu PFs Simbarashe Shonhiwa, popularly known as Gweja, secured a decisive yet controversial victory in the Masvingo Urban Ward 7 by-election, winning with 703 votes.\n\nThe result, however, was overshadowed by allegations of intimidation, vote buying, and apathy that kept turnout at a low 23.49 percent.\n\nIndependent candidate Struggle Desire Nyahunda came second with 192 votes, while another independent, Prosper Taruvinga Tiringindi, received 119. Former councillor Tafara Masimbas wife, Tsungai Mandati, managed 58 votes. Out of 1,087 total ballots cast, only four were spoiled, reflecting the lack of enthusiasm among voters.\n\nThe biggest casualty was Douglas Togarasei Mwonzoras MDC-T, whose candidate Prosper Mataruse polled a humiliating 11 votes across nine polling stations, with some stations recording zero. Analysts said the collapse of MDC-T support showed that the race was effectively between Zanu PF and independents, raising questions about the shrinking space for alternative opposition voices.\n\nInsiders allege that Zanu PF deployed its usual arsenal of patronage and coercion to secure Gwejas victory. People were promised mealie-meal and money. Others were threatened with losing food aid if they didnt vote Zanu PF, claimed one resident who refused to be named.\n\nMwonzoras failure to back his own candidate only added to the drama. One frustrated member of Mataruses campaign team said: Mwonzora should leave politics. He has failed as party president, especially in his lack of support for his candidate, unlike in the Epworth campaign.\n\nCritics note that while Shonhiwas win strengthens Zanu PFs grip on Masvingo, the low voter turnout and widespread disillusionment expose deeper cracks in Zimbabwes political system. Many residents reportedly stayed away from the polls, saying elections no longer bring meaningful change.\n\nFor Zanu PF, the Gweja win is a tactical gain. For the opposition, especially Mwonzoras MDC-T, it is yet another confirmation that the party has lost all relevance.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dereck Goto\n\nCollins and Sean Mnangagwas story begins not in the boardrooms and security establishments where they now command respect, but in the long shadow of a family where service to the community was never optional. The twin brothers grew up watching what leadership meant at its most human level  not grand speeches, but the quiet dignity of helping others.\n\nToday, as CEO of ZIMCN Investments, Collins has carved his name into Zimbabwes mining industry. His company, which runs ventures such as the Radnor Gold Mine in Mutoko, is more than a business. It is a vehicle of transformation, one that has rehabilitated roads, created jobs, and invested in communities that had for too long been left behind. When people in Mutoko speak of renewed access to markets, employment, and better connectivity, they are telling the story of how enterprise can uplift lives when guided by responsibility.\n\nSean, equally, has stepped into leadership with the same sense of duty. Where Collins has built in mining and corporate governance, Sean has been involved in ventures that touch different parts of the economy, but always with the same ethos: that success is measured not only by profit, but by the good it brings to others. Together, they form a portrait of young leaders shaped by more than opportunity  shaped by values instilled at home.\n\nThose values are not difficult to trace. The First Lady, Dr. Auxillia Mnangagwa, has for years traversed the country for philanthropic initiatives, instilling strong African values, more recently through her Angel of Hope Foundation. She has brought medical equipment to hospitals, food to the hungry, linen to clinics, and stationery to schools. She has gifted goats to womens groups, started fish ponds and nutrition gardens, and worked tirelessly to empower rural women while preserving indigenous cultures. In each act, she has modeled what it means to lead by giving, not just by directing.\n\nFor Collins and Sean, these lessons were not theoretical. They were lived moments  helping unload supplies at schools, watching their mother encourage women in remote villages, and hearing their father speak about empowerment as a duty. These experiences etched into them a sense of responsibility that now defines their work.\n\nSo when detractors attempt to reduce them to caricatures in political narratives, they ignore the deeper truth: two young men carrying forward a tradition of service, integrity, and hard work. Their awards and achievements  Collins being recognised among the Top 5 Young CEOs in Zimbabwe and celebrated as a leading corporate director and board chairperson  are not merely personal milestones. They are affirmations of a family culture that has long insisted on building, empowering, and giving back.\n\nThe story of the Mnangagwa twins is therefore not one of privilege alone. It is a story of inheritance  not just of a name, but of responsibility. And in the fields of Mutoko, in the wards of hospitals supported by the First Lady, and in the womens groups empowered by goats and seeds, that inheritance is already yielding fruit.\n\n",
