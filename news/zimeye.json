So theres no way you would have met me with a pastor.\n\nIve never asked for your help. I dont need your help, Ive been doing just fine without you, concludes Miss Mubaiwa.\n\nHopewell Chinono was reached for comment.\n\nSIDE CONTEXT | Before his sudden death, the senior Journalist Geoff Nyarota instructed Simba Chikanza to deploy his 25 years-insurance-industry-expertise to finalise his (Nyarotas) bigger-than-Willowgate investigation on Hopewell Chinono, whos Nyarotas boasting-1996 50,000-sportscar-ex-employee whod insulted him on social media and falsely accused an NHS whistleblower of what shes never done.

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZANU PF National Political Commissar Munyaradzi Machacha has made explosive claims against Blessed Runesu Geza, accusing him of dishonesty and greed during the liberation war.\n\nMachacha alleged that Geza, a former ZANU PF Central Committee member, engaged in theft while serving in Mozambique, stealing goods from a logistics warehouse and reselling them to villagers.\n\nThese allegations come after Gezas fallout with the ruling party over its push to amend the constitution to allow President Emmerson Mnangagwa a third term.\n\nGeza has previously faced accusations of serious crimes, including rape, murder, and theft.\n\nThe timing of these new accusationsafter his break with the partyhas raised questions.\n\nIn a video shared by ZANU PF on social media, Machacha, who claims to be related to Geza, addressed party members at an undisclosed location, revealing his family connection to the accused. He said:\n\nI acknowledge that Geza is my uncle. You heard him rant that I am his nephew, yes, its true. I am not speaking of a person that I am not familiar with. We were together at Chimoio during the war.\n\nMachacha went on to claim that Geza never fought at the warfront. Instead, he allegedly spent his time stealing from the camps logistics warehouse. According to Machacha, Geza would steal clothes intended for guerrilla fighters and sell them in local villages, or exchange them for alcohol and cigarettes. He said:\n\nThere was a big hall which served as a logistics warehouse where clothes for guerrilla fighters were stored. Bombshell would go there and steal jeans and shirts, which he would go and sell in the villages or exchange for beer or cigarettes.\n\nHe literally never spent a single day in camp. Each morning, he would go around villages and get chicken, beer, cigarettes, and Saraveji.\n\nMachacha also stated that Geza faced punishment for his actions, including being flogged by security personnel, but remained unrepentant. He claimed:\n\nWhenever he was caught stealing, he would be given corporal punishment, flogged on the buttocks by security details at the camp. But he never learned his lesson.\n\nMachacha further accused Geza of dishonestly claiming to be the son of nationalist Robert Mugabe while in Romania for military training, which led to special treatment from Romanian authorities. He said:\n\nThe correct fact was that Gezas elder brother was married to Mugabes sister. He would be chauffeured in limousines around Romania.\n\nMachacha also alleged that Geza had tricked FRELIMO soldiers during a military operation in Mozambique by intoxicating them, then stealing engines from their Scania trucks and smuggling them into Zimbabwe. He said:\n\nGeza would get the FRELIMO soldiers drunk and then steal the engines from their Scania trucks, which he would smuggle back into Zimbabwe.\n\nIn addition, Machacha accused Geza of raiding white commercial farmers cattle during the land reform program and taking control of abattoirs, where he slaughtered and sold the stolen cattle. He further alleged that Geza looted diamonds during the Chiadzwa diamond rush while serving as a security officer for Mbada Diamonds.\n\nLastly, Machacha suggested that Gezas fallout with President Mnangagwa began when he was disqualified from running in the 2018 elections for the Sanyati constituency due to a pending rape case involving a local schoolgirl.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nTemba Mliswa, the former ZANU PF Mashonaland West Provincial Chairman, has strongly defended President Emmerson Mnangagwa, asserting that the ruling party frontman is in excellent health.\n\nThe comments followed a video from Mnangagwas speech at the 3rd Africa Education Summit 2025 in Victoria Falls, which quickly gained attention on social media.\n\nIn the clip, Mnangagwa is seen delivering humorous remarks and making light-hearted gestures in Shona, leaving some international attendees confused by the playful tone.\n\nThe viral video sparked accusations from Jealousy Mawarire, who criticized Mnangagwas inner circle for taking advantage of him. Mawarire suggested that Mnangagwa should remain in office instead of being advised to step down and take rest.\n\nIn response to these assertions, Mliswa took to X (formerly Twitter) on Monday to assert that Mnangagwa is neither frail nor unwell. He emphasized that the president remains mentally sharp for his age. Mliswa wrote:\n\nAfter the Geza uprising fizzled out, some people have started spreading stories of a fragile and sick president. Let me clarify: these rumors are far from the truth. The president is as sharp as ever for someone of his age.\n\nYou cant just create a narrative and expect people to believe it. While its natural to have differing opinions, its more productive to focus on strengthening your own party or campaign rather than attacking an elected leader with baseless claims.\n\nI had the opportunity to interact with the president recently at an event at his farm, and he was full of energy. He even danced to traditional music, which is hardly the behavior of someone unwell.\n\nIve never been one to engage in sycophantic behavior, even during my time as an MP. My criticism of the government has always been constructive. The difference is that those who accuse me of bootlicking thrive on negativity and insults, something I refuse to engage in.\n\nThe narrative of the president being sick is completely unfounded. Just recently, at the education conference in Victoria Falls, he made a joke that fit perfectly within the context of his speech.\n\nHowever, those who werent present selectively edited the video and used it to claim that hes incompetent. Who does that? For those of us who were there, including foreign guests, the meaning was clear and had nothing to do with some amateur psychological analysis.\n\nYou cant manipulate a story by cherry-picking facts to suit your agenda, just as you cant edit a video out of context and claim it proves something it doesnt. The president is well aware of his health, which is why he has hinted at stepping down in 2028.\n\nSpreading false narratives wont hasten his exit. Those with political insight should focus on building real grassroots support. Get involved with communities and prepare for 2028 elections instead of hiding behind social media and telling comforting lies.\n\nThe opposition has been trapped in this cycle for years, thinking that the 180,000 people on X represent the whole country. When the elections come, theyll be in for a rude awakening. Right now, as someone once said, the opposition is dead as a dodo.\n\nFor those overseas, stop relying on false claims about the presidents health. Instead, start making plans to return home and vote. Living on a foundation of deception and unfulfilled promises wont get you far. Its time to create your own path.\n\n",

            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda-Information Minister Jenfan Muswere is facing backlash from within Zanu PF for allegedly bypassing internal party procedures.\n\nIn a strongly worded letter dated7 April2025Zanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa effectivelyfiredMuswere, accusing him of using state mediato prematurely announce party election results without properauthorisation.\n\nIn the letteraddressedto Muswere, Mutsvangwa lambasted the minister for allegedly bypassing party procedures by allowing state broadcaster ZBC andThe Heraldto announceWomensLeague provincial election results before the partyhadofficially ratified them.The electionswere heldin Manicaland onApril 6.\n\nDescribing the announcement asirregularand an attempt toupend standard internal consultations,Mutsvangwa wrote that the statement aired and published by Muswere wasof no consequence.\n\nHe warned that the correct and final position would only be communicated by his departmentas therightful party mouthpieceeffectively challengingMusweresauthority and overstepping into ministerial turf.\n\nBehind this clash lies a deeper political contest.\n\nChristopher Mutsvangwa, who claims to be a war veteran, has, in recent years,positioned himself as a power broker and potential presidential contender.\n\nThough he has not openly declared his intentions, his increasing assertiveness in party affairs and sharp political commentary hasbeen interpretedas part of a campaign to carve out a post-Mnangagwa path for himself.\n\nInsiders say Mutsvangwa is emboldened by factional fractures within Zanu PF, especially as President Emmerson Mnangagwa faces growing opposition over his controversial push to extend his term beyond 2028.\n\nMutsvangwais believedto be rallying support among war veterans and the disenchanted elitewho view him as a more charismatic alternative toMnangagwasincreasingly authoritarian rule.\n\nOnce seen as a close ally of Mnangagwa,Mutsvangwasrelationship with the president has grown cold, especially amid whispers that Mnangagwa is grooming younger loyalists like Muswere while sidelining seasoned war veterans.\n\nSources within the party allege that Mutsvangwa has long felt betrayed by Mnangagwa, who he helped ascend to power in the aftermath of the 2017 military coup that ousted Robert Mugabe.\n\nThe friction hasbeen compoundedby competing networks of patronage and a toxic mix of personal and political scandals.\n\nOne of the most salaciousand damagingrumours fuelling the rift involves claims that Monica Mutsvangwa,Christopherswife and a senior Zanu PF official in her own right, once had an intimate relationship with Mnangagwa that allegedly resulted in a child.\n\nWhile the claim has never been substantiated andis widely seenas political gossip, its circulation inbothinternal party discussions and dissident online platforms has intensified the hostility between thetwocamps.\n\nJenfan Muswere, the youthful Minister of Information and Zanu PF MP forMakoni,is perceived to beMnangagwasprotg.\n\nHis growing prominenceespecially in state mediahas made him a target for Mutsvangwa, who sees Muswere as a threat to his influence and a symbol ofMnangagwasefforts to bypass traditional party structures.\n\nMuswere wants to be a Mnangagwa darlingandMutsvangwa is not happy about that,a senior Zanu PF official confided.This is no longer about media policyitsabout who controls the narrative as Mnangagwa tries to outflank his opponents inside the party.\n\nThe letter to Muswere may be the clearest sign yet that Mutsvangwais doneplaying nice.\n\nBy flexing his authority as the official party spokesperson, Mutsvangwa is reasserting control over internal communications while sending a chilling warning to those he views as presidential lackeys.\n\nAs Zanu PF heads toward a potentially explosive elective congress, the battle lines between the war veteran class andMnangagwasinner circle arebeing drawnever more clearly.\n\n",
