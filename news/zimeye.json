            "content": "I was rummaging through my modest library and stumbled upon some interesting facts about the late Dr Dumiso Dabengwa.\n\nSometime in 1988 he fielded questions.A journalist asked, Do you think your contribution in the struggle has been appreciated? For instance, do you think if you died, you would be buried at Heroes Acre?Dumiso Dabengwa: (Chuckle) I made my contribution to liberate my country. It got its independence, and that ends there. All that I look forward to is to see the country develop- to see the ideals for which we struggled recognised and put into practice.\n\nJournalist: Do you feel bitter with the authorities over your arrest and detention, or is there any mutual bitterness between you and them?\n\nDD. I did as any human being would have done. I had my own bitterness about the way I was treated. But I did not-and still do not- begrudge anybody because I think in the first place somehow, somewhere, someone was misled and failed to realise our complete innocence in all the allegations made against us.\n\nI was shattered when news started filtering in that Dr Dumiso Dabengwa had passed on. His death robbed Zimbabwe of a formidable voice of reason and moderation. Death be not proud. The late senior Zapu leader and Zipra commander was a man of courage and moderation and his demise left a permanent void in Zimbabwe.\n\nI was never close to him, but what I know is mostly gleaned from secondary sources, largely from comrades who served under him during the protracted liberation struggle.\n\nAll of them without exception have expressed much admiration and regard for the revered fallen hero.\n\nI vividly recall intensely following his Treason Trial on BBC Focus on Africa for updates and any developments. I also checked The Newsweek and Time magazines.\n\nI was overcome with anger and desperation when Dumiso Dabengwa and his colleagues were detained after acquittal by the highest court in the land.\n\nThat sombre day will remain ingrained in my memory for a long time. They had to languish at Chikurubi Maximum Prison for many years at the pleasure of the Prime Minister Robert Mugabe.\n\nEven the late Zapu leader Dr Joshua Nkomo during the launch of his memoirs in London, Nkomo: The Story of My Life, expressed his disgust and dismay at the continued detention of top Zipra commanders after their acquittal by the courts. They were eventually released after spending almost half a decade at the notorious Chikurubi prison.\n\nSadly, General Lookout Masuku did not survive the prison years. He died in chains.\n\nThe vindictive Zanu PF regime had callously turned down the Zapu request to temporarily release Dabengwa to bury his friend and colleague General Lookout Masuku. The late Zimbabwe National Army Deputy Commander General Lookout Masuku was eventually laid to rest at Lady Stanley Cemetery in the outskirts of Bulawayo city.\n\nMy first encounter with Dumiso Dabengwa was at Large City Hall during a performance by Amandla Cultural Ensemble. I got an opportunity to greet him and wish him well as he had just been released from detention.\n\nThe second time was in South Africa through Joshua Mhambi. I dropped everything that day to meet DD. I had some burning questions related to the exile years in Zambia, execution of the liberation struggle and his wasted years in Mugabes jail. He was candid and forthright in his responses. Dr Dabengwa was a national asset and an inexhaustible fountain of knowledge and wisdom.\n\nThe meeting started early in the evening and stretched until morning.That same night, we had our tea moment with President Jacob Zuma at his house.\n\nAlthough Dr Dumiso Dabengwa sadly passed away a few years ago, his memories will linger on forever. He was a true liberation hero and consistently upheld the values and ethos of the liberation struggle as espoused by the late ZAPU leader Dr Joshua Nkomo and his peers.\n\nDumiso Dabengwa was laid to rest next to His Mother and Father in Ntabazinduna. A Memorial Service was held today in Ntabazinduna,\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent | ZimEye | Harare  23 May 2025  More than eight armed men were Friday dispatched in a targeted operation to track down four Zimbabweans behind a petition recently submitted to the military demanding President Emmerson Mnangagwas immediate retirement.\n\nThe dramatic move follows the submission earlier this week of a formal petition to the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF), calling for Mnangagwas removal on grounds of incapacitation and corruption. The document, stamped and acknowledged by military officials, has reportedly unsettled the President and triggered high-level security responses.\n\nZimEye understands that Gomwes mother was abducted Friday evening at around 8pm from her home in Budiriro, Harare, and transported to her sons rural homestead in Zvimba. The operation is part of an ongoing manhunt for Gifford Gomwe, one of the petitions main authors, alongside Tawanda Jena, Rose Chirenje, and Sarudzai Rushwaya.\n\nThe President, who has not publicly commented on the matter, is accused of instructing the armed men.\n\nHis spokesperson George Charamba appeared to weigh in cryptically via social media, directing a jab at ZimEye editor and the Gold Mafia documentary researching founder Simba Chikanza, tweeting: Hauneti here nhai Simba  WHEN DO YOU GET TIRED?\n\nPresident Mnangagwa operates a zero tolerance to dissenting voices policy with which he states that anyone opposing the extension of his presidential term will have their days on earth reduced as a consequence.\n\nOn their way from Harare to Zvimba, the unnamed men decided to dump Gomwes 72 year old mother, Edna Musarurwa.\n\nWhen they took my mother from Harare when they were approaching Norton at Karina, they dunpled her near the road block thats close to the Norton police station, Gomwe told ZimEye.\n\nHe continued saying, This is now a clear abduction case that is being arranged by a small group in the ruling upper class.\n\nHauneti here nhai Simba?????\n\nMeanwhile, sources confirm that the original petition remains secured and untampered with in military files. The contents invoke Section 212 of the Constitution, a clause empowering the defence forces to uphold the Constitution, peace, and rule of law.\n\nMilitary insiders say the petition is being treated internally as a quasi-legal instrument  a lawsuit against Mnangagwa  and has generated significant support among mid- and lower-ranking officers. The President is reportedly furious that ZDF officials received the document without rejecting it.\n\nThe latest clampdown mirrors a similar operation carried out against activist Blessed Geza in March, in what analysts see as a widening attempt to silence dissenters and prevent a military-political shift.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa was reached for comment.\n\nGomwes whereabouts where unclear at the time of writing, although he briefly notified ZimEye hinting he is safe, though unsettled.\n\nThe ministry of defence was reached for comment and none was availed at the time of writing.

            "content": "By A Correspondent- Hundreds of families in Donnybrook Chizhanje, Mabvuku, face imminent eviction after the government issued a directive ordering them to vacate the area by the end of the month.\n\nThe eviction has reignited fears of a return toOperation Murambatsvina, the 2005 mass demolition campaign that left over 700,000 Zimbabweans homeless.\n\nThe land in question is claimed by Shelter Zimbabwe, a private land developer suspected of having long-standing ties to top ZANU PF politicians.\n\nShelter Zimbabwe has accused so-called land barons of illegally subdividing and selling housing stands to desperate home seekers.\n\nThe developer argues that the settlements violate the Regional, Town, and Country Planning Act, and insists that the land was never approved for residential use.\n\nAccording to residents, the evictions come after years of uncertainty and broken promises. Many purchased their stands from politically connected land barons operating under the guise of community development.\n\nThese middlemen, often protected by ruling party officials, sold the stands without formal title deeds or municipal approval.\n\nShelter Zimbabwes ownership of the land traces back to a controversial allocation process during Zimbabwes land reform era, when vast tracts of peri-urban land were handed to politically aligned developers under opaque circumstances.\n\nSeveral directors of Shelter Zimbabwe are said to have close personal and business ties to senior ZANU PF officials, raising concerns that the evictions are part of a broader political and economic strategy to consolidate urban land control.\n\nIn many such cases, residents say they were encouraged by ZANU PF-linked cooperatives and ward leaders to regularize their occupation through small payments, with promises that the land would eventually be formally approved. They told us to build and that the party was working on our papers, said a Mabvuku resident, who now fears losing her home.\n\nThe Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) confirmed the dispute and issued a stern warning to home seekers.\n\nThe looming demolitions have stirred painful memories ofMurambatsvina, which the United Nations once described as a violation of international law. With elections behind them, critics say the ruling party is now clamping down on settlements it once tolerated for votes.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of Donnybrook Chizhanje are pleading for intervention and a halt to the demolitions. We built our homes here because we had nowhere else to go. If they destroy our houses, where do they expect us to live? asked another resident.\n\n",

            "content": "THIRD EYE ANALYSISTrumps White House Meeting Backfires: Malemas Rise, Ramaphosas Poise, and South Africas Global SpotlightBy Dr. Raymond Chamba\n\nIn a world thats increasingly defined by spectacle, symbolism, and seismic political realignments, the recent White House engagements between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Cyril Ramaphosa may have just redrawn the global political canvasunexpectedly handing Julius Malema a golden coronation.\n\nLet me take a different view on what has just unfolded.\n\nWhat we witnessed was not merely a diplomatic courtesy call or the airing of grievances about South African farm murders. No. This moment spiraled far beyond its intended script. It became a global catalyst. The South African cause has now gone planetary. And as the world hurtles toward the 2028 election cycle in both South Africa and the United States, this spectacle revealed deeper truths: ideological confrontations are becoming existential, not just electoral.\n\nA Clash of Worldsand Orders\n\nThe Trump doctrine, now in its second iteration, is no longer just a clash of culturesits a declaration of indifference to everything that does not serve immediate, transactional self-interest. In that worldview, decency, continuity, and diplomacy are foreign concepts. Trumps America is not just post-truthit is post-ally, post-principle, and dangerously post-moral.\n\nBut President Ramaphosas handling of this moment was nothing short of remarkable. With calm dignity, restraint, and strategic clarity, Ramaphosa did not only address Trump. He addressed the world. Rama-poise was on full displaystatesmanship in the face of provocation.\n\nAnd in that quiet, deliberate grace, he may have unintentionally elevated his most vocal domestic rival.\n\nMalema: Anointed by Absence, Empowered by the Spectacle\n\nJulius Malema was not in the room, but somehow he emerged as the central figure. The corporate-political elite pushing a Government of National Unity (GNU) in South Africa may seek to sideline the rabble rousers of the EFF and MK Party, but this White House moment turned that strategy on its head.\n\nThe message sentperhaps unintentionallywas clear: Malema is inevitable.In trying to control the narrative, the establishment handed it to him for free.\n\nHe doesnt need to fight for visibility anymore. The world saw, the lights dimmed, and the stage was set. What we witnessed was a silent coronation, conducted with the very gravitas that elite institutions thought they had reserved for more acceptable leaders.\n\nAnd now? He shall never lack friends. He shall never lack resources.\n\nThe Global Reverberations\n\nThis isnt just about South Africa. Everything that happens now, especially in the era of instantaneous digital consumption and surveillance, spills over borders. The struggle for Western democratic identitya contested, fragile, ongoing experimentis now playing out on African soil, too.\n\nIf American institutionsso historically selective in their moral judgmentscannot express unambiguous support for a stable South African center, then capital and influence will inevitably shift toward the forces they once feared. But heres the twist: those very forces now look attractive in a world tired of hypocrisy and double standards.\n\nInvestment will flownot just for profit, but for alignment. South Africa is now the global theatre of economic intrigue and political transformation.\n\nThe Soundtrack of a New Age: Grand Political Amapiano\n\nWe are entering a new realitya grand performance where politics is being choreographed to the rhythmic unpredictability of Amapiano. Noisy, layered, youthful, rebellious, and unforgettable. South Africa is no longer on the periphery. It is the main stage.\n\nThe 2025 White House meeting crystallized the fights aheadin both South Africa and America. The traditional order underestimated the power of political optics in the age of algorithmic acceleration. They forgot that narratives now move faster than policy, and those who control symbolism control sentiment.\n\nWhether you hate him or love him, prepare yourselves for the idea of President Julius Malema. This was not the end of a chapter. It was the beginning of a new political genre.\n\nWe will watch. We will listen. Welcome to the Amapiano of global realignment.\n\nDr. Raymond ChambaThird Eye Commentary\n\n",

            "content": "BREAKING | YOU REMOVED THIS FROM SOMEWHERE: Reuben Barwe Slips, Sealing Wicknell Chivayos Fate in International Money Laundering Probe\n\n23 May 2025  Harare\n\nBy Farai D Hove | ZimEye | A dramatic new twist has emerged in the unfolding corruption saga surrounding Wicknell Chivayo  and this time, it comes from the most unexpected source: veteran state broadcaster Reuben Barwe himself.\n\nIn what was meant to be a cheerful thank-you message, Barwe  who acknowledged receiving a US$100,000 cash deposit and a vehicle from Chivayo  may have just delivered the most incriminating line of the year.\n\nMay where you have removed this be added more, Barwe says in the now-viral video, inadvertently confirming what investigators have long suspected: that the funds being paraded as gifts are not Chivayos legitimate earnings, but likely siphoned from public or illicit sources.\n\nThe phrase  removed this from somewhere  is being dissected across legal and diplomatic circles, where it is being interpreted as a public admission that the money in question came from an undisclosed and potentially criminal origin.\n\nA GIFT OR A LAUNDERING DEVICE?\n\nChivayo, already under investigation by South Africas Financial Intelligence Centre for laundering R1 billion in public funds, has been flaunting extravagant donations to high-profile figures  including church leaders, musicians, and now journalists  in what many believe to be an elaborate laundering operation masked as philanthropy.\n\nBut with Barwes gaffe now immortalized on video, the case for criminal prosecution just received its smoking gun.\n\nThe statement is damning, said one legal analyst. It confirms that even the recipients of these funds suspect  and publicly admit  that the source of the money is dubious. Thats not generosity. Thats money laundering in slow motion.\n\nINTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS\n\nInternational observers say this latest development could finally seal Chivayos fate. His activities now risk triggering an Interpol Red Notice or coordinated cross-border arrest under existing treaties on transnational financial crimes.\n\nWhat began as a performative public giveaway  wrapped in designer clothes, Rolls Royces, and religious platitudes  is rapidly unraveling into a global criminal liability.\n\nAlready, financial intelligence agencies in Europe and SADC member states have begun reviewing asset transfers and potential shell companies connected to Chivayos donations, with Barwes careless confirmation giving them ammunition to fast-track asset seizure and movement restrictions.\n\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL CONSENT ANGLE\n\nEven more alarming is Barwes comment that the President consented to the gift. If proven true, this could rope Zimbabwes highest office into complicity  or at minimum, knowledge  of the circulation of possibly laundered money through public institutions and individuals.\n\nThat line alone could trigger further scrutiny from international sanctions monitors and diplomatic watchdogs concerned about state capture and elite impunity in Zimbabwe.\n\nA SELF-INFLICTED COLLAPSE\n\nFor all his showboating, Wicknell Chivayo may now be watching his carefully curated empire collapse under the weight of his own ego  and the loose tongue of a 40-year state media loyalist.\n\nReuben Barwe was supposed to offer validation. Instead, he delivered a confession.\n\nAnd with that, the doors to international prosecution may have just been flung wide open.\n\nDeveloping story. More to follow as global authorities respond.\n\nYes, I want to acknowledge that Sir Wicknell deposited US$100,000 into my account and on top of the vehicle which he donated to me today. I want to thank him for his generosity. And Ive been in service over 40 years, working for this country, being put on sanctions by the Americans and by the Europeans, but I stood first. And it is this young man who later on recognized that this man has been persistent, consistent for over 40 years, defending Zimbabwes interests on the box. And Im very grateful. I also thank him and the President of the Republic for consenting that I should get this gift. Well appreciated, Sir Wicknell.\n\n[thank you] for the gift which you have given me, a vehicle and $100,000, I have just consented to it today. May where you have removed this be added more. I appreciate that you have recognized me from the time when you were in grade two, as you said, that you actually knew my signature, Reuben Barwe, ZBC News, Harare. And Im very grateful for having these two gifts. These are life-changing. Thank you very much.\n\n",

The Chiwengas effortlessly stole the limelight, drawing admiration from dignitaries, cultural practitioners, and members of the public.\n\nThis latest public appearance reflects more than a nod to heritage.\n\nIt is the latest in a series of calculated moves by Chiwenga to craft a refined public image, one far removed from the hard military persona of his past.\n\nIn recent years,the former army general has rebranded himself as a polished statesman.\n\nHis classy wedding to the eloquent and fashion-savvy Miniyothabo in 2022 set a new tone for his public life.\n\nSince then, Chiwenga has regularly appeared in designer suits, traditional regalia, and tailored cultural outfits that signal a deliberate shift from military fatigues to presidential polish.\n\nBut behind the glamour lies deep political intrigue.\n\nChiwenga is the man wholed the military coup in 2017that toppled long-time ruler Robert Mugabe, paving the way for Mnangagwas rise to power.\n\nYet, insiders say he was merely used by Mnangagwa to remove Mugabeandonly to be sidelined soon after.\n\nNow, Chiwenga appears to be slowly repositioning himself for a return tocentrestage.\n\nWhile state media reported the Chiredzi event as a celebration of cultural identity,Zanu PFs online propagandists, known as Varakashi, were quick to spin Chiwengas presence as an endorsement of Mnangagwas increasingly contested 2030 agenda, a bid to remain in office beyond the constitutional two-term limit.\n\nButsources close to the Vice President insist that nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThis was not about 2030. Chiwenga is carefully reminding the nationand the partywho he is and where he came from, said one source. He knows how Mnangagwa used him. This was about visibility, legacy, and power.\n\nThe symbolism of launching Cultural Month in full traditional attire, in front of war veterans and liberation figures, was not lost on observers.\n\nIt was a subtle but powerful message:Chiwenga remains rooted in the liberation ethos, yet he isalsoprepared to lead a modern, culturally grounded Zimbabwe.\n\nWith growing unease within Zanu PF over Mnangagwas succession plan and reports of factional tension mounting, Chiwengas moves are being closely watched, not justfor their fashion statements, but for theirpolitical signals.\n\nOne thing is clear:hes no longer just the general in uniform. Hes dressing for the presidency.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nCHIREDZI  President Emmerson Mnangagwa has called on Zimbabweans to take pride in their country and heritage, urging citizens to embrace unity and celebrate the nations cultural diversity.\n\nSpeaking during the launch of the National Culture Month commemorations at Rusununguko Clinic in Chiredzi District, Masvingo Province, the ZANU PF leader emphasized the importance of national identity and patriotism in shaping a resilient society.\n\nBe proud of your country, be proud of your heritage, Mnangagwa said. Cultural diversity is meant to unite people, not divide them. Let us continue to celebrate our roots and values as Zimbabweans.\n\nThe event, which ran under the theme Celebrating Indigenous Voice, brought together traditional leaders, government officials, artists, and community members to reflect on the countrys cultural richness and promote inclusivity.\n\nMnangagwa also praised what he termed the achievements of the Second Republic in fostering national cohesion.\n\nThe Second Republic has made strides in uniting our people. We have opened up spaces for cultural expression and empowered communities to take ownership of their traditions, he claimed.\n\nCritics, however, argue that the governments repeated emphasis on unity often sidelines voices calling for political reforms and greater freedoms. Despite the presidents optimistic tone, some Zimbabweans view such declarations as attempts to paper over deep-seated divisions and economic struggles affecting ordinary citizens.\n\nNonetheless, the president remained resolute in his message of cultural pride and patriotism.\n\nOur heritage defines who we are. As a nation, we must promote our languages, customs, and traditional practices to ensure that future generations know where they come from, Mnangagwa told the crowd.\n\nAs the commemorations continue throughout May, the government has pledged to support artists, cultural institutions, and indigenous knowledge systemsthough many await to see if those promises will translate into tangible action.\n\n",
