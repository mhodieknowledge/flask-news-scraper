            "content": "Highway accidents are a serious and ongoing issue, with many lives lost or severely impacted due to preventable causes. A key factor contributing to these accidents is speeding. It has been proven that excessive speed is not only dangerous but can be fatal, affecting both the driver and passengers. The good news is that the solution lies in a simple but vital principle: adhering to speed limits.\n\nSpeed limits are set by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to ensure the safety of everyone on the road. These limits are based on the type of road, its condition, and its location, and they are clearly posted on highways to guide drivers. By following these speed limits, drivers can significantly reduce the risk of accidents, protecting not only themselves and their passengers but also pedestrians and other road users.\n\nThe Role of Speed Control Technology\n\nOne of the most effective ways to reduce accidents on highways is to ensure strict adherence to speed limits. However, this requires more than just signage. The government, through the Ministry of Road Transport, must ensure that the traffic control units are equipped with the necessary tools to monitor and enforce speed limits effectively. Speed radars, for example, are crucial for the proper enforcement of these limits. Just as a farmer cannot be expected to clear a field without the right tools, the same principle applies to traffic control. Speed limits cannot be properly enforced with the naked eye alone; modern tools are essential to ensure the safety of all road users.\n\nThe Need for Proper Equipment\n\nIt is essential that police and traffic control units are well-equipped with speed monitoring technology. Without proper tools like speed radars, the effectiveness of speed control is compromised. These tools allow for accurate measurement of a vehicles speed, which is critical in preventing accidents and saving lives. The governments responsibility is to ensure that these units are properly funded and equipped to carry out their duties effectively.\n\nAs a community, we must understand that safety is not solely the responsibility of law enforcement or the government. It is also up to each individual driver. We all play a part in making our roads safer. By adhering to the posted speed limits and being conscious of other road users, we can significantly reduce the number of accidents on highways.\n\nYour Safety Is in Your Hands\n\nUltimately, our safety on the road comes down to personal responsibility. Each driver has the power to make the roads safer by simply following speed limits and exercising caution. The consequences of speeding can be catastrophic, not just for the individual involved but for their passengers, other motorists, and pedestrians. By prioritizing safety and respecting the rules of the road, we all contribute to creating a safer environment for everyone.\n\nSo, remember: Your safety is your responsibility. Adhere to speed limits, stay alert, and encourage others to do the same. Together, we can reduce accidents on highways and save lives.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

The warm welcome extended to us by the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution in Mashonaland Central, Hon Magomo, made our visit pleasant.\n\nThe Expo saw us unpack various aspects of the work that the public and private sectors are doing to ensure that we meet our digital economy targets under Vision 2030.

Key feedback included emerging trends in child online safety, suggestions on measures to combat the abuse of social media as well and the importance of consultations with local communities before siting Community Information Centres.\n\nThis invaluable feedback will go a long way in shaping our implementation strategies for the Child Online Safety Policy, unpacking the Cyber and Data Protection Act and its regulations, as well as our policies in deploying Community Information Centres soon to be rebranded digital centers. Concerns about network unavailability in areas such as Matepatepa, Muzura, Ruya Falls and other places were also noted and communicated to the relevant telco players for actioning.\n\nAs part of our efforts to walk the talk about leaving no one and no place behind, the Ministry of ICT, Postal and Courier Services, in collaboration with POTRAZ, donated computers, a projector, a printer and a whiteboard to Chipadze Drug and Substance Detoxification Centre.

His movement has gained traction among disgruntled citizens, war veterans, and opposition activists who accuse Mnangagwa of consolidating power at the expense of economic stability and democratic freedoms.\n\nThe ZRP has issued a stern warning to motorists, stating that any vehicle operating without displayed number plates willbe impoundedin accordance withtheVehicle Registration and Licensing Act (Chapter 13:14).\n\nIn a statement issued on Friday, 28 March, ZRP spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said impounded vehicles would only be released after completing the necessary registration processes with the relevant authorities.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police reminds the public that any vehicle moving on the countrys roads without displaying number plates, as required under theVehicle Registration and Licensing Act (Chapter 13:14),will be impounded in line with the law.\n\nSuch vehicles will only be released after the necessary registration processhasbeen conductedwith the relevant authorities.\n\nThisapplies to all vehicleswhether family-owned, public, company, government, or private-owned.

            "content": "Pastor Chris Oyakhilome Calls for Fast to Save Zimbabwe from Satan Amid Uebert Angels Controversial Shadow\n\nHarare, Zimbabwe  March 29, 2025, 08:40 AM GMTBy Dorrothy Moyo | Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, the influential Nigerian televangelist and founder of Christ Embassy, has called for a nationwide fast in Zimbabwe on Sunday, March 31, 2025. Oyakhilome claims the country is under threat from Satans modus operandi due to a planned demonstration on the same day, which he warns will not be peaceful and risks plunging the nation into chaos. His remarks, delivered in a video circulated by Zimbabwean government spokesman Nick Mnangagwa, stand in stark contrast to the actions of his own protg, Uebert Angel, whose violent religious practices and alleged criminal enterprises have cast a long shadow over the region.\n\nOyakhilomes impassioned plea comes amid escalating tensions in Zimbabwe, where citizens are reeling from economic hardship and governance issues. In the video, he urges Zimbabwean Christians to fast and pray for your country to thwart what he describes as a devilish plot to destabilize the nation. Dont let the devil take over your country, he declares. These smart talkers who say theyre going to fix your countrywhere have they been? This call to arms, this invitation to uprisings, is not the solution. Its a deception.\n\nYet, Oyakhilomes call for spiritual intervention rings hollow to many observers, given his close ties to Uebert Angel, a self-proclaimed prophet implicated in the notorious Goldmafia scandal. Angel, Oyakhilomes spiritual mentee, has been accused of orchestrating money laundering schemes that siphon public funds from African nations, including Zimbabwe, to destabilize governmentsa practice allegedly dating back to Kenya in 1992. Far from fasting to protect Zimbabwe, Angels actions have arguably contributed to its woes, raising questions about Oyakhilomes silence on his protgs transgressions.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, viral videos have recently surfaced showing Angel instructing his followers to carry out violent night raids on critics, including journalists. In one chilling clip, Angel references the biblical figure Phineas, saying, Without praying, Phineas took a knife and stabbed the men he saw committing adultery. He goes further, urging his followers in Shona, Munhu anongoda kurohwa mbama, zvekuti anyorereyi ichi, zvekunamata tombosiya!translated as, Wayward reporters should be beaten or thrashed without hesitation, prayers be damned! Angel even assures his enforcers, Do you think Ill let you rot in jail if youre jailed for me? No, I wont! These revelations paint a picture of a man whose religious fervor is matched only by his penchant for brutalitya stark contrast to Oyakhilomes call for peace and prayer.\n\nThe Goldmafia scandal, which implicated Angel in a sprawling web of corruption, has already damaged economies across Africa, with Zimbabwe among the hardest hit. Angel recently claimed he fears assassination if he returns to the United Kingdom, where authorities are probing his role in the illicit gold trade. Yet, Oyakhilome has conspicuously avoided addressing Angels actions, instead framing the March 31 demonstration as the true threat to Zimbabwes stability. Critics argue this selective outrage exposes a troubling hypocrisy: while Oyakhilome warns of selfish people who want to take over the country, his own mentee stands accused of doing just that through illicit means.\n\nZimbabweans on social media have expressed outrage over Oyakhilomes remarks, with many pointing to Angels $15 million donation to Oyakhilomes ministry last year as evidence of a compromised allegiance. He cares nothing for Zimbabweans, protecting his spiritual son, a looter and fraudster, one X user posted. Another questioned, Pastor Chris is talking Zim politics because Uebert Angel has fed him gibberishwheres the justice in that?\n\nAs the March 31 demonstration looms, Oyakhilomes call for a fast has ignited a firestorm of debate. Is he genuinely concerned for Zimbabwes soul, or is he shielding a mentee whose violent and corrupt practices have arguably done more to harm the nation than any protest could? With Angels shadow looming large, Oyakhilomes spiritual rhetoric risks being drowned out by the clanging reality of his protgs deeds. For now, Zimbabweans are left to weigh the words of a pastor against the actions of his discipleand decide who, if anyone, truly speaks for their salvation.\n\nDont  let the devil take over your country.You have to understand Satans Modus OperandiIts a deception..@PastorChrisLivepic.twitter.com/Td0tF72dqt\n\n",

            "content": "28 March 2025 | Harare\n\nBy Farai D Hove | ZimEye | In what is being described as a politically motivated act of terror, the home of prominent anti-corruption war veteran Blessed Geza was petrol-bombed late last night by unknown assailants, marking a dangerous escalation in Zimbabwes rapidly deteriorating political climate.\n\nImages shared early this morning show Gezas house severely burned, with visible charring across walls, destroyed roofing, and debris scattered across the property. WhatsApp messages circulating since dawn confirm the incident occurred under the cover of darkness, with witnesses reporting gunfire, wire-cutting tools, and petrol bombs thrown into the home.\n\nImba yaGeza yarohwa manheru  iii yatove hondo iyi, guys, reads one message.\n\n(Gezas house was attacked last night  this is now war, guys.)\n\nAnother message adds:\n\nVangoridzirwa pfuti vakanda ma petrol bomb mumba vaita wire yekucheka,\n\n(They were shot at petrol bombs were thrown into the house the attackers cut wire fencing.)\n\nNo injuries have been reported, but occupants of the property reportedly fled for their lives as flames engulfed the building. The attack comes just three days before the 31 March demonstrations  a mass action being organized to demand President Emmerson Mnangagwas resignation following widespread public anger over constitutional violations and elite impunity.\n\nWhy Geza?\n\nBlessed Geza is no ordinary citizen. A respected liberation war veteran, he has in recent years become an outspoken anti-corruption crusader, known for exposing state-linked scandals and criticizing both government excess and military interference in civilian affairs. He has drawn the ire of ZANU-PF elites and shadowy state actors by calling out top-level abuses  particularly within the security sector.\n\nAnalysts say the attack on his home is no coincidence, coming just days after the unconstitutional sacking of General Anselem Sanyatwe and amid suspicions that a purge is underway targeting dissenting voices within both the military and veteran community.\n\nThis is a clear message. They are warning anyone who speaks out, said one veteran who requested anonymity. But Geza is a fighter. Theyve only made him stronger.\n\nState of Fear: From Crisis to Open Conflict?\n\nThe symbolic and physical assault on Gezas home underscores a broader fear gripping the nation  that rule of law has collapsed, and targeted political violence is escalating in the face of a citizen movement demanding justice.\n\nJust this week, President Mnangagwa was accused of breaching the Constitution by illegally removing General Sanyatwe from command and appointing him to a civilian Cabinet post, in what many see as a panic move to protect himself from arrest or prosecution. Now, activists and whistleblowers like Geza appear to be paying the price for standing in the regimes way.\n\nYatova hondo iyi, one message repeated across dozens of groups warns.\n\n(This is now war.)\n\nWhat Next?\n\nNo arrests have been made, and police have not issued a statement on the attack. Civil society groups and war veterans associations are demanding an urgent investigation, though many doubt whether state institutions can be trusted to deliver impartial justice.\n\nAs the 31 March deadline approaches, the attack on Blessed Geza is likely to galvanize public sentiment  not silence it. What was meant to send a warning may now spark a new wave of resistance.\n\nGeza, who has not yet spoken publicly about the incident, is expected to release a statement later today.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\nWar Veteran Blessed Gezas Home Petrol-Bombed in Midnight Attack\n\nHarare, Zimbabwe  In a brazen late-night attack, the home of Blessed Geza, a prominent war veteran and anti-corruption crusader, was petrol-bombed in the early hours of March 27, 2025. Multiple petrol bombs ignited the residence, causing extensive fire damage but fortunately no injuries. The incident  which witnesses describe as a coordinated assault under cover of darkness  has sent shockwaves through a nation already on edge amid political turmoil.\n\nGunfire, Flames and a Narrow Escape\n\nNeighbors were jolted awake by the sound of gunfire and explosions as armed assailants descended on Gezas property around midnight. We woke up to gunshots and saw flames engulfing part of the house, said one eyewitness in a WhatsApp message describing the chaotic scene. They cut through the wire fence and started shooting, then threw petrol bombs into the house. It was terrifying, but thankfully no one was hurt.\n\nAnother message from a person at the scene confirmed that Geza and his family escaped unharmed. No casualties, but the house is badly damaged, the message read, noting that walls were blackened and windows shattered by the blasts. Photos shared in community groups showed the charred remains of furniture and soot-stained walls  grim evidence of how quickly the firebombs turned parts of the home into an inferno.\n\nTargeted for His Anti-Corruption Stance\n\nBlessed Geza  a liberation war veteran and once a ZANU-PF insider  has become one of the governments most outspoken critics. In recent days, he publicly accused top officials of looting state resources and demanded accountability at the highest levels . Geza has also called for President Emmerson Mnangagwas resignation over rampant corruption and economic mismanagement, urging citizens to join nationwide protests on March 31 against the regime . This fiery anti-corruption crusade  which included naming several powerful businessmen and ministers as criminals around Mnangagwa  is widely believed to have made him a marked man .\n\nWhile no group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, suspicion immediately fell on political actors angered by Gezas crusade. Associates of Geza termed the attack an assassination attempt in all but name, pointing out that it occurred just hours after he vowed to intensify pressure on corrupt officials. This was not a random crime  it was a message, said a fellow war veteran aligned with Geza. They want to silence him. The attacks deliberate nature, timing, and target suggest a retaliatory political hit, observers say, rather than an ordinary crime or accident.\n\nEscalating Tensions Amid Leadership Struggle\n\nThe firebombing comes at a time of surging tensions in Zimbabwes political landscape. Only days ago, President Mnangagwa ignited controversy by unilaterally firing Lieutenant-General Anselem Sanyatwe, the commander of the army, in what analysts called an attempt to coup-proof his regime . Sanyatwes abrupt removal  seen by many as unconstitutional  angered factions within the security services and emboldened veterans like Geza who view it as part of Mnangagwas power-consolidation drive.\n\nMeanwhile, war veterans and opposition activists are mobilizing for mass demonstrations on March 31 to demand Mnangagwas departure, accusing him of driving Zimbabwe deeper into economic crisis and authoritarian rule . Geza has been a central figure in rallying these protests, saying that people of action will not back down until leadership changes occur. The government, for its part, has launched a heavy crackdown  cancelling police leave, increasing roadblocks, and denouncing Geza and his allies as traitorous agitators .\n\nWithin this combustible environment, the attack on Gezas home is being viewed as a flashpoint. It occurred amid a spate of politically-motivated incidents: in the past week, homes and properties linked to supporters of both Mnangagwa and his rivals have been attacked with arson and vandalism, reflecting an ominous tit-for-tat pattern . Just last week, Gezas rural farm in Sanyati was raided by armed men who stormed the property and vandalized buildings, hunting for his whereabouts and forcing his employees to flee into the night . The escalation from that incident to a full-fledged petrol bombing in the capital signals that the battle between rival camps has entered a dangerous new phase.\n\nChilling Message to Dissenters\n\nThis brazen attack on a high-profile anti-corruption figure is raising alarm about the breakdown of security and rule of law in Zimbabwe. If political figures and war veterans can be attacked in their homes with impunity, analysts warn, no one who speaks out is truly safe. War veteran Knox Chivero even claims death squads are now hunting down those who oppose Mnangagwas rule . Its a warning to all of us, said one opposition supporter, reacting to news of the bombing. If they can do this to Cde Geza, they can do it to anyone who challenges the system.\n\nRights groups and observers note that the use of petrol bombs and live ammunition in a residential neighborhood demonstrates a new level of lawlessness. The attack was carried out with military-style precision  cutting perimeter fences, coordinated gunfire, and a swift escape into the night  suggesting the perpetrators were no ordinary criminals. Police have not announced any arrests or suspects so far, fueling public perception that powerful forces might be protecting those responsible .\n\nAs Zimbabweans wake up to images of Blessed Gezas scorched home, there is palpable anger and fear in the air. Many see the bombing as a blunt attempt to intimidate government critics ahead of the March 31 protests. It underscores what opposition figures are calling a reign of terror meant to shore up Mnangagwas hold on power.\n\nGeza himself has remained defiant. He had not fully commented at the time of writing, but relatives spoke to ZimEye over the incident.\n\nWith the clock ticking down to the planned demonstrations, Zimbabwes political crisis appears to be entering uncharted territory. The overnight petrol bombing of Blessed Gezas home has not only highlighted the personal risks faced by dissenters, but also sounded an alarm bell about the lengths to which elements of the embattled regime  or its rivals  may go. In a country scarred by past political violence, this incident is a stark reminder that the struggle over Zimbabwes future is spilling dangerously into the streets and doorsteps of its citizens.\n\n",
