            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe trial of Alpha Media Holdings journalist Blessed Mhlanga and HSTV general manager Olga Muteiwa has been postponed to July 31 after the investigating officer failed to appear in court due to illness.\n\nMhlanga and Muteiwa are being charged with transmitting messages allegedly inciting violence or damage to property. The charges relate to their coverage of press conferences held by war veteran and former Zanu-PF Central Committee member Blessed Runesu Geza on January 27 and February 11 this year.\n\nTestifying in court on Tuesday, Detective Edmore Nyazamba claimed the broadcasts posed a threat to national security. He said the two facilitated the dissemination of Gezas statements, which, in his view, had the potential to incite public unrest and encourage opposition to the government.\n\nNyazamba further alleged that the statements were shared online and on social media using professional media equipment. He also told the court that Mhlanga was in direct communication with Geza through X (formerly Twitter) callscommunications he said could not be easily intercepted.\n\nAccording to the detective, Mhlanga admitted that Geza had arranged transport for him and his crew to attend the press events. However, Mhlanga said he could not disclose the location without Muteiwas consent.\n\nWhen the trial began, both Mhlanga and Muteiwa entered not guilty pleas.\n\nMhlangas lawyer, Chris Mhike, argued that the charges against his client were baseless, stating that Mhlanga neither owns nor directs HSTV, nor does he have access to its broadcasting systems or accounts. Mhike insisted his client did not use any computer systems to transmit the contested material.\n\nMuteiwa, represented by Beatrice Mtetwa, also denied the charges, saying the allegations were flawed and did not constitute a legal offence. She dismissed claims that the broadcasts incited violence, pointing out that while Geza had called for President Mnangagwas removal during the press briefings, this did not amount to incitement under the law.\n\nThe State maintains that by livestreaming the events on HSTV and YouTube, the accused breached legal provisions relating to the dissemination of inflammatory content.\n\n",

The label on the seat reads Pfungwa-chair, suggesting a deep-rooted dependence on cunning, manipulation, and psychological control in his leadership style. He is dressed in a suit and scarf bearing the Zimbabwean flag colours, reinforcing his role as head of state.\n\nOn his right stands Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, in militaristic garb, firmly clutching an AK-47. He represents Pfuti (the gun), the militarised force that props up political power and enforces it through violence. His face is drawn in an enraged or determined expression, and his speech bubble reveals brutal intentions:\n\nED, youve wasted 60 years on Pfungwa. Ive invested in Pfuti. Ill kill her kids watching.\n\nThis chilling threat is directed at an implied enemyMarry Mubaiwa, Chiwengas estranged ex-wife, of whom the VP has in real life been accused of attempting to kill her and separate her from their children. In this fictionalized narrative, Chiwenga views any pursuit of justice or thought-based strategy as weakness, opting instead for raw militarised violence.\n\nThe 1980 TV Set Reference:\n\nTo the left of the cartoon sits a vintage TV labelled 1980, displaying Robert Mugabe running into a jet labelled Maputo List. The caption on screen:\n\nED: Bob go to Moza, the whites want to kill you.  MARCH 1980\n\nThis is a historical callback to the transitional period just before Zimbabwes independence when Mugabe fled to Mozambique. Mnangagwa, portrayed here as always pulling strings behind the scenes, is shown urging Mugabe to flee under the pretext of security. It suggests Mnangagwa has always maneuvered others through manipulation, even before power was his.\n\nAbove Mnangagwas head, another speech bubble (from the past?) reads:\n\nSoko go to Marry, she wants to kill you, kikiki get busy decapitating her.\n\nThis is a grotesque parody of whispered advice, suggesting that Mnangagwa may have incited Chiwenga against his own wife, twisting personal conflicts into tools for political consolidation.\n\nUnderlying Themes:\n\nThe cartoon is not just a commentary on individuals. Its a damning allegory on the Zimbabwean state: where Pfungwa has failed to deliver justice, and Pfuti thrives on destroying itall while the nation watches, again, from a flickering black-and-white TV.\n\n",

            "content": " Diversifying the energy mix with solar\n\nBy Faith Zanda | Analysis |On June 30, 2025, Zambia inaugurated the 100MW Chisamba Solar Plant, developed by PowerChina. This gridconnected facility will supply electricity to First Quantum Minerals, freeing up local power capacity for households and businesses. It marks a major stride toward reducing dependency on hydropower and imported electricity .\n\nIn addition, a 60MW Itimpi Solar Power Station in Kitwe, privately developed by Copperbelt Energy Corporation, has been operational since April 2024, contributing significantly to grid resilience .\n\n Strengthening hydropower and grid infrastructure\n\nZESCO has also been upgrading smaller hydro facilities like the Chishimba Hydroelectric Power Station (~15MW), rehabilitated in the 2020s to improve reliability and reduce ruptures in regional supply .\n\n Tackling the hydropower shortfall\n\nChronic drought has led to low water levels in the Kariba Dam, Zambias main hydropower source. Reservoir levels dropped to critical lowsaround 10% usable waterwhich has led to rolling blackouts lasting 1417 hours daily . ZESCO extended emergency tariffs and sought electricity imports from the Southern African Power Pool to ease the pressure .\n\n Responding to technical outages\n\nIn instances of unexpected system faults, ZESCO crews have acted swiftly. For example, a nationwide grid disturbance in November 2024 left miners trapped undergroundbut power was restored to mines within hours and to households by early morning . ZESCO is also urging improved reporting of lengthy outages to fasttrack repairs ().\n\n Economic implications and policy direction\n\nPersistent power disruptions have hurt households and businesses alike. Droughtinduced outages drove households to rely on candles or generators, while MSMEs and manufacturers faced reduced productivity and revenue . In response, Zambia has begun expanding its energy infrastructure and embracing grid-enhancing technologies and diversified generation sources such as solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal .\n\n Outlook & next steps\n\n Solar capacity is rising:Chisamba (100MW) and Itimpi (60MW) projects are already active, with the Choma Solar Plant (+60MW plus batteries) expected by late 2025 ().\n\n Hydropower reliability is improving:Rehabilitation of small hydro stations is underway, and grid-enhancing technologies are being deployed to increase resilience ().\n\n Imports remain a buffer:Electricity imports and emergency tariffs continue to fill shortfalls while domestic capacity scales up.\n\nZambias approach to resolving its electricity crisis is multi-pronged: ramping up solar energy, refurbishing hydropower infrastructure, deploying smarter grid technologies, and importing power when necessary. While drought conditions still constrain hydropower, the rapid development of renewable assets and grid improvements suggest a promising path toward greater energy security.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent-President Emmerson Mnangagwas notorious business cartelpopularly known asZviganandais allegedly eyeing a hostile takeover of Harares lucrative commuter transport sector, with plans to ban commuter omnibuses (kombis) and pirate taxis, paving the way for cartel-linked transport monopolies.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume, who is aligned with opposition renegade Sengezo Tshabangu, is reportedly facilitating this agenda under the guise of urban renewal. The move is widely seen as a front for looting, backed by Mnangagwas administration.\n\nTheZviganandacartelso named for its shadowy blend of Zanu PF cronies and business elitesis already deeply embedded in corrupt state tenders, including the scandal-ridden Pomona waste deal. Their blueprint is simple: hijack public services, privatise them under state blessing, and extract maximum profit from desperate citizens.\n\nNow, they want the commuter omnibus sector.\n\nUnder Harares newly adopted 20252045 Master Plan, all kombis will be banned in the next three years, while pirate taxismishikashikaface immediate outlawing. Authorities argue this will reduce congestion and accidents. But behind the public relations spin lies a deeper plot: to replace small, independent transport operators with cartel-owned buses and services.\n\nInsiders say Mafumes council is acting on directives from Local Government ministry controlled by Mnangagwa. Tshabangu, who controversially seized control of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) in Parliament with suspected state backing, is also reportedly part of the wider effort to neutralise opposition-led municipalities and facilitate looting.\n\nCritics say this is a repeat of the COVID-19 era, when kombis were banned and the Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (Zupco)a state-linked entity with ties to Mnangagwas associatesbriefly monopolised urban transport, raking in profits while offering poor service.\n\nZviganandas fingerprints are all over this, said a council source. They are positioning to dominate the transport system the same way they took over refuse collection and construction contracts.\n\nTransport experts have slammed the plan as unrealistic and anti-poor. You cant ban kombis without providing alternatives, said Zimbabwe Union for Drivers and Conductors president Frederick Maguramhinga. People will be left stranded. This is not about sanityits about money.\n\nPassenger Association of Zimbabwe president Tafadzwa Goliath added: Council should focus on basicslike fixing public toilets and terminibefore dreaming of banning kombis.\n\nThe master plan also proposes banning three-wheeled taxis, demanding GPS data from ride-hailing firms, and pushing for a return of vehicle licensing to council controlanother potential revenue stream for the corrupt elite.\n\nIn reality, kombis transport over 50% of Harares commuters. Banning them without affordable alternatives will only deepen public hardship.\n\nThis latest manoeuvre underscores how Mnangagwas regime continues to hide looting and elite enrichment behind policy rhetoric, aided by captured councils and political puppets like Mafume and Tshabangu. WithZviganandanow circling Harares transport arteries, the future looks bleak for independent operatorsand for ordinary Zimbabweans who rely on them.\n\n",
