However, on January 29, he submitted a quote claiming a total cost of US$355.\n\nWhen the schools bursar contacted Gazaet (Pvt) Ltd for payment, the company refused to accept the money, disowning the quotation. A Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) investigation later revealed that the quotation was never issued by Gazaet and that its serial number did not match the companys official records.\n\nMaravanyika was arrested on February 27 and appeared in court the following day, represented by Advocate Militao. He was granted US$100 bail and ordered not to interfere with state witnesses, to reside at his given address, and to report to ZACC Gweru every fortnight. His trial is set to begin on March 20.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe ZANU PF Womens League has come under fire for what critics describe as a political move aimed at securing rural votes, after unveiling ten solar-powered incubators for all provinces, which they claim are part of the partys empowerment agenda.\n\nThe incubators, each designed to hold up to 36,000 eggs, were presented as a step towards rural economic development under the promise of Vision 2030. However, some rural women have voiced skepticism about the real benefits of the initiative, with many questioning the feasibility and practicality of the project.\n\nIn a statement during the launch, ZANU PF Secretary for Women Affairs, Mabel Chinomona, said, Every woman must do something with these incubators; when we say Vision 2030, this is what we mean. It is now up to the provinces to work.\n\nDespite the upbeat rhetoric, many local women argue that the promises are more about boosting political capital than providing meaningful support. One woman from a rural district, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed concern: We were promised the world, but where is the support for the tools and training we need to make this project viable? We have seen similar promises before with no real follow-through.\n\nZANU PF officials, including Chinomona, have also praised President Emmerson Mnangagwas leadership, attributing significant economic progress to his governance. Chinomona added, We must cherish this development. President Mnangagwa has over-achieved in all sectors of the economy.\n\nHowever, critics argue that these so-called empowerment projects are merely window dressing to garner rural support ahead of upcoming elections. Its easy to hand out an incubator, but harder to ensure it leads to long-term sustainable growth. Women in rural areas need access to better healthcare, education, and infrastructure, not just a few machines, said another rural activist.\n\nAdditionally, there have been calls within the party for discipline and unity, with some suggesting that political infighting and internal divisions have hindered the development efforts meant to benefit local communities.\n\nWe must be disciplined always, this is the foundation of the party. Women must also remain united to foster development, echoed ZANU PF Womens League Secretary for Administration, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa, stressing party loyalty as key to achieving progress.\n\nWhile the incubator initiative may be seen as a step toward rural empowerment, it remains to be seen whether it will lead to tangible improvements in the lives of women in these communities or merely serve as a political tool for the ruling party.\n\n",

            "content": "Fire extinguishers are an important safety tool to have in your vehicle, but proper storage and maintenance are crucial to ensuring their effectiveness in an emergency. Here are some key tips to keep your fire extinguisher in top condition and ready for use.\n\nFirst and foremost, never expose your fire extinguisher to direct sunlight. Prolonged exposure to the suns rays can lead to dangerous conditions, potentially causing the extinguisher to explode, which could result in harm or damage to your vehicle. Always store it in a cool, dry place to ensure safety.\n\nIt is equally important to store your fire extinguisher in an accessible spot inside your vehicle. Avoid keeping it in the boot, as this could prevent you from accessing it quickly in the event of a fire. During a car fire, the vehicles electronic components may fail, causing the boot to become locked. This would make it difficult or impossible to reach your extinguisher. Instead, store it under your car seat or in the glove compartment where it can be quickly retrieved.\n\nIn addition to proper storage, regular checks are vital. Always verify the expiration date on your fire extinguisher. If the extinguisher is past its expiration date and is refillable, take it to a recognized agent to have it refilled, often at a lower cost than the original purchase price.\n\nRemember, keeping a fire extinguisher in your vehicle is an essential safety measure that can save lives in an emergency. By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your fire extinguisher remains effective when you need it most.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZanu PF has ignited controversy with its early claim of victory in the 2030 elections, despite the fact that, according to the current constitution, elections are scheduled for 2028.\n\nThe declaration by Zanu PF official Taurai Kandishaya on Sunday has raised concerns over the partys intentions to manipulate the electoral process and postpone the upcoming polls to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas rule.\n\nKandishayas statement suggests a clear agenda to maintain power beyond the constitutional limits, as he boldly declared that the ruling party would win resoundingly in the 2030 elections.\n\nHis remarks come at a time when internal debates within Zanu PF are intensifying over whether Mnangagwa should step down at the end of his second term in 2028, as mandated by the constitution.\n\nOn Facebook, Kandishaya boasted of the partys growing influence, claiming that over 200 opposition members from various splinter groups in Chiredzi had defected to Zanu PF, citing the partys unprecedented economic development projects as their reason for switching allegiance. He wrote: Over 200 opposition members in Chiredzi have defected to ZANU PF, from various opposition splinter groups, citing the Second Republics unprecedented economic development projects as the reason for their switch.\n\nThis comes as the commissariat department is intensifying mobilisation efforts to solidify the Party structures. We are already winning 2030 elections.\n\nWhile the party celebrates these defections as a sign of political strength, the focus on the 2030 polls has added fuel to the growing speculation that Zanu PF may attempt to postpone the 2028 elections, a move that would require changing the constitution. This has led to confusion and division within the party, as some hardliners argue that Mnangagwa should not seek to extend his rule past 2028, while others appear to be positioning themselves for a longer tenure.\n\nKandishayas premature focus on 2030 reflects the partys intention to shift the electoral narrative, even though the current constitutional framework mandates elections in 2028. Critics are wary of these moves, fearing they may undermine democratic processes and further consolidate power within the ruling party. As Zanu PF continues to push for constitutional changes and celebrates its alleged developmental successes, observers are increasingly concerned about the implications of these political maneuvers for Zimbabwes democratic future.\n\n",
