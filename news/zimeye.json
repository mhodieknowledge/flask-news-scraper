This event serves as the season opener for a league that will run through to December 2025, focusing on nurturing young football talent and stamping out age cheating in the sport.\n\nThe league, which comprises 14 teams spread across five age groups from U10 to U18, is more than just a competitive platformits a movement to restore integrity and proper development in Zimbabwes youth football scene.\n\nThe aim is to create a transparent and competitive environment where players grow at the right pace and in the right categories, said Organizing Secretary Reuben Dauti. We are determined to eliminate age cheating in junior football and ensure every child plays in their correct age group. Thats the foundation for real development.\n\nThe U14 tournament will bring together teams from across Harare and surrounding areas, showcasing the best of local talent. Among the highlights is the participation of Gracious Saviere, a rising star from Real Vision Football Academy, who will compete against boysmaking a strong statement for gender inclusivity in sport.\n\nWhile the U10 and U12 age groups will focus on festival-style football that emphasizes fun and talent discovery, the U14, U16, and U18 categories will feature structured competition. This approach, the league believes, is vital in identifying players capable of progressing to elite levels, both locally and internationally.\n\nAdding prestige to the event, former national team striker and junior development product Edward Sadomba will attend as a guest, inspiring young players with his story of rising from grassroots football to become a celebrated African footballer.\n\nThe league is also calling on the corporate sector to support its mission. This is not just about football; its about shaping disciplined, ambitious, and talented youth, Dauti emphasized. We invite corporate partners to walk this journey with us and invest in the future of Zimbabwean football.\n\nAs the first whistle prepares to blow at Prince Edward High School, all eyes will be on the budding stars, hopeful that this initiative sets a new standard for junior football in Harare and beyond.\n\n",

            "content": "Every time you get behind the wheel, youre making a commitmentnot just to reach your destination, but to protect your life and the lives of others on the road. Driving may feel routine, but it is a complex task that demands full attention. Even a momentary lapse in concentration can result in serious, sometimes fatal, consequences.\n\nToday, distracted driving is one of the leading causes of road accidents worldwide. And while most drivers are aware of the dangers, many still engage in risky behaviors without realizing how devastating the consequences can be.\n\nHere are some of the most common distractions that take your focus off the roadand why avoiding them could save lives:\n\n Never Text While Driving\n\nTexting while driving remains one of the most dangerous distractions. When you take your eyes off the road to send or read a message, even for just five seconds, you could travel the length of a football field without seeing whats in front of you. According to road safety experts, You are 23 times more likely to crash if youre texting while driving. No message is worth a lifekeep your phone out of sight and out of mind until youre safely parked.\n\n Dont Eat Behind the Wheel\n\nMany drivers think grabbing a quick bite during their commute is harmless. But eating while driving can be just as dangerous as texting. Holding food, unwrapping packaging, or dealing with spills forces you to take one or both hands off the wheel and diverts your attention. Taking your hand off the wheel to grab that burger can mean the difference between stopping in time and causing a crash, says a road safety spokesperson.\n\n Dont Let the Stereo Steal Your Focus\n\nMusic is a great way to enhance a drivebut fiddling with the stereo, adjusting volume, skipping tracks, or switching playlists can be distracting. If youre focused on your playlist instead of the traffic around you, youre not fully driving, warn experts. Pre-set your music before hitting the road or use voice-activated controls to keep your hands and eyes where they belong.\n\n Never Apply Makeup While Driving\n\nMultitasking while driving is a mythespecially when it involves something as delicate and time-consuming as applying makeup. Not only does it take your eyes off the road, but it also compromises your reaction time. Grooming behind the wheel is shockingly common, yet incredibly dangerous, say authorities. If youre running late, its better to arrive a few minutes behind schedule than not arrive at all.\n\n Dont Let Passengers Distract You\n\nFrom lively conversations to rowdy kids, passengers can be a major source of distraction. While its natural to talk during a drive, drivers must set boundaries. Its okay to ask passengers to keep it down if youre feeling overwhelmedyour main job is to drive safely, driving instructors advise. When dealing with children or upset passengers, its always safest to pull over before addressing the situation.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDriving is not the time to divide your attention. Each of the above distractionsno matter how trivial they may seemcan be deadly when combined with the speed and unpredictability of the road.\n\nRemember: You cant drive safely unless the task has your full attention. Stay alert, stay focused, and arrive alive.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri\n\nThe growing political clout of businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei is stirring controversy within the Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) Church, with some members voicing strong opposition to his alignment with ZANU PF and potential ascension to higher political office.\n\nTagwirei, a prominent SDA member and influential figure in Zimbabwes business sector, was recently endorsed by ZANU PFs Harare Province for a seat on the partys powerful Central Committee.\n\nHe is increasingly seen as President Emmerson Mnangagwas possible successoran idea that has reportedly unsettled some within the church.\n\nDissenting voices within the SDA community have taken their grievances to the international stage, petitioning the churchs global leadership to revoke a prestigious honor awarded to Tagwirei. In their appeal to the General Conference, the Zimbabwe Union Conference, and the Southern Africa-Indian Ocean Division (SID), the concerned members argued that his political affiliations compromise the integrity of the church.\n\nThe controversy centers around a Global Award of Excellence presented to Tagwirei at Solusi University last month, making him the first Black recipient of the accolade from the General Conference. Critics argue the award sends the wrong message.\n\nHis involvement in partisan politics, especially at such a high level, is incompatible with the values we uphold as a church, read part of the petition.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with the criticism. Some SDA leaders have come to Tagwireis defense, alleging that the backlash is driven by personal vendettas and unmet financial expectations.\n\nHeather Dube, a member of the City Centre Church, dismissed the accusations as a smear campaign. It is crucial to recognise that since Mr. Tagwirei entered the mainstream political arena, the intensity of these allegations has significantly increased, she said. This organised campaign is rooted in frustration; these detractors were unable to secure financial backing from Tagwirei for their own agendas, prompting them to resort to character assassination.\n\nThe internal discord highlights a broader tension over the role of politics in religious spaces, with Tagwireis rising profile becoming a flashpoint in that debate.\n\n",

It authorises the responsible minister to suspend organisation leaders and appoint replacements, sparking alarm over the autonomy and independence of civil society institutions.\n\nThe enactment was made public through General Notice 620 of 2025, released via the Government Gazette on 11 April.\n\nConfirming the development, Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet, Dr. Martin Rushwaya, stated:The following law, which was assented to by His Excellency the President, is published in terms of subsection 6(a) of section 131 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe  Private Voluntary Organisations Amendment Act (No. 1) of 2025.\n\nThe law has been met with widespread condemnation from local and international civil society actors. Many warn that the act severely compromises the independence of NGOs by enabling the state to remove executives without judicial oversight and exert control over leadership transitions.\n\nThe act also empowers the government to shut down organisations suspected of political involvement and increase oversight of their foreign financial support. While authorities insist the move is aimed at curbing terrorist financing and money laundering, watchdog groups argue it is a thinly veiled attempt to muzzle dissent.\n\nJustice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi has stood by the legislation, asserting it is in line with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)s guidance and aims to shield Zimbabwes economy from illegal financial flows.\n\nBut rights organisations remain deeply concerned. The Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) has condemned the bill, warning that it grants authorities unchecked control over civic entities.\n\nAmnesty International has also raised the alarm, branding the law a serious blow to freedoms of association, expression, and assembly.\n\nThe Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders echoed these concerns, cautioning that the law could be exploited to target groups advocating for democracy, transparency, and fundamental rights.\n\n",

            "content": "By Investigative Reporter | ZimEye | After over 7 years, of accusing the Chamisa led civil society of tension with the army, Hopewell Chinono has finally been blocked on X by the opposition leader.\n\nChinono who has been acclaimed in some circles as a relentless critic of Zimbabwes government, a champion of democracy, and a staunch defender of human rights, has on the other hand been an accuser of the opposition l, not just on social media, but inside meetings with the Ministry of Defence.\n\nMid afternoon Saturday, the journalist posted a message containing revelations that he has since been blocked by Nelson Chamisa. He said he has been blocked over a Bible verse, and suggested that Chamisa would arrest him the same way Mnangagwa has done if he was president.\n\nChamisa who did not comment, has previously told ZimEye, that he finds Chinono to be a low life individual who has no credibility.\n\nIncidents from the last seven-year period reveals with repeating detail that behind this carefully crafted persona lies a different realityone that involves evading questions over illicit money, deceit, and a long history of covering up other activities dating back to 1995, a period during which he has changed his own name.\n\nHopewell Chinono, who has spent the past seven years corrupting Defense Ministers, starting with Vice President ConstantinoChiwenga (watch video)made headlines yesterday by accusing Nelson Chamisa of abandoning his supporters.\n\nIn July 2022, Chinono was recorded trying to convince the jailed legislator, Job Sikhala, his accusation that Chamisa has abandoned him in prison. (listen to recording)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/v/AkGc5FrpUoDxymUG/?mibextid=KsPBc6\n\nChinonos Seven-Year Cover-Up of Suspicious Money Activities Under the Guise of Journalism.\n\nChinono, who also spent years accusing Chamisa of neglecting his supporters, has been exposed for using his supposed opposition to the Zimbabwean government as a faade to mask his involvement in illicit financial activities that have, in fact, supported the very system he claims to oppose.\n\nOne of the most damning pieces of evidence concerns Chinonos claim that he acquired significant wealth at a young age. According to Chinono, his journey into property ownership began in 1996 when, at the age of 25, he received a 50,000 credit from a UK institution, which he used to purchase a sports car. This car was then exported to Zimbabwe, without proper documentation, and sold illegally to fund the purchase of a luxurious home in the affluent Chisipite suburb of Harare.\n\nHowever, evidence clearly shows that Chinonos account of his financial success is riddled with inconsistencies. Despite his claims of legitimate business dealings, including a more recent assertion that he made his fortune selling cellphones between 2003 and 2006, he has consistently failed to disclose the name of the UK institution that granted him such a substantial credit at such a young age. This glaring omission has raised serious questions about the legality of his early wealth.\n\nDuring a revealing interview with the esteemed investigative journalist Geoff Nyarota in 2021, Chinono notably avoided answering questions about the origins of his moneya tactic that only confirmed suspicions about his illicit financial activities. This avoidance is a clear indication that Chinono has been diverting attention from his fraudulent dealings by presenting himself as a social justice warrior.\n\nThe timeline also reveals that Chinono, originally known as Mukusha, changed his name during the period in which he mysteriously accumulated vast wealtha period marked by the absence of any salary or wage records to substantiate his claims of legitimate income. This name change was evidently part of his strategy to obscure the origins of his wealth and to reinvent himself as a respected journalist and activist.\n\nFurthermore, multiple credible witnesses have come forward, with some providing video testimonies, confirming that Chinono engaged in credit and cheque fraud before changing his name. Some of his former associates from that time have been convicted of fraud involving millions of pounds, underscoring the illegal nature of the activities that funded his rise to prominence.\n\nAmong the most significant testimonies is that of a human rights activist employed by the NHS, who withdrew her support for Nelson Chamisas opposition party due to its backing of Chinono following his 2020 arrest on charges of incitement to violence. The activist, who has recounted her own experiences with Chinonos bullying tactics, warned that his unchecked behavior could have devastating consequences for Zimbabwe if allowed to continue. (Listen to Dr Maboreke in audio below)\n\nAdding to these troubling revelations are allegations from women dating back to Chinonos high school days at Marlborough, Harare, where he is said to have bullied his headmaster, Arison Chiware, into accepting him despite poor academic performance. These women have come forward with harrowing accounts of sexual misconduct, further solidifying the image of a man who has long used intimidation and manipulation to achieve his ends.\n\nOne key example of this behavior comes from Dr. Nyasha Maboreke, whose family has expressed concerns about Chinonos use of their name. In a revealing audio interview, Dr. Maboreke stated, *Even my family have been deeply concerned that he sometimes uses my name as well, directly because if you notice he is now saying Nyasha Maboreke these times. So that he makes a distinction between the two of us. You know our lad he does something when, what I have realised is I can engage to tone down. I have already done so actually but sometimes he has got his own mind you know, CHUCKLE!*\n\nThis admission highlights the way in which Chinono has manipulated the narrative to suit his own ends, using the names and reputations of others to validate his questionable claims of property ownership.\n\nAs more evidence continues to emerge, it is becoming increasingly clear that Hopewell Chinonos public persona as a crusader for justice has been nothing more than a carefully constructed cover for his illicit activities. The seven years of pristine evidence leave no doubt that Chinonos actions have not only supported but also reinforced the very regime he claims to oppose, exposing him as a key player in the corruption he so vehemently pretends to fight against.\n\nThis comprehensive exposure of Chinonos activities sheds light on the true nature of his involvement in Zimbabwean politics, revealing a man who has used his platform not to challenge injustice, but to cover up his own involvement in criminal activities while maintaining the faade of a righteous activist.\n\n",

The move is being seen by political analysts as a calculated reward from President Emmerson Mnangagwa for his role in weakening the opposition.\n\nAfter aiding in the fragmentation of the CCC, Tshabangus elevation is clearly a political thank-you from ZANU PF, said one analyst who requested anonymity. Its a textbook case of political patronage.\n\nTshabangu confirmed his new role in a statement released on Friday:Good morning, I wish to inform you that I was elected into the Committee on Health at the Inter-Parliamentary Union of the 10th Parliament of Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nI wish to serve my country with undoubted patriotism and contribute to the improvement of the overall health sector in Zimbabwe.\n\nCritics, however, argue that Tshabangus appointment is less about merit and more about loyalty to those in power. His role in the opposition chaos, which led to the recall of several elected MPs and caused confusion in the partys ranks, has been cited as a significant blow to Zimbabwes democratic landscape.\n\nDespite the backlash, Tshabangu insists that his focus now is on public service, particularly in the health sector. But for many, his new position symbolizes the rewards of political expediency over principle.\n\n",
