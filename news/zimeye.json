            "content": "By A Correspondent  Senior Zanu PF members are increasingly bunking President Emmerson Mnangagwas official functions in what observers say is a clear sign of deepening divisions and manoeuvres in the partys simmering succession battle.\n\nThe latest sign of discontent came to light in a letter addressed to the leadership of Mashonaland West province by Zanu PF provincial chairperson Mary Mliswa-Chikoka. She expressed anger over the failure of senior officials, including Members of Parliament and central committee members, to attend a key event graced by Mnangagwa.\n\nAt the 21st Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) graduation ceremony last Thursday  where Mnangagwa capped 3 130 graduands  the only senior government representative was Womens Affairs, Community and SMEs deputy minister Jennifer Mhlanga. The absence of top provincial leaders raised eyebrows, with Mliswa-Chikoka blasting the boycott as silent sabotage.\n\nWhat message are you sending when you deliberately absent yourselves from events graced by the first secretary of our party? Mliswa-Chikoka charged. How can we take seriously those who campaign aggressively to attend the [Zanu PF] peoples conference, yet show no commitment to supporting the Presidents programmes in their own province (sic)?\n\nShe warned that continued absenteeism would be interpreted as disloyalty and a calculated attempt to undermine Mnangagwas authority, threatening to name and shame culprits.\n\nThose who ignored the CUT ceremony despite being invited include central committee and district co-ordinating committee members Phineas Makumbe, Thomas Chidzomba, Christine Gwati, Precious Masango, Tapera Mtovido, Elisha Bhokoro, Archy Ganizani and Rudo Munyonga. Only politburo member Douglas Mombeshora tendered an apology, citing government business.\n\nThis is not the first time senior Zanu PF and government officials have drawn criticism for dodging key events. In Parliament, ministers and their deputies have repeatedly skipped question-and-answer sessions, forcing both the National Assembly and Senate to reprimand them.\n\nThe growing boycott of Mnangagwas programmes reflects wider fissures within Zanu PF as rival factions jostle for power ahead of the partys elective congress. On one side is a faction aligned to Mnangagwa that is pushing for him to extend his tenure beyond the constitutional limit  either by amending the Constitution in his favour or suspending future elections. On the other side, a camp loyal to Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga is quietly mobilising to push him into State House.\n\nAdding to the intrigue is businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei, who is increasingly being viewed as a dark horse with the financial muscle to influence the succession matrix.\n\nThe latest silent boycott in Chinhoyi has been read by insiders as an early indication of a coup in slow motion within Zanu PF, where political survival often depends on loyalty displays at events presided over by the party leader. As the succession battle heats up, Mnangagwas opponents within his own party appear to be using absence as a weapon of resistance  a tactic that could further destabilise the ruling party ahead of 2028.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nGovernment has once again disbursed millions of taxpayers money to Zanu PF and the Tshabangu-led Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), raising concerns over the misuse of public funds.\n\nAccording to General Notice 1829, published by Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi in an Extraordinary Government Gazette on Tuesday, a total of ZiG147 682 500 was shared between the ruling party and the CCC.\n\nMinister Ziyambi said: It is hereby notified, in terms of section 3(2) of the Political Parties (Finance) Act that the total amount of moneys payable to political parties in respect of the year beginning 1st of January, 2025 and ending on the 31st of December, 2025, ZiG147 682 500,00. The money shall be disbursed to political parties that qualify in terms of section 3(3) of the Act as follows  (a) ZiG102 343 972, 50 shall be paid to Zanu PF which received 69,3 percent of the total votes cast; and (b) ZiG45 338 527,50 shall be paid to the CCC which received 30,7 percent of the total votes cast.\n\nZanu PF received over ZiG102 million, while Tshabangus CCC pocketed more than ZiG45 million, despite critics saying the payouts effectively reward political loyalty rather than democratic participation.\n\nThe Political Parties (Finance) Act, originally intended to support transparency and reduce dependence on foreign funding, has been criticised as a mechanism for entrenching state patronage. One opposition supporter commented, This is taxpayers money being used to bankroll Zanu PF and reward Tshabangu for doing their dirty work.\n\nGovernment last disbursed ZiG70 million to the two parties in September 2024. Critics argue the latest payout shows how public funds continue to be diverted to sustain political power instead of national development.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dr Masimba Mavaza | The attacks against Attorney General Virginia Mabhiza following her appearance in President Emmerson Mnangagwas delegation to the Vatican and China are unfortunate and totally disgusting. The people who call themselves influencers are spreading useless and baseless issues meant to injure the person of the AG.\n\nThe Attorney Generals role in the high-level trip is very important and essential to our country and the nation. The baseless attacks are motivated by jealousy, dubious motives, and double standards.\n\nCriticism of government officials foreign trips can stem from various concerns, such as cost and taxpayer burden. The financial cost of international travel can be significant, and some citizens may question the value for money. But the important issue is to look at the benefits realised from the trip.\n\nHowever, it is essential to recognize the importance of international engagement for a countrys diplomatic relations. Building and maintaining relationships with other countries can lead to mutually beneficial agreements, trade, and cooperation.\n\nOur country is pursuing economic growth. International trade agreements, investments, and partnerships can boost economic growth and create jobs.\n\nGlobal security and stability are achieved by mingling with other countries. Engaging with other countries can help address global challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and conflicts.\n\nIt should be realised that government officials foreign trips are a necessary part of their duties, and the benefits of these trips can outweigh the costs. These visits highlight the significance of the Vatican as a global moral authority and a hub for international diplomacy and cooperation.\n\nThe Attorney General (AG) accompanying the President on foreign trips can serve several purposes: Legal advice: The AG provides legal counsel to the President on matters related to international law, treaties, and agreements. This ensures the President receives informed guidance on the legal implications of diplomatic decisions. International negotiations: The AG may participate in negotiations with foreign governments, providing expertise on legal frameworks and ensuring agreements are properly structured and compliant with domestic and international law. Contract and agreement review: The AG can review and advise on contracts, memoranda of understanding, and other agreements entered into by the government with foreign entities. Diplomatic immunity and privileges: The AG may advise on matters related to diplomatic immunity and privileges, ensuring the President and other officials understand their rights and obligations. Representation: The AGs presence can also demonstrate the governments commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring that international engagements are conducted in a transparent and lawful manner.\n\nHaving the AG accompany the President on foreign trips helps ensure that the governments actions are legally sound and aligned with national interests.\n\n",

Contrary to a finding of ordinary negligence, the facts disclose gross negligence.\n\nHombarume admitted to driving a Honda Shuttle at 100 km/h in a 60 km/h zone when he struck Charumbira. He was not licensed.\n\nThe magistrate had initially sentenced him to 24 months in jail, wholly suspended on condition of community service, after the musician paid compensation and funeral expenses to the victims family.\n\nHowever, Justice Dube said this was a misjudgment.\n\nShe stated that courts should not allow offenders to avoid custodial sentences simply because they can afford to pay compensation.\n\nJustice Dube ordered the magistrate to reconsider the sentence, including imposing a mandatory driving ban.\n\nMagistrate Tendayi Mukurunge has since prohibited Chillmaster from driving for nine months.- ZimEye\n\n",
