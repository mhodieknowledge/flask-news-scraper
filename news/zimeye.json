            "content": "By A Correspondent| The trial of Harare businessman, Michael Smith who is accused of defrauding MA Auto Suppliers trading as Mr Cruiser continued at the Harare Magistrates Court last week with the company owner tendering overwhelming evidence against the accused.\n\nSmith is facing a litany of charges including theft of trust property, fraud and corruptly concealing transactions.\n\nBusinessman, Mike Asher representing MA Auto Suppliers, narrated how his former trusted Lieutenant Smith masterminded a plan with his accomplice in South Africa to defraud his company.\n\nWhatsApp chats and voice notes retrieved by Police Cyber Unity were played before the court clearly revealing that Smith was the one behind fraudulent activities to dupe his employer.\n\nCourt heard that sometime in October 2019, Michael Scot Asher left for Australia and failed to return due to Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nUpon his return, Asher discovered that the company was paying its South African suppliers through a third party called Mant Procurement [Pvt) Ltd.\n\nMant Procurement is incorporated in South Africa and involved Tony Oatley, his accomplice who is based there.Smith had not disclosed this arrangement to Asher or the Finance Manager, Christine Vellah whom he was supposed to work closely with.\n\nMA Auto Supplies later discovered that Mant Procurement was overcharging the company and as a result, they suffered prejudice in excess of R100 000.\n\nIn February 2021, Smith allegedly imported two tents using MA Auto Suppliers (Pvt) Ltds resources. He allegedly sold the tents to one Ms Horsley for US$1 800 and arranged for the pmnt to be made into his personal offshore account in the Isle of Man. No monies were recovered from the accused.\n\nIn October, Smith allegedly used the same modus operandi to import a Station Wagon Rear Bumper and RHS carrier and the customer paid R77112.00 directly into Mant Procurement (Pvt) Ltds FNB account.\n\nOn a separate date, Smith sold, on behalf of MA Auto, a Toyota Land Cruiser 78 series for US$13 000, only US$5500 was recorded in company accounts, with Smith diverting US$7500 to personal use.\n\nAnother Toyota Landcruiser belonging to MA Auto was allegedly sold to his Son Trevor Smith. Despite $5500 being outstanding on the vehicle Smith later sold the Landcruiser privatelyfor $7500 but never remitted any money to the company.\n\nOther evidence tendered by Asher allegedly revealed that work done on Smiths son Russells vehicles were not paid to MA Auto but amounts offset against a personal loan arrangements which Smith had with his Son.\n\nMike Asher further tendered evidence revealing Smith did barter type deals with various customers whereby, instead of receiving payments from the customers but Smith allegedly arranged free nights at lavish resort camps for him and his wife.\n\nThe court has been presented with documents containing evidence of WhatsApp and Email communication of Smiths alleged wrongdoing.\n\nThe trial has been postponed to April 30, 2025, for continuation with defense lawyer expected to cross examine Mike Asher.\n\nSmiths alleged fraudulent activities resulted in a huge loss for MA Auto Suppliers with estimates suggesting at least $38,000 and R124,000 was involved.\n\n",

            "content": "By Sports Correspondent\n\nIn a thrilling Copa del Rey final, Barcelona claimed a record-extending 32nd Spanish Cup title with a dramatic 3-2 win over fierce rivals Real Madrid. The match, played in a raucous atmosphere at Sevilles La Cartuja stadium, went into extra time before French defender Jules Kound scored the decisive goal in the 116th minute.\n\nPedri had given Barcelona the lead in the 28th minute with a brilliant curling strike from outside the box, showcasing his skill in a first-half performance dominated by Bara.\n\nHowever, Real Madrid took control in the second half, with Kylian Mbapp scoring an equalizing free kick in the 70th minute after coming off the bench.\n\nAurlien Tchouamni then gave Real Madrid the lead with a towering header from a corner in the 77th minute. But Ferran Torres quickly responded, finding the equalizer in a counterattack in the 84th minute and sending the game into extra time.\n\nJust when a penalty shootout seemed likely, Kounds stunning strike from 25 yards secured the win for Barcelona, slotting the ball into the low corner of Thibaut Courtois net. The victory marks a significant milestone for Bara, setting the stage for a potential treble.\n\nThe win came with a sour note for Real Madrid, as Antonio Rdiger and Lucas Vzquez received red cards for dissent from the sidelines, while Jude Bellingham was also flashed a red after the final whistle for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nWith this momentum, Barcelona will look to continue their strong form in Wednesdays Champions League semifinal first leg against Inter Milan, as they also lead LaLiga by four points over Real Madrid.\n\n",

The pests, known as tsikidzi, have infested numerous households, prompting calls for urgent intervention from city officials and health experts.\n\nThe outbreak, first reported in Mbares rundown flats, has spread to other high-density suburbs, including Mabvuku, Kuwadzana, and Budiriro. Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume attributes the infestation to the second-hand clothing trade, suggesting that infested clothes may have brought the pests into the city.\n\nWe urge the City of Harare Health Department to take serious action, said Wisbon Malaya, Secretary-General of the Zimbabwe Chamber of Informal Economy Association. Malaya recommends training residents on homemade fumigation methods and advising informal traders to avoid selling potentially infested products.\n\nReuben Akili, director of the Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA), highlighted the need for proactive measures to address the squalid living conditions in Mbare. The City of Harare must adhere to the court order and provide necessary services to the 59 blocks of flats, Akili emphasized.\n\nResidents are growing increasingly alarmed as the infestation worsens.\n\nWithout prompt action from city authorities, the pests may continue to spread, exacerbating the dire living conditions in affected areas.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nA British lawmaker has condemned President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration for its handling of journalist Blessed Mhlangas detention, calling for tangible repercussions. Mhlanga has been held for two months without bail, sparking concerns about media freedom in Zimbabwe.\n\nLord Johnny Oates, a member of the House of Lords, expressed his deep concern about the plight of Mhlanga, who was arrested for interviewing a war veteran critical of the government. In Zimbabwe, journalists are consistently silenced, intimidated, and sometimes even killed for doing their job, Lord Oates stated. Blessed Mhlangas detention is a stark reminder of the regimes hostility towards press freedom.\n\nLord Oates urged British parliamentarians to grill Zimbabwes First Lady, Auxillia Mnangagwa, when she visits the UK in June. When the First Lady speaks at the summit in London, I hope our lawmakers will seize the opportunity to confront her about her husbands authoritarian tendencies and the ongoing detention of Blessed Mhlanga, he said. The UK government must make it clear that normal relations with Zimbabwe will remain frozen until the ZANU PF regime respects media freedom and democratic principles.\n\nThe call to action comes amid growing concerns about human rights in Zimbabwe, which remains suspended from the Commonwealth. Zimbabwean activists in the UK are planning protests outside the FLAIR summit, where the First Lady is scheduled to speak, to highlight the countrys human rights abuses.\n\nBaroness Mobarik had earlier sparked the debate, questioning the UK governments efforts to protect journalists worldwide. Lord Oates echoed her sentiments, emphasizing that consequences must be imposed on regimes that disregard media freedom and human rights.\n\nAs the noble Baroness, Lady Mobarik, aptly put it, there must be consequences for such egregious actions, he stressed.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a bold statement on Saturday, Taurai Kandishaya, a prominent official within Zimbabwes ruling party, Zanu PF, declared that the party is invincible and will continue to rule the nation for the foreseeable future. Kandishaya, who is a member of the Zanu PF Youth League, made the assertion with great confidence, claiming that the partys grip on power is unshakable.\n\nThe truth is: ZANU PF is ruling and will continue ruling; we invested in this thing of POWER, Kandishaya boasted, clearly affirming the partys position in Zimbabwes political landscape. His remarks were not only a reflection of Zanu PFs self-assuredness but also a display of the partys long-standing belief in its dominance.\n\nHowever, the statement was met with resistance from opposition voices. Stephen Chuma, the former spokesperson for the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Youth Assembly, sharply disagreed with Kandishayas sentiment. Chuma countered, emphasizing that Zanu PFs control does not equate to ownership of the country itself.\n\nZanu PF is not Zimbabwe and Zimbabwe is not Zanu PF. Zanu PF does not have the countrys title deeds, Chuma said, highlighting the distinction between the ruling party and the nation it governs. His remarks suggested that, while Zanu PF may hold power, it does not have an inherent claim over the country or its people.\n\nThe exchange between the Zanu PF Youth League official and Chuma underscores the growing tension between the ruling party and opposition groups, with both sides firmly entrenched in their respective views on Zimbabwes future political direction.\n\n",
