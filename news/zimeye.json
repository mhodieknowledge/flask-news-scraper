While the unusual circumstances of the final may spark debate, the victory was well-received by the FC Platinum faithful, who celebrated the triumph on a day of national pride.\n\nSimba Bhora, meanwhile, will be left to reflect on what might have been in a final that never truly got going.\n\n",

Upon searching them, authorities discovered two full leopard skins weighing 3kgs, a hedgehog skin weighing 0.050kgs, and 88 pangolin scales weighing 0.35kgs. The items, which were being held without a permit, were valued at US$41,500.\n\nZimuti claimed in court that he was a registered traditional healer and that the trophies were inherited from his late grandfather, entrusted to him for safekeeping. However, the court found insufficient evidence to support his defense.\n\nThe arrest came after a police taskforce moved in on the suspects during a sting operation, catching them in the act as they were allegedly preparing to sell the trophies to potential buyers.\n\n",
