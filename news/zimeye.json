            "content": "By Business Reporter-Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, once thecountrysleading mobile service provider, is under fire for allegedly exposing customer details to the public domain, further eroding public trust amid growing dissatisfaction over deteriorating service quality and exorbitant charges.\n\nSeveral Econet subscribers have recently reported being contacted by suspicious individuals on WhatsApp, raising concerns that their contact details might have been sourced from an alleged data leak by a threat actor known as Thaihub.\n\nCybersecurity watchdog FalconFeeds.io reported that over 852,000 customer records had been compromised and werebeing soldon the dark web.\n\nThe leaked data reportedly included full names, addresses, email addresses, Twitter handles, and mobile numbers. FalconFeeds.io posted on X (formerly Twitter):\n\nAthreat actor claims to be selling the database of Econet Wireless Zimbabwe (http://econet.co.zw). The leaked data includes 852,791 customer records containing full names, emails, addresses, Twitter handles, mobile numbers, and more.\n\nAccording toTechZim, Thaihub allegedly listed the stolen database for saleat a price of$299.\n\nHowever, Econet Wireless Zimbabwe has denied the claims, stating that its internal investigations found no evidence of a security breach.\n\nIn astatementthe company reassured customers that it had activated incident management processes and was working with international cybersecurity experts to monitor its systems.\n\nThe statement reads:\n\nEconet Wireless Zimbabwe is aware of a social media post first made on X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday (February 4, 2025) claiming that a threat actor was selling part ofEconetssubscriber list containing 852,791 customer records.\n\nOur internal investigations, which started immediately on the day the allegations were made, have detected no breach on our systems that would lead to unauthorised access to sensitive customer data that is not already in the public domain or accessible through third parties.\n\nDespiteEconetsassurances,skepticismremains high among customers, many of whom are already frustrated with the company over its declining service quality and increasing costs.\n\nThe security breach allegations come at a time whenEconetsreputation is already under scrutiny due to the worsening quality of its services.\n\nOver the past few years, Zimbabweans have increasingly complained about network congestion, frequent dropped calls, slow mobile internet speeds, and poor customer service.\n\nOnce considered the best in the country, thecompanysinternet services have reportedly become unreliable, with erratic data connectivity affecting businesses and individuals alike.\n\nAdding to consumer woes, Econet has implemented a series of steep tariff hikes, making mobile communication unaffordable for many Zimbabweans.\n\nWhile the company cites rising operational costs due to inflation and foreign currency shortages as justification for these increases, customers argue that the price hikes are unjustified given the subpar service they are receiving.\n\nFor instance, the cost of mobile data bundles has risen dramatically, pushing many users to seek alternative providers or reduce their internet usage.\n\nMany businesses, reliant on stable network services, have been forced to invest in alternative communication solutions such as Starlink and VSAT, further erodingEconetsdominance in the market.\n\nThe Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (POTRAZ) hascome under pressureto take action against Econet over its service failures and alleged data security lapses.\n\nConsumer rights groups have called for stricter oversight and penalties if Econet is found guilty of negligence in handling customer data.\n\n",

            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda- The ailing co-Vice President Kembo Mohadi has publicly thrown his support behind President Emmerson Mnangagwas controversial #ED2030 campaign despite his persistent health challenges and the ongoing power struggles within ZANU PF.\n\nOn Monday, Mohadi, who has suffered multiple public health scares, made the remarks while mourning the late national hero and former Manicaland governor, Tinaye Chigudu.\n\nChigudu, who succumbed to a long illness last Wednesday at his Mt Pleasant home in Harare, is set to be buried today at the National Heroes Acre.\n\nMohadis ill health has been a matter of public concern for years.\n\nThe 74-year-old politician has collapsed on several occasions while attending official functions, fueling speculation about his ability to continue in office.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Mohadi has remained a key figure in Mnangagwas administration, even after being fired in 2021 following a sex scandal.\n\nHe was quietly reinstated in 2023 as the second Vice President, serving alongside Constantino Chiwenga, in a move widely seen as Mnangagwas strategy to maintain a delicate balance of power within the party.\n\nMohadis endorsement of Mnangagwas Vision 2030 agenda is seen as a calculated move to solidify his allegiance to the President amid intensifying power struggles with his deputy, Chiwenga.\n\nThe fissures between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga have been growing, with the former army general increasingly asserting himself in political and military affairs.\n\nChiwenga, who led the 2017 coup that ousted Robert Mugabe, has long been viewed as the heir apparent to Mnangagwa.\n\nHowever, Mnangagwas push for a third termdespite constitutional limitshas deepened tensions.\n\nThe inclusion of Mohadi, a longtime Mnangagwa loyalist, in high-profile engagements such as the #ED2030 campaign appears to be a bid to counterbalance Chiwengas growing influence.\n\nIn a statement issued through his Chief-of-Staff, Clever Chirume, Mohadi expressed his sorrow over Chigudus passing, linking it to the broader struggle for Zimbabwes development.\n\nThe Vice President joins His Excellency the President and the nation in mourning Cde Tinaye Chigudu, who has since been declared a national hero. It is sad that yet another gallant son of the liberation struggle has died a few weeks after we buried four others, said Mohadi.Furthermore, it is unfortunate that those of us who participated first-hand in the liberation struggle are now leaving when their wisdom and guidance are still required. This is the generation that demonstrated loyalty and resilience against the colonial regime, qualities we require to attain Vision 2030 of an empowered upper-middle-income society.\n\nBorn on August 13, 1942, Chigudu played a crucial role in Zimbabwes liberation struggle.\n\nAfter being expelled from Harare Secondary School in 1964 due to his political activism, he joined ZAPU and received military training in North Korea as a ZIPRA cadre.\n\nUpon returning, he was deployed as an intelligence officer but was captured in 1965 and detained for 12 years in Gonakudzingwa, Gweru, and Whawha prisons.\n\nFollowing his release in 1977, Chigudu exiled himself to the UK, where he studied law at Exeter University between 1978 and 1981.\n\nReturning to Zimbabwe, he held various government positions, including Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Home Affairs and later for Mines and Mining Development.\n\nHe served as the Governor and Resident Minister of Manicaland from 2005 until his retirement in 2008.\n\nChigudu also worked as a senior consultant under the United Nations Development Programme, helping structure the Ministry of Interior for South Sudan.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Esther Chigudu (nee Dumba), and seven children.\n\n",

The rivalry between these two factions has intensified, and all eyes are now on how this will unfold during the national heros burial.\n\nMeanwhile, Chigudus body has arrived in Chiendambuya, allowing Manicaland Province to bid farewell to their son. The body will be returned to Harare this afternoon, where it will lie in state at Chigudus residence in Mt. Pleasant ahead of the burial at the National Heroes Acre on Monday.\n\nAs the burial approaches, its clear that the internal battle for control within Zanu PF will loom large over the solemn occasion, with each faction seeking to assert its influence and stake its claim to the partys future.\n\n",

Chigidora, who was responsible for administration and human resources in the fund, allegedly stole the money in cash from the safe deposit box.\n\nHe was arrested while serving as the officer in charge of operations in Mutoko and appeared in court, where he was remanded in custody. A ruling on his bail application is expected tomorrow. The ZRP is being represented in the case by Chief Inspector Lameck Munyaka, who is acting as the secretary of the ZRP Board of Trustees.\n\nAccording to the State, between September 2023 and July 2024, Chigidora falsely reported transferring cash to Joyce Mine, a facility that ceased operations in 2021. Instead, he allegedly pocketed the funds, and to date, none of the missing money has been recovered.\n\nThe case has sent shockwaves through the police force and the public, raising concerns about financial oversight within the ZRP. Authorities are expected to tighten controls on the management of police funds in response to the scandal.\n\nChigidora remains in custody as the court deliberates on his bail application.

Truly, you have never been on the receiving heavy hand of thismurderouspresident of Zimbabwe. Obviously, you are testing the resilience of the population; their suffering isbeyond whata human can endure.\n\nHow many citizens have been murdered by Mnangagwa, a man with blood on his hands.You tell usto pray fora manwhodecimated20,000 innocent citizens.You have the hide to tellusto pray for a murderer.WhichtrueGodwilllisten to devilishand satanicprayersexclusively for him? Aman who has no qualms when it comes to killing those whom he suspects are not on hisside.How did Solomon Mujuru die? He wasof Shona tribe anda former Zanu General, all the same he was devoured by his own.\n\nQuoting the bible to justify huwori wa Mnangagwa:its satanic. Those verses you are quoting are misplaced when it comes to Mnangagwa. Even Mugabe hated this man but managed to use him to kill, maimtheoppositionanddissenting voices.Mnangagwa isdangerous, he hasmurdered thousands of citizens even those in Zanu, even those of Mashona tribeare not spared. Mnangagwa is now devouring his own people. Chadzamira, your comrade is beyond bible verses. At best you are abusing the holy scriptures to get more freebees. At best stop insulting the insulted people of this nation.Mnangagwamurderedthousands of people, and he does not lose sleep. He has no guilty conscience aboutthedeathshehas committed andis killing even today.\n\nIts Mnangagwa who knows how Itai Dzamara was executed at his behest. Its Mnangagwa who know howSolomon Mujuru was decimated. The deaths of soldiers who died during the 2017 coup is known by Mnangagwa and Chiwenga. Yet we are told to kneel and pray for the Fhrer in honesty andintruth. After the coup, he eliminatedthe very people who gave him power totake overfrom Mugabe. Where is General Sibusiso Moyo and other Generals who dropped dead one by one after the coup. Mnangagwa does not lose sleep,hemurderedtoassumeabsolutepower after their demise.However,Mnangagwa failed on Chiwenga to finish him off: Chiwenga survived poisoning.Mnangagwais the man we are supposed to pray for him in earnest and in truth; according to Chadzamira.\n\nMaybe, Mr. Chadzamira you are right that we must pray to God.Pun intended.That bible has stories of genocide atrocities committed in Gods name. He lets Mnangagwa go killing frenzy. He kills without guilt because he knows #godiswithit#.This is a man whoconniveswith apoor woman to finish herhubby, Chiwenga: it did not happen.ButMerrywill sufferthismisshapeuntil death. Mnangagwa does not lose sleep because he put Merry in a precarious situation.He does not assist hereither butleft her to dry! How sataniccanit still go? Sure, we must pray forED earnestlyand in truth!This god isa jealous god, a hateful God;he isa murderous god,he isa vindictive god. A destructive godwhocan even curse generations and generation to come; can live under his curseto five generations.ED is the chosen one fromholy-evilGod. For this reason, he kills willy nilly: his conscience is clear.\n\nMnangagwa is looting wealth resources meant for the entire nation. He hasballetsof dollars in his home,one cannot count, even himselfhe cant count thebalesof dollars in his home.We must continue to pray for our Fhrer.How many street children are there in all towns and cities.Who cares for them if they are not caredforby NGOs of Caucasian origin.They bring their own resources to give hope to the forgotten and oppressed. When they do so they are insulted again forofferingthose benevolent servicesto the downtrodden.Ourroads are deaths traps:ourhospitals are death traps;ourschools are death traps:the water we drink are death traps, this week, about 50 people have died of a medieval disease simple to treat, Cholera. Mnangagwa does not lose sleep because of dilapidatednational infrastructuresmost of which were left by colonial past.Two governments have not risen to the occasion of giving decent livestocitizensfor fourgenerations.\n\nMnangagwa offers foreigners of Chinese origin to loot resources: Zimbabweans are told to work for them as slaves.Chinese employers shoot at Zimbabwean employees at will, if they asked for theirslendermonthly payments. If they reported cases of abusefromemployers, no law listens to them but will listen to Chineseversion of the story.We never saw this coming when we were liberating this nation. We hoped our resources will be made use to develop Zimbabweans and not Chinese. Was this not the very bone of contention to fight for freedom of this nation: to be free and be prosperous? What isthe differencebetween the life we lived during colonial times and the slave-like lives we live today under a black government? IAN DOUGLAS SMITH WAS BETTER THAN MNANGAGWA governmentperiod.\n\nFather which art in Heaven, bless our fhrer Mnangagwa and his children forever. Yes, Mr. Chadzamira, we are praying as you can see.It is inconceivable how Zimbabweans will endure humiliation in various degrees by this hell of a government of Mnangagwa. We are told to pray for him all the same even if he is abusing his power over us.The economyis at the edge of collapse. Resilient citizens wake up in the early hours of the day to market their products at Mbare. Mbare was burnt down by the state, accused ofsinking the Zig dollar.Seeing the burnt down Mbare, you feel the satanismand hatethat caused the destruction of the marketplace: the place where people were trying their utter best to put bread on the tablefor their children. Mnangagwa decides to burn it down to spite them. In Shona we say, Hutsinye. Chimwe ne chimwe chinenguva yacho, mufunge!Everything will come to pass. Whoever thought Mugabe governmentwouldbe history. Mnangagwa is 85 years old. All things being equal, he will depart from this earth like theinnocent personhe murdered. What a god! He lets goodness and human kindness to be subordinated toevil.Glad I am not a Christian!\n\nI quote Chadzamira:Insubordination, unethical conduct, indiscipline and disobedience are all characteristics inhumane behaviour which calls for dismissal from church by supreme leader hence as politicians, we also operate within the confines of biblical texts and discourses. Pray for only supreme leaders since they carry blessings for us all, and without submission to them, we are nothing and best candidates for hell, Chadzamira declares.\n\n",

highest office of the land, the expectations of the people remain high.\n\nGhana needs decisive action to address pressing issues such as economic revitalization, industrialization, youth empowerment, technological advancement, and infrastructural development, goals that align with Dr. Nkrumahs ideology of self-determination and economic emancipation.\n\nTo this end, ACUC humbly submits for your consideration key thematic areas that could define Ghanas transformational agenda under your stewardship:\n\nEconomic Independence and Industrialization:\n\nMoving from a raw material-exporting economy to an industrialized, value-added production system is crucial.\n\nPolicies prioritizing manufacturing, agribusiness, and technology-driven industries must be central to our national development agenda.\n\nEducation and Innovation:\n\nInvestment in STEM education, technical training, and research institutions should be amplified to cultivate a generation of problem-solvers and innovators who can drive Ghanas technological advancement.\n\nPan-Africanism and Regional Integration:\n\nStrengthening Ghanas role in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and fostering stronger economic ties with African nations will be essential in achieving economic resilience and collective prosperity.\n\nYouth and Job Creation:\n\nPolicies that stimulate entrepreneurship, support small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and create sustainable employment opportunities for the youth should be prioritized to curb unemployment and promote economic inclusivity.\n\nEnergy and Infrastructure Development:\n\nExpanding access to reliable energy, investing in modern transportation networks, and improving digital infrastructure will position Ghana as a competitive player in the global economy.\n\nYour Excellency, your historic commitment to Pan-Africanism was exemplified in 2016 when your administration granted Ghanaian citizenship to 34 Afro-descendants.\n\nThis initiative, spearheaded by Dr. Maulana Maulana and supported by your then Executive Secretary and former Deputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Ambassador Kwesi Quartey, was a historic step in reconnecting the African diaspora with the motherland.\n\nIt sent a powerful message of inclusion and belonging, reaffirming Ghanas role as a beacon for African unity and integration.\n\nYour symbolic Key of Return to African-descendants must not remain a moment in history but a sustained initiative.\n\nIt is our hope that your administration will expand this program, enabling awarded citizens to integrate fully into Ghanaian communities and contribute meaningfully to national development.\n\nTheir diverse skills, investments, and cultural heritage can play a vital role in achieving and sustaining the 24-hour economy model you envision.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of neo-colonial divestitures of state properties, including strategic assets such as Ghana Telecom, warrants urgent reassessment.\n\nRepossessing such assets could be instrumental in strengthening national development goals under your 24-hour economy framework.\n\nEnsuring that Ghana maintains control over its key economic resources will be crucial in building a resilient and self-sustaining economy.\n\nYour Excellency, the burden of leadership is great, but the opportunity to shape history is even greater.\n\nThe people of Ghana look to you not only to uphold the tenets of democracy but to also lead the nation into a new era of economic transformation and social equity.\n\nIt is our collective responsibility to ensure that the ideals of Dr. Nkrumah remain alive and relevant in shaping the destiny of our beloved nation.\n\nAs you embark on this crucial journey, may wisdom, strength, and the unwavering support of the people guide you.\n\nGhanas future lies in bold leadership, and I trust that you will rise to the occasion to deliver on the aspirations of the people.\n\nWe hope, the properties of the Nkrumahs Convention Peoples Party, (CPP) as requested by the Party are returned to the rightful owner under your watch as the President of Ghana, who believes in the idea/ ideals of Kwame Nkrumah, and indeed, from the stalk of the CPP.\n\nWith utmost respect and best regards,\n\nBenjamin Anyagre Aziginaateeg, CEO, African Continental Union Consult, ACUC.\n\n",
