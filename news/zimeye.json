            "content": "By Dorrothy Moyo | ZimEye |Harare, Zimbabwe  The Harare City Council has come under fire for approving two cemetery projects over key water infrastructure, raising fears of contamination to the citys raw water sources. Both cemeteries, located above the Prince Edward Waterworks main trunk and in areas feeding into the Seke Dam, have drawn criticism from health experts, environmentalists, and residents.\n\nThe approvals have triggered concerns about the potential health hazards posed by decomposing human remains, embalming chemicals, and surface water runoff seeping into Harares water supply system. Stakeholders fear the projects could lead to a repeator worseof the recent Lake Chivero pollution crisis, where untreated sewage discharge caused widespread ecological damage.\n\nTwo Projects, One Common Risk\n\nOne cemetery project is situated directly above the main water trunk of the Prince Edward Waterworks near Chitungwiza, while the second is located along Seke Road near water streams feeding into the Seke Dam. Both areas are critical to Harares raw water supply network.\n\nExperts warn that rainwater could carry harmful contaminants from decomposing bodies, including embalming fluids containing mercury and other toxic chemicals, into groundwater and surface water systems. Such contamination poses a direct risk to human health, livestock, and aquatic ecosystems.\n\nPublic Health Alarm\n\nPermanent Secretary for Health and Child Care, Dr. Aspect Maunganidze, confirmed that the ministry has launched an investigation into the health implications of the cemeteries. Our team is conducting assessments, and a report will determine the next steps. Public health is our priority, he said.\n\nDespite these reassurances, residents are questioning how both projects were approved without sufficient consultation or Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) being completed.\n\nCouncils Position\n\nHarare City Council officials defended their decisions, stating that permits for the cemeteries were issued with conditions, including mandatory EIAs. Acting Director of Urban Planning, Mr. Samuel Nyabezi, argued that the process aligns with regulations, adding, If the conditions are not met, the permits will be revoked.\n\nHowever, the citys Department of Water had previously raised red flags over the cemetery near the Prince Edward Waterworks, warning of possible pipe ruptures and contamination risks. Engineer Zvenyika Chawatama, Director of Works for Harare City Council, acknowledged these concerns and indicated steps are being taken to map out pipelines and ensure no graves are placed above them.\n\nEnvironmental Management Agencys Role\n\nThe Environmental Management Agency (EMA) has faced criticism for its role in the approvals. While EMA spokesperson Ms. Amkela Sidange confirmed that assessments excluded designated wetland areas, she emphasized that public health risks are beyond EMAs mandate. Planning authorities must involve environmental health experts to prevent such risks, shetold the state run Herald paper,\n\nExpert and Public Outcry\n\nPublic health experts have called the decision to allow two cemetery projects in such sensitive areas reckless. One expert warned, We could face a water contamination crisis that dwarfs the Lake Chivero incident. Both cemeteries are dangerously close to critical water infrastructure.\n\nResidents, meanwhile, are outraged at the lack of transparency and consultation. Local communities affected by the projects argue that their safety and livelihoods have been sidelined in favor of questionable development priorities.\n\nThe Bigger Picture\n\nThe simultaneous approval of two cemetery projects over Harares waterworks raises broader concerns about urban planning and governance in the city. With investigations ongoing and public pressure mounting, stakeholders are demanding a halt to the projects until comprehensive environmental and health assessments are completed.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is expected to release its findings soon, but for now, the controversial cemetery projects remain a flashpoint for Harares water security and public health.\n\nScholarly Report: The Risks of Cemetery Development on Critical Water Infrastructure\n\nCemetery placement above critical water infrastructure poses significant environmental and public health risks. Globally, examples from both developing and developed countries demonstrate the potential for severe consequences when burial grounds contaminate nearby water sources. The case of Harares decision to approve two cemetery projects above the Prince Edward Waterworks highlights these risks. Drawing from academic studies and historical precedents, this report underscores the dangers of such developments.\n\n1. Groundwater Contamination\n\nMechanisms of Contamination\n\nDecomposing human remains release organic and inorganic pollutants, including nitrogen, phosphorus, ammonia, and chloride. These compounds, along with heavy metals such as mercury from embalming fluids and lead from coffins, seep into the soil and groundwater through infiltration. The process accelerates during heavy rainfall or if the water table is shallow.\n\nExamples\n\nSo Paulo, Brazil: Studies conducted in So Paulo revealed high concentrations of nitrate in groundwater near cemeteries. Nitrate contamination, primarily from decomposing bodies, exceeded safe drinking water limits and posed significant health risks, including methemoglobinemia (blue baby syndrome) in infants.\n\nAdelaide, Australia: Research on cemeteries in Adelaide found microbial contamination of groundwater with coliform bacteria and pathogens likeEscherichia coli, linked to burial practices.\n\nApplication to Harare\n\nIn Harare, the cemeteries proximity to the Prince Edward Waterworks trunk and Seke Dam increases the likelihood of contaminants entering raw water supplies. The threat is amplified by the regions rainy seasons, which exacerbate leaching into both groundwater and surface water systems.\n\n2. Public Health Implications\n\nPathogen Transmission\n\nDecomposing human remains harbor a wide range of pathogens, including those causing tuberculosis, hepatitis, and cholera. These pathogens can persist in burial sites for decades and may infiltrate water systems.\n\nCase Study\n\nLake Victoria Basin, East Africa: An epidemiological study found that cemeteries near water sources contributed to cholera outbreaks during rainy seasons, as pathogens infiltrated drinking water systems used by local communities.\n\nRelevance to Harare\n\nWith Harares history of cholera outbreaks, including a deadly epidemic in 2018, the placement of cemeteries near critical water infrastructure could exacerbate the citys vulnerability to waterborne diseases.\n\n3. Infrastructure Risks\n\nPipeline Damage and Leaching\n\nCemeteries placed over water pipelines increase the risk of ruptures, allowing contaminants to infiltrate treated water supplies. Ground movement from burials and the weight of coffins can stress underground infrastructure, leading to cracks and leaks.\n\nExamples\n\nLondon, UK: In 2001, aging pipelines under an old cemetery were found to have ruptured, causing localized water contamination. The incident spurred changes in cemetery planning laws to prevent further risks.\n\nHarare Context\n\nThe Prince Edward Waterworks pipeline, a critical trunk for the citys water supply, lies beneath the proposed cemetery site. Ruptures in this pipeline could introduce pollutants directly into treated water, leading to widespread health hazards.\n\n4. Regulatory Gaps and Oversight Failures\n\nImportance of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs)\n\nScholarly research highlights the necessity of comprehensive EIAs for cemetery projects near water sources. EIAs should assess soil permeability, hydrology, and the proximity of burial sites to aquifers, wells, and pipelines.\n\nExamples of Poor Planning\n\nAccra, Ghana: A lack of proper EIAs resulted in the establishment of cemeteries on wetlands. Subsequent studies found increased pollution levels in nearby streams and reservoirs, negatively affecting community health.\n\nHarares Oversight\n\nThe Harare City Councils approval of the cemeteries without completed EIAs contravenes international best practices. Furthermore, the Environmental Management Agencys (EMA) conditional approval raises questions about whether critical health and safety factors were fully addressed.\n\n5. Environmental and Economic Consequences\n\nEcosystem Impact\n\nCemetery pollution not only affects human health but also damages ecosystems. Leachate from burial sites alters the chemical balance of water systems, harming aquatic life and reducing biodiversity.\n\nEconomic Costs\n\nThe cleanup of contaminated water systems and the treatment of waterborne diseases impose significant financial burdens. For example:\n\nBangladesh: A World Health Organization (WHO) report noted that contaminated water sources near cemeteries increased the costs of water treatment by 40%.\n\nFor Harare, the economic implications could be devastating, especially given the citys existing water treatment challenges and financial constraints.\n\n6. Recommendations\n\n1.Suspend Cemetery Projects Pending Comprehensive EIA\n\nBoth cemetery projects should be halted until detailed EIAs are conducted to evaluate the risks of groundwater and pipeline contamination.\n\n2.Adopt Cemetery Zoning Regulations\n\nZoning laws should prohibit burial grounds near critical water infrastructure, aquifers, or surface water sources.\n\n3.Monitor and Mitigate Risks\n\nLong-term monitoring of groundwater and pipeline integrity near burial sites is essential to detect and address contamination early.\n\n4.Public Consultation and Transparency\n\nLocal communities should be included in decision-making processes to ensure that public health and environmental concerns are prioritized.\n\nScientific evidence and global case studies unequivocally demonstrate the dangers of placing cemeteries near water infrastructure. The decision to approve two cemetery projects over Harares waterworks is fraught with risks that could compromise the citys water security, public health, and environmental sustainability. Immediate action is required to reassess these projects and implement policies that prevent similar threats in the future.\n\n",

I was drinking alone at Montague when my friend Dr Gari Prince showed up.\n\nWe had a short chat and he asked me to get into his car. He drove to Chicken Slice near Mbare studios.\n\nThe first person I met who was a Dynamos official was a guy called Richard Chihoro. Gari quickly introduced us and told Nyoka that he was leaving me in charge of his portfolio as the Dynamos F.C team doctor whilst he was away on consultancy.\n\nMe and Gari knew he was going to greener pastures. I knew mdara Chihoro coz on several occasions I had been part of the Vietnam crowd that had sang against him and the entire technical bench outside Rufaro and NSS on several occasions when things were not going our way. To those who know me, know that I was like that in my previous life.\n\nThat first day, that first encounter with this gentleman changed my entire life. This was the beginning of the rest of my life. (I now have a huge sports resume, unbelievable).This guy gently introduced me to the flipside of how I viewed Dynamos. 2 days later, we were playing those Bob something games against Caps. He made sure I had my room at Holiday Inn, (somehow always thought Dembare yaingo camper kwamudoronyenye), gave me a bag full of stuffthose days BancAbc knew how to dress us well. Sunday I had my first winners medal, Tuesday Nyoka showed up with an envelope for the winning bonuses. Gees, ndakawira mushuga nemistake.\n\nYears went by and we had our ups and downs. Politics dzekubhora, different coaches, different beliefs, but many a times we would laugh about many of it.

Tuesday we would have a good laugh. He knew me well to tell me just enough. The rest he kept to himself.\n\nAs a doctor we shared a lot. He leant to trust me and I supported him as best I could. It hurts the most that I was not there in his final hour but the bond we shared with him and our close companion Job Zambo allowed it so that he was there with him that he had as much a comfortable cross over as possible. (Believe me that combination yakatomboita dambudziko zvekutodaro). When things go south for me one day, please call that guy first. I beg.\n\nToday i say goodbye Mr Richard Chihoro. Nyoka. MHOFU.

            "content": "Chaos Looms as Witch Doctor July Moyo Becomes Energy Minister in a Nation Entrenched in Ritualistic Folklore\n\nBy Farai D Hove | ZimEye | ANALYSIS |In a move that has ignited controversy, ridicule, and fear, the President of our beleaguered nation has appointed July Moyo, his long-time ritualistic witch doctor, as the new Minister of Energy. In a country already grappling with bizarre and deeply superstitious practices surrounding electricity production, this decision has sent shockwaves through both the public and international observers.\n\nEmmerson Mnangagwa chuckles after getting the nod to get Ezekiel Guti's corpse before the late's church members get a piece of it for rituals, as taught/practiced. | ADDITIONAL FOOTAGE FOR CONTEXT.pic.twitter.com/gv8qlDxgui\n\nThe appointment comes as the nation faces a dire energy crisis, marked by daily blackouts lasting up to 18 hours and industries crippled by erratic power supplies. But instead of pursuing tangible solutions rooted in science and technology, the government appears to have embraced the absurd. Moyo, notorious for his ritualistic practices, is expected to oversee the countrys energy portfolio, raising fears of even more unconventional and unscientific attempts to generate power.\n\nA History of Rituals in the Energy Sector\n\nThe appointment of Moyo is not an isolated incident in the nations troubled history with energy policies. In 2007, during the height of the countrys energy crisis, a group of government officials famously claimed that diesel was oozing from the sacred Chinhoyi Mountain. A witch doctor had allegedly performed rituals to summon diesel from the rocks. The bizarre claim saw ministers rushing to the site, accompanied by drums, songs, and promises of a miraculous energy solution. The debacle ultimately unraveled as a scam, embarrassing the government and exposing the lengths to which desperation had driven national leadership.\n\nIn 2019, the country signed a staggering USD 5 billion contract to extract diesel from coal. However, like the Chinhoyi incident, the project never materialized. Instead, it became another footnote in the nations legacy of mismanagement, corruption, and the blending of mystical beliefs with national policy-making.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the country recently dangled millions to convicted fraudster Wicknell Chivayo in the belief that electricity would soon flow under his stewardship. With such irrational decisions setting the precedent, its only a matter of time before we witness even more fantastical attempts to resolve the crisis. Very soon, the country could see:\n\n1.Electric wires being connected to graves in an attempt to harness ancestral energy.\n\n2.Electric wires being connected to mountains, in the hope of tapping into some mystical earth current.\n\n3.Electric wires being connected to coal stones, with the promise that rituals will make them self-combust to produce endless energy.\n\n4.Electric wires being connected to more fat-bellied characters like Wicknell, who somehow become the face of the energy sector despite lacking expertise or integrity.\n\nJuly Moyos Legacy of Ritualism\n\nJuly Moyos appointment as Energy Minister has dredged up old fears about the role of ritualism in government. Known for presiding over secret ceremonies involving sacrifices and invocations, Moyo has long been a controversial figure within political circles. Critics argue that his rise to power signals a further descent into irrationality at a time when the country desperately needs practical, modern solutions to its energy crisis.\n\nHis first act as Energy Minister reportedly involved a ceremony in which he consulted ancestral spirits about the future of the countrys electricity grid. Eyewitnesses described scenes of animal sacrifices and chants, as Moyo promised that the ancestors will light up the nation. While some citizens, desperate for any resolution to the power crisis, clung to hope, others expressed outrage over what they see as a dangerous distraction from addressing systemic issues like decaying infrastructure and corruption.\n\nPublic Reaction and International Concern\n\nThe reaction to Moyos appointment has been one of widespread disbelief and growing unrest. Social media platforms are ablaze with criticism, with many mocking the government for prioritizing superstition over science. Protesters have already begun gathering in major cities, demanding the dismissal of Moyo and the implementation of practical energy solutions.\n\nInternationally, the appointment has been met with skepticism and concern. Energy experts and investors, already wary of the countrys tumultuous policies, are now questioning the credibility of a government willing to entrust its energy future to a figure rooted in mysticism. Neighboring countries, too, are watching closely, worried about the potential for regional instability as the nation edges closer to chaos.\n\nA Nation at a Crossroads\n\nAs the energy crisis deepens, the appointment of July Moyo represents a critical turning point for the nation. Will this move plunge the country further into darknessboth literal and figurativeor will it finally galvanize citizens to demand accountability and reject the intertwining of folklore with governance?\n\nFor now, the country remains in the grip of uncertainty, its future clouded by rituals, broken promises, and the ever-present specter of mismanagement. Only time will tell whether this gamble on superstition will yield light or leave the nation in an even deeper shadow.\n\n",

His followers have called for peaceful demonstrations of support, highlighting their desire for positive change and unity.\n\nSecurity Concerns\n\nWhile Mondlanes return has been met with widespread excitement, questions remain about the political climate and the potential challenges he may face upon his arrival. Calls for peace and protection for Mondlane have become a central theme in discussions among his supporters, who have expressed a mixture of hope and apprehension.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nAs January 9 approaches, Mozambiques eyes will be on Mavalane International Airport, where supporters are expected to gather in large numbers. Mondlanes return marks a critical moment in Mozambiques political landscape, one that could galvanize efforts toward unity and reform.\n\nFor now, Mozambicans are urged to come together peacefully, as Mondlane himself advocates for hope, resilience, and the enduring power of unity in the face of adversity.\n\nSpeech summary:\n\nGood evening, world, Africa, diaspora, Europe, America, Asia, Australia, Oceania, Antarctica, and everyone across the globe.\n\nIf youve joined this live broadcast, you can share it with 30 people or groups. This is one of the most important live streams in our ongoing struggle. Its been about two and a half months since the last discussion, and I wanted to share this live stream to communicate with you and provide updates.\n\nTheres been a lot of tension surrounding this live session. Were now at a critical moment, with countless lives lost and many in danger. The country faces grave challenges, and we must come together to discuss and act. Share this link with as many as possible30 people or moreso we can maximize our reach.\n\nMozambique is in turmoil. Reports from across the country show that the destruction, chaos, and violence are being orchestrated by state forces, including the police and military, who have been caught on camera ransacking businesses, targeting civilians, and committing unspeakable atrocities. Claims of terrorism in Cabo Delgado have suddenly disappeared, leaving the police and army responsible for the current crisis.\n\nInnocent lives, including youth and political supporters, are being targeted. We have seen countless deaths, injuries, and destruction, yet institutions like SADC and others remain silent or complicit. This live stream is a call to all who value freedom and justice.\n\nThe crisis is not isolated; its a reflection of the broader failure in leadership across the continent. Africas founding visionaries, like Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr., dreamed of a united and democratic continent. Today, however, we face greed, corruption, and violence that betray their legacies.\n\nThis is a plea for action. The world is watching as Mozambique struggles under the weight of oppression, and it is our collective responsibility to stand up for freedom and justice. Share this message widely. Let us honor the sacrifices of those who have fought and died for democracy, both in Mozambique and across Africa.\n\nWe must act. We must resist. Mozambique will rise.\n\n",

            "content": "Zimbabwe has recorded a remarkable milestone, clearing over one million travellers at its various ports of entry in December 2024. This achievement reflects the countrys strengthened regional and national developments, including the relaxation of visa regimes and the introduction of the user-friendly e-visa system. The milestone signals a new era for tourism and travel in Zimbabwe, aligning with the nations economic blueprint, the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1).\n\nChief Immigration Officer Ms Respect Gono noted the increase, comparing it to December 2023 figures of 840,000 travellers. This steady rise is a testament to the Second Republics commitment to ushering in a new era of easy and convenient travel, she stated. Other contributing factors include the prevailing peace, tranquillity, and economic progress.\n\nKey ports of entry contributed significantly to these numbers, with Beitbridge Border Post accounting for over 500,000 travellers, followed by Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport and Victoria Falls International Airport. Innovations like the Online Border Management System (OBMS) have enhanced efficiency, reducing traveller processing times, while modernisation efforts at Beitbridge have decongested facilities.\n\nSocial Medias Role in Driving Tourism Growth\n\nThis milestone aligns with global trends highlighted in recent tourism research, which underscores social medias transformative impact on destination perception and visit intentions. A study published in theAfrican Journal of Hospitality Tourism and Leisureidentifies key factors shaping tourists choices:\n\nDestination Credibility: Trust and transparency are critical. Zimbabwes streamlined visa process and secure environment have amplified its credibility as a travel destination.\n\nUser-Generated Content (UGC): Peer-generated travel reviews and social media content shape perceptions. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have likely contributed to Zimbabwes growing allure.\n\nInfluencer Marketing: Influencers serve as trusted voices, playing a pivotal role in promoting Zimbabwes attractions, including Victoria Falls and its wildlife sanctuaries.\n\nThe study, which surveyed 982 respondents predominantly from Generation Z and Millennials, also emphasized the role of trust, engagement, and social media interaction in influencing travel decisions. Zimbabwes ability to align its strategies with these dynamics has positioned the nation as a top destination in Africa.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nAs the nation celebrates its milestone, tourism experts suggest further leveraging digital marketing trends to sustain this growth. Expanding the focus to emotional and psychological drivers of tourist decision-making, as recommended by the study, could enhance Zimbabwes appeal. This includes refining marketing strategies that resonate with the evolving preferences of global travellers.\n\nZimbabwes success story is a testament to its strategic investments in infrastructure, policy reforms, and digital transformation. As global tourism rebounds, the nation is poised to remain a leader in creating seamless, accessible, and enriching travel experiences. Ziana\n\n",
