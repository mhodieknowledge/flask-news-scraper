            "content": "By Dorrothy Moyo | ZimEye | In an escalation of ZANU PFs internal succession war, Zimbabwes Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi has allegedly urged First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa to move swiftly and decisively to fire Vice President Constantino Chiwengadeclaring that the former general should forget about succeeding President Mnangagwa in 2028.\n\nThe revelation comes from a pair of high-level, JOC-style meetingsfirst held in Borrowdale, then at Precabe Farm, President Mnangagwas private estate. The gatherings were attended by Mnangagwa himself, Ziyambi, State Security Minister Lovemore Matuke, First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa, and senior operatives including Owen Mudha Ncube. Sources say the meetings bore the hallmarks of a Joint Operations Command (JOC) council, even if not officially designated as such.\n\nAccording to leaked intelligence notes, the agenda was clear: to eliminate internal resistance to Mnangagwas continued rule and neutralize potential threatsincluding Chiwenga and Retired Lieutenant General Engelbert Rugeje. One attendee reportedly volunteered to carry out the task, referencing a prior failed operation targeting Rugeje, where gunfire erupted but the former general was absent from the property.\n\nThe Precabe meeting followed a tense session in Borrowdale, where the newly installed army commander reportedly warned that if Chiwenga were removed, the barracks will be hot to touch, and even he, the commander, might not be able to enter. The statement was viewed as a stark reminder of Chiwengas lingering grip on the military.\n\nZiyambi, meanwhile, has privately dismissed any suggestion that Chiwenga remains in line to succeed Mnangagwa. In a WhatsApp exchange with ZimEye, he shot back at claims the VP was being groomed for 2028: Who said he cannot be elected in 2030?a loaded statement widely interpreted as confirmation that Chiwenga has been politically iced out.\n\nInside sources close to Auxillia Mnangagwa say shes grown increasingly wary of Chiwengas ambitions and has aligned herself with efforts to extend EDs rule beyond 2028. Ziyambi reportedly cited a resolution launched last year at Precabe by Shamu and Tshabangu in EDs presence that laid the groundwork for Mnangagwas prolonged stay in power, bypassing any VP-led transition.\n\nThe meeting reportedly turned theatrical when Mfanha Mutamba declared, Shefu, if you want me to go arrest him (Chiwenga), I can do it, underscoring the volatile nature of the political climate and the raw loyalty driving these confrontations.\n\nWhile Chiwenga has remained publicly silent, insiders suggest he is consolidating support within the military and war veterans. With the JOC-like gatherings deepening factional divides, Zimbabwe finds itself on the brink of a dangerous internal showdownone not fought in parliament or at the ballot box, but behind closed doors at Precabe.\n\nMore to follow\n\n",

These vehicles require additional space and may take a different course than expected to safely maneuver through the area.\n\nTo ensure safety for both yourself and the driver of the long vehicle, stay well back and give them plenty of room. Remember, their size and turning radius mean they need extra space to complete the maneuver without obstruction. By keeping a safe distance and being patient, you help prevent accidents and ensure smoother traffic flow for everyone on the road.\n\nAlways be aware of the needs of larger vehicles, particularly in tight spaces like roundabouts or when merging onto busy roads.
