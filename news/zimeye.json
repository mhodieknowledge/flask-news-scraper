A dark cloud has engulfed the Zimbabwe Defence Forces family, said Makotore. An Air Force of Zimbabwe F-7 fighter aircraft crashed in the Wazheri general area As a result of the crash, the pilot, Squadron Leader (retired) Ritswanetsi Vuyo Ncube, lost his life.\n\nSquadron Leader Ncube, a veteran pilot who had returned from retirement to continue serving in the Air Force, was actively involved in the training of young fighter pilots at Josiah Tungamirai Air Force Base. His passion for aviation and unwavering commitment to national duty had earned him deep respect within the ranks.\n\nIn a heartfelt tribute, Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, General Philip Valerio Sibanda, described the late pilot as a proficient and highly experienced pilot. He added, The Zimbabwe Defence Forces have learnt, with heavy hearts, of the passing on of Squadron Leader Ncube Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the deceased pilot.

If the DNA test shows Mahachi is not the father, we will not hesitate to pursue charges of perjury and misrepresentation.\n\nBut Marita was quick to hit back. She told the court that if the DNA results confirm Mahachi as the father, she would seek compensation for defamation of character, accusing him of tarnishing her name and putting their children through public humiliation.\n\nThis is about more than just money, Marita told the magistrate. Its about my dignity and the well-being of my children. If he is indeed the father, I deserve justice for the falsehoods he has spread about me.\n\nThe magistrate ordered a DNA test to conclusively determine the childs paternity and directed Mahachi to cover the cost of the procedure.\n\nWhat began as a maintenance dispute has now transformed into a high-stakes battle over truth, trust, and personal honour. With both sides standing their ground, the case has gripped public attention.\n\nThe magistrate is expected to make a formal ruling soon, but the DNA results may ultimately decide the fate of this family dispute.\n\nB Metro\n\n",

I argued for the heads of arguments. The state presented their heads of arguments as well. The case was adjourned to 10 June, said a member of Masiwas legal team.\n\nThe lawyer revealed that further consultations with Masiwa were necessary, particularly concerning personal matters, but the state pushed back against the defences application.\n\nI needed to consult with Mr. Masiwa. I needed to ask him questions over his first wife, and the children. The state refused to accept the application they said there has to be new evidence, the lawyer explained. Yes, I do accept they are receiving new evidence, but I still confirmed completing the new application itself. I still proceeded, I still raised my defence and I just hope that the magistrate makes a very informed decision  in terms of the Constitution, in terms of dignity, freedom, and his rights. I really hope that the magistrate passes this decision.\n\nAccording to the defence, the magistrate appeared emotionally affected at some point during the proceedings.\n\nThe issue is this man has been locked up for about 47 days. He has a right to freedom; he has a right to see his family. Hes a human being, the lawyer argued passionately. This is why I argued like that. This is why I argued that he should have gotten his freedom. He shouldnt be locked up in a foreign country. I have raised these points. I believe that he should be with his family while awaiting trial.\n\nThe defence is now awaiting the magistrates ruling on the matter, which is expected to take into account the constitutional rights and humanitarian concerns raised during the hearing.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nHARARE  The Bankers Association of Zimbabwe (BAZ) has issued a stark warning about the devastating effects of private cash hoarding, accusing the countrys wealthiest individuals of undermining the national economy by keeping billions of dollars outside the formal financial system.\n\nIn a scathing critique of Zimbabwes shadow banking culture, Sibongile Moyo, the newly appointed BAZ president and managing director of Nedbank Zimbabwe, painted a grim picture of how a few cash-rich individuals have become de facto banks, hoarding funds in vaults, safes, and even under mattresses.\n\nA lot of money is circulating outside the formal banking system. I think individuals have almost become like banks themselvesprobably holding more money than what we hold in the banks, Moyo said. That money is effectively not working for the economy because its sitting outside the formal channelwe cant use it to lend.\n\nThe impact is massive. Zimbabwes entire formal banking sector holds just US$3.3 billion in deposits, a figure dwarfed by the suspected volume of unbanked wealth. Of that US$3.3 billion:\n\nUS$1.9 billion (58%) is already committed to loans,\n\n30% is locked in statutory reserves and regulatory requirements,\n\nleaving just 12% available for everyday banking operations, including interbank settlements and liquidity needs.\n\nSo look, the entire market only has US$3.3 billion of deposits, which is a very small pool from which to lend, Moyo emphasized. We are already lending most of it, and what remains cannot support meaningful growth or economic transformation.\n\nAccording to Moyo, the core of the issue lies not only in hoarding but also in the structure of deposits, which are mostly short-term and volatile.\n\nThere is no capacity to lend long-term because more than 70% of deposits are current accountspeople who want their money the next day. You cant transform that into long-term assets, she said.\n\nAdding to the challenge, Zimbabwes capital and bond markets are shallow, forcing banks to act as the sole intermediaries of long-term finance, despite being ill-equipped for such a role.\n\nWith limited local funding options, the banking sector has resorted to external lines of credit to try and bridge the gap. But this is neither sustainable nor ideal, especially for an economy already facing credibility challenges in the global financial market.\n\nBAZ is now calling for urgent policy measures to incentivize formal banking, restore trust, and address the root causes of hoardingchief among them being economic uncertainty, lack of confidence in the financial system, and regulatory loopholes that allow hoarders to operate with impunity.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nOutspoken Zanu PF official Killer Zivhu has stirred fresh controversy after publicly showering praise on Wicknell Chivayo, describing the embattled businessman as a charismatic and influential figure with strategic value far beyond Zimbabwes borders.\n\nIn a statement issued Wednesday, Zivhu  no stranger to provocative political commentary  defended Chivayos growing public profile, despite widespread criticism over his extravagant spending and opaque business dealings.\n\nLets face it, Wicknell is a master planner with influence across Africa, Asia, and parts of Europe, said Zivhu.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government seeks his expertise, and many African nations highly regard him. His endorsement carries weight in international deal-making.\n\nChivayo, known for his controversial government tenders and flashy philanthropy, has divided public opinion in recent months. While some praise his donations to public figures and institutions, others question the source and transparency of his wealth.\n\nZivhu, however, was unapologetic in his admiration, calling Chivayo a vital asset to Zimbabwes diplomatic and business interests.\n\nHis comments come amid growing scrutiny over how state contracts are awarded and the rising power of politically connected businessmen.\n\nIn the same statement, Zivhu also reaffirmed his allegiance to President Emmerson Mnangagwa, asserting that ED remains the only viable leader for Zimbabwes foreseeable future.\n\nED is the only capable person to continue as president. For the time being, we dont have any other candidate until 2035, Zivhu declared. Chamisa has chances only if he joins ZANU-PF and replaces ED by 2035. This is a reality that pains many people, but they cant do anything about it.\n\nThe remarks are likely to provoke political backlash, especially as opposition leader Nelson Chamisa continues to gain support from Zimbabwes youth and urban electorate. Zivhus suggestion that Chamisa would need to join ZANU-PF to ever become president highlights the entrenched political dominance of the ruling party  and the limited avenues for electoral change in the current landscape.\n\nBoth Chivayo and Zivhu remain lightning rods for controversy, frequently trending on social media and dominating public discourse. This latest endorsement has once again brought to the fore questions about power, money, and the future of leadership in Zimbabwe.\n\n",
