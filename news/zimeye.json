Speaking at the Zimbabwe Defence University, Deputy President of the Senate, Hon. Lt. Gen. (Rtd) M.R. Nyambuya emphasized the critical importance of parliamentary involvement in safeguarding the countrys security and democratic processes.\n\nParliament has a vital oversight role and a responsibility to contribute meaningfully to national security and stability, Nyambuya told military officers and faculty during a presentation. His remarks come at a time when public trust in Parliament is under severe strain, following the Ministry of Local Governments confirmation that residential stands are being distributed to MPs as non-monetary benefits.\n\nAccording to a press statement from the Ministry dated 10 April, 70 stands were allocated just this week in Mabelreign, Goromonzi, and Zvimba  part of a broader program benefitting MPs from the 8th to 10th Parliaments. While government insists this is a constitutional welfare initiative, critics see it as a direct response to impeachment efforts spearheaded by anti-corruption activist Blessed Geza.\n\nThe timing of these handouts has raised eyebrows, with observers pointing to the proximity of the disbursements to Gezas 31 March protest and impeachment motion. The perception is that the ruling elite is using state resources to buy political loyalty and stave off accountability.\n\nProminent MPs have broken ranks with the establishment narrative. Harare West MP Joana Mamombe voiced her outrage on social media, stating:\n\nThis is heartbreaking! Our precious greenways in #HarareWest are being carved up to allocate MP stands  without any community consultation or consent. These green spaces sustain us in the community This is unjust and wrong!\n\nAmid the growing controversy, Nyambuyas remarks appear to be a subtle yet strategic attempt to reframe Parliaments position not as a complicit beneficiary of state largesse, but as a guardian of national interest  even as the very institution is accused of undermining that principle by accepting land on questionable grounds.\n\nWith Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda already facing international scrutiny for war crimes allegations, the spotlight on Parliament has never been more intense. Whether Nyambuyas appeal to national duty will reassure the public remains to be seen, as the Geza Movement continues to rally for broader accountability and constitutional order.\n\n",

Mhike and Provincial Financial Director, Liniah Chinoda, are accused of corruption, prompting prosecutor Isabel Pambuka to request a further remand due to outstanding responses from three government departments: the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, Public Service Commission, and Treasury.\n\nThe prosecution requested a further remand, citing incomplete responses from key government departments. Mhikes lawyer, Yolander Chandata, protested the remand, arguing that investigations should have been completed by March 31, 2025, and a trial date set. Chandata claimed further delays would violate her clients right to a timely trial.\n\nCorruption in education is a widespread problem, affecting many countries, including Iraq and South Sudan. In Iraq, for example, a former education minister was accused of taking credit for a non-governmental organizations (NGO) work in rebuilding a school.\n\nIn South Sudan, corruption has led to severe consequences, including underfunding of essential public services and undermining the effectiveness of anti-corruption laws.\n\n",

The announcement follows mounting pressure on the Mnangagwa administration, particularly from anti-corruption campaigner Blessed Geza, who recently called for the presidents impeachment.\n\nIn a press statement dated 10 April 2025, the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works outlined the governments plan to allocate stands to MPs from the 8th, 9th, and current 10th Parliament as a once-off entitlement under their conditions of service. The statement confirms that 70 stands were issued on 9 April  40 in Mabelreign (Harare), 15 in Killarney (Goromonzi), and 15 in Penrose (Zvimba).\n\nThe announcement has triggered widespread backlash over what many see as a politically motivated move to shield President Emmerson Mnangagwa from accountability. Critics argue the disbursements, coming immediately after Gezas public protest, are designed to buy loyalty from legislators who may be asked to vote on impeachment proceedings.\n\nAmong the most vocal critics is Harare West MP Joana Mamombe, who took to social media to denounce the allocations, particularly their impact on public land:\n\nThis is heartbreaking! Our precious greenways in #HarareWest are being carved up to allocate MP stands  without any community consultation or consent. These green spaces sustain us in the community. How can we destroy what gives us life? This is unjust and wrong!\n\nDespite efforts to present the allocations as part of a broader welfare initiative, no clear process of public consultation has been identified, and key local authorities  including the Harare City Council and the Department of Housing in Mbare  have not issued statements to clarify the criteria or transparency mechanisms involved.\n\nThe allocations are also being viewed within the context of deeper political maneuvering. Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda, under international scrutiny for unresolved war crimes allegations raised in a 2019 ZimEye interview, is believed to be central to the orchestration of the land handouts.\n\nAs the Geza Movement continues to escalate its campaign, promising further action if impeachment is blocked, the regimes resort to land giveaways has become a flashpoint. What was framed as support for MPs is now seen by many  including those within Parliament  as an abuse of state resources to protect the powerful.- ZimEye\n\n",
