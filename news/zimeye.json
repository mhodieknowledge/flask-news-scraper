This is no ordinary club, he said.\n\nMarriot, who also serves as board chairman, remains optimistic that the season can be salvaged if everyone works together.\n\nThere are 23 league games left. If we pull in the same direction, we can still win the title, he added. This is a dry spell, not a death sentenceprovided we stay together.\n\nThe meeting, set for tomorrow, will bring together chapter heads from across the country to discuss the ongoing crisis and explore ways to restore unity. A key objective will be to persuade supporter leaders to encourage their members to back the team and call off the planned boycott.\n\nClub sources say both parties view the meeting as a critical opportunity to repair the fractured relationship ahead of what is arguably the seasons biggest fixture.\n\n",

            "content": "NEWS ANALYSIS: BILLIONS SPENT, BUT WHERE ARE THE RESULTS?\n\nBig figures only, chiona zvima projects zvacho masaramusi. This blunt remark from former legislator Killer Zivhu, posted on X (formerly Twitter), cuts to the heart of Zimbabwes current infrastructure and public service crisis: astronomical budgets are announced, yet on the ground, the projects are either shoddy, unfinished, or outright invisible.\n\nZivhus comment is not just a jabit is a profound critique of Zimbabwes state machinery, particularly its public procurement and implementation systems. He lists amounts80 million, 1 billion, 15 billion, 187 million, 25 million, 300 millionfigures commonly attached to state projects and government announcements. These numbers are often touted with pomp in the state media, used to signal development and progress. However, Zivhu challenges this with biting realism: chiona zvima projects zvacho masaramusijust look at the pitiful state of the actual projects.\n\nBILLIONS IN THE AIR, MUD ON THE GROUND\n\nZimbabweans have grown accustomed to hearing about massive investments: US$90 million on the Mbudzi Interchange, billions for Command Agriculture, hundreds of millions for road rehabilitation, dam construction, and housing developments. But the actual output frequently resembles what Zivhu calls masaramusia Shona term suggesting something ridiculous, laughable, or utterly disappointing.\n\nThe discrepancy between publicized budget allocations and the final delivery is staggering. Many projects show signs of poor workmanship, misallocation of resources, or outright abandonment. For example, the Mbudzi Interchange projectdespite its multi-million-dollar price taghas been widely ridiculed for misaligned brickwork and unfinished structures.\n\nSYSTEMIC FAILURE: CORRUPTION OR INCOMPETENCE?\n\nZivhus rhetorical questionProblem ndeye vanopa basa here? kana kuti vanopiwa basa racho kuti vaite?asks whether the problem lies with those awarding the tenders or those executing them. This is the crux of Zimbabwes governance dilemma. Is it elite-level corruption and favoritism in contract allocation, or is it the sheer lack of capacity among those awarded the jobs?\n\nIn many cases, tenders are granted without transparent bidding processes. Companies linked to politically connected individuals are often handpicked, bypassing accountability mechanisms. Sometimes these entities exist only on paper. The result is a vicious cycle of inflated budgets, abandoned sites, and no service delivery.\n\nCALLING FOR ACCOUNTABILITY\n\nZivhus post reflects growing public frustration. Zimbabweans are not just tired of corruptionthey are tired of failure. People are asking: where is the money going? Who is auditing these projects? What happened to the roads that were meant to be paved? The clinics that were to be built? The schools and water systems that were supposedly funded?\n\nWhile Zivhu himself is a controversial figurehaving been expelled from ZANU PFhis remarks resonate widely. They capture the broader reality of a nation where headlines are filled with billions, but daily life remains mired in potholes, dry taps, and broken promises.\n\nWORDS VS. WORK\n\nZimbabwes developmental rhetoric is rich in billions and slogans, but desperately poor in results. Until there is a shift in how tenders are awarded, how projects are monitored, and how officials are held accountable, the country will continue to churn out big figures onlywith little to show for them.\n\nThe people deserve more than figures. They deserve function.\n\n",
