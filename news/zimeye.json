He emphasized that the team is diverse, with players from overseas, South Africa, and local leagues, each with different situations.\n\nNees expressed concerns about the fitness levels of local players, having only played a few matches. He described the process of selecting players without properly assessing their fitness as a blind flight.\n\nThe Warriors will face Benin on March 20 in Durban, South Africa, before traveling to Uyo, Nigeria to take on the Super Eagles on March 25. Nees squad announcement is eagerly anticipated, as fans await the teams preparation for these critical World Cup qualifiers.\n\n",

            "content": "Overloading buses to the point where passengers are standing is becoming an increasing safety hazard. While it may be a common practice, this situation poses serious risks to passengers and needs to be addressed by authorities.\n\nOne of the main dangers of overcrowded buses is the excessive weight that is placed on the vehicle. When a bus is overloaded, it becomes harder for the driver to maintain control, especially when navigating sharp turns or sudden stops. In the event the driver is forced to apply the emergency brake, passengers who are standing are at risk of falling and sustaining injuries due to the lack of support.\n\nMoreover, standing passengers are more vulnerable to accidents in the event of sudden maneuvers. They lack the security of a seat belt or a steady handrail, making them more likely to be thrown off balance and potentially hurt in an accident. The possibility of injury only increases when buses are traveling at high speeds or during congested traffic conditions.\n\nThe safety of passengers should always be a priority, and overloading buses compromises this fundamental principle. Passengers deserve a safe and secure journey, and it is crucial for bus operators and regulatory authorities to enforce strict guidelines on vehicle capacity to prevent overloading.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, authorities should consider increasing inspections of public transportation systems and impose fines for overloading violations. Moreover, bus companies must adhere to regulated passenger limits and ensure that all safety protocols are followed to protect the well-being of those traveling.\n\nIn conclusion, the practice of overloading buses is not only illegal but extremely dangerous. It is essential for both passengers and authorities to recognize the risks involved and work together to prioritize safety in public transport.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

Ignore all the sideshows and ignorance. The heavens will confound all, silencing all the disbelief, cynicism, and criticism. It is about His name and fame that must be exalted, not any other mans name or fame, he said.\n\nHe also expressed confidence that Gods plan for Zimbabwe was unfolding, citing the biblical passage Psalm 126:1-3 to reinforce his belief. Gods hand is moving mightily in Zimbabwe. God is not man that He should promise and not do it. He doesnt promise then compromise His promise.

A police report has been filed at Makoni Police Station under RRB Number 6346710.\n\nOn Monday night, an X user identified as @DrAfricanPride alleged that Marapira and Zanu PF national youth member for environment, Batsirai Joel Matiza, were linked to Mabvirakares disappearance.\n\nResponding to the claims, Marapira denied any involvement beyond introducing Mabvirakare to Matiza, whom she had approached for support with a farming project.\n\nThat was the end of my involvement bar updates here and there from the both of them being excited with their project, Marapira said.\n\nHe further explained that tensions arose in January when Matiza informed him that an audit team had discovered financial mismanagement on Mabvirakares part.\n\nAs a person who introduced them, I went to his office to understand better and after they explained, I texted Nadia asking to see her and discuss the matter, he said.\n\nMarapira recounted that Mabvirakare agreed to meet him the next day and told him the case had already been reported to the police.\n\nShe told me to ask him to suspend the police report and asked to meet in a neutral venue he stated.\n\nMarapira has since demanded a public retraction from the netizen who made the allegations.\n\nbe responsible enough to acknowledge publicly that your assertions against me were unwarranted since you also made them publicly, he said.\n\nMaybe next time an inquiry first would help hey.\n\nMeanwhile, police have launched an investigation into Mabvirakares alleged disappearance.\n\n",

Tatenda Mavetera, the Minister of ICT, has made a significant contribution to education in Masvingo by donating Core i5 laptops and a Starlink kit during the ZANU-PF Thank You Rally at Gwengavi Primary School in Masvingo West constituency on Saturday.\n\nThis donation aims to empower students with digital tools and promote digital literacy, ensuring the youth have the necessary resources to thrive in the future.\n\nHowever, despite the commendable gesture, concerns are rising that prolonged power outages and the ongoing load shedding crisis could severely limit the impact of Maveteras donation.\n\nWith power outages being a persistent issue across the country, the laptops and Starlink kit may remain underutilized if there is no reliable electricity to charge or operate the devices.\n\nWhile the donation to Gwengavi Primary School and 15 additional schools in Masvingo is a positive step toward improving digital infrastructure, the chronic power shortages in Zimbabwe pose a significant obstacle.\n\nThe lack of consistent electricity to power these new technologies could render the initiative ineffective, as students and teachers may find themselves unable to use the equipment on a regular basis.\n\nThe issue of load shedding has affected various sectors, including education, making it difficult for schools to fully embrace technological advancements.\n\nEven with the provision of modern gadgets, the success of such initiatives is undermined when the power supply remains unreliable.\n\nMinister Maveteras efforts to enhance Zimbabwes digital infrastructure are indeed commendable, but without addressing the root issue of consistent power supply, the long-term effectiveness of these initiatives may be compromised.\n\nThe government must prioritize solutions to the ongoing power crisis to ensure that such donations can truly benefit the future generation and contribute to the countrys digital transformation.\n\n",

It is disappointing to see such tactics being used against those who merely want to engage with their constituents.\n\nThe incident highlights ongoing concerns over the suppression of political space in Zimbabwe, where critics argue that the government is using the police to stifle dissent and limit opposition activities.
