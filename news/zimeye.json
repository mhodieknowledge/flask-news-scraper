            "content": "By Business Reporter  Leading Zimbabwean-owned money transfer agency, Access Forex (Pvt) Ltd, has been fined by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) for failing to comply with the countrys antimoney laundering and counterterrorism financing regulations.\n\nIn a statement on 17 October 2025, the SARB confirmed that it had sanctioned Access Forex, categorised as an Authorised Dealer in Foreign Exchange with Limited Authority (ADLA), for violations of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FIC Act).\n\nThe penalty followed an inspection by the Reserve Bank, which found specific weaknesses in the companys internal controls and compliance measures.\n\nAccording to the SARB, Access Forexs Risk Management and Compliance Programme (RMCP) failed to meet statutory requirements under the FIC Act, particularly regarding customer verification and due diligence.\n\nThe regulator noted that the company also failed to properly train staff on compliance obligations and to document the necessary antimoney laundering procedures.\n\nAs a result, the company was fined a total of R162,500, comprising:\n\n R100,000 for failure to comply with section 42(1) of the FIC Act,\n\n R37,500 for violations of section 20, and\n\n R25,000 for failure to comply with section 43 of the Act.\n\nThe SARB emphasised that while the violations were serious, the penalties were administrative rather than criminal, noting that Access Forex had since taken remedial action to address the compliance gaps identified during inspection.\n\nAccess Forexs sanction forms part of a broader wave of enforcement actions by the SARB and the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) targeting financial institutions that fail to meet FIC Act obligations.\n\nEarlier this year, Sanlam Collective Investments (SCI) was fined R10.6 million for similar compliance failures, while major banks such as Capitec, Standard Bank, and Absa also received penalties ranging from R10 million to R56 million for deficiencies in customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting systems.\n\nThe SARB said these enforcement actions are part of its ongoing efforts to strengthen the integrity of South Africas financial system and prevent the abuse of financial channels for illicit activities.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Zimbabwean banker and entrepreneur Raymond Chigogwana, Access Forex (Pvt) Ltd operates as part of the Access Group of Companies, which includes Access Finance and Access Finance International.\n\nThe group has offices in Harare, Johannesburg, and London, providing remittance, foreign exchange, and money transfer services across the region and diaspora markets.\n\nCorporate filings show that Access Forex is majority-owned by Access Finance Holdings (Pvt) Ltd, a Zimbabwean-registered company in which Chigogwana holds a controlling stake.\n\nOther shareholders include local investment partners and diaspora investors with minority equity interests.\n\nThe companys business model focuses on facilitating remittances between Zimbabwe, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, positioning itself as a formal, regulated alternative to informal money-transfer networks.\n\nIt operates as a licensed Authorised Dealer with Limited Authority (ADLA) under the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) and holds corresponding approvals from the SARB in South Africa and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK.\n\nAccess Forex gained prominence during Zimbabwes 2019 currency reforms, when it became a key remittance channel for diaspora funds and cross-border business payments.\n\nThe firms expansion into South Africa was driven by the large Zimbabwean migrant community seeking formal remittance platforms.\n\nHowever, regulatory scrutiny over its compliance processes has increased in recent years, with financial authorities in both Zimbabwe and South Africa emphasising the need for stronger anti-money laundering frameworks.\n\nIn 2022, the company was along with another money transfer agency, Innbucks, temporarily suspended by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for regulatory infractions.\n\nNormal operations resumed after authorities were satisfied that all regulatory requirements had been met.\n\nThe SARBs inspection concluded that Access Forexs internal systems did not fully reflect the requirements of the FIC Act, particularly in customer verification, monitoring, and record-keeping. The regulator also highlighted insufficient staff training in identifying and reporting suspicious transactions.\n\nIn its statement, the SARB reiterated that it expects all ADLAs to maintain robust compliance and governance systems to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. It said the enforcement action was not indicative of criminal conduct but part of efforts to ensure continuous compliance within the sector.\n\nAccess Forex did not immediately issue a public statement on the SARB sanction. However, sources within the company said remedial steps had already been implemented to address the cited weaknesses, including a review of compliance manuals, staff retraining, and the appointment of a dedicated compliance officer.\n\nThe sanction against Access Forex underscores a regional trend of tightening financial compliance oversight. Over the past year, the SARB and FSCA have sanctioned several major institutions, including HSBC, Citibank, HBZ Bank Limited, and the Bank of Taiwan, for similar breaches.\n\nRegulatory experts note that while penalties against smaller ADLAs like Access Forex are modest compared to those levied on major banks, they serve as an important signal that South Africas monetary authorities are broadening enforcement to include non-bank financial service providers.\n\nAccess Forexs sanction highlights the increasing scrutiny on cross-border financial operators in Southern Africa, particularly those handling remittances and diaspora transfers. The case also underscores the growing importance of robust compliance cultures within regional fintech and money transfer institutions operating across multiple jurisdictions.\n\n",

His comments ignited a storm of backlash, with many accusing him of double standards and openly aligning himself with ZANU PF despite claiming to lead the opposition bench.\n\nDangote, who visited Zimbabwe on Wednesday for high-level engagements with Mnangagwa and government officials, became the centre of heated political debate after Tshabangu enthusiastically endorsed the visit.\n\nPosting on X, Tshabangu wrote:As a Senator and Leader of Opposition in Parly, I want to extend a warm welcome to Mr. Dangote, Africas richest business tycoon, to Zimbabwe. We appreciate our governments open-for-business policy and wish him every success in his endeavors, Mat-North is open for bussiness.\n\nThe statement immediately drew intense backlash from netizens who accused Tshabangu of abandoning opposition principles in favour of praising the ruling party.\n\nOne furious user condemned him for what they described as shameless hypocrisy, while others ridiculed him for parroting ZANU PF slogans instead of challenging government policies. Many argued that his public endorsements consistently expose him as a political actor working against genuine opposition interests.\n\nThe uproar further deepened when Tshabangu reportedly claimed that Dangotes visit demonstrated why President Mnangagwa should remain in office beyond 2028, reinforcing suspicions that he is actively pushing ZANU PFs agenda.\n\nTshabangu doubled down on his stance, adding:As opposition we support 2030 agenda because;\n\nThe governments stability is reassuring.\n\nTheres increased transparency.\n\nThe President has successfully turned the economy around.\n\nThe President has earned recognition, and its clear that his efforts are yielding results.\n\nThese remarks only intensified accusations that Tshabangu is undermining the oppositions mandate while openly campaigning for Mnangagwas prolonged stay in power.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent  Speculation is intensifying within Defence House over who will take command of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) as General Philip Valerio Sibanda retires next week, ending one of the most politically sensitive military tenures in the post-2017 era.\n\nGeneral Sibanda, who turns 71 in December, is expected to step down on 23 November when his contract expires, raising urgent questions about the future of Zimbabwes military leadership and the political balance that has shaped ZANU PF since the coup that toppled Robert Mugabe.\n\nSibanda took over as ZDF Commander in December 2017 after Constantino Chiwenga left the post to become vice president under the military-civilian pact that ushered President Emmerson Mnangagwa into power.\n\nUnlike Chiwenga, whose approach was overtly political and militarised, Sibanda adopted a restrained, professional posture, earning a reputation as a stabilising figure and one of the few senior officers able to remain above the increasingly sharp contest between Mnangagwas civilian loyalists and the military faction aligned to Chiwenga.\n\nAnalysts argue that Mnangagwas controversial decision to extend Sibandas contract by one yeardespite the legal retirement age of 70was meant to keep the military calm while the President reconfigured the security hierarchy.\n\nSpeculation about Sibandas next role has grown as his retirement nears.\n\nRumours of him being elevated to the vice presidency have circulated for months, though such a move would require Mnangagwa to dislodge either Vice President Chiwenga or Kembo Mohadia decision that would carry significant political risk at a time when internal tensions are mounting over the Presidents alleged ambition to extend his rule beyond 2028.\n\nStill, Mnangagwas history of rewarding loyal officers with political appointments keeps the speculation alive.\n\nAttention has now shifted to who will succeed Sibanda as ZDF commander.\n\nBy institutional tradition, Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) commander Lieutenant General Emmanuel Matatu should assume the post. But at 72, he is older than Sibanda and beyond the statutory retirement threshold, making him a highly unlikely long-term choice.\n\nMilitary insiders describe Matatu as respected but transitional, someone who does not serve Mnangagwas strategic effort to cement control of the security establishment ahead of the 2027 ZANU-PF elective congress.\n\nThis is why the rapid rise of Asher Walter Tapfumaneyi has triggered intense debate.\n\nThe former Deputy Director General of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), former Permanent Secretary for War Veterans Affairs, and former FAZ boss has long been a central player in ZANU PFs coercive electoral machinery.\n\nIn June this year, he was quietly reintegrated into the Zimbabwe National Army and later promoted to Major Generalmoves many insiders view as deliberate steps in Mnangagwas plan to place trusted, loyal intelligence operatives into key defence positions to counter what remains of the Chiwenga-aligned command network.\n\nSources at Defence House insist the timing was strategic.\n\nOne insider told ZimEye: The reintegration of Tapfumaneyi into the ZNA mid this year was not a coincidence. It was a calculated move by the President to strategically position him ( Tapfumaneyi) for the takeover.\n\nThe source added that his elevation was also a reward for his electoral operations in 2023: We all know what FAZ did during the last elections, not forgetting his role in 2008 when President Mugabe was defeated by MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai. He initiated a sting that terrorised opposition activists and human rights activists. On the positive side, Tapfumaneyi has two masters degrees, all in strategic planning and administration, on top of his military credentials. This also gives him an edge over even VP Chiwenga in terms of intelligence and intellectual capacity.\n\nTapfumaneyis record is long, controversial, and deeply entwined with Zimbabwes political-security architecture.\n\nBefore his 2020 appointment as deputy director-general in the Presidents Department, he served as Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of War Veterans, Principal Director in the Ministry of Presidential Affairs, and held multiple senior roles in the Zimbabwe National Army.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2009, he served as a CIO director.\n\nHe was identified among those who abducted human rights activist Jestina Mukoko in 2008, a case in which Justice Nyaradzo Priscilla Munangati-Manongwa later ruled that Mukoko could sue the CIO minister then, Didymus Mutasa and Peter Magwenzi (ZRP) in their personal capacities after she was tortured while held incommunicado for three weeks.\n\nHe was also implicated in the British American Tobacco bribery scandal, where investigative reports linked him to a proposed US$300,000500,000 bribe to protect BAT interests in Zimbabwe while serving as a senior government official.\n\nTapfumaneyi re-emerged at the centre of power in 2023 when FAZrun by the CIO under his leadershipoversaw ZANU PFs internal primaries and played a decisive role in the general election.\n\nFAZs involvement in coercion, intimidation and parallel electoral operations was widely reported, marking Tapfumaneyi as one of Mnangagwas most trusted operatives in consolidating political control. One of his wives, Jessica Tapfumaneyi, has also been linked to the aggressive mobilisation efforts in Mashonaland West, deepening concerns about the merging of party structures, intelligence operations and electoral machinery.\n\nMnangagwa, this year, formally reintegrated him in the Army and promoted him to Major General. During the ceremony, General Sibanda said, Congratulations to you, Major General Tapfumaneyi and you are welcome back to the ZDF, and we are looking forward to working with you. Tapfumaneyi responded: I am determined and committed to supporting the Presidents vision and the Commanders plan in defence of this country and making sure the country remains secure. I want to thank His Excellency for promoting me.\n\nAs Sibanda exits the stage, insiders say Mnangagwa is poised to move decisively to secure the military command structure with loyalists.\n\nTapfumaneyi, with his intelligence background, operational ruthlessness, and deep loyalty to Mnangagwa, has emerged as the clearest signal of that strategy.\n\nIf appointed ZDF Commander, it would mark the most significant shift in Zimbabwes military leadership since Chiwengas departure in 2017and could decisively weaken the military faction that once brought Mnangagwa to power but now stands increasingly sidelined.\n\n",

Chiwenga would represent Zimbabwe at this years SADC region World Childrens Day commemorations in Gaborone, Botswana. Critics argue that the assignment is a symbolic demotion, raising questions about internal power dynamics within ZANU PF.\n\nIn a statement, Mangwana said: Vice President General (Rtd) Dr. C.G.D.N Chiwenga has arrived in Gaborone, Botswana, to attend this years SADC region World Childrens Day commemorations to be held this Saturday.\n\nHowever, social media erupted with criticism. Trevor Mzingaye wrote on X: Generari degraded to creche work  Minnie must refuse these embarrassing kindergarten duties on her husband. The post reflects a growing perception that Chiwenga, once a central figure in Zimbabwean politics and military affairs, is being sidelined.\n\nPolitical analysts suggest that the assignment may signal Mnangagwas attempt to marginalise Chiwenga amid ongoing ZANU PF infighting. One observer commented: Sending a former vice president to oversee a childrens day event may appear benign, but in the context of ZANU PF factionalism, it is a clear message. Chiwenga is being moved to peripheral roles while the President consolidates power.\n\nOthers note that the incident highlights the broader challenges of loyalty and status within the ruling party. ZANU PF has a history of managing potential rivals through symbolic assignments, said another analyst. This is not just about protocolit is about power and perception.\n\nThe controversy raises questions about the role of senior military figures in political life and the extent to which ceremonial duties are being used as tools of internal political signalling. As one commentator noted, What looks like an innocuous diplomatic or ceremonial task may carry deep political implications within the party hierarchy.\n\nObservers say the assignment could further strain Chiwengas political influence, even as he maintains a presence in national affairs, suggesting that Mnangagwa is systematically reshaping the balance of power among his top deputies.\n\n",

            "content": "Harare  A heavy deployment of anti-riot police has cordoned off the office of former Finance Minister and opposition leader Tendai Biti in Milton Park, Harare this morning, in what legal observers and human-rights advocates are calling one of the clearest signs yet of Zimbabwes accelerating crackdown on dissent.\n\nImages obtained by ZimEye show armed police officers stationed around the property, with some taking concealed positions behind trees and vehicles. A lorry and multiple police teams are visible, forming what appears to be a ring-fence around the premises. Officers can be seen standing guard across the field adjacent to the office grounds, restricting movement and blocking access.\n\nWitnesses report that no explanation has been given for the barricade, and staff attempting to enter the premises were prevented from doing so.\n\nTatenda Hungwe: This is not policing  this is intimidation, plain and simple.\n\nResponding to the unfolding situation, prominent UK-based Zimbabwean lawyer and democracy advocate Tatenda C.K. Hungwe issued a blistering statement condemning the Mnangagwa administration for weaponising the police to strangle political competition.\n\nWhy is the ZRP barricading the office of Honourable Tendai Biti?\n\nWhat kind of country are we becoming when private citizens can no longer freely access their own properties? This is not policing  this is intimidation, plain and simple.\n\nHungwe accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa and ZANU-PF of using state machinery to suffocate dissent instead of engaging citizens:\n\nInstead of dialogue, you choose force.\n\nInstead of constitutionalism, you choose coercion.\n\nYou call yourself a Constitutionalist yet create the exact opposite  a hostile, violent, repressive environment.\n\nHe added that no leader in SADC has damaged democratic norms more aggressively in recent years than Mnangagwa.\n\nPolice Focus on Politics, Not Crime  Critics Say\n\nFootage from the scene shows the deployment is not geared toward crime prevention but political suppression. Officers are positioned deep within the grounds and along the road leading to the office, suggesting an operation aimed at controlling access rather than responding to a security threat.\n\nHungwe warned that the pattern is becoming familiar:\n\nZimbabwe is watching a government that behaves like a frightened regime, not a confident leadership.\n\nA government that relies on the police to police politics instead of crime.\n\nWhat Triggered the Barricade?\n\nSources inside Harare say the state was attempting to block or monitor a private meeting expected to take place at Bitis office. However, there has been no official statement from the Zimbabwe Republic Police.\n\nObservers say the intensity of todays deployment reflects the Mnangagwa administrations new posture following internal ZANU-PF succession anxieties, unresolved legitimacy debates, and growing public disenchantment.\n\nA New Low in Democratic Decline\n\nThe clampdown comes amid heightened political tension across Zimbabwe, with civil society figures warning of a fast-closing civic space ahead of anticipated political transitions.\n\nHungwes closing remarks were stark:\n\nZimbabwe deserves better than a government that fears its own citizens.\n\nZimbabwe deserves politics without barricades, intimidation, or state-sponsored pressure.\n\nPower must be earned  not enforced through fear.\n\nDeveloping Story\n\nZimEye is tracking this situation closely. More updates to follow as the story develops and as the police stance becomes clearer.\n\n",
