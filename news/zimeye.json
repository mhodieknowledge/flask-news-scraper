            "content": "South Africa  Outspoken KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi has rocked regional politics by directly implicating Zimbabwes ruling party, Zanu PF, and the office of President Emmerson Mnangagwa in a high-level criminal syndicate operating in South Africa.\n\nIn a detailed provincial report submitted to South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Mkhwanazi alleged that crime networks in the country increasingly involve international actors, specifically naming Zanu PF officials and individuals linked to the Zimbabwean presidency. According to the report, these networks collaborate with ANC insiders to illegally move cash, minerals, and goods across borderscircumventing international sanctions placed on Zimbabwean elites.\n\nMkhwanazis explosive report claims Zanu PF figures and allies of Mnangagwa, including controversial businessmen Wicknell Chivayo and Kudakwashe Tagwirei, help launder illicit funds from South Africa. The report further alleges that, in exchange for facilitating illegal trade, Zanu PF supplies untraceable, military-trained gunmen who have been implicated in political killings in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nChallenging the widely held belief that cash-in-transit heists and similar crimes are solely the work of local criminal syndicates, Mkhwanazi asserts he has evidence showing active participation by serving members of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA).\n\nThe commissioner also warns that Zimbabwe has effectively become a hub for laundering dirty money from South Africa, with direct involvement from people close to Mnangagwa.\n\nIn a particularly pointed recommendation, Mkhwanazi urges President Ramaphosa to confront Mnangagwa at the meeting of former liberation movements held over the weekend. He argues that the Zimbabwean leadership is worsening South Africas crime crisis by backing and sheltering professional criminals, thus making law enforcement efforts far more difficult.\n\nMkhwanazi, who has gained a reputation for his frank criticism of both political interference and rising violent crime in South Africa, did not mince words. He described Zanu PF as no longer functioning as a genuine liberation movement but as a criminal organization enriching ANC and Zanu PF elites at the expense of ordinary citizens.\n\nThis latest development comes amid heightened regional concerns over cross-border crime, political violence, and entrenched corruption networks linking powerful business and political figures across southern Africa.\n\n",

            "content": "By ZimEye Investigations Desk | MASVINGO  A shocking murder has rocked the Dinson Iron and Steel Company community after three men working as caterers under First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwas Hot Plate food scheme allegedly murdered a Manhize-based miner linked to Presidential Advisor Chris Mutsvangwa.\n\nAccording to a police Request for Remand Form (CR 551/7/25) seen by ZimEye, the accused  Simbarashe Muneri (39), Munyaradzi Muneri (32), and Junior Thando Nkomo (34)  are alleged to have fatally assaulted the now deceased, Simbarashe Chingururuve, on the night of 28 June 2025.\n\nThe fatal incident unfolded at the Dinson Iron and Steel Companys Hot Plate Bar, a site widely known for serving thousands of workers under a feeding program launched by Auxillia Mnangagwa in 2023. Witnesses say a confrontation erupted between the three men and Chingururuve, a miner reportedly seconded to Manhize by high-level political allies within ZANU PF.\n\nCCTV Footage, Confessions, and a Sewer Dump.\n\nPolice investigations revealed that the three accused chased the victim for over 200 meters from the Hot Plate Bar before assaulting him with an unknown object. He succumbed to the injuries on the spot.\n\nThe accused then dragged his body to a nearby sewage pond, where they dumped it, hoping it would wash away undetected.\n\nThe body was discovered 18 days later, floating in a flowing sewer channel.\n\nEvidence obtained includes CCTV footage of the accused pursuing the victim and recorded confessions, with one of the suspects allegedly admitting to throwing a half-brick at the deceased during the attack.\n\nBail Opposed as Accused Face Harsh Charges\n\nThe three men were arrested on 15 July 2025 and appeared in the Masvingo Magistrates Court where police opposed bail. Authorities say the accused, all originally from Bulawayo, are flight risks, and may intimidate key witnesses.\n\nTheir employers, Dinson Iron and Steel Company, have distanced themselves from the trio, stating they were not directly employed but operated independently through the Hot Plate scheme.\n\nA High Court bail application (Case No. HCMSCR960/25) by Mutendi, Mudisi and Shumba Legal Practitioners was filed on behalf of Munyaradzi Muneri and Junior Thando Nkomo, with Simbarashe Muneri named in separate proceedings.\n\nPolitical Ramifications?\n\nThe case raises serious questions about the governance and supervision of Auxillia Mnangagwas flagship feeding program. Critics argue that the programs lack of regulation and transparency may have enabled rogue elements to infiltrate critical national infrastructure sites.\n\nEqually concerning is the political dimension: sources confirm that the deceased, Simbarashe Chingururuve, was a contracted technician at Manhize, seconded via networks tied to Chris Mutsvangwa, the ZANU PF Spokesman.\n\nZimEye will continue tracking this developing story.\n\nIf you have additional information or were present at the Hot Plate Bar on 28 June, contact our investigations desk anonymously at:[emailprotected].\n\nMore to follow.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent-Controversial Australia-based philanthropist Susan Mutami has reignited political tensions with a series of explosive claims involving President Emmerson Mnangagwa, former Tourism Minister Walter Mzembi, and other high-profile figures in Zimbabwes ruling elite.\n\nIn a lengthy social media rant, Mutami questioned the wisdom behind Mzembis return to Zimbabwe, warning that Mnangagwa, whom she described as vindictive and unforgiving, could pose a serious threat to the former ministers life.\n\nCan yall please explain to me why you dont listen when I give warnings? No one knows Mnangagwa and his crew the way I do, Mutami posted. Who advised Walter Mzembi to return to Harare without a proper change of guard?\n\nShe alleged that Mnangagwa and Mzembi have long been at odds, tracing their fallout to an incident in London during Mzembis tenure as Tourism Minister. According to Mutami, Mzembi witnessed something he wasnt supposed to see, leading to lasting animosity between the two.\n\nMnangagwa doesnt forgive and he doesnt forget. He will lure you in and crush you like a fly, she warned.\n\nMutami further claimed that Mzembi had tried to prevent the alleged assassination of the late Foreign Affairs Minister Sibusiso Moyo, but his warning went unheeded.\n\nThe day SB Moyo was assassinated, Walter called Loice Matanda-Moyo to warn her, but she dismissed him. He tried to save SB Moyo, Mutami wrote.\n\nShe also dragged in other political figures, including businessman Kuda Tagwirei and exiled former minister Saviour Kasukuwere, saying theres no honour among thieves. Mutami alleged that Vice President Constantino Chiwenga survived an assassination attempt by Mnangagwa only because of Chinese intervention.\n\nIf it wasnt for Xi Jinping and his trusted professionals, Chiwenga would be dead, she said.\n\nMutami ended her rant with a cryptic message suggesting she holds more damaging secrets:Musoro wangu wakatakura ma secrets kufa kwako kucharwadza vakawanda my baby daddy, she said, in what appeared to be a dig at former Norton MP Temba Mliswa.\n\nHer claims, though unverified, have sparked heated debate on social media and further fuelled intrigue around internal Zanu PF rivalries.\n\n",

Mliswa replaces Hon. Edouardo Namburete of Mozambique, who has recently been appointed as ambassador.\n\nZimEye first revealed on Saturday that members gathered in Benin had resolved to vote for the outspoken former legislator, with formal confirmation coming in the networks final communique issued Sunday night.\n\nAPNACs Statement\n\nIn the communique, APNAC declared:\n\nHonourable Peter Mliswa Temba (Zimbabwe) is elected as the Vice-president of the Board to replace the Honourable Edouardo Namburete (Mozambique), who has been appointed as an ambassador.\n\nThe board, comprised of delegates from Benin, Cameroon, Cte dIvoire, Ghana, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe, deliberated on a number of institutional reforms and new anti-corruption strategies, including:\n\nSymbolic Victory for Zimbabwe\n\nMliswas appointment marks a rare international endorsement of a Zimbabwean parliamentarian, elevating the countrys role in continental anti-corruption efforts.

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nProminent Zimbabwean businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei has once again found himself at the centre of political debate following a public show of camaraderie with President Emmerson Mnangagwa on the golf course  a moment political analyst Brighton Mutebuka says was no accident, but a calculated signal that Tagwirei remains a key player in the ZANU PF power matrix.\n\nThe footage, which shows Tagwirei sharing a light-hearted side embrace with President Mnangagwa while the two laugh together, has reignited speculation about the internal dynamics within the ruling party  particularly after Tagwireis recent failed bid to join ZANU PFs Central Committee.\n\nUK-based legal expert and political commentator Brighton Mutebuka believes the embrace was more than a casual moment.\n\nThrough that public side embrace of ED, nonchalantly gliding into his personal space  with both giggling  the signal was clear, said Mutebuka. The two are somewhat joined at the hip and enjoy intimate and cordial relations away from the prying eyes.\n\nJust days earlier, Tagwirei had been dealt what appeared to be a political blow when his bid for a seat in the powerful Central Committee was blocked  a move interpreted as a victory for his rivals in the party, including spokesperson Chris Mutsvangwa and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nAccording to Mutebuka, Tagwireis body language on the golf course was no accident.\n\nIt seemed like it was an assignment borne out of the collision of desperation and cunning, he said, so that Tagwirei could showcase his defiance, resilience and closeness to ED to his political enemies and the rest of the country  and reinforce the message that he retains EDs confidence, is not isolated, teetering or going anywhere.\n\nMutebuka also noted that President Mnangagwas body language appeared slightly restrained, possibly due to the political sensitivities surrounding the moment.\n\nEDs fairly guarded manner could be down to his subconscious ode to protocol  or his awareness of the political difficulties that could arise from projecting public over-cosiness to a man who has gained notoriety as the Alpha Chigananda nationally  particularly so soon after the Central Committee debacle, Mutebuka explained.\n\nLooking ahead, Mutebuka believes the incident signals more political manoeuvring to come.\n\nWe have likely not heard the last of the attempt to catapult Tagwirei into the Central Committee, he said. Based on what I have seen there, which is just a microcosm of the strength of ties between the two  we should expect a more full-blooded tilt at it, with ED giving it all his might and mobilising all his assets and the power of incumbency to help overcome Chiwenga, Mutsvangwa et als spirited resistance.\n\nMutebuka added that the golf embrace was designed to send a message to all power players within ZANU PF and beyond.\n\nMake no mistake about it  egos were mightily bruised, and this is what has been cobbled up as the perfect response, he said. Through this footage, ZANU PFs structures, state institutions, EDs allies and enemies alike have all been put on notice that Tagwirei is still very much part of the fabric regardless of whether or not he is a Chigananda.\n\nThe incident marks yet another chapter in the ongoing saga of ZANU PF succession politics  one where symbolism, appearances, and carefully staged moments carry enormous weight in determining who remains in the game.\n\n",
