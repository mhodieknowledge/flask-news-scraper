            "content": "By James Gwati- The Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service (ZPCS) has repurposed the infamous hanging gallows at Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison into a museum and radio broadcasting studios.This transformation marks a significant step following Zimbabwes recent abolition of the death penalty.\n\nThe gallows at Chikurubi were originally used in the 1970s to execute offenders.\n\nThe last execution at the facility took place in 1979 before the execution chamber was relocated to Harare Central Prison, where the death penalty was last carried out in 2005.\n\nSince then, Zimbabwe had maintained an unofficial moratorium on executions, culminating in the formal abolition of capital punishment under President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration.\n\nBrian Moyo, Director of Corporate Chaplaincy Services for Bridging the Gap Foundation, hailed the initiative, saying, This transformation signifies a genuine commitment to respecting United Nations human rights practices. We applaud the government and ZPCS for leading this reform, and we thank President Mnangagwa for championing the abolition of the death penalty.\n\nThe project has drawn technical support from the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ).\n\nMatthias Chakanyuka, BAZs technical director, noted the sites suitability for broadcasting purposes: After our assessment, we determined that this place is ideal for a radio station, with all necessary facilities in place.\n\nChikurubis Officer in Charge, Chief Superintendent Alfred Machingauta, described the psychological toll of the death penalty, saying, I have interacted with individuals who were on death row, and their experiences were profoundly traumatic. Transforming these facilities gives new meaning to a place once associated with despair.\n\nZPCS Commissioner General Moses Chihobvu highlighted the practical benefits of the conversion: This initiative allows us to generate revenue through museum visits while also symbolizing our alignment with modern penal reforms and the abolition of the death penalty.\n\nZimbabwes death penalty history is intertwined with its colonial and post-independence legal systems.\n\nExecutions were a common feature during the 1970s and early 1980s, primarily targeting political dissidents and convicted criminals.\n\nHowever, no executions have been carried out since 2005, owing to growing advocacy against the practice and a lack of a hangman willing to perform the grim task.\n\nThe abolition of the death penalty is a milestone in Zimbabwes justice system.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa, himself a former death row inmate during the liberation struggle, has been a vocal advocate against capital punishment.\n\nHis governments approval of the bill to abolish the death penalty demonstrates Zimbabwes commitment to aligning with global human rights standards.\n\nLocated on the outskirts of Harare, Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison houses over 2,000 inmates, with the majority serving long sentences.\n\nKnown for its harsh conditions, the prison has been at the center of various reform initiatives aimed at improving the rehabilitation of inmates.\n\nThe conversion of the gallows into a museum and radio studios is expected to contribute to educational and awareness efforts while generating revenue for the ZPCS.\n\nIt also provides an opportunity for the public to engage with the history of Zimbabwes justice system, learn about the abolition of the death penalty, and explore avenues for promoting restorative justice.\n\nThis transformation represents a symbolic closure of a dark chapter in Zimbabwes penal history, paving the way for a new era centered on rehabilitation and human rights.\n\n",

The victims, including Mr. Dziruni (72), Ms. Maria Nyamusamba (70), Mr. Keith Dziruni (32), and Mr. Blessed Mafuta (43), were assaulted, bound, and robbed of valuables amounting to US$25,348.\n\nThe assailants, identified as Godfrey Mulizwe (20) and Herbert Ngwenya (46), were captured on December 3, 2024, following a police manhunt that led to Murambinda. The duo was found with some of the stolen items, including Mr. Dzirunis Toyota Hilux, four guns, and various personal belongings.\n\nDuring their court appearance before Rusape regional magistrate Mr. Francis Mapfumo, Mulizwe and Ngwenya were charged with four counts of armed robbery and remanded in custody until February 27, 2025, for routine remand. Prosecutor Mr. Tawanda Munjanja detailed the violent nature of the robbery, highlighting how the suspects assaulted the victims with the butts of their firearms, demanding cash and stealing items ranging from cash and cellphones to clothing and even biscuits.\n\nThe police operation not only led to the arrest of these two individuals but also the recovery of property valued at US$24,139. Despite these arrests, the search continues for the other accomplices involved in the crime.\n\nThis incident has shaken the local community, bringing to light the bravery and efficiency of the Nyazura police force in tackling crime with vigor and determination. The community and victims are relieved by the quick action but remain vigilant as the hunt for the remaining culprits continues.- Manica Post\n\n",

However, the 24-year-old has struggled in this unfamiliar position, which he has openly admitted to feeling uncomfortable in.\n\nAccording to Relevo, Real Madrids hierarchy has expressed disappointment in Tchouamenis performances. The prevailing sentiment within the club is that the Frenchman has not lived up to the high expectations placed upon him following his 80 million transfer from AS Monaco in 2022. Despite these concerns, Ancelotti remains supportive, continuing to field the player in various defensive roles.\n\n",

Kandishaya continued to outline Mnangagwas immense contribution to both the party and the nation, positioning him as the central figure in Zimbabwes political history.\n\nThis man is not just a member of ZANU PF, but its architect, having laid the foundation and cast the pillars, he said. He established the National Security System of our beloved Zimbabwe. Kandishaya went on to describe Mnangagwa as a leader who bridges the past, present, and future of Zimbabwes political landscape.\n\nThe youth leader emphasized Mnangagwas unique place in Southern Africas political history, noting, As the only President in SADC who worked alongside the founding fathers of African solidarity, he embodies a perfect blend of past, present, and future.\n\nKandishaya also underscored the challenges Mnangagwa has overcome throughout his political career.\n\nHis entire political life has been marked by naysayers who claim he will not get, he will fail, he cannot, but he continues to triumph, he stated, commending the Presidents resilience and ability to outmaneuver his detractors.\n\nThe remarks come as Mnangagwa continues to consolidate power within the party, with some party officials and analysts debating the long-term future of Zanu PF leadership.\n\nKandishayas strong endorsement positions the President as not just a leader, but as the enduring foundation of the party itself, effectively claiming ownership over its direction and legacy.\n\n",
