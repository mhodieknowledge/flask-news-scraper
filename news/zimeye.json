            "content": "By Sports Correspondent\n\nControversial tenderpreneur and Zanu PF-linked businessman Wicknell Chivayo has once again sparked public debate after doling out a staggering US$110,000 to Scottland FC following their shock 52 demolition of FC Platinum in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League clash at Mandava Stadium on Saturday.\n\nIn a characteristically flashy post on Facebook, Chivayo showered praise on the underdog team and confirmed the cash reward:\n\nWELL DONE SCOTTLAND FC Im so proud of you  100 thousand USD for the players and 10 thousand USD for coach NDIRAYA Marova team ya NORMAN , Im still in SHOCKWELL DONE  MABVIRAVIRA @ScottlandFC\n\nThe post, dripping with emojis and braggadocio, has drawn mixed reactions from the public, with some hailing the gesture as generous, while others view it as yet another display of opulence funded by opaque business dealings and state contracts.\n\nChivayo, who has long been associated with controversial government tenders and unexplained wealth, has built a reputation for showering luxury gifts on celebrities, public figures, and now, apparently, sports teams that exceed expectations.\n\nThe reward followed Scottland FCs unexpected thrashing of FC Platinum, a top-tier team often regarded as one of Zimbabwes most consistent football giants. The result sent shockwaves across the local football fraternity, and Chivayo seized the moment to grab headlines.\n\nMarova team ya Norman, Im still in shock he wrote, taking a dig at FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza, as he celebrated the rise of his apparent new favorite, Coach Tonderai Ndiraya, who walked away with US$10,000 for masterminding the victory.\n\nWhile fans of Scottland FC celebrated the win and the windfall, critics pointed to the deeper problem of political patronage in sport, where loyalty or headlines often matter more than merit or sustainability.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe ruling Zanu PF party has emerged victorious in the recently held local authority by-elections in Epworth Ward 6 and Chinhoyi Ward 14, amid widespread voter apathy and concerns over the fairness of the electoral process.\n\nIn Epworth Ward 6, Zanu PF candidate Bushe Civilised won with a landslide, garnering 3,022 votes, according to Chirere Ocean Chenjerai, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) elections officer for the area. Civilised was followed distantly by MDC-Ts Alice Nyahunzvi who managed a paltry 120 votes, while independent candidate Peter Nyapetwa secured only 23 votes.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ward 14 Chinhoyi, Zanu PFs Solomon Bizwork was declared the winner with 599 votes, according to Taona Pfunye, the ZEC elections officer. Independent candidate Hope Zimbiri came second with 194 votes.\n\nWhile Zanu PF celebrated the wins as a show of continued support, critics have raised questions about the level of public engagement and the credibility of the process. The alarmingly low voter turnout in both areasespecially in Chinhoyi, where fewer than 800 votes were casthas intensified claims that Zimbabwes elections are failing to energize or inspire voters.\n\nWhat were seeing here is not a democracy at work, but a democracy in retreat, commented a political analyst based in Harare who chose to remain anonymous. When the ruling party sweeps with over 90% of the vote in a by-election, and the total voter turnout barely scratches the surface of the eligible voting population, it raises serious concerns about intimidation, disillusionment, and manipulation.\n\nOpposition parties have remained largely silent on the outcomes, likely reflecting both their waning influence and public frustration with the fractured state of the opposition itself.\n\nObservers also noted the absence of any significant civic engagement or voter education in the lead-up to the polls, further reinforcing the perception that these elections were little more than formalities rubber-stamping Zanu PFs grip on power.\n\nDespite the official announcements, the silence from the streets of Epworth and Chinhoyi suggests that citizens remain unconvinced and disengaged. In a country where elections have long been marred by accusations of rigging, coercion, and uneven playing fields, these results are unlikely to change public perceptionor the political status quo.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nMichael Makaza, the President of the opposition movement Freedom Fighters for Change, has issued a passionate and defiant statement reaffirming his commitment to transforming Zimbabwe, despite what he described as threats from the ruling Zanu PF regime.\n\nAddressing his supporters last week, Makaza drew inspiration from scripture, citing Isaiah 43:19  Behold, I am doing a new thing  and Jeremiah 29:11  For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you. He used the verses to offer both encouragement and reassurance to his followers as he pledged to press forward with a new vision for the country.\n\nDear followers, Makaza wrote, I want to thank each and every one of you for standing with me. Your support means the world to me. As we journey towards change I assure you that change is possible and its coming. Together, we will bring about a new Zimbabwe. A Zimbabwe where everyone thrives.\n\nMakaza acknowledged the challenges ahead, including threats allegedly coming from the ruling party, but made it clear that such intimidation would not derail his efforts.\n\nDespite threats from the ZANU PF regime, I assure you that change is possible and its coming, he declared. Lets stand firm and keep moving forward. As a team, we will overcome.\n\nThe message, accompanied by the hashtag #WeMove, has been interpreted as both a rallying cry and a declaration of intent from a political figure positioning himself as a moral and transformative alternative to the current leadership.\n\nMakazas tone was one of resilience and unity, emphasizing selfless leadership and a future where Zimbabweans are no longer victims of economic collapse, political repression, and widespread inequality.\n\nHis statement comes at a time when opposition voices are increasingly under pressure, with allegations of state-sponsored intimidation, shrinking democratic space, and growing disillusionment among the electorate.\n\nWhether Makazas hopeful rhetoric can be translated into political traction remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the call for a new Zimbabwe continues to resonate with many citizens desperate for real change.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZanu PF supporter and vocal Murakashi, Tanaka Gumbo, has sparked a wave of criticism online after posting a bold and highly exaggerated praise of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, claiming he is the only leader in the world developing a country without external assistance.\n\nTaking to his official Facebook page on Friday, Gumbo wrote:\n\nPresident Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa: The Only Leader in the World to Develop a Nation Using Its Own Resources. Since 2018, the Second Republic has successfully implemented 9,706 projects across Zimbabwemaking President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa the only President globally to achieve such extensive national development without relying on external aid. His remarkable leadership has led many to rally for his tenure to be extended until 2030.\n\nThe post, widely circulated across social media platforms, has been met with ridicule by critics who say it reflects the dangerous levels of sycophancy within Zanu PFs support base.\n\nGumbos claims come at a time when Zimbabwe continues to face deep economic challenges, including a weakening local currency, high unemployment, and a reliance on donor support in key sectors such as health and food security.\n\nPolitical analysts say such statements are part of a broader strategy within Zanu PF to portray President Mnangagwa as a visionary leader ahead of potential 2028 or extended 2030 leadership ambitions.\n\nHowever, critics argue that far from being self-sufficient, Zimbabwe has continued to depend on international partners, including the World Bank, African Development Bank, the EU, and NGOs, for various development programmes.\n\nThis type of bootlicking insults the intelligence of Zimbabweans who live with daily power cuts, rising prices, and poor public services, said a Harare-based political commentator. Claiming that Zimbabwe has developed without aid is a distortion of facts and a misrepresentation of reality.\n\nOnline, the backlash was swift. Some users mocked the 9,706 projects figure, demanding specifics. One post read: Name one. Just one. Not roads patched or boreholes  a real project with measurable impact.\n\nDespite the criticism, Gumbos post remains online, reflecting what many see as the growing cult-like glorification of the presidency within ruling party circles.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tinashe Sambiri\n\nOpposition leader and president of the Citizens Movement, Advocate Nelson Chamisa, has issued a stern rebuke to President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration over what he describes as the manipulation and abuse of church leaders for political ends.\n\nIn a strongly worded statement posted on Saturday, Chamisa warned against turning the church into a political playground and urged religious leaders to remain loyal only to the Gospel, not to politicians.\n\nSpeak truth to power, Chamisa said. Stop this pastors for this or that politician business. Dont defile the pulpit. Let there be pastors for Jesus Christ only preaching truth, peace, love and life. Preach the true gospel.\n\nThe statement comes amid growing criticism of the increasingly close ties between certain church figures and the ruling Zanu PF party. Some pastors have publicly endorsed Mnangagwas leadership, even going as far as declaring him God-ordained  a move that many see as blasphemous and politically motivated.\n\nChamisa, who is himself known for frequently referencing his Christian faith, accused the ruling elite of corrupting religious institutions with material rewards in exchange for loyalty.\n\nThe church must never be in the pockets of politicians, he declared. The church must be a prophetic voice and watchtower, being incorruptible, not bribable.\n\nHe added that the body of Christ should be rooted in principle, not opportunism. The body of Christ must not pivot on contaminated personal gain or corrupted prosperity. Let the church speak truth to power!!\n\nQuoting from the book of Isaiah 56:9-12, Chamisa closed his message with a spiritual tone, signing off, Blessed Sabbath ~ nc #Godisinit.\n\nChamisas comments reflect a broader concern among opposition figures and civil society that Zanu PF is co-opting churches to silence dissent and legitimise authoritarian rule under the guise of divine support.\n\nCritics say the government often uses donations, political favors, and access to resources to manipulate church leaders  a tactic that weakens the churchs prophetic role in society.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues to grapple with deepening socio-economic and political crises, Chamisas call for the church to reclaim its independent voice resonates with many who believe religious institutions should challenge, not cheerlead, political power.\n\n",

In stark contrast, MDC-Ts Alice Nyahunzvi received just 120 votes, while independent candidate Peter Nyapetwa came in with a mere 23.\n\nIn Chinhoyi Ward 14, Zanu PFs Solomon Bizwork won with 599 votes, beating independent Hope Zimbiri, who trailed with 194 votes, as announced by elections officer Taona Pfunye.\n\nWhile Zanu PF presented these results as evidence of unwavering national support, analysts and observers have flagged major concerns over the alarmingly low voter participation. In both wards, turnout was dismally low, with fewer than 800 ballots cast in Chinhoyicasting doubt on the legitimacy and competitiveness of the so-called victory.\n\nThis is not democracy. This is dominance without consent, said a political analyst in Harare who requested anonymity. When the ruling party is essentially running unopposed and people are not even bothering to vote, thats not a strongholdits a hollow one.\n\nCritics argue that the by-elections reflect Zanu PFs continued use of electoral processes as symbolic displays of power, rather than genuine expressions of the peoples will. Opposition parties, weakened by internal divisions and state pressure, were virtually absent from the campaign trail, while independent candidates failed to present a credible challenge.\n\nCivic groups also pointed to the lack of voter education and meaningful political debate leading up to the elections, reinforcing the view that these by-elections were mere formalities in a system designed to sustain the ruling elite.\n\nDespite Zanu PFs confident rhetoric, the reaction from the communities of Epworth and Chinhoyi has been largely muted. Residents appear indifferent, if not cynical, about the political processunderscoring a deepening crisis of legitimacy in Zimbabwean politics.\n\nAs the ruling party continues to consolidate its hold, the question remains: is Zimbabwe moving forward as a democracy, or sliding into an era of unchallenged political hegemony disguised as electoral success?\n\n",

            "content": "By A correspondent-Zanu PF spokesperson Chris Mutsvangwa and his wife,  Monica , made a surprise appearance at former First Lady Grace Mugabes 60th birthday party held privately in Harare on Saturday, raising eyebrows given the pairs acrimonious political history.\n\nThe intimate but high-profile gathering was attended by an eclectic mix of elites, including Second Lady Miniyothabo Minnie Baloyi, wife of Vice President Constantino Chiwenga; Elizabeth Macheka, widow of the late opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai; and Graces brother, former Zanu PF Political Commissar Mike Bimha and his wife, Tsitsi.\n\nBut it was the presence of Chris Mutsvangwa  a man who played a central role in the political downfall of Grace and her G40 faction  that stirred the most interest.\n\nIn the tense years leading up to the November 2017 military coup that ousted Robert Mugabe, Mutsvangwa became one of the most vocal and aggressive public critics of Grace Mugabe. Then serving as war veterans leader and a senior Zanu PF figure, he accused her of overreaching, destabilizing the party, and seeking dynastic power. His rhetoric was often inflammatory, branding Grace and her allies as a cabal of usurpers attempting to hijack the liberation legacy for personal gain.\n\nGrace, then at the height of her political influence, had increasingly positioned herself as a potential successor to her aging husband, sidelining and publicly ridiculing then-Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa. The bitter power struggle between her G40 faction and the military-aligned Lacoste faction  backed by Mutsvangwa  ultimately culminated in the military intervention that ended Mugabes 37-year rule.\n\nIn the post-coup era, Mutsvangwa continued to disparage Grace, dismissing her as a symbol of the excess and impunity that had tarnished Zanu PFs image.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, his attendance at her birthday celebration has been widely interpreted as either a symbolic gesture of political reconciliation or, at the very least, a sign of shifting dynamics within the elite power networks.\n\nGrace Mugabe  famously dubbed Gucci Grace for her extravagant lifestyle  has kept a low profile since the coup, retreating to her familys rural stronghold and avoiding the limelight. Her fall from grace included legal wrangles over property, international criticism for alleged abuses, and a sharp public backlash at home.\n\nSaturdays gathering, however, marks her most significant public reappearance in recent years. That it included both longtime allies and former adversaries suggests that Zimbabwes post-Mugabe elite are beginning to close ranks  or at least blur past lines of enmity  as new political realities emerge.\n\nWhile Grace Mugabe has made no public political statements since the event, her re-engagement with figures from across the political divide hints at unfinished ambitions  or a strategic return to visibility.\n\n",
