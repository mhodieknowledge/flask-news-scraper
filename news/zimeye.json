            "content": "By A Correspondent In a rare act of defiance, a former Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) officer,Togara Fambi, has broken ranks with the establishment to form a new political party, theNational Progressive Democrats (NPD) declaring open resistance to PresidentEmmerson Mnangagwasrule andZANU PFs decades-long politicisation of the security sector.\n\nThe NPD was launched on Wednesday in Harare under the theme,Building a Capable Democratic Developmental State to Empower Citizens and Improve Living Standards.\n\nFambi, who retired from the police force inJuly 2025, said his decision to step into politics came after his dismissal for criticizing the governments priorities. He had condemned the state forsending humanitarian aid to Mozambiquewhile millions of Zimbabweans continued to suffer from poverty, hunger, and joblessness. Shortly after making the remarks, Fambi was expelled fromChikato Police Campin Masvingo.\n\nThe NPD is not an offshoot or continuation of any existing political party, Fambi said at the launch. It is born from the peoples consensus that the current ZANU PF system is corrupt, corrosive, and oppressive. We have lived for too long under a regime that mistakes fear for loyalty.\n\nHe also slammed Zimbabwes partnerships withChinese mining companies, accusing them of plundering the nations mineral wealth and destroying communities. If we do not act wisely at the ballot, the Sino-Zim relations will continue to erode our minerals and devastate our environment. Unsustainable mineral extraction and exploitation of our people by Chinese firms continues unchecked. The effects will be felt for generations unless we stand up now and end this madness, he said.\n\nFambi said his new party envisions aZimbabwe free from the grip of a militarised elite, built instead on transparency, fairness, and people-centred governance.\n\nFambis political rebellion comes against the backdrop ofZANU PFs entrenched control over Zimbabwes security establishment, a relationship that has shaped the countrys political landscape since independence in 1980.\n\nUnderRobert Mugabe, the ruling party systematicallyblurred the line between state security and party politics, with the police, army, and intelligence services openly participating in political campaigns, intimidation, and election manipulation. TheJoint Operations Command (JOC) a security coordination body bringing together the heads of the army, police, and intelligence  became thede facto political enginethat safeguarded ZANU PFs rule.\n\nDuring the2000s, especially after the formation of theMovement for Democratic Change (MDC), the security sector played a direct role insuppressing dissent, using violence, arbitrary arrests, and propaganda to weaken opposition movements. Senior officers, including police commanders and army generals, publicly declared that they wouldnever salute anyone without liberation war credentials,effectively disqualifying opposition leaders from ever gaining legitimate power.\n\nWhen Mnangagwa took power in2017through amilitary-assisted transition, the security forces once again played kingmaker  this time turning their guns on Mugabe to install one of their own. Since then, Mnangagwas government hasrewarded military and police elites with top government and diplomatic positions, deepening their political entanglement with ZANU PF.\n\nAnalysts argue that this militarisation of governance hasundermined professionalism within the security servicesand left officers like Fambi disillusioned. His public defiance therefore signals growing internal frustration among rank-and-file members who feel used as instruments of political repression rather than protectors of national integrity.\n\nThe formation of theNational Progressive Democratsthus represents more than just another political party  it symbolizes arare rupture within Zimbabwes security establishmentand could test ZANU PFs ability to maintain loyalty among forces long treated as its political insurance.\n\nAs Fambi put it: We served our country with loyalty, but loyalty should never mean silence in the face of injustice. It is time to reclaim our nation from fear.\n\n",

However, he reportedly defaulted between March and July, accumulating arrears of US$2,500. The amount has since risen to US$3,500 after he allegedly missed payments for August and September.\n\nAlthough the warrant was issued almost two months ago, police have not yet executed it, and inquiries to Harare Central Police for clarification have been unsuccessful.\n\nMwonzora, quoted byMasvingo Mirror, said he was unaware of the development. I havent received the warrant of arrest you are talking about. I dont deserve any warrant. This is a sniff campaign, he said.\n\nChuma is said to be unhappy with the continued failure by police to act on the warrant, which has not been served on Mwonzora despite several attempts.\n\nPolice sources confirmed that the case, registered under number M389, remains active, though no arrest has been made to date.\n\n",

Outside Zimbabwe, we currently have Johannesburg only.\n\nHe added that preparations were underway to open new centres inHwedza,London, andBotswanabefore year-end  countries with some of the highest numbers of Zimbabweans living abroad.\n\nThe initiative aligns with the governments ongoing diplomatic infrastructure projects. During a post-Cabinet briefing in August, Information MinisterDr. Jenfan Muswereconfirmed that Zimbabwe is constructing new diplomatic missions inthe United Kingdom, Nigeria, and Mozambique, with the new mission house in London set to include an e-passport office.\n\nThe construction of the Zimbabwe-Abuja Chancery, Official Residence and Staff Apartments has reached 65 percent of completion, Dr. Muswere said.The renovation of the Zimbabwe-Pretoria Staff House is 60 percent complete, while the renovation of the Zimbabwe-Cape Town Chancery is at 50 percent. The construction of the Zimbabwe-London Official Residence and electrical works at the Beira Chancery are ongoing.\n\nPresenting the2025 National Budget, Finance and Economic Development MinisterProfessor Mthuli Ncubesaid Government had allocatedZiG $4 billionto support the countrys image-building, engagement, and re-engagement agenda. This includes the establishment of an additional mission office inNew York, USA.\n\nThe governments expansion drive also responds to long-standing recommendations by theZimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC). In its 2020 report,National Inquiry on Access to Documentation in Zimbabwe,the ZHRC urged the state to develop anational policy on access to documentationanddecentralise the Registrar-Generals Office servicesto improve efficiency and inclusivity.\n\nThe report also called for regular, well-funded mobile registration exercises and alignment of internal documentation procedures with devolution principles underSection 264 of the Constitutionto enhance accessibility, particularly for marginalized communities.\n\n",

            "content": " TEMBA MLISWA: THE SABHUKU AT ZANU-PFS GATE  NEW ANALYSIS BY DR SIBANGILIZWE MOYO\n\nBy A Correspondent\n\nIn a thought-provoking analysis titled Temba Mliswa: The Sabhuku at ZANU-PFs Gate Amid Succession Turmoil, political analyst Dr Sibangilizwe Moyo dissects the restless presence of former Norton legislator Temba Mliswa within Zimbabwes turbulent political ecosystem  painting him as the symbolic Sabhuku, a self-appointed custodian standing at the threshold of ZANU-PFs inner sanctum.\n\nDr Moyo argues that Mliswas political behaviour  half critic, half loyalist  mirrors the village headman archetype who chastises his community not to rebel, but to restore his own moral authority within it.\n\nIn the shifting terrain of ZANU-PFs internal dynamics, writes Dr Moyo, a new silhouette has appeared  not the ghostly figure of a rural headman, but a man of bold pronouncements and restless ambition.\n\n A Return to the Fold  or a Bid for Power?\n\nDr Moyo suggests that despite his repeated claims of independence, Mliswa has never escaped ZANU-PFs gravitational field. His vocabulary remains firmly rooted in liberation-era rhetoric  discipline, loyalty, and patriotism  suggesting that he still identifies with the movements ideological DNA.\n\nHis criticisms, Moyo observes, are not aimed at dismantling the house, but at inheriting a room within it.\n\nThe analysis posits that Mliswas recent commentaries on corruption and governance may, in fact, be auditions for a renewed role in ZANU-PFs post-Mnangagwa configuration  a political recalibration disguised as reformist outrage.\n\n The Unappointed Spokesman\n\nIn one of his sharpest insights, Dr Moyo compares Mliswas current visibility to that of Christopher Mutsvangwa, the partys official spokesperson. Mutsvangwa, known for his fiery loyalty, has long embodied the establishments voice  but Dr Moyo questions whether his dominance is now under challenge.\n\nHe notes that Mliswa has begun to speak with the authority of a de facto spokesman  not by appointment, but by assertion.\n\nThis parallel, Moyo argues, reveals a subtle power play: while Mutsvangwa defends the regimes continuity, Mliswa presents himself as its moral reformer  both fighting for relevance in a party where visibility equals survival.\n\n Succession Shadows and Strategic Positioning\n\nDr Moyo situates Mliswas manoeuvres within the broader succession anxiety consuming ZANU-PF. As President Mnangagwa consolidates power, the question of what happens next hovers ominously. In this silence, opportunists like Mliswa emerge  balancing critique and conformity to remain politically bankable.\n\nMliswa is neither inside nor fully outside, Moyo writes. His utility lies in his ability to straddle the boundary between reform and loyalty  a liminal figure rehearsing for re-entry.\n\n The Art of Ambiguity\n\nThe analysis describes Mliswas method as one of strategic ambiguity  condemning corruption like a reformist while affirming patriotism like a loyalist. This dual posture, Dr Moyo notes, allows him to remain relevant to all factions and dangerous to none.\n\nIs this not the essence of the Sabhuku, he asks, the figure who commands both fear and respect, who polices boundaries while bending rules to his advantage?\n\n The Theatre of Power\n\nDr Moyo contextualises Mliswas public outbursts and constant media engagement as performances of political endurance  a survival mechanism in a country where invisibility equals extinction.\n\nEvery tweet, press statement, or televised rant, he argues, is a coded message to ZANU-PFs strategists: a reminder that Mliswa remains a useful messenger, capable of mobilising the restless middle ground while still speaking the partys dialect.\n\n Mutsvangwa, Mnangagwa, and the Shadow Game\n\nMoyos essay also revisits the relationship between Mliswa, Mutsvangwa, and Mnangagwa  casting them as players in a subtle succession rehearsal.\n\nMliswas posture, he suggests, is not an attack on Mutsvangwa, but a demonstration that he could play that role  perhaps with more finesse.\n\nMnangagwa, in this reading, presides over the spectacle like a chess master  letting his subordinates spar rhetorically as he tests their endurance and loyalty for the post-2028 political chapter.\n\n Loyalty, Dissent, and the ZANU-PF Paradox\n\nDr Moyo highlights a recurring pattern in ZANU-PFs history: dissenters are rarely expelled forever. The partys strength, he writes, has always lain in its capacity to absorb dissent and reconstitute it as loyalty.\n\nCould Mliswas current positioning, therefore, be another act of strategic repentance  a way to signal readiness for reabsorption into the system he critiques?\n\nOr has ZANU-PFs ideological cohesion dissolved so completely that figures like Mliswa are now performing for a party that no longer knows what it believes in?\n\n Renewal or Repetition?\n\nUltimately, Dr Moyo questions whether Mliswas resurgence represents a genuine generational renewal or merely another rotation in Zimbabwes endless theatre of power.\n\nEach new phase brings its own Sabhuku  the figure who promises reform but perpetuates continuity under a new guise.\n\nThe analysis closes with a haunting question:\n\nCan any political system survive when every critic secretly longs for a seat at the table they denounce?\n\nIn Summary:Dr Sibangilizwe Moyos essay positions Temba Mliswa as both a mirror and a symptom of ZANU-PFs enduring political culture  where rebellion often masks ambition, and loyalty remains the ultimate currency.\n\nAs the ruling party edges toward an uncertain succession, the Sabhuku at the gate may yet find his way back inside.\n\nAuthor Note:Dr Sibangilizwe Moyo writes on Church and Governance, politics, legal and social issues.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nMDC-T president Douglas Mwonzora is facing legal trouble after a Harare magistrate issued a warrant of arrest against him for allegedly failing to pay child maintenance for five months.\n\nThe court had ordered Mwonzora in February 2024 to pay US$500 per month for the upkeep of his 10-year-old son with Getrude Chuma, along with school fees. However, he reportedly defaulted between March and July, accumulating arrears of US$2,500. The amount has since risen to US$3,500 after he allegedly missed payments for August and September.\n\nAlthough the warrant was issued almost two months ago, police have not yet executed it, and inquiries to Harare Central Police for clarification have been unsuccessful.\n\nMwonzora, quoted byMasvingo Mirror, said he was unaware of the development. I havent received the warrant of arrest you are talking about. I dont deserve any warrant. This is a sniff campaign, he said.\n\nChuma is said to be unhappy with the continued failure by police to act on the warrant, which has not been served on Mwonzora despite several attempts.\n\nPolice sources confirmed that the case, registered under number M389, remains active, though no arrest has been made to date.\n\n",
