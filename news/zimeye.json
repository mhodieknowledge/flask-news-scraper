Those bricks are pre-sold. They are going to our customers. Our customers will pay a 50 percent deposit and pay the balance in instalments over two years, he said.\n\nThe initiative is meant to incentivise the customers to build and not be burdened by paying lump sums towards the bricks and then failing to buy other building materials.The purchase price of $0.14 a brick will include transportation costs to the building site.\n\nSpeaking at a Christmas and excellence recognition awards ceremony for WestProp employees, Mr Sharpe stressed the concept of urgency in service delivery to meet customer expectations.\n\nHe rallied the employees to embrace the one billion brick vision, adding that their hands would be imprinted on the achievements of the vision.\n\nWhatever we do with the billion bricks stands forever. For the test of time, he said.\n\nMr Sharpe reiterated his love for Zimbabwe, noting that he formed the company to make a difference and provide livelihoods for thousands of people whose value chain depends on WestProp.I set up this business to be a public company. Not to enrich myself. I have enough money. I set it up so that you can benefit from it, he said.\n\nMR Sharpe challenged the employees to introspect and inspire themselves to achieve more for the company.\n\nThe plant that will manufacture WestProp branded bricks.Our plant will be operational in 2025. We are targeting to do our first installations of new equipment in January and February. Initially the plants output will be directed exclusively to our Harare projects, he said.The land we own requires one billion bricks which translates to US$5 billion to build. We want to be able to meet our own deadlines in terms of construction timelines, he says.\n\nWestProp has been on a drive to self-resource by purchasing yellow machines and other capital-intensive equipment to avoid hiring and delays in completing work.\n\nWestProp are the developers of Pomona City, Pokugara, Millennium Heights, The Hills Luxury Golf Estate, the soon-to-be-built Mall of Zimbabwe and the upcoming branded apartment hotel at Millennium Heights (block 5).\n\nThe companys developments embody the live, work, shop, and play themes, which have quickly become the signature selling point of all its products.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwas promises to revive Zimbabwes agricultural sector have been met with skepticism, with many critics labeling his recent efforts as political gimmicks rather than genuine steps towards transformation.\n\nOn Friday, Mnangagwa launched the Land Tenure Implementation Programme at Precabe Farm in Kwekwe, a new initiative he claims will rejuvenate the agricultural sector. During the event, he handed over Land Tenure Deeds to farmers, describing the move as a milestone in Zimbabwes agricultural progress.\n\nHowever, opposition leaders and critics have dismissed the programme as an attempt to distract from the countrys ongoing agricultural challenges. This is nothing more than a political stunt. For years, the countrys agricultural sector has suffered from poor policy implementation and lack of support, and this programme wont change that, one political analyst remarked.\n\nIn a statement during the event, Mnangagwa said, Today, I officially launched the new Land Tenure Implementation Programme at Precabe Farm in Kwekwe, where I also handed over Land Tenure Deeds to Zimbabwean farmers. This milestone is a critical step in transforming our agricultural sector, enabling farmers to access credit facilities, purchase inputs, and hire labour.\n\nThese tools will enhance agricultural production, improve yields, and uplift our people from poverty into prosperity.\n\nDespite the presidents optimism, many are doubtful that these measures will lead to significant improvements. The land reform process has been poorly managed for years, and handing over deeds now wont fix the systemic issues that have plagued farming in Zimbabwe, said a critic of the programme.\n\nMnangagwa also highlighted that the programme reflects his governments commitment to inclusive growth, focusing on marginalized groups such as war veterans, women, and youth. This programme reflects the Second Republics commitment to inclusive growth, ensuring that war veterans, women, and the youth are not left behind in this transformative journey, he added.\n\nWhile the president continues to champion agriculture as key to national development, his critics argue that the lack of tangible reforms over the years has made such promises seem increasingly far-fetched. Farming has always been close to my heart, and I am proud to support this initiative, which will create opportunities for sustainable commercial agriculture and attract investment into our economy, Mnangagwa said, but many believe that the focus should be on practical support for farmers, not just promises.\n\nAs Zimbabwe grapples with food insecurity and economic challenges, the real impact of this initiative remains to be seen. Many are calling for more than just ceremonial gestures, urging real action to revive the sector and restore confidence among farmers.\n\nTogether, we are building a thriving agricultural sector that drives Zimbabwes development and secures food security for future generations, Mnangagwa concluded, but for many, these words appear to be more hopeful rhetoric than a concrete plan.\n\n",

Allegations have surfaced suggesting that some of the items she has given away may have been confiscated by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), sparking questions about the transparency of her philanthropic efforts.\n\nOn December 19, 2024, the office of the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution announced that Mrs. Mnangagwa had donated 300 food hampers to the elderly in Gweru, a gesture described as part of her commitment to supporting vulnerable communities during the festive season.\n\nIn Gweru on 19 December 2024, Honourable Owen Ncube, Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Midlands, handed over 300 food hampers to the elderly at the Gweru Government Complex. The hampers, donated by the First Lady of Zimbabwe, Dr. Auxillia Mnangagwa, underscore her commitment to ensuring that no one is left behind during the festive season, a government official stated in a press release.\n\nHowever, sources within government circles have suggested that some of the items included in these hampers could have been seized by ZIMRA, raising concerns about the appropriateness of using such goods for charitable purposes. While her intentions may be good, the public deserves to know the origin of these goods. If they were taken by ZIMRA due to non-compliance with import regulations, it raises questions about the ethical use of such items, one government insider commented, requesting anonymity.\n\nAs of now, there has been no official confirmation regarding the exact source of the goods donated by the First Lady. Critics argue that using goods seized by ZIMRA for charity may undermine the integrity of the donations and contribute to a lack of transparency in public affairs.\n\nDespite these concerns, Mrs. Mnangagwas supporters have continued to praise her charitable work, particularly her focus on the elderly, a group often neglected in society. The First Ladys donations have been a blessing to many in need. Its crucial that we focus on the positive impact of her initiatives, said a government spokesperson.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the origin of the donated goods continues to raise questions about the broader implications of using confiscated goods in charity, and whether it might lead to a reassessment of how such donations are handled in the future.\n\n",
