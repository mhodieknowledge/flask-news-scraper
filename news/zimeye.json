            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda-Former Norton Member of Parliament, Temba Mliswa, was spotted this week at a Zanu PF farewell event held in Harare, reigniting public interest in the outspoken politicians ambiguous political positioning.\n\nNow a traditional leader, Mliswa attended a ceremony held tohonourthe retirement of Dr. Davison Gomo, the long-serving Zanu PF Director forCommissariat. Gomo, who served under four different political commissars, stepped down this week after years at the helm of Zanu PFs votermobilisationmachinery.\n\nWhile Mliswas presence at a ruling party function might raise eyebrows, it is not out of character.\n\nA former Zanu PF Mashonaland West provincial chairperson, he was expelled during the turbulent Mugabe-era factional battles between theGamatoxandZvipfukutocamps.\n\nSince then, he has carved out a distinctive political identityindependent, non-aligned, and vocal.\n\nThough he has no formal ties to any political party, Mliswa has consistently expressed personal loyalty to President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a position he has neverapologisedfor.\n\nHe has, however, distanced himself from Zanu PF as a political institution,criticisingits internal culture while maintaining his support for the Presidents leadership.\n\nHe may not wear party colours, but he doesnt hide where his loyalties lieMnangagwa the man, not Zanu PF the machine, said one observer.\n\nMliswas independence has also seen him attend opposition events and openlysympathisewith victims of state repression.\n\nHis pro-human rights stance has often put him at odds with hardliners within the ruling establishment.\n\nMliswa confirmed attending Dr Gomos farewell event, saying,  Yes, I was there. You know me and Dr Gomo, we have come a long way even during my time in the UK ( early 2000s). He is a respected man and a great mentor.\n\nAt the Gomo farewell ceremony, however, the Zanu PF family was united in praise.\n\nPolitical Commissar Munyaradzi Machacha credited Gomo with building an elaborate web of affiliateorganisationsthat significantly boosted the partysmobilisationahead of the disputed August 2023 elections.\n\nWhen I took over, I found that Dr. Gomo had already laid a solid foundation with the affiliate network, Machacha said. He gave the commissariat strategic depth.\n\nAmong these affiliates isForever Associates Zimbabwe (FAZ), a shadowy group allegedly linked to the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which was accused of running parallel electoral structures, voter intimidation, and influencing outcomes in Zanu PFsfavour.\n\nAnother was theVarakashisocial media brigade, known for online propaganda and the harassment of government critics.\n\nOthers, likeTeachers for ED,Pastors for ED,Young Women for ED, andDiaspora 4ED, operated under the guise of civil society but promoted partisan interests. By 2023, Zanu PF claimed to have over 60 such groups under its wing, blurring the lines between grassroots engagement and political control.\n\nAffiliate leaders at the event celebrated Gomos legacy, vowing to carry on his work.\n\nWe willmobilisethe diaspora to return and help rebuild Zimbabwe under Zanu PF, declared Gwatidzo, political commissar for the partys UK branch.\n\nThough Gomo is stepping down, analysts warn that his influence will persist through the structures he helped entrench.\n\nCivil societyorganisationsand opposition parties continue to accuse Zanu PF of using affiliates to tighten its grip on rural communities and suppress dissent, all under the rhetoric of national unity and development.\n\nFor Mliswa, however, his presence at the farewell appears to reflect personal respect for Gomo and enduring ties to individuals within the ruling elite, rather than any formal political re-engagement.\n\nI go where I am invited, and I stand by what I believe, Mliswa has often said.\n\nThat belief, it seems, remains rooted in loyalty to Mnangagwaif not the party that surrounds him.\n\n",

The 27-year-old overcame a slow start to the seasonhaving been an unused substitute in the opening six fixturesto establish himself as a key figure in the Bluebirds starting lineup.\n\nRinomhota made 31 appearances across all competitions, impressing not only in his familiar midfield position but also stepping in as a reliable right-back when required. His consistent performances and adaptability earned him the respect and votes of his teammates.\n\nBeing recognised by my fellow players means a lot, Rinomhota said after receiving the award. Its been a challenging season, but Im proud of how I responded and contributed to the team.\n\nAlthough nominated for the overall Player of the Season award, that honour went to forward Callum Robinson.\n\nCardiff City will now prepare for life in League One next season following their relegation from the Championship.\n\n",

Authorities have urged motorists to observe speed limits and exercise caution, especially in high-traffic areas like Mucheke Bridge, which has seen several accidents in recent years.\n\nMore details are expected to emerge as the police complete their report.\n\n",

He has failed to lead and has allowed his cronies to plunder state resources with impunity, Geza said in a strongly worded statement earlier this week.\n\nWhile the meetings purpose remains undisclosed, its secrecy and the current political climate suggest that the Zanu PF leader may be maneuvering to address internal dissent and shore up his waning support.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has drawn sharp criticism for remarks seen as an implicit endorsement of controversial businessman Wicknell Chivayo, following a speech in which he declared that his government rewards honest and hardworking individuals. The comments, delivered at the burial of the late Air Vice Marshal (Rtd) Winnie Mandeya, have sparked public outrage amid growing concerns about corruption and political patronage within the ruling Zanu PF.\n\nWe are in control of our own future, said Mnangagwa. Honesty, hard work, patriotism, zeal, and dedication will always be rewarded in the Second Republic. My government will always recognise those values and virtues.\n\nAlthough Mnangagwa did not mention Chivayo by name, his refusal to condemn the businessmanwho has become a symbol of alleged state capture and corruptionwas widely interpreted as a tacit endorsement. Chivayo, linked to questionable multi-million-dollar government tenders, continues to flaunt his wealth on social media while enjoying proximity to high-ranking officials.\n\nBy failing to distance himself from Chivayo and instead praising so-called hardworking individuals, Mnangagwa effectively legitimises looting, said one political analyst. It sends a dangerous message: loyalty to the system, not integrity, is what gets rewarded.\n\nThe timing of the remarks has added fuel to the fire. Mnangagwa also used the occasion to reaffirm his commitment to Vision 2030his flagship development agendawhich he insists will transform Zimbabwe into an upper-middle-income economy. But critics argue the initiative has become a political slogan detached from economic reality, especially as public frustration grows over inflation, unemployment, and elite enrichment.\n\nThe presidents use of liberation war rhetoric to defend his administrations direction has done little to calm tensions, especially as internal Zanu PF divisions deepen and calls for leadership renewal intensify. His silence on high-profile corruption scandals, including Chivayos, is increasingly viewed as complicity.\n\nAs the gap widens between government rhetoric and public experience, Mnangagwas attempt to project strength and vision is being undercut by accusations of hypocrisy and misplaced loyalty. Whether Vision 2030 can regain credibilityor whether the president can maintain his grip on powerremains to be seen.\n\n",

Honesty, hard work, patriotism, zeal, and dedication will always be rewarded in the Second Republic.

Critics argue that the Vision 2030 agendawhich aims to transform Zimbabwe into an upper-middle-income economy by the end of the decadelacks transparency, measurable progress, and grassroots support.\n\nPolitical analysts believe Mnangagwas insistence on the 2030 vision is not just about economic development, but also a calculated move to extend his political lifespan. Hes tying national aspirations to his own leadership, one Harare-based analyst said.\n\nIn essence, abandoning Vision 2030 would mean admitting failure or stepping asideneither of which hes prepared to do.\n\nMeanwhile, public dissatisfaction continues to grow, driven by high inflation, unemployment, and allegations of corruption at the highest levels. The presidents speech, rooted in liberation war rhetoric, sought to remind the nation of its revolutionary originsa frequent tactic used to invoke loyalty and distract from present crises.\n\nAs the battle over succession and leadership intensifies, Mnangagwas reiteration of his 2030 agenda sends a clear message to both allies and rivals: he is not ready to relinquish control.

We were at Mhlabangubo School in Tsholotsho South, Mat North, where we distributed 200 goats, marking the final phase of our initial nationwide empowerment program.\n\nShe went on to praise the effort as part of a broader development initiative, noting: During the course of the initiative we have empowered young women through sustainable livelihoods in goat rearing, pig farming, and rabbitry.\n\nWhile Mavetera framed the event as part of a legitimate economic development program, political analysts and opposition figures argue the gesture was little more than vote-buying in a region long neglected by the central government. The timing and symbolismon Workers Dayonly intensified the criticism.\n\nThis Workers Day, we did more than just remember the workers and heroes like Benjamin Burombo and Ubaba Dr. Joshua Nkomo, she added. We honored hardworking young women Zimbabweans by investing in their future. Agriculture is wealth, and empowerment is freedom.\n\nObservers, however, say Maveteras gesture reflects a growing trend within Zanu PF of using state-aligned resources and politically branded groups to maintain loyalty in rural areas. You can call it empowerment, but its clear this is a political transaction, said one civil society leader in Bulawayo. These so-called donations come with expectations of allegiance, especially in an election-sensitive climate.\n\nMavetera ended her statement by expressing gratitude to those involved: I am grateful to all who made this possible.
