            "content": "By A CorrespondentVice PresidentConstantino Chiwengaand his boss,President Emmerson Mnangagwa, are set to lock horns at the ruling partysZANU PF Annual ConferenceinMutare, which began this week. Their supporters are reportedly gearing up for a tense confrontation amid deepeningsuccession battlesand growing mistrust within the Presidium.\n\nChiwenga has already shown remarkable defiance in recent months, having directly challenged Mnangagwa to halt and investigate his allies who are pushing for the controversialVision 2030 Agendaa campaign many within ZANU PF view as a veiled attempt to extend Mnangagwas rule beyond the constitutional two-term limit.\n\nOutspoken former Norton MPTemba Mliswahas warned that Chiwenga could even beexpelled from ZANU PFduring the Mutare conferencean outcome that would mark the most dramatic escalation yet in the ruling partys long-simmering internal feud.\n\nIn anexplosive interview with ZimEye, Mliswa  a former ZANU PF Mashonaland West Provincial Chairperson and one of the partys most outspoken insiders  predicted that Mnangagwa will use the conference toconsolidate his grip on powerand politicallyneutralize his deputy.\n\nIf theres anyone to be chased this week, it could be Chiwenga at congress, because ED can fire anyone at conference, Mliswa declared. The only safe person at the conference is ED. No one can move a motion to remove him because it has to be on the agenda, and the conference is not an elective congress  just like in 2017.\n\nThe current confrontation revives memories of the2017 political upheavalthat ousted long-time rulerRobert Mugabe. Then, Chiwenga  as Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces  led the military intervention, code-namedOperation Restore Legacy, which paved the way for Mnangagwas rise to power.\n\nHowever, the alliance forged in the heat of the coup began tofracture almost immediatelyafter the transition.Chiwenga, who saw himself as the guarantor of the post-Mugabe political order, reportedly expected a rotational leadership arrangement or succession pact. Mnangagwa, however, swiftlycentralized power, surrounded himself with loyalists such asZiyambi Ziyambi,Owen Ncube, andKudakwashe Tagwirei, and embarked on a campaign to weaken Chiwengas influence within both thepartyand themilitary.\n\nBy 2019, Chiwengas health challenges, frequent medical trips to China, and the removal of key military figures loyal to him  including Air Marshal Perrance Shiri and SB Moyo  left himincreasingly isolated. The2023 elections, which cemented Mnangagwas second term, further widened the rift as the Presidents allies began floating theED2030narrative, signalling his intentions to remain in power beyond his constitutional mandate.\n\nThe latest flashpoint came with theleak of a confidential dossier, reportedly authored and presented by Chiwenga before the ZANU PF Politburo in September 2025. In the document, Chiwenga accused Mnangagwa and his business allies Tagwirei, Wicknell Chivhayo, Delish Nguwaya, andScott Sakupwanya ofstate capture and grand corruption, alleging they were using state resources to entrench a dynastic political agenda under the guise of Vision 2030.\n\nThe dossiers publication has shaken the ruling elite. Mnangagwas inner circle has branded it adeclaration of war,with some calling for Chiwengasimmediate dismissal or arrestfor undermining the President.\n\nAccording to Mliswa, such defiance could mark Chiwengasfinal fall:\n\nThe only person untouchable is ED, he emphasized. He holds all the cards. Chiwenga, just like anyone else, can be dismissed even before the conference ends. Those thinking otherwise are living in denial.\n\nAdding to the tension,campaign-style fliersemblazoned with the messagePresident for 2028 & Beyond  General Constantino G.D.N. Chiwengahave flooded the streets of Mutare.The leaflets carry bold slogans such asNo to corruption, no to patronage and cronyism  enough is enoughandI stand for Zimbabweans, not ZANU PF interests,signalling an open challenge to Mnangagwas authority.\n\nFor many party observers, these fliers representthe clearest indication yet of factional defiancewithin ZANU PFs ranks and a symbolic reawakening of the 2017 fault lines  this time, with Mnangagwa wielding the same instruments of power once used against Mugabe.\n\nInsiders say the Mutare conference could prove to be adecisive momentfor both men. Mnangagwa is expected to use the event toreassert controlandpurge dissent, while Chiwengas allies are bracing for potential political retribution.\n\nMliswa likened the current tensions to theprelude to the November 2017 coup, when Mnangagwa and Chiwenga worked together to oust Mugabe  but warned that this time, the former general standsisolated and vulnerable.\n\nWho controls the chairpersons? Mliswa asked. The only person safe is Mnangagwa because he can only be removed at congress. The Vice President, including Chiwenga, can be fired by ED even as the conference ends.\n\nAs the Mutare conference unfolds,ZANU PFs internal battle lines have never been sharper. Whether Mnangagwa moves decisively against his deputy or seeks a temporary truce, the outcome will define not onlythe future of the ruling partybut alsoZimbabwes political trajectoryleading into the 2030 elections.\n\n",

He alleged that the Vice Presidents document sought to undermine a constitutionally elected President and rekindle the appetite to return Zimbabwe to November 2017  a clear allusion to the military coup that toppled the late Robert Mugabe.\n\nZiyambi accused Chiwenga of plotting to destabilize the state and subvert constitutional order, calling his actions adirect threat to national security. He further claimed that Chiwengas push for the arrest of controversial businessmenKudakwashe Tagwirei, Wicknell Chivhayo, Scott Sakupwanya, andDelish Nguwayaover multi-billion-dollar corruption scandals was merely a smokescreen for a broader plan to seize control of government.\n\nThis behaviour, Ziyambi reportedly wrote, is treasonous in nature and should be crushed decisively under Zimbabwes laws protecting the sovereignty of the State and the authority of the President.\n\nUnderSection 20of ZimbabwesCriminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, treason is punishable bylife imprisonment or death, underscoring the gravity of Ziyambis accusations.\n\nThe Justice Minister also mounted a spirited defence of MnangagwasVision 2030 Agenda, which critics have dismissed as a tool to entrench Mnangagwas hold on power, insisting that the programme is lawful, constitutional, and supported by the will of the people.\n\nThe escalating feud between the President and his deputy marks the most serious internal confrontation withinZANU-PFsince 2017  when the partys then mouthpiece,The Herald, ran with the now-infamous headlineZanu-PF unfazed by Chiwenga, accusing him of treasonous statements just days before the military deposed Mugabe.\n\nPolitical analysts warn that Ziyambis remarks suggest that Mnangagwas loyalists arereplaying the script of 2017, this time turning the same accusations once used to justify the coup against their former ally.\n\nThe parallels are unmistakable, said one political commentator. In 2017, Chiwenga was accused of treason for defending the military. Today, he faces the same charge for allegedly defying the President. Its as if the revolution has come full circle.\n\nIf the treason allegations are formally pursued, observers warn that Zimbabwe could be on the brink of anotherhigh-stakes power struggle, testing bothZANU-PFs internal unityand theresilience of the countrys constitutional order.\n\nZimEye News | Developing Story\n\n",

He has constantly emphasised that his leadership is guided by constitutional principles and democratic values.\n\nHowever, the current attempts by Daniel Gware and his crew to push for constitutional manipulation, aimed at extending the presidential term beyond what the law allows, are in direct contradiction to everything the President has stood for. It is concerning that individuals within the ruling party appear determined to pressure the Head of State into breaking the very law he helped craft and swore to defend.\n\nZimbabwes Constitution is not just a document of convenience; it is the supreme law of the land, a product of the peoples will and a symbol of their hope for accountable governance. Any effort to tamper with its provisions for political gain undermines the integrity of our democracy and betrays the trust of the citizens who voted for it.\n\nNow, as the ZANU PF 22nd Annual National Peoples Conference is just hours away, the moment of truth has arrived. This conference presents President Mnangagwa with the perfect opportunity to reaffirm his commitment to the Constitution and silence those who are advocating for unconstitutional amendments.\n\nTrue leadership is measured not by how much power one can accumulate, but by how faithfully one can protect the institutions that safeguard the peoples rights and freedoms. The President must use this platform to decisively put this matter to rest and demonstrate to Zimbabwe and to the world that he remains a leader of principle, integrity and constitutional fidelity.\n\nThe nation awaits his word.\n\nEngineer Jacob Kudzayi Mutisi+263772278161\n\n",
