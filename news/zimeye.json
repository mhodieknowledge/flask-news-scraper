            "content": "SATIRICAL FEATURE | By Our Correspondent\n\nIf You Hire Makebi Zulu, How Many Colours-of-Ideas Will He Announce Before You Get Home?\n\nA viral meme has catapulted Edgar Lungu family spokesperson Makebi Zulu into the internets courtroom of comedic judgmentwhere instead of arguing legal principles, the question is far more existential: If you were stranded in a foreign land and hired this man to bring you back home, how many colours-of-ideas would he announce along the way? And would you ever actually make it?\n\nIn the now-infamous photo, Zulu stands confidently dressed in a navy-blue suit, crisp (though partially rebellious) white shirt, and a silk scarf knotted at the neck like he just stepped off the runwayor perhaps out of a very complicated affidavit. Behind him, an African sunset painting glows warmly, perhaps foretelling how many times the story behind Edgar Lungus burial may still change colour.\n\nOnline analysts (read: amused citizens) have already identified at least three colour-coded themes:Colour Route 1: The scarf of layered intentions  equal parts style and a metaphor for the tangled narrative hes been spinning.Colour Route 2: The shirt of uncertainty  unbuttoned, unfiltered, and unbothered by the weight of clarity.Colour Route 3: The trousers of long journeys  seemingly pointing toward a route that may go nowhere, slowly.\n\nMakebi Zulu, a seasoned lawyer, has found himself not just defending the Lungu familys controversial decision to keep the former presidents remains in South Africa, but now defending himself against the court of public opinion armed with memes and satire. His long-winded explanations, evasive phrasing, and ever-shifting statements have become a national riddle with no final page.\n\nWhile the public waits for a definitive answer on where, when, or whether the late Edgar Lungu will be buried, one thing is certain: if youre relying on Makebi Zulu to guide you home, bring a tent, some snacks, and a few changes of metaphor. Youll need them.\n\nIn the end, its not just about the colours-of-routes. Its about whether this journey has a destinationor just a very stylish detour.\n\n",

            "content": "By A CorrespondentControversial businessman and Emmerson Mnangagwas close ally, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, has been co-opted into ZANU PFs Central Committee  a move that has fueled speculation he is being positioned as a potential successor to the president.\n\nThe development, confirmed by ZANU PF legal affairs secretary Patrick Chinamasa, marks Tagwireis formal entry into politics after years of wielding influence from the shadows through his sprawling business empire and strategic proximity to the presidency.\n\nTagwireis appointment comes as Mnangagwa enters the final stretch of his constitutionally mandated second term, with internal jockeying for the post-Mnangagwa era intensifying. Sources say the billionaire tycoon could emerge as a dark horse in the succession race, with growing support from party elites who view him as a loyal benefactor and stabilizing force.\n\nThough initially recommended by Masvingo, it was Harare Province that cleared space for Tagwirei in the powerful 300-member committee. Chinamasa described him as a dormant but committed cadre who is now erupting like a volcano, signaling his arrival on the national political stage.\n\nThis is a breath of fresh air, said Chinamasa. Cde Tagwirei is destined to add value to ZANU PFs political fortunes. His entry may change the game not only in Harare but nationally.\n\nTagwireis elevation is being viewed in political circles as more than symbolic. Insiders believe his Central Committee role could be a calculated first step toward a larger leadership bid  possibly even the presidency.\n\nThough critics accuse him of using his economic clout to buy influence, supporters say Tagwireis resilience and deep pockets make him a formidable contender in ZANU PFs future.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent-Princess Cruises has suspended shore leave in Canadian ports for all Zimbabwean crew members following a spate of desertions since the start of the Alaska cruise season, highlighting the enduring desperation among Zimbabweans seeking economic refuge abroad.\n\nThe directive, issued in a company memo early this month, by Elio Autiero, Vice President of Maritime HR Strategy & Operations, cites multiple desertion cases by Zimbabwean seafarers in Canadian ports.\n\nThe company said the decision was necessary to safeguard its business operations and maintain the integrity of its global staffing protocols.\n\nAs a result, we made the difficult decision to suspend shore leave for all Zimbabwean teammates in Canadian ports, Autiero wrote. He urged captains, hotel general managers, and human resources officers to implement the measure with immediate effect.\n\nThe move comes amid a renewed wave of economic migration by Zimbabweans, many of whom have been fleeing deteriorating conditions at home since the early 2000s.\n\nZimbabwes once-thriving economy began to collapse around 2000 following a series of political missteps, including violent land seizures, disputed elections, hyperinflation, and the near-total collapse of essential public services.\n\nDespite changes in leadership, the country has continued to face chronic unemployment, currency instability, corruption, and human rights abusesdriving millions to seek better lives abroad.\n\nThe cruise ship industry has in recent years become a vital source of employment for young Zimbabweans, particularly those with hospitality and culinary training. However, Canada has increasingly become a popular destination for deserters, drawn by its relatively open asylum system and perceived better prospects for long-term settlement.\n\nPrincess Cruises acknowledged the potential hardship this restriction will cause to law-abiding Zimbabwean crew members. Nevertheless, the company emphasized that it must comply with immigration regulations and mitigate business risks posed by unauthorized absconding.\n\nThe memo clarified that Zimbabwean crew members will not be reassigned to other regions, and upon the completion of their contracts, they will be disembarked at ports outside Canada. Crew planners and third-party concession partners are reportedly adjusting rosters to avoid further complications involving Zimbabwean staff.\n\nThe company advised employees with concerns or questions to contact David Price, Senior Manager of GTP Management, who is liaising with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to handle the matter.\n\nThe development underscores the increasingly precarious position of Zimbabwean economic migrantsespecially those in temporary or contract jobs abroadwhose dreams of escape are now colliding with tightened immigration controls and corporate crackdowns.\n\n",

            "content": ".\n\nBy A Correspondent\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump will make a final decision within the next two weeks on whether the United States will become directly involved in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, the White House announced on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt conveyed a message directly from President Trump:\n\nBased on the fact that theres a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks.\n\nThe announcement comes amid escalating tensions in the Middle East, following Israeli strikes on Iranian targets and a retaliatory missile attack by Iran that struck near a hospital in southern Israel on Thursday morning. Iranian state media claimed the strike was aimed at a military installation next to the hospital.\n\nIn a firm warning to Washington, Irans Deputy Foreign Minister Saeed Khatibzadeh told the BBC:\n\nThis is not Americas war. If the U.S. gets involved, it will be hell for the whole region. It will turn into a quagmire, prolong the aggression, and delay any end to the brutal atrocities.\n\nPresident Trump, who addressed reporters earlier in the week, remained vague about his intentions:\n\nI may do it. I may not do it, he said on Wednesday, emphasizing his administrations strategic ambiguity on the matter.\n\nAsked what message the president had for ordinary Americans concerned about a potential new conflict, Leavitt responded:\n\nTrust in President Trump. His top priority is making sure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community remains divided. Trump has dismissed recent intelligence assessments from figures such as Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who indicated that Iran is not actively pursuing nuclear weapons. In contrast, the administration insists that Iran has never been closer to building one.\n\nMeanwhile, CBS and other media outlets reported that Trump had approved military plans targeting Irans Fordo nuclear facility  a heavily fortified uranium enrichment site buried deep in a mountain. However, no final order has been given, and the president later responded on Truth Social that the media has no idea what my thoughts are concerning Iran.\n\nDiplomatic channels remain open, with American negotiators reportedly maintaining communication with Iranian officials. Reuters revealed that U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Irans Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi have held several phone calls in recent days.\n\nDespite these efforts, Khatibzadeh maintained a cautious tone:\n\nDiplomacy is our first option, but while the bombs are falling, we cannot begin any negotiation.\n\nEuropean foreign ministers are scheduled to meet with Iranian officials in Switzerland on Friday in an attempt to cool tensions and prevent a wider regional conflict.\n\nAs the world watches closely, President Trumps looming decision could shape the future of U.S. involvement in the Middle East  with potentially historic consequences.\n\n",

Keep the promise. Refuse compromise. Never get neutralized. Never be diluted. Stick to your gut. Stick to your guns. Ignore their attacks, hate, sideshows, lies and propaganda. #Lead #Integrity\n\nChamisas remarks come at a time when Zanu PF hardliners and aligned social media voices appear to be intensifying efforts to discredit his leadership, often through orchestrated narratives and unfounded allegations. The sideshowsranging from smear campaigns to insinuations aimed at questioning his credibilityhave done little to shake the youthful opposition figure.\n\nClose allies to the opposition leader suggest that the attacks are part of a broader campaign to distract the public from the real issues facing the country, including economic decline, rising poverty levels, and growing public discontent.\n\nChamisa has been clearhe is focused on the bigger picture, said a source within his political circle. Zanu PF hardliners are trying to discredit him, but he is not taking the bait. He wont be derailed by propaganda and petty politics.\n\nObservers note that Chamisas continued message of integrity and consistency resonates with many Zimbabweans, particularly the youth, who see him as a symbol of hope and change.\n\nAs political tensions simmer, Chamisas unwavering stance sends a clear signal: he has no time for sideshows. His focus, as he has repeatedly stated, remains on building a just, democratic, and accountable Zimbabwe.\n\n",

Representing himself, Sibanda alleged that Phephela Tshuma, a married woman, was not a fraud victimbut a lover who voluntarily gave him money after their sexual encounters at various city lodges.\n\nShe treated me like her Ben 10, Melusi told the court. She would call me anytime for sex, and after every session, she would give me money as a token of appreciation.\n\nMelusi went further, claiming that Phephela had sent him nude pictures and even offered to submit them to the court as evidence. The gallery murmured in disbelief as he detailed their alleged affair.\n\nHowever, Phephela fiercely denied the allegations, dismissing Melusis claims as a desperate attempt to deflect from his fraudulent activities.\n\nHes lying to cover up his scams, she responded. I was in love with a businessman named Moyo from Esigodini. I sent him money to help me secure a shopnot Melusi.\n\nBehind the explosive personal claims lies a more serious case. Sibanda stands accused of defrauding not only Phephela but also her daughter, Mercy, and two other women.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Melusi conned Mercy in March this year at the corner of Fife Street and Fifth Avenue in Bulawayo. He allegedly promised her a waitress job at a local hotel, claiming he needed US$35 for uniforms. After receiving the money, he disappeared and blocked her contact.\n\nThe trial continues, with the court expected to sift through the sensational claims and determine whether Sibanda is a charming conman or an innocent man entangled in a messy personal drama.\n\n",
