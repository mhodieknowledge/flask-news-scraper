            "content": "By A Correspondent| A state-of-the-art smart market is set to be officially opened to the public in Mbare on Friday in a move that is set to transform the citys commercial landcape.\n\nThe smart and modern trading facility is designed to improve hygiene, security and convenience for vendors and customers alike.\n\nThe new Mbare Musika market boasts of advanced amenities aimed at addressing long-standing challenges faced by informal traders in the area.\n\nThis redevelopment signals not only a facelift of the countrys busiest market but a broader shift in Zimbabwes approach to urban infrastructure and informal trade.\n\nHistorically, Mbare Musika has served as a vital economic artery for Zimbabwe, functioning as a distribution hub for fresh produce and goods from across the country. Despite its centrality to livelihoods, the market had become notorious for its chaotic environment, poor sanitation, overcrowding, and security challenges. The markets infrastructure was dilapidated, and its thousands of vendors operated in unsafe, unhygienic conditions.\n\nThese longstanding issues came to a head in April 2023, when a devastating fire reduced large parts of the bustling market to ashes. The blaze destroyed vendor stalls and goods worth millions of dollars, affecting nearly 4,700 traders and prompting President Mnangagwa to declare a state of disaster. At the time, the President described the tragedy as a severe setback for our hardworking vendors and pledged swift government intervention to restore the critical trading center.\n\nIn response, a comprehensive reconstruction project commenced in November 2024, resulting in a three-story, state-of-the-art Smart Market facility. Local Government Minister Daniel Garwe hailed the development as a milestone in urban development, emphasizing its role in formalizing informal trade.\n\nThis Smart Market is proof of the governments commitment to improving the working conditions of our people, Garwe said. With proper sanitation, security, and financial support systems, we are empowering vendors to operate in a dignified and sustainable environment.\n\nContrary to social media reports, rentals have been set at an affordable $120 per month, making the space accessible to local entrepreneurs. The facility is designed to accommodate at least 10,000 vendorsmore than double its previous capacityhighlighting the governments intent to accommodate the growing informal sector.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume said the revamped facility would bring much-needed order and efficiency to Mbare Musika, which has historically struggled with mismanagement and neglect.\n\nFor years, vendors have struggled with inadequate facilities, but this Smart Market changes that. With reliable water supply, clean toilets, waste management, and CCTV surveillance, we are setting a new standard for markets in Zimbabwe, Mafume said.\n\nThe new market comes equipped with several transformative features including boreholes providing 120,000 liters of water daily, CCTV cameras, a modern waste management system, secure parking and washing bay for all products among others.\n\nThe Smart Market has drawn praise beyond Zimbabwes borders, with South African opposition leader Julius Malema, known for his pan-Africanist ideology, commending the initiative.\n\nThis is the kind of progressive urban development Africa needs, Malema said. When governments invest in proper infrastructure for informal traders, theyre not just building marketstheyre building dignity, economic stability, and true economic freedom for the people.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues to grapple with urbanization, economic instability, and the vast influence of informal trade, the transformation of Mbare Musika stands as a powerful example of what is possible when infrastructure meets intention.\n\n",

            "content": "By Munacho GwamandaFresh details have emerged in the growing rift between Zanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa and Information Minister Jenfan Muswere, revealing a toxic blend of factional battles, personal interests, and raw political power.\n\nAt thecentreof the storm is a scathing letter Mutsvangwa wrote on7 April, threatening to fire Muswere for allegedly bypassing internal party procedures.\n\nThe Zanu PF spokesperson accused the minister of prematurely authorizing the state broadcaster, ZBC, andThe Heraldto announcethe resultsof the partys internal womens league elections in Manicaland before the party leadership had officially ratified them.\n\nMutsvangwa branded the announcement irregular and an attempt to upend standard internal consultations, asserting that any official position would come only from his office as the partys designated mouthpiece.\n\nIn tone and content, the letter was not just a reprimandit was a direct challenge to Musweres ministerial authority and a bold assertion of control over the state media apparatus.\n\nYet behind the bureaucratic outrage lies a more calculated motive: Mutsvangwa was fightingindefenceofhis wife, Monica Mutsvangwa, a senior party official whose preferred candidate had lost the controversial womens league election in Manicaland.\n\nThe womens league elections, held onApril 6, were to choose a new provincial chairperson to replace Happiness Nyakuedzwa,whowasfiredlast year.\n\nThe contest pitted acting chairperson Mercy SaccoMonica Mutsvangwas allyagainst Dorothy Mabika, backed by womens league boss Mabel Chinomona.\n\nWhen the resultswere announced, Mabika had won decisively, reportedly securing 29 votes to Saccos solitary ballot. But soon after, chaos erupted.\n\nOne faction disputed the results, claiming the elections hadbeen postponedandthat thevoteswere countedat an unsanctioned venue.\n\nAllegations of forged signatures and procedural violationsswirled,as rival camps accused each other of manipulation.\n\nThe meeting wascancelled, said a party insider, but the other faction went ahead at an unknown location. Later, it returned to the Manicaland party offices in Mutare. There is real fighting in the womens league. Chinomona supports Mabika, while Monica Mutsvangwa supports Sacco. Now Chris [Mutsvangwa] is fighting in his wifes corner.\n\nThe fallout escalated when Muswere, reportedly following routinegovernment mediapractice, authorized the coverage of the results.\n\nThis,in Mutsvangwas eyes, was a betrayalnot ofprotocol,but of his familys political interests.\n\nMutsvangwas letter to Muswere was heavy-handed, and observers say it exposed the Zanu PF spokespersons bully-boy tactics.\n\nRather than resolve the issue through internal dialogue, Mutsvangwa publicly humiliated Muswere and wielded his role as spokesperson like a weapon.\n\nHes trying to reassert himself, not just as a communications head but as a powercentrein the party, a senior Zanu PF official confided. The letter was a warning shotnot just to Muswere but to anyone seen as Mnangagwas rising star.\n\nIndeed, Jenfan Muswere, the youthful Information Minister and Zanu PF MP forMakoni,is widely seen as a protg of President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nMany perceive his growing influence, especially in managing state media narratives, as part of Mnangagwas broader strategy to groom loyalists who can eventually replace the old guard.\n\nAnd this, more than anything else, seems to have irked Mutsvangwa.\n\nOnce a close ally of Mnangagwa, Mutsvangwa played a pivotal role in the 2017 military coup that ousted Robert Mugabe and elevated Mnangagwa to the presidency.\n\nBut that alliance has soured.\n\nAs Mnangagwa begins to edge out aging war veterans and consolidate power around a younger cohortincludingthe likes ofMuswereMutsvangwa has grown more aggressive and erratic.\n\nSome insiders believe heharboursambitions of his own and is using his party post to build a base, especially among disgruntled war veterans andsections of the elitefrustrated with Mnangagwas increasingly authoritarian rule.\n\nMutsvangwa sees himself as a natural successor, said another source. He thinks he has the liberation credentials, the charisma, and the networks. But Mnangagwa is not about to hand over the reins.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire arelongstanding personalrumoursthat continue to dog both camps.\n\nWhispers within party corridors suggest that Monica Mutsvangwa once had a romantic relationship with Mnangagwa, a liaisonthat allegedlyproduceda child.\n\nThough unsubstantiated and widely dismissed as political gossip, therumourhas persistedrevived every time the two camps clash.\n\nThisrumour, while salacious, underscores thedeeplypersonal nature of the political battles within Zanu PF.\n\nIn a party where family ties, factional alliances, and state power often overlap, such scandals are not mere distractionsthey areweapons.\n\nAt its heart, the Mutsvangwa-Muswere clash is about control: control of the media, control of party processes, and control of the post-Mnangagwa succession narrative.\n\nAsthe party gears up for a potentially explosive elective congress, the battle lines are becoming clearer.\n\nMutsvangwa,longand loudest voice in the room,is flexinghis muscles to reassert dominance.\n\nBut Muswere, backed by the full weight of the presidency, is no pushover.\n\nThis is no longer about protocol or press statements, the senior Zanu PF official added. Its about who controls the future of the partyand who gets left behind.\n\n",
