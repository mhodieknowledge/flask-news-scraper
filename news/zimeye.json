            "content": "By Sports Reporter-Since his demotion from the Zimbabwe National Army and reassignment to civilian life, Lt General (Retired) Anselem Nhamo Sanyatwe has increasingly found himself in the public eyethis time not in military fatigues, but as the new Minister of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture.\n\nSanyatwes demotion marks the latest chapter in a gradual political fall from grace. Once a powerful figure in Zimbabwes military and political establishment, he was a central player during the 2017 coup that ousted long-time ruler Robert Mugabe. He later served as Zimbabwes Ambassador to Tanzania, before being recalled in January 2024 under murky circumstances. His reassignment to a ministerial post, widely seen as a further sidelining, came amid a reshuffle that removed him from strategic security structures and placed him in a less politically sensitive portfolio.\n\nDespite this, Sanyatwe has remained unusually visible and vocal. Last week, he toured the controversial Heart Stadium and hotel in Waterfalls, owned by self-proclaimed prophet and convicted fraudster Walter Magaya, raising eyebrows about the ministers choice of company.\n\nHe also made headlines after confronting the contractor in charge of renovating the National Sports Stadium, reportedly telling them to shape up or ship outa statement that signalled his intention to shake up the countrys troubled sports infrastructure.\n\nThis week, Sanyatwe visited Kensington Medical Centre, where four professional golfers are receiving treatment following a tragic car crash that claimed the life of a fellow player.\n\nThe deceased, Morton Kombai, a professional golfer from Zvishavane, died in a car accident late Sunday night at the intersection of Samora Machel Avenue and Seventh Street in Harare. He had just competed in the FBC-Zimbabwe Open golf tournament alongside four other professional golfers.\n\nThe injuredTonderai Masunga (Zimbabwean), Biggie Chibvuri (Zimbabwean and driver of the vehicle), Victor Kachepatsonga (Malawian), and Lucky Ayisa (Ghanaian)are currently hospitalised.\n\nSanyatwes presence at the hospital underscores his new role as minister, but also highlights the tightrope he walks between remaining politically relevant and appearing overly eager in a portfolio often seen as a political graveyard. Whether this renewed visibility will help him rebuild influence or fade quietly from the national spotlight remains to be seen.\n\n",

            "content": "ByCrime and Courts Reporter-The High Court of Zimbabwe has today granted bail to 89 opposition-linked protesters who were arrested in connection with the crippling 31 March 2025 demonstrations, an action widely credited to war veteranBlessed Runesu  Geza, who continues to mount pressure for the release of all political detainees.\n\nPresiding over the matter, Justice Muremba overturned a lower court decision that had denied bail to the group and ordered their release upon payment of US$100 each to the Clerk of Court at the Harare Magistrates Court. Strict bail conditions were imposed, including a requirement for all accused to reside at their stated addresses and report to designated police stations every fortnight until the finalisation of their cases.\n\nAmong the named appellantsJoseph Gatsi, Kudzanai Murungweni, Memory Dehwe, and Munyaradzi Kanonamareporting stations include Chegutu, Sanyati, Rusape, and Glendale, respectively.\n\nThe group is facing charges of public violence, breach of peace, and bigotry under section 37(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Law Code. The state alleges they engaged in unlawful assembly and incitement during the March 31 demonstrations, which saw thousands take to the streets demanding political reforms, economic relief, and respect for constitutional rights.\n\nHowever, human rights lawyers have dismissed the charges as politically motivated, arguing that the arrests were part of a broader state strategy to stifle dissent and criminalise legitimate protest.\n\nThe March 31 protests, described by observers as one of the most significant acts of civil disobedience in recent years, were largely mobilised by Cde Geza. His call to action brought cities and towns across Zimbabwe to a near-standstill, with widespread shutdowns of businesses, schools, and public services. Economists estimate that millions of dollars in business activity were lost that day, with many acknowledging that the protests impact sent shockwaves through both the government and private sectors.\n\nThe court, while granting bail, warned the appellants not to interfere with ongoing investigations.\n\nTodays ruling is a significant legal and moral win for the opposition and civic groups, coming at a time when Zimbabwes human rights record is under renewed international scrutiny.\n\nDeveloping story\n\n",
