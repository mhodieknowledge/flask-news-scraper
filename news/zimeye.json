            "content": "By A Correspondent| Eight employees linked to Robert Mugabe International Airport, including two staff members from Zimbabwes National Handling Services (NHS), appeared in court this week over allegations of orchestrating the illegal transit of 23 Ethiopian nationals through Harare to Eswatini.\n\nThe accusedGloria Chikukwa (27) and Ashley Zhaimu (27) of NHS, alongside immigration officers Vincent Shoshore (45)Gondoza Sunday (39), Terrence Mangwende (43),Innocent Tawanda Hamandishe (54), and security officials *Elliot Nhapi and Moses Tawanda Mutambai (29)were remanded in custody by Harare magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa pending a bail hearing Thursday.\n\nThe National Handling Services (NHS), a key ground operations company at Zimbabwes major airports, faced scrutiny after its employees allegedly abused their positions to facilitate the smuggling scheme.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Chikukwa and Zhaimuboth NHS workersreportedly escorted the Ethiopians through the airports restricted VIP route and concealed them overnight in the Vakacha Lounge, a premium facility reserved for dignitaries.\n\nThe Department of Immigration Control, led by Regional Immigration Officer Chakawuya Leslie, detailed how the group manipulated airport protocols.\n\nThe accused wedged doors open with paper to bypass security checks, enabling unauthorised movement, the court heard.\n\nThe operation unfolded over two days in March 2025. On March 15, five Ethiopians arrived on Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET 873 and were hidden by the accused. The following day, 19 more Ethiopians arrived on two additional flights (ET 873 and ET 34). Prosecutors allege NHS staff and immigration officials collaborated to falsify manifests, listing the Ethiopians as Russians, Turks, Indians, and Malawiansto evade detection.\n\nBy evening, all 23 individuals boarded Eswatini Airlines Flight RN401 to Manzini. The scheme unraveled when Eswatini authorities discovered the passengers lacked valid transit visas. Subsequent investigations exposed the falsified documents and implicated the Zimbabwean officials.\n\n",

            "content": "UK Sponsorship Scheme Exposed as Candidates Left Waiting in Multi-Thousand Pound Scam\n\nBy A Correspondent  |  ZimEye | London, March 21, 2025  A damning expos has revealed shocking mismanagement and scam in a UK-based sponsorship scheme, leaving dozens of international job seekers stranded after paying thousands of pounds for Certificates of Sponsorship (COS) that were never delivered.\n\nAt the center of the controversy is Emma Walker, a registered NHS nurse and recruiter who has been implicated in a chaotic web of fake papers, contradictions, failed verifications, and financial irregularities. Meeting minutes from a critical discussion on February 25th reveal an alarming picture of negligence and disarray affecting over 50 candidates, many of whom have been waiting since mid-2024 for services that were promised within six months.\n\nA Program Mired in Contradictions\n\nWalker admitted during the meeting that two COS documents lacked certificate numbers and were provided via videos supposedly showing their issuance on a portal. However, under sustained questioning, she conceded that no checks were made with the Home Office to verify the authenticity of these documents.\n\nDespite claiming to have performed thorough checks, Walker repeatedly asked for basic verification information, including the Home Office contact details  exposing an absence of due diligence in a system where candidates pay thousands for UK work opportunities.\n\nMounting Red Flags\n\nThe program, originally marketed as a streamlined six-month pathway to employment, has now extended to nearly 10 months for many. More troubling, the justification for delays  such as a mandatory training requirement before COS issuance  was debunked by industry experts as not being a legal prerequisite for certificate allocation.\n\nIn another alarming contradiction, Walker offered refunds to affected agents while still insisting during the meeting that she was unaware of the documents being counterfeit  raising serious questions about prior knowledge and transparency.\n\nFinancial Exploitation\n\nEvidence reveals that candidates were charged up to 4,000 each, with Walkers organization allegedly pocketing 1,000 per individual while agents retained the remainder. However, no clear communication was made to the candidates about this split, contributing to widespread confusion and dissatisfaction.\n\nInternational candidates, including many from Africa and Asia, were promised one-month turnaround times for COS issuance. Yet some have now been waiting up to five months, with no concrete progress  fueling suspicions of systemic failure or worse, deliberate deception.\n\nIndustry Reaction\n\nThis is textbook negligence, said a veteran investigative journalist specializing in immigration scams. Basic verification steps were ignored. Instead, candidates were given excuses and left hanging for months, despite having paid large sums.\n\nZimEye also noted that Walkers reliance on unverifiable videos instead of using standard Home Office verification procedures shows a reckless disregard for best practices.\n\nRefund Promises Amid Fallout\n\nWalker has now promised refunds within seven days after intense pressure from ZimEye and affected parties. However, there is growing skepticism in the community. Many candidates fear that their hard-earned money will not be fully recovered, given the multiple intermediaries involved and Walkers shifting explanations.\n\nCommunity advocates have called on authorities to investigate the scheme, citing concerns that this could be part of a larger pattern of exploitation targeting vulnerable job seekers abroad.\n\nWhats Next?\n\nWhile Walker has agreed to return funds to her clients, there is still uncertainty surrounding the total number of candidates affected and whether full accountability will be enforced.\n\nAs this story develops, the spotlight now shifts to both UK regulators and the Home Office to address mounting calls for tighter oversight of sponsorship schemes and recruitment practices that prey on foreign workers desperate for employment.\n\nIf you or someone you know has been affected by this scheme or others like it, contact [news outlet contact] for confidential assistance.\n\n",

            "content": "Distracted driving has become one of the most significant threats to road safety in recent years. It only takes a mere five seconds to look away from the road  whether its to read a text, search for a phone number, adjust your cars music or GPS, or pick up something thats fallen  but those five seconds can be deadly. In fact, that short moment of distraction can make the difference between a safe journey and a devastating crash.\n\nWhile it might seem harmless to glance at your phone or fiddle with the radio for a moment, the consequences can be catastrophic. A vehicle moving at just 55 miles per hour travels the length of a football field in five seconds  a dangerous amount of time when youre not focused on the road. Those precious seconds can lead to fatal accidents, leaving you, your passengers, and others on the road in harms way.\n\nEvery moment you spend driving is critical to the safety of everyone around you. It may feel like a small, insignificant distraction, but it can easily result in tragic outcomes. Consider the devastating impact an accident can have on your life and the lives of your loved ones. A crash could leave you struggling in a hospital bed, confined to a wheelchair, or worse, it could end your life. More importantly, it could leave your family in grief and financial turmoil, forever haunted by the absence of your presence.\n\nThink about the effort you put into providing for your family. Imagine how your loved ones would cope without you. Your children may have to drop out of school, and your spouse may struggle to make ends meet. These are the harsh realities of distracted driving that we often fail to acknowledge. A momentary lapse in concentration could change everything for your family, and the consequences are often far-reaching.\n\nThe message is clear: every second behind the wheel is crucial. Never let a moment of distraction cost you everything. Stay focused, drive safely, and keep the ones you love safe. Your family needs you  dont let a few seconds of distraction jeopardize their future.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",
