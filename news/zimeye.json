            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nA joyous occasion in Liverpool quickly turned into a scene of chaos and horror as a car ploughed into a crowd of celebrating football fans during Liverpool FCs Premier League victory parade. The incident, which occurred around 6pm on Monday, has left 65 people injured11 of whom remain hospitalizedprompting a major police investigation and widespread public concern.\n\nMerseyside Police confirmed the arrest of a 53-year-old man from West Derby on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving, and drug-driving. He remains in custody and is being questioned by detectives. The suspect is believed to have tailgated an ambulance onto Water Street after security barriers were momentarily lifted to allow emergency responders through to aid a man suffering a suspected heart attack.\n\nThe temporary removal of the robust traffic controls in place for the parade has raised serious questions, with Liverpool Mayor Steve Rotheram calling for an urgent review of how the vehicle was able to access a restricted area teeming with fans.\n\nEyewitness accounts depict a terrifying moment. Fan Alex Todd, who was near the crash site, described the chaos as people surged into nearby businesses for safety. My little sister burst into tearsshe had been only a few metres from the car, he said.\n\nFour children were among those injured. The governments Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) has opened access for victims to apply for support under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2012.\n\nPolice have launched a comprehensive investigation, including reviewing CCTV footage and speaking with numerous witnesses and emergency responders. Detective Chief Superintendent Karen Jaundrill said, We are trying to get a full picture of exactly what happened.\n\nThe swift response of Merseyside Police and the North Western Ambulance Service has been widely praised. Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Simms commended emergency workers for running toward the danger to assist the injured. Their bravery and quick action undoubtedly prevented a more tragic outcome, she said.\n\nThe incident is not being treated as terrorism. However, it has prompted a complete step change in how police share information with the public, according to experts, drawing comparisons to previous criticisms around communication following other major incidents in the region.\n\nAs investigations continue, the community of Liverpooland the broader football worldremain united in shock and support. Former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard expressed his sentiments, saying he was shocked, sickened and saddened by what transpired.\n\nWith the city still reeling, the focus now turns to accountability, recovery, and ensuring such a tragedy does not happen again during public celebrations.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent -A storm is brewing at Ndarama High School after its headmaster, Oddy Matongo, came under fire for accepting a furniture donation from Masvingo Urban MP Advocate Martin Mureri, a member of the opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC).\n\nWhile the donation  40 chairs and 40 desks sourced through the Constituency Development Fund (CDF)  was well-received by staff and students during a handover ceremony last week, sources at the school say senior ZANU PF officials in the province were enraged by the move.\n\nThe backlash, insiders reveal, has created tension between the school administration and ruling party figures, who reportedly claim the gesture undermines political protocol.\n\nThere is pressure from ZANU PF officials who feel the school has crossed a line by accepting help from an opposition MP without prior clearance. They are accusing the headmaster of promoting a political agenda, said a staff member at Ndarama who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal.\n\nThe donation followed an appeal by Matongo to the legislator, citing a critical shortage of desks that had left several students learning while seated on the floor. Mureri, speaking at the event, promised to provide an additional 14 chairs to cover the remaining shortfall.\n\nWe are here to serve our communities. Education should never be a victim of differences. Ndarama High School is well-known for excellence, Mureri said at the ceremony, which was attended by Deputy Mayor Daniel Mberikunashe and school development committee members.\n\nDespite this, school sources say the backlash from local political heavyweights has been swift and unforgiving, with attempts allegedly being made to summon Matongo for a disciplinary hearing and threats of administrative interference now looming.\n\nThis has become a political minefield, said a teacher at the school. We just want support for our learners, no matter where it comes from. But now the head is being treated like he committed a crime.\n\nEducation analysts have criticised the politicisation of development efforts in schools, arguing that such donations should be welcomed regardless of the donors political affiliation.\n\nIts disappointing to see education being weaponised, said one education policy expert.\n\nWe should be celebrating leaders who respond to community needs, not punishing them.\n\nFor now, the furniture remains in use at Ndarama High  but the controversy it sparked underscores the delicate balancing act educators must navigate in Zimbabwes highly politicised public sector.\n\n",

She struck Mativenga with a log on the head and bit her under the chin before Masuku intervened to stop the assault. In the struggle that followed, Moyo turned on Masuku, striking him with the same log and fatally stabbing him in the back with a kitchen knife.\n\nRealising the gravity of her actions, Moyo reportedly tried to revive her husband and later threatened to attack Mativenga again.\n\nDuring the trial, Moyo claimed the stabbing occurred during a physical struggle and was not premeditated.\n\nThe matter was reported to police, and Masukus body was taken to Mwenezi District Hospital.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Zimbabwe Teachers Association (ZIMTA), the countrys oldest and once most influential teachers union, is facing growing dissatisfaction from educators who accuse it of being aligned with the ruling regime and failing to champion their plight.\n\nAcross the education sector, many teachers are reportedly cutting ties with the union, citing its perceived failure to fight for fair salaries and better working conditions, despite consistently deducting monthly union dues from their salaries.\n\nEducators argue that ZIMTA has grown increasingly detached from the realities faced by its members, accusing its leadership of living comfortably off union subscriptions while ordinary teachers remain trapped in poverty.\n\nThe growing sentiment is that the union has lost its independence and is no longer a credible voice for the teaching profession.\n\nMany teachers are now encouraging one another to terminate their membership and halt salary deductions to the union, using publicly available links shared via social media platforms to opt out.\n\nThey say its no longer viable to continue funding an organisation they believe has become ineffective and compromised.\n\nWere tired of feeding a system that doesnt serve us, said one teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity. We are better off using that money to buy basics rather than funding leaders who are silent while we starve.\n\nWhile ZIMTA has publicly denied the allegations of being captured or losing members en masse, insisting that any claims of mass resignations are driven by social media misinformation, the mood among teachers tells a different story.\n\nEducators are also expressing mounting frustration over their stagnant salaries, which remain far below the pre-2018 levels when they were earning around US$540 per month. With current earnings severely eroded by inflation and the depreciating local currency, many teachers now say industrial action is inevitable.\n\nPlans for a large-scale strike are reportedly gaining traction, with teachers threatening to paralyse the education sector until their demands are addressed.\n\nIf nothing changes soon, we are ready to shut down schools. This is no longer just about salariesits about restoring dignity to the teaching profession, said another teacher.\n\nShould the planned job action proceed, it could cause major disruptions to the school calendar and negatively affect student performance and national exam pass rates, further deepening the crisis in Zimbabwes education system.\n\n",
