            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri The City of Harare has moved to remove street vendors selling roasted maize and street children from public spaces, citing concerns over sanitation and public safety.\n\nAuthorities this week said the activities were contributing to littered streets and blocked drainage systems, increasing the risk of flooding during heavy rains.\n\nA city official emphasized the need for decisive action. We have to take action, he said. Our priority is to clean up the city and restore order in every part of the Central Business District.\n\nHe highlighted the dangers posed by the way maize cobs were being stored. We cannot allow people to continue selling roasted maize while blocking drainage systems. Some vendors are even keeping their maize in storm drains, which creates a serious health hazard for residents, he explained.\n\nThe official also appealed to the public to cooperate. We urge residents to avoid buying from these street vendors, as the storage conditions are unsafe and could pose risks to the community, he added.\n\nThe city confirmed that similar operations would continue as part of ongoing efforts to maintain cleanliness and ensure public safety in Harare.\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri Auxillia Mnangagwa has come under criticism following a health expo held on Friday at Maria Theresa Clinic in Kakora Village, Mashonaland Central Province, with detractors dismissing the event as a cosmetic exercise that fails to address deep-rooted problems in rural healthcare.\n\nThe First Lady, who attended the expo in her capacity as Health and Child Care Ambassador, praised the large turnout and urged communities to embrace regular health screenings, early detection and preventative care. However, critics argue that such messages offer little comfort to villagers who continue to rely on under-resourced clinics.\n\nResidents say the reality on the ground sharply contrasts with the speeches delivered at the event, as many rural health facilities struggle with chronic shortages of medicines, basic equipment and trained personnel.\n\nTalking about prevention does not help when the clinic has no drugs and patients are turned away, said one villager, who described the expo as a one-day spectacle disconnected from everyday hardships.\n\nObservers also questioned the emphasis on holistic healthcare approaches, noting that rural communities still face long distances to health centres, poor infrastructure and limited emergency services.\n\nCivic groups argue that high-profile health expos have become symbolic gestures that generate publicity but fail to deliver lasting solutions. They say genuine commitment to improving healthcare would be reflected in sustained funding, improved working conditions for health workers and the rehabilitation of rural clinics.\n\nAs the event concluded and officials departed, many in Kakora were left wondering whether the expo would lead to meaningful change or simply add to a growing list of well-publicised events that leave Zimbabwes rural health challenges unresolved.\n\nAuxillia Mnangagwa\n\n",

Tobaiwa was advocating for increased funding for maternal health, arguing that current allocations were inadequate. She said:\n\nI think regarding maternal health, why cant we have a standalone budget for it? We hear of free maternal health, which doesnt exist, and then our mothers face challenges in giving birth due to these issues.\n\nWhile she was speaking, a ZANU PF MP interrupted, making a personal remark about her mother that immediately drew outrage.\n\nYou cannot bring my mother into this discussion. My mother is not in Parliament, and if you have an issue, you can confront me, not my mother. That is wrong, Tobaiwa responded firmly.\n\nThe comment sparked uproar among MPs, with calls for an apology and suggestions that breathalysers be used as some members appeared intoxicated. Several legislators condemned the conduct, pointing out that the treatment of women in the chamber was unacceptable.\n\nThe Acting Speaker stepped in, visibly frustrated, reminding the house that while all members are adults, certain remarks crossed the line.\n\nZanu PF \n\n",

            "url": "https://www.zimeye.net/2025/12/13/police-boss-admits-taking-bribes/",
            "content": "By Crime and Courts Reporter-Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) Commissioner-GeneralStephen Mutambahas publicly admitted that police officersparticularly traffic officersare routinely taking bribes from motorists, a rare acknowledgment that comes against a long and troubled history of police brutality, corruption, and anti-citizen conduct in Zimbabwe.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the rebrandedZRP National Highway Patrol, Comm-Gen Mutamba appealed to motorists to refuse paying bribes and to report corrupt officers, arguing that citizens who pay bribes are complicit in criminal activity.\n\nRefuse to pay bribes. Remember, by doing so, you are complicit in the crime, Mutamba said.Report any corrupt or suspicious behaviour to your nearest police station.\n\nHis remarks come amid persistent public anger over the conduct of traffic police, who for years have been accused of turning roadblocks into informal tollgates through extortion, harassment, and intimidation. Civil society organisations, commuter groups, and transport operators have consistently reported that officers demand cash, groceries, fuel, or mobile money transfersoften without issuing tickets or citing offences.\n\nBeyond bribery, the ZRP has faced sustained criticism for excessive force, political policing, and systemic corruption, particularly since the early 2000s. Police have repeatedly been accused of violently dispersing peaceful protests, assaulting civilians, conducting politically motivated arrests, and shielding ruling-party activists from accountability. Human rights organisations have documented cases of baton beatings, tear gas use, dog attacks, and live ammunition being deployed against unarmed citizens, while internal accountability for such abuses has remained limited.\n\nTraffic policing has become one of the most visible symbols of everyday state abuse, with motorists frequently forced to choose between paying bribes or facing delays, vehicle impoundment, or further harassment. Despite repeated promises of reform by successive police leaderships, corruption at roadblocks has remained entrenched.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Mutamba unveiledfive high-powered double-cab Ford Ranger vehiclesfor the National Highway Patrol, which will be deployed nationwide during the festive season and beyond to enhance road safety. Each vehicle will be staffed by officers equipped withbody-worn cameras, which police say form part of a broader electronic traffic management system intended to promote accountability and safer roads.\n\nPlease utilise these new National Highway Patrol vehicles to make reports whenever you encounter our teams on the roads, Mutamba said.\n\nIn his2025 Festive Season statement on crime and road safety, Mutamba said police would intensify operations as travel and socio-economic activity increase during the holidays. He said officers have been deployed nationwide to set up roadblocks, conduct traffic blitzes, and carry out stop-and-search operations, with motorised, foot, and cycle patrols intensified in central business districts, residential areas, industrial zones, and leisure centres.\n\nHe also announced a crackdown on liquor outlets operating outside the times stipulated on their licences and warned that police would intensify operations against smuggling and other illicit activities, urging transporters to declare all goods at official ports of entry and exit.\n\nMutamba reminded Zimbabweans that road safety was a collective responsibility, urging motorists to minimise night travel due to poor visibility and the high incidence of fatal accidents, and cautioning drivers against offering lifts to strangers.\n\nWhile the commissioner-generals admission of bribery marks an unusual moment of candour, public scepticism remains deep. Critics argue that corruption and brutality within the police force are systemic rather than incidental, and that meaningful reform will only be demonstrated through visible arrests of corrupt officers, accountability for past abuses, and an end to the routine harassment of ordinary citizens on Zimbabwes roads.\n\n",

            "content": "By Showbiz Reporter-Nicholas Madzibaba Zakaria, the revered sungura maestro whose disciplined artistry and extraordinary mentorship shaped Zimbabwean music for nearly five decades, has died. He was 69.\n\nZakaria passed away on Thursday morning after a long struggle with diabetes, hypertension and chronic muscle cramps that had increasingly limited his mobility. His family described him as a gifted musician whose influence transformed Zimbabwean music and inspired generations. He will be buried in Chiweshe this Sunday.\n\nFrom grooming legends such as Alick Macheso, Cephas Karushanga, System Tazvida, Silas Chakanyuka and Aaron Chinamira, to supporting dozens of emerging artists, Zakaria stood at the centre of sunguras most important lineage. His musical fingerprint stretches across generations, carried by protgs like bassist Simon Mutambi and many others whose careers he quietly shaped.\n\nBorn in 1956 at Belgownie Estate in Mazowe, Mashonaland Central, Zakaria discovered his gift almost by accident. After dropping out of school in Grade Seven, he found himself idle  until the guitar drew him in. His father, who played a box guitar at local beer gatherings, forbade him from touching the instrument. But the young Zakaria would sneak it away while his father worked in the fields, teaching himself to play in secret. His mother eventually revealed his hidden talent, and his fathers initial anger gave way to reluctant acceptance.\n\nIn a recent interview, Zakaria recalled how crippling shyness kept him from performing in public. I preferred to practice at home, he said. My father played at beer binges, but I felt embarrassed by the crowds. Yet as he honed his craft, neighbours began gathering to listen. Impressed by his skill, the estate owner bought a public address system so Zakaria could perform for larger audiences.\n\nAt 19, he formed his first band, The Green Mangoes, with the late Robson Kaitano in 1975. They played at local shops and surrounding farms, becoming popular across Mazowe. When Zakaria later moved to Harare, he left the Green Mangoes behind and joined Vhuka Boys around 1980  a move that set the stage for his defining musical influence.\n\nIn 1984, Zakaria co-founded the iconic Khiama Boys with Shepherd Chinyani and Tineyi Chikupo. The group would become one of the most influential institutions in Zimbabwean music, nurturing future giants such as Alick Macheso, System Tazvida, Cephas Karushanga, Zakaria Zakaria, Donald Gogo and others. Their disciplined rehearsals, technical precision and refined sungura arrangements produced classics likeMabhauwa,Paida Mwoyo,Muzhinji,Kuvhiyiwa,Ndire Ndire,Kusiya VaviriandTsaona.\n\nThe runaway success ofMabhauwain 1989, however, triggered well-known internal tensions. Several band members left to form their own groups, including Macheso, who established Orchestra Mberikwazvo in 1997 and rose to national stardom. Zakaria, undeterred, worked as a haulage truck driver to support his family and save money for new instruments. By 2002, he had revived Khiama Boys and began releasing new music.\n\nHis catalogue is vast and influential, including hits such asMabvi Nemagokora,Chikumbiro,Mazano,Tsamba,Ida Anokuda,Zomvelamvela,Zvipo Zvevanhu,Pfuma Yenhaka,Special Brew,Zvese Mari,Ruvhu RwevhuandPanorwadza Moyo. Few Zimbabwean musicians sustained relevance across as many eras, and fewer still produced so many protgs who shaped the direction of a genre.\n\nZakarias final years were marked by health challenges and financial strain. Earlier this year, he was gifted a Toyota Fortuner by businessman Wicknell Chivayo after a misunderstanding involving a viral video. Zakaria later clarified he had not been asking for help but merely promoting a mechanics workshop.\n\nDeeply rooted in spiritual life, Zakaria was originally associated with the Mugodhi Apostolic sect before joining Prophet Walter Magayas PHD Ministries in 2014.\n\nHe was married to Margaret Gweshe  herself a former Khiama Boys dancer  and together they had two children, Rudo and Simba. In 2008, the family suffered a devastating loss when Simba died by suicide after a long illness, a tragedy that left a profound mark on him.\n\nWith his passing, Zimbabwe loses not only a musical giant but also one of its most influential cultural architects. Nicholas Zakarias patient teaching, disciplined artistry, and unmistakable guitar work built the foundations of modern sungura. His protgs carried the genre into new eras, and his sound remains an essential pillar of Zimbabwean identity.\n\nHis legacy will continue to resonate wherever sungura is played  in rehearsal rooms, at growth points, on long rural bus rides, and in the hearts of the many musicians who trace their origins to the Senior Lecturer.\n\n",
