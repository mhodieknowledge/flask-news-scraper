            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Super Eagles of Nigeria are gearing up to take on the Warriors of Zimbabwe in a crucial Group C clash of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers on Tuesday. As the team prepares to face their opponents, coach Eric Chelle is expected to stick with his tried-and-tested 4-4-2 diamond shape, with a few tweaks in personnel.\n\nIn goal, Stanley Nwabali is expected to retain his place, having had a comfortable outing against Rwanda in the previous match. The backline is also expected to remain largely unchanged, with William Troost-Ekong, Calvin Bassey, Ola Aina, and Bruno Onyemaechi forming the defensive quartet. However, Bright Osayi-Samuels fitness will be monitored, and if he fails to recover in time, Onyemaechi will slot in, with Aina shifting to his natural right-back role.\n\nIn midfield, Chelle may opt for a tactical switch, given the struggles of some players to interpret their roles against Rwanda. Alex Iwobi and Wilfred Ndidi are expected to form the central midfield pairing, with Raphael Onyedika potentially coming in for Samuel Chukwueze. Onyedikas introduction would allow Ndidi to play in a more advanced role, while Iwobi continues to provide creativity from deep. Ademola Lookman is expected to play behind the two strikers, providing pace and width to the attack.\n\nUp front, Moses Simon and Victor Osimhen are expected to lead the line, providing a potent attacking threat to the Zimbabwean defense. With the Super Eagles targeting maximum points against the Warriors, Chelles tactical decisions will be crucial in determining the outcome of the match.\n\nAs the Super Eagles take to the pitch on Tuesday, they will be looking to build on their impressive performance against Rwanda and take a significant step towards qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nWith the Warriors seeking to cause an upset, the stage is set for an electrifying clash between two teams hungry for victory.\n\n",

            "content": "When walking along the road, it is crucial to prioritize your safety by always walking facing oncoming vehicles. By doing so, you enhance your ability to see approaching traffic and stay aware of your surroundings, relying on both your sight and hearing to assess potential dangers. This simple precaution allows you to step aside or into a safe area, such as a ditch, if a vehicle unexpectedly loses control.\n\nWalking with your back to traffic, on the other hand, puts you in a vulnerable position. In such a scenario, you would have to rely only on your ears to detect a vehicle approaching from behind, which can be risky. A driver may unintentionally hit you without you being aware of their presence, especially if they are speeding or driving too close to the edge of the road.\n\nAdditionally, to avoid the dangers of distracted walking, always keep your focus on the road ahead rather than on your mobile phone. While listening to music or podcasts can make your walk more enjoyable, it can be risky if it prevents you from hearing nearby vehicles. A simple solution is to keep one earphone out, ensuring you can still listen for approaching cars while enjoying your walk.\n\nWhile walking facing oncoming traffic is generally the safest option, its important to note that some areas, such as hills or sharp curves, may make this practice dangerous. In such areas, visibility is limited, and both you and oncoming vehicles may not see each other until its too late. In these situations, walking on the opposite side of the road might be the safer choice.\n\nBy staying alert, walking facing traffic, and avoiding distractions, you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and ensure a safer walking experience.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

Since she was new to Harare and had been recommended for the job by the accuseds older brother, she initially stayed at Mangwendezas residence.\n\nThe alleged victim stated that two days after her arrival from Victoria Falls, Mangwendeza traveled to the United Kingdom for a 10-day visit. Upon his return, she claims the abuse began, alleging that he would force himself on her at night, often after returning home intoxicated.\n\nFeeling isolated and with no one to turn to, she endured the ordeal in silence until January this year when she confided in the person who had secured her the job. A confrontation ensued between that person and Mangwendeza, after which a police report was filed.\n\nThe case was initially reviewed by prosecutors in Domboshava before being referred to Harare. On March 12, during a hearing at the Rotten Row Magistrates Court, it was determined that the matter would proceed to a full trial on March 26.\n\n",

However, the high number of stolen transformerstotaling 6,000has raised concerns about the effectiveness of security measures and the governments ability to prevent such acts of vandalism.\n\nIn his remarks, Moyo did not elaborate on specific measures being taken to address the ongoing issue of transformer theft or to resolve the wider power crisis. As Zimbabweans continue to struggle with unreliable power supply, many are questioning whether the governments response is adequate or merely an excuse to deflect from more pressing issues in the energy sector.\n\n",

He led the assembly in affirmations, stating, We believe in the divine destiny of our nation, and in the fulfillment of Gods promises for Zimbabwe.\n\nReflecting on the nations history, Wutawunashe recounted the sacrifices made by figures such as President Mnangagwa during Zimbabwes liberation struggle.\n\nHe shared the story of Mnangagwas near-death experience at a young age, emphasizing his commitment to the nations freedom and ongoing development.

ZIMCHE has identified several unregistered institutions engaged in these illegal practices and has issued closure orders to halt their operations. Unfortunately, some institutions continue to defy the law, enrolling students and issuing fraudulent degrees.\n\nOf particular concern is the misuse of these fraudulent qualifications, as well as the use of false titles such as Professor or Doctor by officials from these unregistered institutions and the recipients of these degrees. This includes unsuspecting members of the public who are deceived into paying for these false qualifications, as well as individuals who knowingly participate in this academic fraud.\n\nAs the regulatory body mandated by The ZIMCHE Act [Chapter 25:27], ZIMCHE is committed to preserving the standards, quality, and credibility of Zimbabwes higher education system. Unregistered institutions are hereby unequivocally warned to cease their operations immediately, withdraw all fraudulent qualifications, and stop issuing or conferring any degrees, including purportedly earned and honorary Ph.Ds. Recipients of these fraudulent qualifications and false titles are strongly urged to stop using them, as they could face legal consequences, including civil and criminal prosecution.\n\nTo protect stakeholders, including students, employers, and the public, ZIMCHE has launched investigations into these unlawful activities. Appropriate legal action will be taken against both unregistered institutions and individuals found complicit in academic fraud.\n\nMembers of the public are encouraged to verify the accreditation status of any institution with ZIMCHE before enrolling in any programs. Employers should also authenticate the qualifications of prospective employees with ZIMCHE. Public vigilance is essential, as some unregistered institutions frequently change locations to avoid detection. Additionally, some of these institutions are not owned by Zimbabweans, while others falsely claim affiliations with dubious international universities that lack proper accreditation in their home countries.\n\nZIMCHE remains steadfast in its commitment to maintaining the integrity and quality of Zimbabwes higher education system. The organization is intensifying efforts to ensure that only accredited institutions are allowed to operate within Zimbabwe, safeguarding the high standards that have been built over decades.\n\nFor further inquiries, please contact ZIMCHE through the following channels:Tel: +2638677009649Email:[emailprotected]Website: www.zimche.ac.zw\n\nZIMCHE remains dedicated to protecting the integrity and credibility of Zimbabwes higher education system.\n\nZIMBABWE COUNCIL FOR HIGHER EDUCATIONwww.zimche.ac.zwQuality Assurance in Higher EducationEmail:[emailprotected]319 Harben Chiron Avenue, Murwo, BEL\n\n",
