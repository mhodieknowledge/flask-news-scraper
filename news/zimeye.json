But soon after, chaos erupted.\n\nOne faction disputed the results, claiming the elections hadbeen postponedandthat thevoteswere countedat an unsanctioned venue.\n\nAllegations of forged signatures and procedural violationsswirled,as rival camps accused each other of manipulation.\n\nThe meeting wascancelled,said a party insider,but the other faction went ahead at an unknown location. Later, it returned to the Manicaland party offices in Mutare. There is real fighting in thewomensleague. Chinomona supports Mabika, while Monica Mutsvangwa supports Sacco. Now Chris [Mutsvangwa] is fighting in hiswifescorner.\n\nThe fallout escalated when Muswere, reportedly following routinegovernment-mediapractice, authorized the coverage of the results.\n\nThis,inMutsvangwaseyes, was a betrayalnot ofprotocol,but of hisfamilyspolitical interests.\n\nMutsvangwasletter to Muswere was heavy-handed, and observers say it exposed the Zanu PFspokespersonsbully-boy tactics.\n\nRather than resolve the issue through internal dialogue, Mutsvangwa publicly humiliated Muswere and wielded his role as spokesperson like a weapon.\n\nHestrying to reassert himself, not just as a communications head but as a powercentrein the party,a senior Zanu PF official confided.The letter was a warning shotnot just to Muswere but to anyone seen asMnangagwasrising star.\n\nIndeed, Jenfan Muswere, the youthful Information Minister and Zanu PF MP forMakoni,is widely seen as a protg of President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nMany perceive his growing influence, especially in managing state media narratives, as part ofMnangagwasbroader strategy to groom loyalists who can eventually replace the old guard.\n\nAnd this, more than anything else, seems to have irked Mutsvangwa.\n\nOnce a close ally of Mnangagwa, Mutsvangwa played a pivotal role in the 2017 military coup that ousted Robert Mugabe and elevated Mnangagwa to the presidency.\n\nBut that alliance has soured.\n\nAs Mnangagwa begins to edge out aging war veterans and consolidate power around a younger cohortincludingthe likes ofMuswereMutsvangwa has grown more aggressive and erratic.\n\nSome insiders believe heharboursambitions of his own and is using his party post to build a base, especially among disgruntled war veterans andsections of the elitefrustrated withMnangagwasincreasingly authoritarian rule.\n\nMutsvangwa sees himself as a natural successor,said another source.He thinks he has the liberation credentials, the charisma, and the networks. But Mnangagwa is not about to hand over the reins.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire arelongstanding personalrumoursthat continue to dog both camps.\n\nWhispers within party corridors suggest that Monica Mutsvangwa once had a romantic relationship with Mnangagwa, a liaisonthat allegedlyproduceda child.\n\nThough unsubstantiated and widely dismissed as political gossip, therumourhas persistedrevived every time the two camps clash.\n\nThisrumour, while salacious, underscores thedeeplypersonal nature of the political battles within Zanu PF.\n\nIn a party where family ties, factional alliances, and state power often overlap, such scandals are not mere distractionsthey areweapons.\n\nAt its heart, the Mutsvangwa-Muswere clash is about control: control of the media, control of party processes, and control of the post-Mnangagwa succession narrative.\n\nAsthe party gears up for a potentially explosive elective congress, the battle lines are becoming clearer.\n\nMutsvangwa,longand loudest voice in the room,is flexinghis muscles to reassert dominance.\n\nBut Muswere, backed by the full weight of the presidency, is no pushover.\n\nThis is no longer about protocol or press statements,the senior Zanu PF official added.Itsabout who controls the future of the partyand who gets left behind.\n\n",

The German side dominated the early stages, with Harry Kane hitting the post, but Inters first shot on target proved decisive.\n\nA beautifully crafted team goal in the 38th minute gave the Serie A leaders the advantage. Marcus Thurams impressive flick set up Lautaro Martinez, who expertly finished with the outside of his boot.\n\nHowever, Bayerns experience told, and Thomas Muller equalized in the 85th minute, sparking hopes of a comeback. The veteran striker, who will leave the club this summer after 25 years, capitalized on a low cross from Konrad Laimer.\n\nYet, Inters determination paid off in the final minutes. A swift counter-attack led to Carlos Augustos cross being converted by Davide Frattesi, securing a vital win for the visitors.\n\nThe defeat marked the end of Bayerns 22-match unbeaten home run in the Champions League, which dated back to 2021. The second leg at the San Siro will take place on April 16, with the winner advancing to face either Barcelona or Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals.\n\nThe Champions League final will be held at Bayerns Allianz Arena on May 31.\n\n",

Rather than the polished image expected of heads of state, both appeared in strikingly oversized clothingMuseveni in a billowing white shirt that could double as a tent, and Mnangagwa in what looked like a weary black winter suit two sizes too big, accessorized with a gaudy, rainbow-coloured scarf more suited for a blizzard than the 26C Ugandan heat.\n\nThis is not just a fashion misstep. Presidential dress is deeply symbolicit communicates authority, dignity, and the state of governance. Instead, these two leaders communicated confusion, detachment, and an almost careless disregard for their public image.\n\nMusevenis shirtunstructured, almost collapsing around himevokes the image of a ruler past his prime, cloaking the body politic in something too loose to support it. His iconic hat and casual demeanor suggest a man long ensconced in power, uninterested in appearances, certain his authority is unchallengeable. Yet the effect is more ghostly than groundedan emperor refusing to admit his empire is fraying.\n\nMnangagwa, by contrast, looked like hed been hurriedly pulled out of a dusty closet and into the spotlight. His stiff, dark, oddly wintery ensemble clashed absurdly with the climate and the occasion. The scarfassociated with Zimbabwean nationalismhung awkwardly, as if trying to assert pride in a body politic thats visibly unraveling. Most jarring of all, he looked as though he needed a bathhis appearance not just unkempt, but actively uncomfortable to look at. It read less as patriotic flair and more as a performative costume worn by a man uncertain of his place on the global stage. His entire presence was an unintentional metaphor for the Zimbabwean state: out of place, ill-fitting, and sweatily clinging to borrowed authority.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nClothes are often a regimes soft propagandathink of Nkrumahs sharply tailored suits, Sankaras fatigues, or Kagames minimalist urbanism. Mnangagwa and Museveni, once liberation icons, now appear like rulers in retreat, dressed in dissonant shadows of their former selves. The oversized clothes arent just garments; they are costumes of men burdened by the bloated weight of their decades-long rule, awkwardly trying to fit into a post-liberation era they no longer understand.\n\nAt a time when both countries face deep economic and democratic crises, the attire reflects something more damning: not just sartorial misjudgment, but symbolic disorientation. Power without purpose. Rule without reflection. Prestige, like their tailoring, falling apart at the seams.\n\n",

In what bears the hallmarks of a desperate bribe to stave off accountability, Harare City Councils Mabelreign District Office has confirmed the quiet but coordinated arrival of nearly 80 Members of Parliament  each allegedly poised to receive free residential stands.\n\nNation now needs a full-blast-month-Chimurenga of a mass stay away to restore the rule of law\n\nThis covert scheme, which unfolds in the shadow of Gezas explosive March 31st protest, points to a broader pattern of illicit enrichment and state capture. Sources on the ground describe a parade of official vehicles entering Mabelreign, with the silence of implicated institutions  from the City Council to the Department of Housing  amplifying the stench of corruption. It is widely believed that this mass handout of land is a backdoor maneuver engineered by Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda, who himself faces allegations of war crimes following a ZimEye expos in Serbia.\n\nWith no comment from key offices and mounting evidence of institutional decay, the implications are profound: the Geza Movement is not only shaking the system  it is exposing the rot beneath it.

            "content": "By A Correspondent| A state-of-the-art smart market is set to be officially opened to the public in Mbare on Friday in a move that is set to transform the citys commercial landcape.\n\nThe smart and modern trading facility is designed to improve hygiene, security and convenience for vendors and customers alike.\n\nThe new Mbare Musika market boasts of advanced amenities aimed at addressing long-standing challenges faced by informal traders in the area.\n\nThis redevelopment signals not only a facelift of the countrys busiest market but a broader shift in Zimbabwes approach to urban infrastructure and informal trade.\n\nHistorically, Mbare Musika has served as a vital economic artery for Zimbabwe, functioning as a distribution hub for fresh produce and goods from across the country. Despite its centrality to livelihoods, the market had become notorious for its chaotic environment, poor sanitation, overcrowding, and security challenges. The markets infrastructure was dilapidated, and its thousands of vendors operated in unsafe, unhygienic conditions.\n\nThese longstanding issues came to a head in April 2023, when a devastating fire reduced large parts of the bustling market to ashes. The blaze destroyed vendor stalls and goods worth millions of dollars, affecting nearly 4,700 traders and prompting President Mnangagwa to declare a state of disaster. At the time, the President described the tragedy as a severe setback for our hardworking vendors and pledged swift government intervention to restore the critical trading center.\n\nIn response, a comprehensive reconstruction project commenced in November 2024, resulting in a three-story, state-of-the-art Smart Market facility. Local Government Minister Daniel Garwe hailed the development as a milestone in urban development, emphasizing its role in formalizing informal trade.\n\nThis Smart Market is proof of the governments commitment to improving the working conditions of our people, Garwe said. With proper sanitation, security, and financial support systems, we are empowering vendors to operate in a dignified and sustainable environment.\n\nContrary to social media reports, rentals have been set at an affordable $120 per month, making the space accessible to local entrepreneurs. The facility is designed to accommodate at least 10,000 vendorsmore than double its previous capacityhighlighting the governments intent to accommodate the growing informal sector.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume said the revamped facility would bring much-needed order and efficiency to Mbare Musika, which has historically struggled with mismanagement and neglect.\n\nFor years, vendors have struggled with inadequate facilities, but this Smart Market changes that. With reliable water supply, clean toilets, waste management, and CCTV surveillance, we are setting a new standard for markets in Zimbabwe, Mafume said.\n\nThe new market comes equipped with several transformative features including boreholes providing 120,000 liters of water daily, CCTV cameras, a modern waste management system, secure parking and washing bay for all products among others.\n\nThe Smart Market has drawn praise beyond Zimbabwes borders, with South African opposition leader Julius Malema, known for his pan-Africanist ideology, commending the initiative.\n\nThis is the kind of progressive urban development Africa needs, Malema said. When governments invest in proper infrastructure for informal traders, theyre not just building marketstheyre building dignity, economic stability, and true economic freedom for the people.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues to grapple with urbanization, economic instability, and the vast influence of informal trade, the transformation of Mbare Musika stands as a powerful example of what is possible when infrastructure meets intention.\n\n",
