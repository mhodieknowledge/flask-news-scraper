            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Environmental Management Agency (EMA) has temporarily shut down Ran Mine in Bindura following the discovery of cyanide traces in the water supply of Chipadze suburb. This contamination resulted from a water spillage on Thursday from the mines slime dam, raising serious concerns about public health.\n\nThe shutdown is intended to give authorities more time to address the environmental and health risks posed by the spillage, which has not only affected the local water supply but also led to the death of fish in Pote River and Arcadia dams.\n\nMaxwell Mupotsa, EMAs Provincial Environment and Publicity Officer, explained the agencys findings: Our laboratory analysis from Thursday up to today has been sampling boreholes and streams close to Mushambanhaka into Pote River, where there are reports of fish dying. We found that there are traces of cyanide in the area as well as clusters in Chipadze. We ordered them to stop operations and focus mainly on this health hazard.\n\nThe mines temporary closure follows a meeting of the Bindura Civil Protection Unit on Wednesday, which reviewed the laboratory results and agreed on an immediate community awareness campaign to address the contamination issue.\n\nEnvironmental Health Officer Fungai Mangwambi urged residents to take precautions: We just advised the community not to use the water from their wells because they are not fully protected. They must use the reticulated water from the council or local authority, which is a bit safer as from now, since we are expecting underground contamination.\n\nHowever, the situation has left Chipadze residents divided. While some expressed confusion and concern, others questioned the previous assurances given by the mine. One resident shared their frustration: We were told the mine conducted tests and the water was safe, but we saw with our own eyes that vegetables and trees were affected. On top of that, we have some shallow wells, and now we are surprised we are being told not to use the water. Our health is now at risk because we have been drinking that water.\n\nAnother resident added, We are no longer sure what to believe because when they tested, they said the water was safe. Now we are being told not to wash plates after hearing that fish, especially catfish, died at Pote.\n\nA disabled resident, concerned about the potential health risks, expressed worry about the waters reach: I use a wheelchair, and when I pass my gate, there is water. I dont know to what extent I will be affected since I handle that water when wheeling my wheelchair.\n\nAs authorities continue to monitor the situation, Chipadze residents remain anxious about the safety of their water and their health.\n\n",

Prosecutor Mr. Tafadzwa Zulu led the States case against Chiropa.\n\nThe Crime and Court Proceedings\n\nChiropa was convicted on two counts of theft of trust property under Section 133 (2)(b) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9:23, as well as contravening the Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act, Chapter 9:23.\n\nThe court heard that Assistant Commissioner Marume had entrusted her domestic worker, Precious Nyasha Manyawu, with US$20,100 for safekeeping. However, when Marume requested the money on December 16, 2023, Manyawu failed to produce it, prompting an investigation.\n\nIt was discovered that Chiropa, with Manyawus assistance, had stolen the money and spent it on lavish items, including a Toyota Runx, household furniture, a 55-inch plasma TV, and a solar panel.\n\nA Romantic Plot Unveiled\n\nThe trial exposed a romantic relationship between Chiropa and Manyawu, through which they allegedly hatched the plan to steal from Marume. Manyawu, who had been a trusted domestic worker for eight years, has already been punished and is currently serving her sentence at Mutare Remand Prison.\n\nChiropa initially pleaded not guilty, claiming the charges were fabricated and asserting his status as a famous traditional healer of means. He further muddied his defense by offering inconsistent statements about his profession, at one point claiming to also be a truck driver and businessman.\n\nAbsconding and Arrest\n\nThe trial was marked by Chiropas initial release on bail, after which he absconded. Authorities later re-arrested him, and he was held in remand prison for violating bail conditions.\n\nMagistrate Ms. Ndiraya noted the overwhelming evidence against Chiropa, including his influence over Manyawu and his extravagant expenditures following the theft.\n\nLegal and Community Repercussions\n\nThe case has drawn widespread attention, particularly regarding the abuse of trust and the role of traditional healers in Zimbabwean society. The harsh sentence and restitution order serve as a warning against financial crimes and the abuse of social and professional influence.\n\nChiropas sentencing brings some closure to Assistant Commissioner Marume, who has since recovered US$12,000 of the stolen amount.\n\nThe case highlights the need for vigilance in handling trust property and reinforces the legal consequences of betrayal and financial misconduct.\n\nStay with us for more updates on this developing story.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent | Bulawayo, Zimbabwe  A Bulawayo couple accused of exploiting a technical glitch at Stanbic Bank Zimbabwe to allegedly spend over US$30,000 both in Zimbabwe and South Africa will learn their fate today as the court delivers its verdict.\n\nFrank Sibanda (65) and his wife, Fransisca Netsai Sibanda (65), of Pelandaba suburb, appeared before Bulawayo regional magistrate Mrs. Dambudzo Malunga, facing 47 counts of theft. The couple, currently out on US$500 bail each, has maintained their innocence, claiming they believed the funds were deposited by their daughter, Rudo Sibanda, who resides in Harare.\n\nThe State closed its case after calling two witnesses to testify against the couple. As part of their bail conditions, the Sibandas were required to surrender their passports, report twice a week at Bulawayo Central Police Station, and remain at their registered address.\n\nHow the Alleged Fraud Unfolded\n\nAccording to prosecutor Mr. Owen Mugari, the saga began on February 5 last year when Fransisca opened a Silver banking segment account at Stanbic Banks Joshua Nkomo Street branch. Her daughter, Rudo, had allegedly falsely declared that her mother was an employee of her Harare-based company, Cominergy Construction Mining Energy, to facilitate the account opening.\n\nFransisca was subsequently issued a Visa chip-and-PIN card for transactions. The alleged fraudulent activity started on April 5 when Fransisca attempted a US$17.95 purchase at National Foods Bulawayo using a Steward Bank point-of-sale (POS) machine. When the transaction failed, Steward Bank initiated a standard reversal process through ZimSwitch.\n\nHowever, due to a technical error, the reversal was processed with a grossly overstated amount of ZWG579,116.21, which was mistakenly auto-converted and credited into Fransiscas Stanbic US dollar account. This unexpected windfall resulted in a deposit of US$40,850.86.\n\nForensic Audit Exposes Discrepancy\n\nThe alleged misuse of funds came to light following a routine forensic audit by Stanbic Bank, which revealed significant discrepancies in its financial records. The audit findings prompted an investigation that led to the couples arrest.\n\nWhile the prosecution argued that the Sibandas knowingly exploited the glitch, the defense maintained that they had no reason to suspect the funds did not originate from their daughter.\n\nA Community Holds Its Breath\n\nThe case has captured public attention, with many eagerly awaiting the courts ruling. A guilty verdict could lead to severe legal consequences for the elderly couple, while an acquittal would raise questions about the banks internal controls and oversight mechanisms.\n\nThe verdict is expected to set a precedent in Zimbabwean legal circles, particularly concerning cases involving financial institutions and technical errors.\n\nStay tuned for live updates as this story develops.\n\n",
