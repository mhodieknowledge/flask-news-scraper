            "content": "Sports Correspondent  Dynamos coach Kelvin Kaindu has officially announced his departure from the Harare giants, bringing an end to his stint with DeMbare after achieving key objectives with the club.\n\nIn a statement released on Monday following his move to Hardrock, Kaindu described the decision to leave Dynamos as a difficult one, saying the club had become a home to him during his time in charge.\n\nIt hasnt been an easy decision to make. Personally, I see Dynamos as my home, said Kaindu. The main objective set was to survive relegation, which we managed to achieve, and the Chibuku Super Cup victory was an icing on the cake.\n\nKaindu expressed gratitude to the clubs leadership and stakeholders, acknowledging the support he received throughout his tenure.\n\nI would like to thank the Dynamos F.C owner, Mr B.M Lusengo, the Executive Committee, management, sponsors, and technical team for the working relationship we had, he said. Not forgetting the players who helped us survive relegation.\n\nHe emphasised that the achievements at the club were a result of collective effort rather than individual brilliance.\n\nIt will be even more difficult for me to single out individuals, but I attribute this to team effort and commitment, Kaindu noted.\n\nThe departing coach also thanked supporters and individuals who stood by him, admitting that the decision may have disappointed some fans.\n\nI know I could have disappointed a lot of people, but this wasnt an easy decision for me to make, he said. This is a difficult moment for me knowing that Im not staying at Dynamos, but I believe that Ive created a working relationship that leaves the door open for the future.\n\nKaindu concluded his message by wishing Dynamos success in the upcoming season and beyond.\n\nThank you for the tremendous support. I wish DeMbare all the best for success this coming season and beyond.\n\n",

Representatives from various districts attended, and after the presentations, Dr. Tungwararas name will be forwarded to the national leadership for consideration and adoption. In addition, Dr. P.

Dr. Tungwararas co-option is not in the best interest of the province.\n\nThe standoff highlights ongoing tensions within Zanu PF, with factions appearing divided over loyalty, influence, and control at both provincial and national levels.

            "content": "By Engineer Jacob Kudzayi Mutisi | The towering blast furnaces of the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (Zisco Steel) once symbolised the promise of an industrialised Zimbabwe. For years, Zisco was not merely a factory, it was a nation-builder. It supplied steel to railways, construction, agriculture, mining and manufacturing, while sustaining entire towns and generations of skilled workers. Yet, tragically, this industrial giant did not survive the era it was meant to empower. Zisco Steel did not die before independence, it died after it.\n\nAt independence in 1980, Zimbabwe inherited one of Africas most sophisticated integrated steel plants. Zisco had trained apprentices, technicians, artisans, engineers and metallurgists, it had captive iron ore, coke ovens, rolling mills and export markets. Few newly independent African states possessed such a strategic industrial asset. Properly managed, Zisco could have been the backbone of national reconstruction, infrastructure development and value-added exports for decades to come.\n\nInstead, independence marked the beginning of a slow and painful decline. In the early years after independence, Zisco continued to operate and employ thousands. Redcliff and Kwekwe thrived as industrial towns, with decent housing, schools, clinics and stable incomes. Steel production underpinned roads, dams, factories and railways the very skeleton of the economy.\n\nHowever, as the years progressed, political interference replaced professional management, long-term investment gave way to short-term survival and maintenance of critical equipment was deferred until failure became inevitable. Strategic decisions were often driven by patronage rather than competence. By the 1990s, inefficiencies had crept in, debts mounted, and reinvestment lagged behind global technological change.\n\nZisco became a victim of policy inconsistency, foreign currency shortages, power cuts and an inability to operate as a commercial entity in a competitive global steel market. What should have been modernised was cannibalised. What should have been protected as strategic national infrastructure was neglected.\n\nBy mid 2000s, production had virtually ceased. Thousands of workers were sent home without salaries, pensions or medical support. Families that had depended on Zisco for generations were plunged into poverty. Redcliff, once a model industrial town began to resemble a ghost settlement, marked by abandoned houses, shuttered businesses and broken hopes.\n\nFormer employees, some now elderly and unwell, waited years for pensions that never came. Many died in hardship, their skills and service discarded without dignity. The collapse of Zisco was not only an economic failure, it was a moral failure.\n\nOver the years, multiple revival plans were announced with fanfare foreign investors, management contracts and public-private partnerships. Each promised a turnaround all delivered nothing. Assets deteriorated further, equipment was stripped or vandalised and confidence evaporated. The absence of transparency and accountability turned rescue efforts into exercises in delay rather than recovery.\n\nWhile smaller private steel players emerged elsewhere, Zimbabwe lost what no small mill could replace, an integrated steel ecosystem capable of supporting heavy industry, railways, shipbuilding, defence manufacturing and large-scale infrastructure.\n\nThe death of Zisco Steel after independence is a painful lesson. Political freedom without economic discipline, institutional integrity and industrial strategy is incomplete. Nations are not built on slogans alone, they are built on functioning institutions, competent leadership and respect for technical expertise.\n\nZisco did not fail because Zimbabwe lacked resources. The country has iron ore, coal, skilled people and regional markets. Zisco failed because the institution was allowed to die.\n\nAs Zimbabwe speaks again of industrialisation, beneficiation and value addition, the rusting remains of Zisco stand as a warning. Reviving industry is not about announcements it is about governance, investment, skills and continuity. Until those lessons are learnt, Zisco Steel will remain what it is today, a fallen giant and a symbol of what Zimbabwe could have been and still could be if institutions are protected rather than sacrificed.\n\nEngineer Jacob Kudzayi Mutisi+263772278161\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri- Government bureaucrats and Zanu PF heavyweights have taken control of the Basic Education Assistance Module (BEAM), it has emerged.\n\nBEAM, designed to support vulnerable pupils in communities, is reportedly being manipulated by government officials to benefit those with influence, leaving the genuinely needy at a disadvantage. In response, the government has announced plans to conduct an audit to identify and expose those involved.\n\nDuring last weeks debate on the Finance Bill for the proposed 2026 National Budget, Finance Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube said Cabinet had taken a firm position on the matter and that an audit would soon be carried out.\n\nNow, turning to BEAM arrears and so forth, colleagues, in Bulawayo, when we debated this issue, I explained that the Government has taken a position through Cabinet that an audit should be undertaken, and because other concerns have come up, to say that a good part of these beneficiaries from BEAM are not deserving cases, Professor Ncube said.\n\nWhat we are finding is that the system for identification of the vulnerable is being manipulated by those with influence and leverage in various areas. This needs to be audited so that we get to know who is really vulnerable, he added.\n\nIt looks like those who are in need are not benefiting. That is the information we have. Therefore, we do not want to rush in without doing this audit work.\n\nConcerns have also been raised over the governments failure to disburse BEAM funds to schools. The Portfolio Committee on Primary and Secondary Education, chaired by Nyanga South MP Supa Mandiwanzira, noted that this delay was affecting school operations.\n\nI am standing to support the proposal that has been made by my colleague Honourable Member that the line item about the Basic Education Assistance Module, in fact, be redirected to the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education. Not only does it reduce transaction costs, but in the last three years, there have not been any disbursements to the schools on these Basic Education Assistance Module (BEAM) allocations. It would also ensure that there are actual disbursements going to schools for this purpose, Mandiwanzira said.\n\nZaka South MP Clemence Chiduwa also commented on the allocation, praising the increase but highlighting concerns over its release.\n\nThe allocation is showing an increase from ZWG2.4 billion to ZWG5.58 billion for the year 2026. This is an increase of more than 100%. However, what is critical is not just the allocation but the releases. The issue that we are having with the schools is that most schools are now going down because the majority of our students are under BEAM. I would want to urge the Hon. Minister to synchronise allocation and releases. The ZWG5.58 billion allocated is quite commendable, Chiduwa said.\n\nMoreover, there is the issue of the BEAM Information Management System. You mentioned that there are quite several ghosts or undeserving pupils who are benefiting from BEAM. I think this is again a commendable move which should be deployed as soon as we start 2026.\n\nOpposition MP Gladys Hlatywayo argued for allocating BEAM funds through the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education rather than the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.\n\nThis is because I think that allocating it to the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare would increase the transaction cost. So, we can reduce the transaction cost by just directing it to the Ministry that is dealing with the particular issue and, in particular, the Ministry of Education, she said.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent-President Emmerson Mnangagwas twin sons, Sean and Collins, are behind the rise of Mines Minister Polite Kambamura, ZimEye has established.\n\nKambamura was appointed last Monday, hours after the abrupt dismissal of Winston Chitando, whose removal followed escalating disputes over mining interests linked to the Mnangagwa twins and rival interests associated with Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nChitando was fired while attending a strategic planning workshop for his ministry in Masvingo. Sources say he was informed of his dismissal while still on duty, a development that reportedly shocked both him and senior officials present. President Mnangagwa moved swiftly to replace him with his deputy, Polite Kambamura, with the reshuffle taking immediate effect.\n\nIn a brief statement, Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Dr Martin Rushwaya said Chitandos removal was effected in terms of Section 340, read together with Section 108 of the Constitution. No official reasons were given.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, multiple sources within the Ministry of Mines say Chitandos exit was the culmination of prolonged tensions over the allocation of lucrative mining licences and concessions.\n\nAccording to senior officials, Chitando had repeatedly resisted pressure to approve mining deals linked to Collins and Sean Mnangagwa. These allegedly included foreign-backed lithium ventures in Mashonaland Central, particularly around Mbire, as well as gold concessions in Mazowe.\n\nThe minister was under sustained pressure to sign off on deals brought to him by the Presidents sons, said one senior official. On several occasions they sought meetings with him, but he refused to give them an audience.\n\nThat resistance, sources say, proved costly.\n\nCollins and Sean Mnangagwa have in recent years become increasingly influential within their fathers political and economic orbit. Senior party and government insiders allege that the twins often act as informal gatekeepers to the President, demanding large sums  reportedly up to US$50,000  from businesspeople seeking access to Mnangagwa for investment discussions. While such claims have never been tested in court, they are widely cited within political and business circles.\n\nMajor Sean Mnangagwa, who recently joined his fathers close security detail, has also emerged as a constant presence on both domestic and international trips, often alongside his twin brother. Sources allege that some of these trips have doubled as platforms for advancing private business interests under the cover of official government delegations.\n\nAnalysts describe this growing influence as part of a broader pattern of family-centred state capture, with the Mnangagwa network now linked to gold, chrome, lithium, fuel procurement and major infrastructure contracts.\n\nChitandos troubles were further compounded by friction with Vice President Chiwenga. Sources say the former minister clashed with the VP over the cancellation of gold mining permits allegedly held by individuals aligned to Chiwenga. Those permits were reportedly withdrawn and reassigned, triggering complaints that reached the highest levels of government.\n\nThis was not the first time Chitandos position had been undermined by elite disputes. ZimLive previously reported that he had once been removed from the mines portfolio after allegedly attempting to interfere in a mining claim linked to Chiwenga. Although he later returned to the ministry, insiders say the tensions never fully dissipated.\n\nChitando, a former managing director of Mimosa Mining Company, was first appointed Mines Minister in 2017 as part of Mnangagwas first post-Mugabe cabinet, initially billed as a technocratic team. He survived several reshuffles, was moved to Local Government in 2023, and then reappointed to Mines a year later. In recent months, however, he was increasingly viewed as politically vulnerable as factional battles within Zanu PF intensified and Mnangagwa tightened control over strategic ministries.\n\nHis successor, Polite Kambamura, a 48-year-old mining engineer from Sanyati, is widely regarded as a close associate of Collins and Sean Mnangagwa. Sources say his relationship with the twins dates back to the Mugabe era and is rooted in gold dealings around Sanyati, Kadoma and surrounding areas, where he allegedly wielded influence over artisanal miners.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa did not even know Kambamura personally, a source claimed. He was introduced to him by his sons soon after the 2017 coup. The same applies to other younger ministers like Jenfan Muswere and Sithembiso Nyoni  they are all friends of the twins, and that is how they entered Cabinet.\n\nKambamuras appointment comes amid heightened public scrutiny of the Mines Ministry, long accused of corruption, opaque licensing processes and domination by politically connected cartels.\n\nHis own public profile is not without controversy. Australia-based activist Susan Mutami has previously alleged that Kambamura was her former lover and claimed he maintained relationships with several high-profile media personalities, including Samantha Musa (Miss Red) and broadcaster Rumbi Takawira. She described the women as part of what she termed a network of slay queens linked to powerful politicians and businessmen.\n\nNone of those named have publicly confirmed the allegations, and Kambamura has never formally responded. Government officials have dismissed the claims as private matters unrelated to public office. Nonetheless, the allegations circulated widely on social media, fuelling debates about patronage, power and gendered exploitation within Zimbabwes political elite.\n\nKambamura now assumes control of one of the countrys most politically and economically sensitive ministries, at a time when competition for control of Zimbabwes vast mineral wealth is intensifying.\n\nChitandos dismissal stands out as one of Mnangagwas most consequential cabinet moves in recent months, signalling a recalibration of power at the heart of the mining sector. Whether Kambamura will reform a ministry long viewed as a battleground for elite interests  or simply oversee a deeper consolidation of control by politically connected actors  remains an open question.\n\n",
