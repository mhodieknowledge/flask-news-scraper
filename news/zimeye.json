            "content": "By Dr. Trywell Muzerengi\n\nRingworm in cattle  medically referred to as Dermatophytosis  is a contagious fungal skin infection caused by dermatophytes, and not actual worms, despite its misleading name. It primarily affects young calves, especially during the cold winter months when cattle are housed in crowded, poorly ventilated environments.\n\n Causative Agent\n\nThe main culprit in cattle is the fungus Trichophyton verrucosum, which specifically targets bovines.\n\n Transmission\n\nRingworm is highly contagious and can spread through:\n\nDirect contact with infected animals\n\nContaminated objects, including brushes, halters, and fences\n\nEnvironmental spores, which can survive for months\n\nPoor barn conditions, especially overcrowding and lack of ventilation\n\n Clinical Signs\n\nFarmers should look out for:\n\nCircular, greyish-white crusty lesions\n\nPatchy hair loss (alopecia), especially on the head, ears, neck, shoulders, and back\n\nScaly or raised skin that may be mildly itchy\n\nMore severe infections in young, malnourished, or immunosuppressed cattle\n\n Zoonotic Risk\n\nRingworm can also infect humans, particularly farm workers and children, causing red, itchy, ring-shaped rashes on the skin. This highlights the importance of early detection and proper hygiene.\n\n Diagnosis\n\nThough often diagnosed based on appearance, confirmation methods include:\n\nSkin scraping and microscopy (KOH preparation to see fungal hyphae)\n\nFungal culture\n\nWoods lamp test (note: not reliable for T. verrucosum)\n\n Treatment Options\n\nWhile Dermatophytosis often self-cures, treatment is recommended to prevent spread:\n\nIdeal for mild or localized cases:\n\nLime sulfur (1:16) or Enilconazole (1:100) rinse\n\nTwice-a-week applications\n\nOther options: Miconazole, Iodine, or Chlorhexidine washes\n\nRemove crusts with a brush and discard the brush and burn the infective material, advises veterinary guidelines.\n\nFor severe or outbreak scenarios:\n\nGriseofulvin (restricted in food animals in some regions)\n\nIvermectin (some antifungal effect but not first-line)\n\nClean and disinfect barns, feeding troughs, and grooming tools\n\nUse antifungal disinfectants such as bleach (1:10 solution)  though some vets caution that bleach can be irritating and hazardous to humans\n\n Recovery & Immunity\n\nLesions can take weeks to fully heal\n\nImmunity generally develops after infection, making reinfection rare in older animals\n\nEmail:[emailprotected]\n\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/share/18x439qwXt/\n\nWhatsApp Channel:\n\nInstagram: @lasmuzagro1LinkedIn: Lasmuz Agro\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwas administration is under growing pressure after revelations that a US$1 billion cement and mining project in Magunje was approved without following proper legal and environmental procedures.\n\nThe scandal has triggered outrage from traditional leaders, villagers, and civil society, who accuse the government of trampling on citizens rights in pursuit of investment.\n\nThe backlash comes after Tafadzwa Muguti, the Permanent Secretary in the Office of the President and Cabinet responsible for devolution, publicly rebuked the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) for issuing an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) certificate to a cement company  despite the fact that it does not have verified legal claim to the land.\n\nEMA, I dont know what kind of kickback you received, but it is highly improper to grant an EIA to someone who has no legitimate claim to the land, Muguti said during a heated engagement in Mashonaland West.\n\nThat EIA should never have been issued.\n\nLocal chiefs and community leaders have slammed the project as an unlawful intrusion on communal land, approved without consultation or consent.\n\nThis dam is used by villagers, the army and Magunje residents. No investor should be allowed to poison it because of shortcuts, Muguti warned. Even the President pays taxes to his local authority. Why should an anonymous investor operate tax-free and outside Government control?\n\nHe also revealed that Labenmon Investments had not obtained licensing from the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (ZIDA), nor had it engaged the local Rural District Council. Even more alarming, the investors physical address remains unknown.\n\nIn what appears to be a desperate attempt to contain the fallout, Muguti said the decision on whether the project proceeds would now rest with the provincial leadership  but only if the project complies with all legal frameworks.\n\nI told Minister Chombo and the provincial chairperson, if the province wants the project, it must be done properly. Lets reach consensus. But if there is crime involved, we arrest, because thats what the Office of the President and Cabinet does under its mandate, he said.Development is our national agenda, but it must be lawful and transparent.\n\nThe Centre for Natural Resource Governance (CNRG) added fuel to the fire last month by calling for an immediate suspension of the project. The watchdog reported cases of forced displacement, desecration of ancestral graves, and intimidation of local villagers and activists.\n\nWhile government officials had touted the project as a game-changing investment set to create 5,000 jobs, communities on the ground say it has brought only fear, division, and disregard for the rule of law.\n\nWith chiefs and citizens demanding answers, and civil society turning up the heat, the Mnangagwa regime is now caught in a storm of its own making  one that could cost far more than just a cement plant.\n\n",

However, he parted ways with the CCC after Chamisas departure from the organisation.\n\nMourners have begun to gather at his family home in Ngundu to pay their respects, a citizens leader in Masvingo said.
