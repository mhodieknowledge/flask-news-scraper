            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has reaffirmed his commitment to achieving Zimbabwes Vision 2030, a plan aimed at transforming the country into an upper-middle-income society. While his leadership has often been scrutinized, particularly regarding his adherence to the constitution, Mnangagwas latest statements suggest a focused pursuit of this national agenda. He has been consistent in outlining a path for economic growth, social cohesion, and unity, emphasizing that all sectors of society must collaborate to realize the vision.\n\nSpeaking on the trajectory towards Vision 2030, President Mnangagwa assured that the country is progressing steadily on the path to economic development. Vision 2030 shall surely become a reality, he stated, Never, never, never again should anything ever divide us. United we must stand, strong and solid as the walls of great Zimbabwe, from which we derive our nations name. The Presidents words underline the importance of unity, not just for political stability, but as a cornerstone for economic prosperity.\n\nAt the core of the Vision 2030 agenda is a call for collaboration across all levels of society. Mnangagwas vision requires the active participation of citizens, businesses, and the government. He expressed this sentiment clearly, saying, Hand in hand, in unity, from village to the provincial level, sector by sector and industry by industry, Vision 2030 shall surely become a reality. His message is clear: the achievement of the nations aspirations is only possible through collective effort.\n\nCentral to the governments strategy for achieving Vision 2030 is fostering national unity and social cohesion. President Mnangagwa emphasized that the country is building a cohesive society through grassroots development and decentralization. These include accelerated development at grassroots level and broader decentralisation. Home-grown unity and peace-building processes, led by our chiefs, are a testimony of the effectiveness of our heritage-based strategies in addressing contemporary realities, he explained.\n\nThe Presidents focus on heritage-based strategies and decentralization underscores a commitment to local-level engagement, particularly through traditional leadership. Chiefs, who have been instrumental in peace-building efforts, are seen as vital players in uniting communities and fostering a sense of shared purpose.\n\nAs the country marks 37 years since the signing of the Unity Accord, which ended the civil strife between Zanu PF and the PF-Zapu, President Mnangagwa used this significant milestone to remind Zimbabweans of the values that have shaped the nations progress. Unity, patriotism, peace as well as love and respect for one another are indispensable values to accelerate the development of our country, he asserted. The Unity Accord, signed in 1987, remains a pivotal moment in Zimbabwes post-independence history, and Mnangagwas reference to it calls for a renewed commitment to peace and national reconciliation.\n\nWhile President Mnangagwa has faced scrutiny regarding his constitutional adherence, particularly his statement about stepping down in 2028 as required by the constitution, his consistent rhetoric about unity, peace, and development provides a clear narrative about his vision for the country. The challenge for Mnangagwa, however, remains in balancing his public pledges with the need for genuine democratic reforms. His statement about not staying in power beyond 2028, in accordance with the constitution, invites further scrutiny into whether his actions will align with this promise.\n\nIn conclusion, President Mnangagwas insistence on Vision 2030 being on course, along with his emphasis on national unity and grassroots development, presents a roadmap for Zimbabwes future. However, his adherence to the constitution and his commitment to democratic processes will remain key indicators of his sincerity in achieving the vision he has outlined. Let us therefore, look ahead to a brighter future as we continuously discover the strength that resides in our diversity, culture, and traditions, Mnangagwa concluded, encapsulating his vision for Zimbabwes unity and progress.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, Masvingo-based clergyman Prophet Lovemore Chevure has condemned veteran musician Clive Malunga for criticizing President Emmerson Mnangagwas bid for a third term.\n\nThe controversy began after a video surfaced last week in which Malunga, who is also a war veteran, argued that Mnangagwa was not divinely appointed and therefore had no mandate to extend his rule.\n\nYes, I clearly said that Mnangagwa wont see 2030 or even 2026 because he isnt God and wasnt appointed by God to be President of Zimbabwe, Malunga stated.\n\nIn response, Chevure, leader of Prophetic Grace International Church, rebuked Malungas remarks in an interview with a local publication. Chevure invited Malunga to visit his church for instant deliverance.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has every right to rule. The power of life and death lies in your tongue, as the scriptures say. Therefore, the President has every right to say, I can be there and lead even up to 2040,' Chevure asserted.\n\nChevure continued by addressing Malunga directly: As for you, Clive Malunga, you dont have the power to say the president wont be around in 2026. Who are you? Who gave you that authority? Regardless of our political affiliations, we must accept that the current president of Zimbabwe is Emmerson Mnangagwa. Scriptures urge us to respect the authority of our leaders, and by showing disrespect to the President, Malunga has invited a curse on himself and his family.\n\nHe further invited Malunga to his church for deliverance, claiming that if Malunga could not see the progress made under the Second Republic, he was in need of spiritual intervention. The problem with some of our countrymen is that they focus only on the negative side, Chevure said.\n\nChevure also reminded listeners that no one is perfect. You must know that if you are praying for your enemies to die, remember that you, too, are someones enemy, and they might be wishing the same for you. No human has a clean record; we all have offended someone at some point.\n\n",
