            "content": "Sports Correspondent\n\nFA Cup holders Crystal Palace clinched a dramatic Community Shield victory against Premier League champions Liverpool, winning 3-2 on penalties after a 2-2 draw at Wembley.\n\nGoalkeeper Dean Henderson was the standout hero, saving penalties from Alexis Mac Allister and Harvey Elliott. Meanwhile, Liverpools Mohamed Salah saw his kick fly over the bar, opening the door for 21-year-old Palace midfielder Justin Devenny, who had come on as a stoppage-time substitute, to confidently slot the winning penalty past Alisson.\n\nThis victory adds a second major trophy to Palaces cabinet within months, having secured their first-ever major trophy earlier this year. Notably, Palace became the first team in 50 years to win the Community Shield on their debut appearance, the last being Derby County in 1975.\n\nThe match was a thrilling spectacle from start to finish, with early drama unfolding in just the fourth minute. Liverpools four major summer signings made immediate impact, as 116m record signing Florian Wirtz provided the assist for Hugo Ekitikes clinical finish to put Liverpool ahead.\n\nHowever, Palace responded resiliently. Thirteen minutes later, Jean-Philippe Mateta converted a penalty after Virgil van Dijk fouled Ismaila Sarr. Mateta also contributed in the shootout, scoring one of Palaces successful penalties.\n\nHendersons heroics in the shootout, including two crucial saves at the same end where he denied Omar Marmoushs spot-kick in Mays cup final, proved decisive.\n\nLiverpool fans paid a poignant tribute in the 20th minute to Diogo Jota, the forward who wore the number 20 shirt before his tragic passing in a car accident last month.\n\nMeanwhile, Palace await the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) decision on their appeal against demotion from the Europa League, adding an off-field drama to their recent on-pitch success.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Mnangagwa regime is once again playing with fire, this time by announcing a bold  some would say reckless  plan to phase out the US dollar by 2030 in favour of the untested Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG).\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), the country will transition from the current multi-currency system to a domestic mono-currency in an orderly manner. The move will be anchored in the upcoming National Development Strategy 2 (NDS2), replacing the already underwhelming NDS1.\n\nRBZ Governor John Mushayavanhu insists the plan will preserve foreign currency accounts and respect existing USD-denominated contracts, but Zimbabweans have heard these promises before. The memory of 2008s hyperinflation and the governments sudden seizure of US dollar bank balances in 2019 remains fresh.\n\nWhile officials boast of stability since ZiG replaced the collapsing Zimbabwe dollar in April 2024, sceptics point out that ZiG still accounts for only a fraction of the money in circulation. The overwhelming majority of transactions  especially in critical imports like fuel and medicines  are still priced in US dollars.\n\nForeign-currency depositors are particularly uneasy, with the RBZs own Mid-Term Review admitting that stakeholders relayed concerns about the fate of their savings post-2030. The absence of legally binding guarantees has only heightened suspicion that the government might be setting the stage for another raid on hard currency deposits.\n\nFormer Masvingo Central Constituency Member of Parliament Jeffryson Chitando criticized the governments plan sharply: The obsession with ZiG is reckless and risks repeating the disastrous mistakes of the past. Zimbabweans cannot afford another currency collapse caused by political vanity and poor economic management.\n\nThe governments framing of de-dollarisation as national sovereignty rings hollow for many Zimbabweans, who see it as a political vanity project detached from economic reality. The 2030 deadline is being pushed as non-negotiable, yet the RBZ has offered no clear explanation of how it will maintain price stability, rebuild public trust, or ensure the new currency holds value beyond paper promises.\n\nPresident Mnangagwas administration appears determined to push forward, regardless of the risks. If history is any guide, ordinary citizens will be the ones left paying the price when political grandstanding collides with economic reality.\n\nFor now, the message from the regime is clear: the US dollars days are numbered. The real question is whether Zimbabweans can trust their leaders not to repeat the catastrophic currency blunders of the past  or whether 2030 will be yet another year of shattered savings and broken promises.\n\n",

He was joined by his two deputiesVice President General (Retired) Dr Constantino Chiwenga and Colonel (Retired) Kembo Mohadiin laying wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\nThis year, the families of the four newly declared national heroes were each presented with a national flag.\n\nProfessor Vladimir Shubin, former Secretary of the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee and Head of the Africa Section of the Communist Party of the Soviet Unions International Department, received the Zimbabwe International Friendship Award.\n\nI am honoured to be here in Zimbabwe to receive this award for my work to help the country achieve independence. This is not my own awardthis is for my country, Russia, he said.\n\nInasem Chitutu, a teenager who bravely rescued two children from a burning house in Bindura, was awarded the Silver Cross of Zimbabwe.\n\nI never thought I would meet the President at such a young age, let alone receive this award, which is closest to my heart. I will forever cherish this, he said.\n\nWith women continuing to play a key role in the health care sector, Dr Madeline Nyamwanzathe first female African medical doctor in Zimbabwereceived the Robert Gabriel Mugabe Commendation Award for Service in Human Capital Development.\n\nI feel grateful to receive this award in recognition of the work I have done, particularly in the health care sector, and I will forever cherish it, she said.\n\nThese living heroes are among more than two thousand veterans of the liberation struggle from across the country who were honoured on Monday.\n\nAs the nation celebrates both the living and the departed heroes, the responsibility to build a thriving Zimbabwe rests with every citizen, as the country works towards becoming an upper-middle-income society by 2030.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nICT Minister Tatenda Maveteras weekend fanfare over the donation of 30 laptops and 5 Starlink kits to Dopota Primary School in Gokwe South did little to mask the governments ongoing failure to deliver meaningful digital inclusion across Zimbabwe.\n\nMavetera proudly announced, Today, I was honoured to accompany the Hon. Minister of Defence, Cde Oppah Muchinguri Kashiri, who on behalf of His Excellency, President Dr. Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, officially commissioned a state of the art computer laboratory at Dopota Primary School.\n\nHowever, the pomp and circumstance stand in stark contrast to the everyday realities faced by most Zimbabwean learners. With only 30 laptops and a handful of Starlink kits for an entire school and community, this milestone barely scratches the surface of the countrys vast digital divide.\n\nMaveteras assertion that no learner, no community, and no corner of our nation is left behind as we march towards Vision 2030 is at best aspirational rhetoric and at worst misleading. Vast swathes of Zimbabwe remain disconnected from reliable internet and digital resources, especially in rural areas like Gokwe South where basic infrastructure continues to lag behind.\n\nThe Ministers claim that the Ministry of ICT remain steadfast in driving digital inclusion and creating opportunities for all Zimbabweans to thrive in the Fourth Industrial Revolution does little to conceal the slow pace of progress and lack of tangible impact on the ground.\n\nCritics argue that such token gestures are designed more for political optics than genuine transformation. For many schools, the lack of electricity, trained teachers, and maintenance support for digital facilities means donated equipment often ends up unused or broken.\n\nZimbabwes digital future requires far more than ceremonial launches and social media hashtags.\n\n",
