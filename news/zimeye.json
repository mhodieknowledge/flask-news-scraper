Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Sheila Chikomo, brought the memorandum before Parliament seeking approval for the Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the two countries.\n\nChikomo urged lawmakers to ratify the agreement by May 31, 2025, claiming it would enhance Zimbabwes appeal to foreign investors and foster economic development.\n\nThe agreement is intended to secure and protect investments from both countries, and to provide a framework for mutual economic cooperation, she said.\n\nA parliamentary foreign affairs committee also recommended the deals approval, arguing it would support sustainable development and strengthen bilateral ties.\n\nHowever, CCC legislators expressed deep skepticism, with one MP stating that the timing of the agreements presentation to Parliament was suspicious.\n\nThe coincidence of the minister bringing this agreement before this August House was designed to be timed with the presidents official visit currently happening, the MP said.\n\nCritics pointed out the lack of clarity regarding the trade dynamics between Zimbabwe and Belarus, warning the agreement could be exploited by politically connected elites.\n\nWe also need to be worried when we end up having a trade agreement which can be manipulated and exploited by a few individuals who are connected, another MP added.\n\nAnother opposition MP criticized the imbalance in trade benefits, saying Zimbabwe would likely end up importing finished products such as tractors, while Belarus gained a foothold in local markets.\n\nMutsa Murombedzi, another CCC lawmaker, strongly cautioned against fast-tracking the deal without proper scrutiny.\n\nParliament should not become a rubber stamp for executive deals, Murombedzi said. Its a document that potentially grants disproportionate power to foreign capital with little accountability. I therefore call upon this house to defer the approval.\n\nThe backlash comes as President Mnangagwa continues a four-day state visit to Belarus, where he has signed several Memoranda of Understanding in areas such as health, agriculture, infrastructure, and economic cooperation.\n\nDespite the governments push to solidify ties with Minsk, the opposition remains firm that Parliament must conduct due diligence before endorsing such high-level international agreements.\n\n",

Problem nde yake hake aka tanga kundiimba iwe uno tenga butsu dzakawanda vamwe vasina sei?\n\nThe flamboyant businessmanknown for his lavish lifestyle and controversial statementshinted that Winky Ds past lyrics may have subtly criticized him for flaunting his wealth.\n\nIf he ever came and said, Mukoma wangu, we differ in our political party choice but please recognize my talent, ini hangu handina kana problem naye, Chivayo continued. His poor handlers are bad influence.\n\nThe comments have sparked backlash and debate across social media, with fans of the Gaffa President defending him as a socially conscious artist who speaks truth to power through his music. Others, however, echoed Chivayos sentiment that Winky Ds team may be pushing him toward unnecessary political controversy.\n\nWinky D has long been regarded as a fearless voice in Zimbabwean music, often using his lyrics to comment on corruption, inequality, and social injustice. However, his silence in response to these recent remarks has only added fuel to speculation about the state of his relationship with politically connected figures.\n\nAs tensions continue to simmer between influential voices in politics and the arts, this latest jab from Chivayo is unlikely to go unnoticed in Zimbabwes already heated cultural and political landscape.\n\n",

            "content": "Pretoria  Sunday, 18 May 2025\n\nBy Dorrothy Moyo |\n\nSouth Africa, once Africas largest and most industrialised economy, has now slipped to fourth place  overtaken by Nigeria, Egypt, and Kenya  marking a dramatic reversal from its leading position in 1995. Economists and policy analysts attribute the sustained decline to a toxic combination of populist labour policies, deteriorating investor confidence, and hostile approaches toward foreign labour participation.\n\nOne of the critical factors has been aggressive political attacks on foreign professionals and skilled workers, particularly in sectors like mining, ICT, manufacturing, and finance. Over the past two decades, successive administrations  under mounting pressure from nationalist movements  increasingly enforced rigid local labour quotas, often at the expense of business continuity and specialised expertise.\n\nForeign talent, once a cornerstone of South Africas global competitiveness, was systematically pushed out under the guise of protecting local jobs. As a result, companies faced skills shortages, stalled innovation, and began relocating operations to more welcoming environments across the continent.\n\nThese labour protectionist policies were not matched with education and training reform, leaving a gap in critical capabilities across key industries. Combined with power cuts, corruption, and policy uncertainty, South Africas GDP growth stagnated while others surged ahead.\n\nThe economic fallout is stark:\n\nSouth Africas drop to the fourth-largest economy is symbolic of a broader structural failure. Analysts warn that unless the government rethinks its hostile stance on foreign staffing and rebuilds investor trust, the country risks falling further behind in Africas economic race.\n\nBut South Africas Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Gayton McKenzie, has triggered national debate and diplomatic concern after launching an explosive tirade demanding the immediate dismissal of all foreign workers from the Department and its entities  unless they possess special skills.\n\nSpeaking to top officials in a fiery address, McKenzie declared that no foreign national without a special skill would be allowed to work in the Department of Sports, Arts and Culture during his tenure, insisting that all such posts must be given to unemployed South Africans.\n\nThey must go, and you must replace them with South Africans. Even if it means the CEOs have to go so we can put CEOs that love South Africans. Nothing occupies my mind for the next three weeks like the foreigners working in your department. I want them out. I said it. I want them out. Get them out before I get you out, McKenzie said, visibly angry.\n\nHe continued:\n\nSouth Africas got the highest unemployment rate. Children and adults are committing suicide because they cant get jobs. Unemployment has the potential of causing massive riots in this country. And some of you have the audacity to hire foreigners instead of South Africans.\n\nMcKenzies remarks come just weeks after his appointment and have drawn comparisons to xenophobic rhetoric, with some officials warning of legal and diplomatic repercussions. However, the Minister dismissed such concerns:\n\nIt is not xenophobic. You are not a chairperson in Zimbabwe. You are not a chairperson in Angola. You can go to those countries and tell me if you find a South African working there without a special skill. We must leave this self-hate of our people.\n\nHe added that no one in the room had a special skill that couldnt be found locally and accused some of sabotaging unemployed citizens:\n\nImagine if somebody had given your job to a foreigner. Nobody in this room has a special skill. But you have a job. Why do you deny that same opportunity to South Africans?\n\nMcKenzie also read a message from a South African jobseeker who was allegedly sidelined in favor of a foreign national after an interview in 2021, using it as an example of systemic bias against locals.\n\nSome of you that hire foreigners will be gone in four weeks. I promise you that. Because South Africans are jobless. And if I have to choose between stopping this audit and keeping my job, I will resign.\n\nHe announced a five-week deadline for CEOs, boards, and chairpersons to remove all ineligible foreign workers:\n\nGo and get your house in order because the storm is coming. Youll receive letters tomorrow. Most of your entities have illegal foreigners. It stops today. Fix that thing. Because Im coming for you if you dont.\n\nMcKenzies comments have reignited long-standing tensions over immigration, job scarcity, and economic inequality. Human rights organisations are expected to respond in the coming days.\n\nBackground: Convicted Criminal Turned Cabinet Minister\n\nBefore entering politics, Gayton McKenzie was a convicted criminal who served over 10 years in prison for armed robbery and other offences. While incarcerated, he became a whistleblower, exposing widespread corruption in South African prisons, which eventually led to his early release.\n\nHis political career began with the founding of the Patriotic Alliance (PA), a party known for its populist and nationalist stance. Despite a checkered past, McKenzie rose to prominence as mayor of the Central Karoo District before being appointed as Minister in 2024.\n\nThis latest development may cement McKenzies status as one of the most controversial ministers in South Africas post-apartheid era.\n\nMore updates to follow.\n\n",

His post, dripping with sarcasm and contempt, declares hes unbothered by being called corrupt  instead, he celebrates it.\n\nYes yes indeed you are absolutely right, he writes mockingly. Then I just jump into one of my ROLLS ROYCE V12 or the full ELECTRIC one The next morning Im sitting in my PRIVATE JET going to have calamari & prawns for lunch in Mozambique and back in the evening\n\nBut its the visual symbolism of his belly thats causing a stir.\n\nAnalysts say Chivayos exaggerated physical posture is no accident  its political theatre. The inflated stomach, protruding with pride, acts as a metaphor for his gluttonous accumulation of wealth in a country where millions cant afford a loaf of bread.\n\nThe belly is a message, one political analyst noted. Hes saying: Ive eaten, and theres nothing you can do about it.\n\nChivayos choice of the word peaceful paired with images of cars worth millions and a private jet further reveals a disconnect from the lived reality of Zimbabweans. While civil servants beg for raises, hospitals crumble, and students go without textbooks, Chivayo gleefully announces, THE WORLD IS NOT KIND TO THE POOR  with emojis, for emphasis.\n\nWhats more disturbing is the silence from state leaders and spiritual figures like Apostle Eunor Guti, who has refused to publicly rebuke Chivayo despite receiving lavish gifts from him. Her Sunday sermon instead focused on telling church members to stay in church  while ignoring the gospel duty to speak truth to corrupt power.\n\nChivayo, with his belly as billboard, is not just bragging  hes taunting. His message is clear: I am untouchable.\n\nIn a nation looted into collapse, his stomach has become the altar of power  swollen not by grace, but by greed.\n\nAnd Zimbabwe watches, hungry.\n\n",
