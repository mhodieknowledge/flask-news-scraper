            "content": "By A Correspondent-ZESA Holdings executive chairperson, Sydney Gata has been declared a national hero and is set to be buried at the National Heroes Acre on Wednesday.\n\nGata passed away in Harare on Thursday after a short illness.He was 79.Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Ambassador Raphael Faranisi confirmed the latest development to The Herald Online.\n\nGata, from Mutema communal lands under Chief Mutema, was not only a towering technocrat but also a close ally of President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Married to Mnangagwas second wife, Gata operated at the heart of Zimbabwes patronage networks, often leveraging his proximity to power to secure personal and family interests.Despite holding prestigious postsZESA CEO in the 1980s and 1990s, Executive Chairman from 2019, and international advisory roleshis career was tainted by accusations of looting public resources, nepotism, and abuse of office. Under his watch, Zimbabwes energy crisis worsened, with rolling blackouts and ballooning debt becoming the norm, while he lived in luxury and retained power.In his home constituency of Mutema-Musikavanhu, locals accuse Gata of imposing his wife, Angeline Gata, as MP and using his influence to dominate local politics. Her candidacy divided ZANU-PF structures, and critics say the couple used fear and state resources to suppress dissent.During the June 14 by-election in Ward 5, over 1,200 voters were assisted under suspicious claims of illiteracymany reportedly being teachers and civil servants. This, locals say, was political coercion disguised as support.Gata was also accused of displacing villagers for personal land expansion, further alienating communities. Many in Chipinge feared confronting him, citing his deep ties to Mnangagwa and the resulting political protection.Despite a few voices praising his developmental contributions, including the proposed Gazaland University, the broader view in Chipinge is that Gata embodied the worst excesses of Zimbabwes post-independence eliteabuse of power, political gatekeeping, and economic exclusion.\n\n",

His dedication to public service and development of critical infrastructure deserves national recognition. We have lost a committed patriot.\n\nCritics, however, have raised eyebrows over the declaration, pointing to Gatas familial ties to the president and a controversial tenure at the helm of ZESA, marred by allegations of nepotism and mismanagement. One Harare resident said on condition of anonymity,We dont dispute that Gata served, but many people are asking if this is a reward based on merit or bloodlines.\n\nAnother ZESA employee, speaking anonymously, added:He had his achievements, yes, but there were serious issues at ZESA. Declaring him a hero will not sit well with everyone.\n\nDespite the controversy, preparations are already underway for the burial at the National Heroes Acre. State media has since begun running tributes praising Gatas contribution to the energy sector, particularly during the early years of Zimbabwes independence.\n\n",

As opposition in Zimbabwe, we will make sure that we remove Zanu and its useless people from power, Tshabangu said.\n\nThe statement has drawn a swift backlash, especially given that Geza  unlike Tshabangu  has consistently challenged the Mnangagwa administration without being linked to any suspicious political maneuvering. Notably, Geza is credited with frustrating the controversial Mnangagwa 2030 presidential ambition campaign, a feat Tshabangu has never come close to achieving.\n\nPolitical analysts and CCC supporters have dismissed Tshabangus remarks as the desperate rhetoric of a man propped up by Zanu PF to weaken the opposition from within.\n\nAnyone who believes Tshabangu represents real opposition is either nave or complicit. The man has been front and center in recalling elected MPs to give Zanu PF an edge  and now he dares insult a real patriot like Geza, said one online user.\n\nObservers say Tshabangus public statements often mirror Zanu PF talking points, leading many to question his credibility and allegiance.\n\nDespite the backlash, Tshabangu has doubled down on his claims, positioning himself as a key figure in what he calls the real opposition, even as his actions continue to undermine the democratic movement in Zimbabwe.\n\n",

As Zimbabwes opposition, our solution lies in dialogue  sitting at a round table to discuss differences and unite with one voice.\n\nAnything less is a waste of time as well still find it difficult to beat Zanu PF.\n\nThe irony of Tshabangus call for dialogue has not gone unnoticed. Many within the opposition and civil society believe Tshabangu is responsible for sowing division within the CCC at the behest of Zanu PF interests. His unilateral recalls of MPs and councillors created instability within the opposition and have left many questioning whether he is truly committed to democratic change.\n\nAdvocate Nelson Chamisa, who stepped away from CCC after Zanu PF allegedly hijacked its structures, has shown no interest in entertaining Tshabangus overtures.\n\nWe are not under pressure to negotiate with anyone. They say they are in charge, let them lead, Chamisas aide said yesterday, dismissing Tshabangus calls as political noise.\n\nAnalysts say Tshabangus latest move is a clear sign he is politically cornered, with his influence waning and public trust all but eroded. Calls for Chamisa to return and reconstitute a new, independent movement have been growing louder, leaving Tshabangu isolated within a fractured opposition.\n\nWhile Tshabangu insists on dialogue as a path forward, many Zimbabweans continue to view him as a symbol of betrayal  a man whose actions handed Zanu PF the upper hand and weakened the prospects of genuine opposition unity.\n\n",

In such conditions, many now view marriage as an economic burden.\n\nThe survey also found that traditional gender roles are increasingly being challenged by a society where women are becoming more financially independent and empowered. This shift has added to the complexity of modern relationships, particularly among urban youth.\n\nOne observer said, How do I get married when I can barely afford rent or groceries? Marriage these days is a luxury.\n\nThe data was collected against a backdrop of rising poverty, persistent inflation, and a stagnant job market  conditions that have left many Zimbabwean youths uncertain about the future.\n\nThe survey further indicated that Western influences, especially through digital media platforms, are reshaping how marriage is perceived. It is now more commonly viewed as a lifestyle choice rather than a necessary rite of passage.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues to grapple with economic uncertainty, the ZDHS suggests that the traditional family unit is facing a steady transformation, with marriage no longer holding the same social urgency or appeal among men as it once did.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent-The Chipinge community had no kind words for the late Executive Chairman of the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), mourning the death of Sydney Zukuzo Gata, who passed away on Thursday evening.\n\nGata died at a private hospital in Harare after being admitted earlier in the week with chest pains. He hailed from the Mutema communal area under Chief Mutema.\n\nNationally, Gata was a towering but controversial figurewidely regarded as a key member of President Emmerson Mnangagwas inner circle and a prominent beneficiary of Zimbabwes post-liberation patronage system.\n\nHe was also married to President Mnangagwas second wife.\n\nWhile his career was distinguished by powerful appointments and international roles, it was also tainted by long-standing allegations of corruption, nepotism, and the misuse of public institutions for personal and political gain.\n\nDespite official tributes, Gatas legacy in his home district is far from universally celebrated. Many residents in Chipinge remember him less for his philanthropy and more for the power he wielded to influence politics, control land, and silence dissent.\n\nKnown locally asChigananda, Gata was accused of using his proximity to Mnangagwa and his tribal identity to dominate the MutemaMusikavanhu constituency, where his wife serves as the areas MP and Deputy Minister of Primary and Secondary Education.\n\nIn Ward 5, Gata was accused of displacing villagers through controversial land takeovers. During the June 14 by-election in the ward, activists allegedly loyal to Gata and his wife reportedly harassed voters, with over 1,200 people being assisted to vote under the pretext of illiteracyan improbable claim that reportedly included qualified teachers.\n\nMany viewed the imposition of his wife as a political candidate as undemocratic, and her presence deepened divisions within ZANU-PF. Locals say few dared to speak against the Gata family, citing fear of political reprisals and their close links to the presidency.\n\nDr. Gatas career trajectory was remarkable. He was the first Black General Manager of the Electricity Supply Commission (ESC), serving from 1981 to 1985. He later became ZESAs Chief Executive Officer and board member during the late 1980s and 1990s. His controversial reappointment as Executive Chairman in 2019 was met with public skepticism as ZESA grappled with worsening load shedding and financial mismanagement.\n\nInternationally, Gata held respected positions, including a term as Deputy Chair of the Studies Committee of the World Energy Council from 1992 to 1994. He also served in advisory roles with the African Development Bank and Integrated Energy Systems Limited (UK).\n\nThough many in Chipinge were deeply critical of his legacy, others mourned him as a son of the soil who never severed ties with his roots.\n\nWard 23 Councillor Shingai Gapara said all local activities had been suspended to honor the Gata family.\n\nIn honoring his legacy and respecting the Gata family, we have suspended all gatherings and programs in Ward 23 of Chipinge Rural. May we find strength in our collective grief and support one another during this difficult period,he said.\n\nCommunity activist Oliver Chikumba, who broke the news of Gatas death, remembered him warmly:\n\nThe giant has fallen. A man of few words and more action. The nation has been robbed. Dr. Engineer Sydney Zukuzo Gatayour legacy will forever be cherished. Rest in power, Mutape.\n\nAcademic and consultant Dr. Robbert Matikiti called him a hero who has left behind a good legacy, while members of the United Church of Christ in Zimbabwe (UCCZ) also paid tribute to his development work and spiritual leadership.\n\nGata was instrumental in championing the proposed Gazaland University (GU) project in Chipinge. According to Mr. Phillimon Mlambo, Chairperson of the GU Taskforce, Gata helped conceptualize an Agriculture Centre of Excellence and pushed for the projects realization.\n\nDr. Gata was one of our greatest advocates and cheerleaders for Gazaland University. In his honor, we are even more determined to make GU a reality,Mlambo said.\n\nDr. Gata is survived by his wife, Hon. Angeline Gata, their children, and grandchildren. Funeral and burial arrangements will be announced in due course.\n\nAs Zimbabwe reflects on a life that intersected power, privilege, and patronage, Chipinge remains divided. To some, he was a loyal son and visionary. To others, he symbolized a system of political control, economic exclusion, and elite entitlement that they continue to rejecteven in death.\n\n",
