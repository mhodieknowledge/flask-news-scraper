The Reds will assess each potential destination carefully before deciding whether a loan move would support Nyonis development.\n\nHowever, the clubs final decision will hinge largely on the fitness and form of Liverpools senior midfielders, meaning any approval for a loan is likely to come later in the window.\n\n",

This will separate functions between the Traffic Safety Authoritys Inspectorate and the VID, which should focus on inspections at the depots, Minister Mhona explained.\n\nThe move signals a significant shift in Zimbabwes road safety regulatory framework, limiting VIDs highway operations while expanding the enforcement role of the newly proposed Traffic Safety Authority.\n\n",

That should not be tolerated. Biti and Mawarire are always negative. They cant stop the wave of transformation.\n\nHe further warned Biti against criticizing the country while lacking the financial means to contribute to investment and economic growth. You cannot speak badly about Zimbabwe when you do not have money to invest, Mutsvangwa said.\n\nThe spokespersons remarks come amid ongoing debates over Zimbabwes economic performance, with Zanu PF emphasizing recent policy measures aimed at economic transformation and stability. Mutsvangwas message underscores the partys firm stance against what it perceives as persistent opposition negativity, insisting that the countrys development agenda will continue despite detractors.\n\nThe country is moving forward, and no amount of criticism from those with no constructive solutions will change that, Mutsvangwa concluded.\n\n",

Every veteran and spouse will be guaranteed proper arrangements, because they gave everything for our nation, critics argue that the scheme prioritizes the deceased over the living.\n\nOther announcements included a US$300 000 empowerment boost for party leagues, donations of computers, laptops, and wheelchairs, the construction of five clinics with maternity wards, and a party-owned market in DCC 5.\n\nResidents and opposition voices, however, expressed concern that these initiatives favor political loyalists and symbolic gestures over urgent community needs such as food security, housing, and education.\n\nThe policy seems to prioritize the dead over the living, one local resident said. People in our communities are struggling with access to health care, clean water, and education. Why give thousands for funerals while families go hungry?\n\nDespite Tagwireis emphasis on social and economic empowerment, including SME support and the nationwide rollout of free WiFi, many argue that the heavy focus on funeral payouts risks leaving living citizens underserved.\n\nCritics are now calling for more transparent allocation of resources that directly address pressing needs in DCC 5 and beyond, highlighting the tension between symbolic gestures and practical community support.\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri Zimbabwean journalist and political commentator Jealousy Mawarire on Friday delivered a scathing critique of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, accusing him of glorifying corruption and misrepresenting Zimbabwes development achievements.\n\nMawarire directly challenged claims that Mnangagwa succeeded where former President Robert Mugabe had failed, particularly regarding infrastructure and economic growth.\n\nHe stated:The claim that ED succeeded in what Mugabe failed is a lie from the pit of hell. Lets take, for instance, infrastructure. Mugabe built the National Sports Stadium, Reserve Bank building, New Government building, Karigamombe, Causeway, and universities in nine provinces, starting with NUST in Bulawayo.\n\nHe also criticized the roads credited to Mnangagwa:\n\nThe Mutare-Harare-Bulawayo-Plumtree road, in its current state, was built under Mugabe. The Masvingo-Beitbridge road, which ED is resurfacing, was initially done by Mugabe. The Chivhu-Chiredzi highway was done by Mugabe between 1987 and 1989.\n\nMawarire was particularly scathing about the new class of wealthy individuals associated with Mnangagwas tenure:\n\nThe millionaires you are talking about, the thieves looting Zimbabwe now, cant be compared to real businesspeople who came up during Mugabes time, like Shingai Mutasa, Strive Masiiwa, Nigel Chanakira, and others. Crediting ED for creating millionaires is an insult to our national psyche, a glorification of thievery which can only come from someone of the same ilk.\n\nHe further claimed that many projects completed under Mnangagwa were originally brokered under Mugabe and are now being used as opportunities for corruption:\n\nYes, there are projects that have been undertaken during EDs time, but if you look closely, these are projects that were brokered by Mugabe before the coup. The new parliament and the airport are good examples. What ED has done is turning such projects into looting schemes by overpricing the projects through proxy contractors who bring suitcases of money every day to his private office in Borrowdale.\n\nMawarire also accused Mnangagwa of failing citizens in the healthcare sector:\n\nMugabe built clinics all over the country. ED, through his wife, has made sure there are no painkillers in those clinics and even major referral hospitals. Give us a break. ED is a thief, the worst thing that has happened to Zimbabwe since colonialism.\n\nHis remarks are likely to reignite debates over Zimbabwes economic management, governance, and the legacies of both Mugabe and Mnangagwa.\n\n",

A funeral policy is not one of them.\n\nHe condemned the government for repeatedly making empty promises, saying the welfare of ex-combatants had collapsed while political elites grew wealthier.\n\nThe ZNLWVA said respect for war veterans was a constitutional and moral duty  not a political bargaining chip.\n\nTagwirei had announced that Harare war veterans and their spouses would receive funeral policies valued at US$2 500 each  an offer now publicly dismissed as degrading and politically manipulative.\n\n",

We had our resolution number 1 at the party conference in Bulawayo, which said that President Mnangagwa remains the President of Zimbabwe until 2030, and that resolution was unanimous, made by a majority, he said.\n\nHe emphasised that no one can claim the partys top position before the appropriate internal processes take place.
