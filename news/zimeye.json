            "content": "By A Correspondent-Top Zanu PF Womens League officials nearly came to blows at a tense Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC) meeting in Mutare, as deepening factional battles for control of the partys Manicaland structures spilled into the open.\n\nThe dramatic altercation  witnessed by senior party officials and delegates  saw rival factions aligned to Zanu PF secretary for legal affairs Patrick Chinamasa and Senate president Mabel Chinomona clash over who should lead the provincial womens league.\n\nThe main protagonists in the showdown were acting provincial chairperson Mercy Sacco, widely regarded as Chinamasas ally, and Dorothy Mabika, a political heavyweight allegedly backed by Chinomona. Both women attempted to assert dominance at the high table during the meeting, each claiming to be the legitimate leader of the womens league in the province.\n\nChinamasa was forced to intervene publicly, urging the two rivals to avoid further embarrassment and await a final determination from the politburo.\n\nI am the secretary for legal affairs and I must ensure that the party constitution is upheld, Chinamasa said. The election of Mabika as chairperson was not sanctioned by the party. It was overruled, and Sacco remains the acting chairperson until the politburo makes a final decision.\n\nThe position became vacant last year following the suspension of then-chairperson Happiness Nyakuedzwa. Mabika claims to have been legitimately elected earlier this year, but Chinamasa insists the process was irregular.\n\nI raised this matter in the politburo, and it is now on the agenda for the next meeting on July 4. Until then, we will not embarrass anyone. That is why both women are here today, he added, in an attempt to restore order.\n\nHowever, the spectacle in Mutare laid bare the extent of infighting gripping the ruling party, particularly as rival camps within the womens league openly jockey for power and influence in the post-Mugabe era.\n\nSome party members at the meeting supported Mabikas claims, saying she was duly elected through a democratic process. Yet the open confrontation  and the need for high-level arbitration  underscores the widening cracks in Zanu PFs internal cohesion, especially in key provinces like Manicaland.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, Zanu PFs director of information, Farai Marapira, sought to downplay the incident, dismissing the reports of factionalism as opposition propaganda.\n\nThere are no factions in Zanu PF, Marapira claimed. What people are witnessing is vibrant internal engagement, which is being mischaracterized by opposition elements who wish to destabilize the party.\n\nDespite these denials, the heated scenes in Mutare suggest that factionalism  long a feature of Zanu PFs internal politics  remains alive and well, with competing power blocs now openly challenging each other even at grassroots levels.\n\n",

            "content": "By Parliamentary Reporter-Parliament has expressed deep concern and dismay over the dilapidated state of the Chitungwiza Aquatic Complex, a once-iconic sports facility that proudly hosted the 1995 All Africa Games and numerous other international events.\n\nOnce a symbol of sporting excellence in Zimbabwe, the Olympic-standard complex is now a shadow of its former self. Its main swimming pool, practice pool, and childrens pool have fallen into disrepair, while key infrastructure such as the electronic timing system and boiler house has long been abandoned and remains non-functional.\n\nThe collapse of the complex has not only affected its aesthetics but also severely impacted local and national swimming development, with athletes and recreational swimmers now forced to seek alternative facilities. Safety concerns and a lack of basic maintenance have rendered the complex unusable.\n\nThe extent of the neglect was brought to light during a recent inspection by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture, chaired by legislator Farai Jere. Following the visit, Jere expressed outrage at the state of the facility:\n\nWe are appalled by the state of the Chitungwiza Aquatic Complex. We will take this matter to Parliament to push for the restoration of this facility to its former glory so that it can once again host international swimming events, Jere said.\n\nIt is unacceptable that we are spending millions of dollars to send athletes abroad when we have a world-class Olympic facility right here at home that has been left to rot.\n\nThe committees visit was part of a broader oversight mission to assess the implementation of government policies on sports infrastructure and to identify urgent interventions needed to revitalize the sector.\n\nThe current state of the Chitungwiza Aquatic Complex stands as a stark reminder of the countrys failure to preserve legacy infrastructure, and Parliament is now under pressure to act decisively to rescue what was once one of Zimbabwes proudest sporting landmarks.\n\n",

He called on councillors to honour the mandate given to them by their constituents, stressing the need to focus on critical service areas such aswaste management, housing, and transparency in governance.\n\nYou came from the people, you were elected by the people Whatever you do must be guided by the best interests of those who put you there, he said.\n\nHe also challenged local authorities to monitor their performance rigorously and to act swiftly to prevent administrative collapse. We should be able to intervene before systems collapse. That is only achievable if there is constant monitoring by leadership, Mnangagwa said.\n\nBut it was his warning againstnepotismin council hiring practices that raised eyebrows.\n\nLet us avoid nepotism when employing and make sure competent people are employed, he statedcomments that stood in sharp contrast to his own record as President.\n\nCritics have long pointed toMnangagwas elevation of close relatives and loyalistsinto key government and parastatal positions as a hallmark of his leadership style. From family members appointed to diplomatic posts to trusted allies placed in powerful ministries and boards, Mnangagwas administration has often been accused ofconsolidating power through patronage, undermining the very meritocracy he now claims to champion.\n\nObservers say the presidents remarks may ring hollow for Zimbabweans who continue to witness a widening gap betweenrhetoric and realityespecially as transparency and accountability remain elusive at the highest levels of leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indaba also featured the launch of the Minimum Service Delivery Standards and the Urban State Land Management Policy, aimed at improving transparency and standardising operations in urban councilsa move welcomed by many, but still overshadowed by the Presidents contradictory message.\n\n",
