            "content": "By Municipal Reporter-Sengezo Tshabangu close ally and Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume could face jail time after Local Government Minister Daniel Garwe recommended prosecution of city officials implicated in corruption and poor governance, following the conclusion of a year-long Commission of Inquiry into the affairs of the Harare City Council.\n\nThe commission, chaired by retired High Court judge Justice Maphios Cheda, submitted its final report to President Emmerson Mnangagwa at State House on Tuesday.\n\nThe inquiry was initiated by the President in 2023 to investigate suspected financial mismanagement, corruption, and service delivery failures within Zimbabwes capital city.\n\nThe commissions findings painted a grim picture of systemic rot at Town House.\n\nIt exposed widespread corruption, abuse of office, and lavish spending by officials under Mafumes leadershipdespite the council routinely citing a lack of funds to justify failure to deliver basic services to residents.\n\nHarare City Council is decayed to the core, Garwe said following the handover of the report. That is why the President established the Commission of Inquiryto investigate the severe governance failures in our urban local authorities. Harare is the worst, followed by Bulawayo.\n\nHe said the commission uncovered shocking levels of extravagance, with top city officials awarding themselves hefty perks and allowances while ordinary residents grappled with unsafe drinking water, garbage piles, and deteriorating roads.\n\nGarwe indicated that if the commissions report provides evidence of criminal conduct, including financial impropriety, the implicated officialsMayor Mafume includedcould face arrest and prosecution.\n\nThe President will study the report and act on its recommendations. Where criminal activities are confirmed, those responsible should face the full wrath of the law, including imprisonment, Garwe said.\n\nJustice Cheda confirmed that the commission conducted nine months of public hearings, during which various stakeholdersincluding residents, city employees, and expertstestified about the dysfunction at Town House.\n\nThe report is expected to trigger a major clean-up of the citys governance structures once reviewed by the President.\n\nMafume, as the sitting mayor, remains politically and administratively accountable for the state of affairs at the Harare City Council. His future now hinges on the decisions President Mnangagwa will take after reviewing the findings and recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry.\n\n",

They may want to leave the country to evade the law liquidation will force them to account for their financial affairs.\n\nThe case is scheduled to be heard in the High Court on Wednesday.\n\n",

            "content": "LONDON  Zimbabweans based in the United Kingdom have successfully blocked First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa from attending a high-profile summit in London, forcing organisers to quietly remove her from the programme.\n\nMnangagwa was expected to speak at the First Ladies of Africa Impact and Resilience (FLAIR) Summit, held from 17 to 18 June at the Royal Leonardo Hotel near Tower Bridge.\n\nHowever, she was noticeably absent from the event after activists mobilised demonstrations against her visit, citing allegations of corruption, abuse of state resources, and complicity in human rights violations in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe protests had been brewing for weeks, with UK-based Zimbabwean civil society organisations, human rights activists, and members of the diaspora issuing public calls for the UK government to bar her entry.\n\nThey also petitioned event organisers to deplatform the First Lady, accusing her of using philanthropic fronts to sanitise a repressive regime.\n\nIn anticipation of protests, Labour MP Dawn Butler withdrew from the summit in protest against Auxillias scheduled appearance. According toThe Standardnewspaper, Butlers exit triggered an emergency meeting among the organisers, which resulted in Auxillia being quietly dropped from the speaker lineup.\n\nInstead of travelling to London, Auxillia flew to Dubai, where she attended the Merck Foundations First Ladies Initiative Summit from 18 to 19 June. Posting on her official X account while the London event was underway, she wrote:\n\nToday, I met with Mr. Prateek Suri, an Indian billionaire and CEO of Maser Group on the sidelines of the 7th Merck Foundation First Ladies Initiative Summit 2025 underway in Dubai and we discussed several investment opportunities in Zimbabwe in education, sports, mining and infrastructure development sectors. Mr. Suri expressed interest in the construction of a university in Harare with student accommodation facilities at the campus. I invited him to Zimbabwe to have further deliberations with the relevant Cabinet Ministers because Zimbabwe is open for business.\n\nToday, I met with Mr. Prateek Suri, an Indian billionaire and CEO of Maser Group on the sidelines of the 7th Merck Foundation First Ladies Initiative Summit 2025 underway in Dubai and we discussed several investment opportunities in Zimbabwe in education, sports, mining andpic.twitter.com/sUejlxymtD\n\nPresidential spokesperson George Charamba downplayed the First Ladys no-show in London, claiming that she had chosen to skip the event due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nYou can be invited, but you can also turn down an invite, said Charamba, insisting that Auxillia had a full plate with other engagements.\n\nDespite the official explanation, Zimbabweans in the UK have hailed her absence as a diplomatic victory and a show of accountability by citizens in the diaspora. Activists say they will continue to oppose public appearances by senior Zimbabwean officials abroad until there are meaningful reforms back home.\n\n",

            "content": "By Farai D Hove | London, 18 June 2025  South African opposition leader Julius Malema has once again been denied a UK visa, this time in a damning refusal letter from the United Kingdom Home Office citing his extremist positions, repeated justification for terrorist violence, and incendiary comments about race.\n\nThe decision, made by the UK Visas and Immigration Decision Making Centre, explicitly states that Malemas presence in the country is not conducive to the public good. It is the second time the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has been blocked from entering the UK.\n\nAccording to the letter dated 17 June 2025, the UK Home Secretary referenced Malemas repeated public support for Hamas, a proscribed terrorist organisation under British law, and his controversial remarks regarding the slaughter of white people.\n\nI note that you have made statements calling for the slaughter of white people or hinted that it could be an acceptable option in the future, reads the Home Office letter, citing Malemas 2016 statement: We are not calling for the slaughter of white people at least for now.\n\nMalemas refusal comes in the wake of fresh scrutiny over his public speeches and online posts, including an October 2023 rally outside the Israeli Embassy in Pretoria where he vowed to arm Hamas if his party came to power.\n\nHe later posted on X (formerly Twitter), defending the Hamas-led 7 October attack on Israel, writing, There is nothing wrong Hamas did.\n\nThe Home Office said that such remarks  along with the EFFs official support for armed struggle by both Hamas and Hezbollah  amount to justification of terrorist violence.\n\nNo Right to Appeal\n\nThe decision is final. According to the UK Home Office, There is no right of appeal or right to administrative review.\n\nThe Home Secretary added that any future applications will be considered on their individual merits, but warned that Malema is likely to be refused unless the circumstances of [his] application change.\n\nI consider that the above statements, notably that your political party would arm a proscribed organisation and other statements you made justifying the actions of proscribed terrorist organisations, mean your presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.\n\nThe refusal comes as Malema continues to polarise opinion in South Africa and beyond. Critics say his rhetoric incites racial hatred and glorifies violence, while supporters argue he is a misunderstood revolutionary speaking uncomfortable truths.\n\nPopular South African musician and satirist The Kiffness reacted sharply to the UKs move, tweeting:\n\nCouldnt have happened to a nicer guy.\n\nAnother user, RobbC (@IndunaRobb), added:\n\nIts hate speech and our courts should really reevaluate the judgement that allows him to sing it Hopefully a lot of our corrupt cadres are sanctioned and deprived of all the Western/colonial benefits they so desire\n\nLong History of Controversy\n\nIn addition to his support for Hamas, the Home Office cited Malemas 2024 interview in which he said:\n\nHamas legitimately resisted Israels occupation of Palestine It was not an act of war.\n\nHe has also repeatedly refused to distance himself from calls for racial violence, telling a court in 2022:\n\nI cant guarantee I wont call for the slaughter of white people.\n\nWhile Malema has attempted to clarify his cutting the throat of whiteness remarks as metaphoric, the UK authorities remain unconvinced.\n\nWhat It Means Going Forward\n\nThe visa ban significantly curtails Malemas international mobility and could damage his partys credibility abroad. Analysts say this development could set a precedent for other Western countries reviewing similar cases involving inflammatory political rhetoric and associations with outlawed groups.\n\nUnder UK immigration rules, any individual whose conduct, character, or associations are deemed a threat to the public good can be excluded without recourse to appeal.\n\nThe Home Office concluded:\n\nA persons presence in the UK may be considered not conducive to the public good if the individual has been involved in unacceptable behaviour, including past or current extremist behaviour. This covers any medium used to justify or glorify terrorist violence.\n\nMalemas office has not yet issued a formal response.\n\nStory developing\n\n",

Their upcoming match against Al Hilal is projected to feature 3.03 goals  a sign of the attacking firepower Madrid is expected to unleash.\n\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of Trents arrival is none other than Kylian Mbapp. The French forward, already a shot machine, now has a world-class provider feeding him from deep and wide areas. Known for his precision crosses and creative vision, Trent offers a new dimension to Madrids attacking structure.\n\nEven without Trent, Mbapp was already among the most threatening forwards in Europe last season. In the 2024/25 campaign, he averaged 4.71 shots per 90 minutes  the second-highest across Europes top five leagues, trailing only Ousmane Dembl of PSG (4.99). He also averaged 2.32 shots on target per 90, again second-best behind the French winger.\n\nIn terms of end product, Mbapp dominated La Liga, netting 31 goals  more than any other player in the top five European leagues. His 25.9 expected goals (xG) tally was only surpassed by Robert Lewandowskis 27.1 xG, highlighting how prolific and efficient he was in front of goal.\n\nAs the team prepares for a high-profile summer in the U.S., Mbapp looks poised to shine on the international stage. With Alexander-Arnolds elite delivery and Alonsos progressive tactics, the French star could very well claim the tournaments Golden Boot. Few would be surprised if he does.\n\n",

One of the key tools for good farm management is record keeping. Accurate and up-to-date records help farmers track activities, evaluate performance, and make informed decisions.\n\nBelow are the main types of farm records and why they matter:\n\nThese track what the farm produces, whether from crops or livestock.\n\nExamples:\n\nPlanting dates\n\nCrop types or seed varieties used\n\nHarvest quantities\n\nNumber of animals born or sold\n\nQuantity of milk, eggs, or meat produced\n\nWhy They Matter:Production records help farmers identify which crops or animals perform best. This information supports better planning, improved yields, and increased profits in future seasons.\n\nInput records show what has been used to support production on the farm.\n\nExamples:\n\nFertilizers or compost applied\n\nPesticides or organic sprays used\n\nAnimal feed purchases\n\nLabor used for various tasks\n\nWhy They Matter:These records help manage costs and ensure resources are used efficiently. Farmers can compare inputs with outputs to assess whether farming methods are cost-effective.\n\nThese detail the farms income and expenses, offering a full picture of its financial health.\n\nExamples:\n\nSales of farm produce\n\nExpenses on seeds, chemicals, or tools\n\nLoan and repayment details\n\nProfit and loss statements\n\nWhy They Matter:Financial records allow farmers to monitor cash flow, assess profitability, and make smart decisions about budgeting and investment.\n\nInventory records list all the physical assets owned or used by the farm.\n\nExamples:\n\nTools and machinery\n\nLivestock and poultry numbers\n\nStored feed, seeds, and fertilizers\n\nBuildings and storage facilities\n\nWhy They Matter:These records help keep track of valuable assets, avoid unnecessary purchases, and support farm planning and insurance claims.\n\nConclusion\n\nRecord keeping is essential for every farmer who wants to grow a successful and sustainable farming business. Whether small or large-scale, a well-documented farm gives the farmer control, clarity, and the ability to plan for a better future.\n\n[emailprotected]\n\n",
