            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nEleven people have died in two separate road accidents in Mutare and along the HarareNyamapanda Highway between Thursday night and Friday morning.\n\nIn Mutare, six people lost their lives when a Toyota GD6, driven by prominent transport operator Godfrey Chikosi, veered off the road and rolled several times near the Himalaya Turn-Off, close to 9 Miles along the MutareMasvingo Road.\n\nThe crash occurred around 11 PM on Wednesday. Four people, including Chikosi, died on the spot, while two others succumbed to their injuries later. The vehicle had seven occupants. The sole survivor was rushed to Victoria Chitepo Provincial Hospital with serious injuries.\n\nAccording to a state media report, Chikosi lost control of the vehicle before it veered off the road and overturned.\n\nChikosi sustained serious head injuries, together with Vincent Musepa and two ladies only identified by their first names as Patience and Melissa. Three other passengers were seriously injured and rushed to Victoria Chitepo Provincial Hospital, where sadly two died on admission. As we speak, one victim is battling for his life, a source told state media.\n\nAnother source added that Chikosi was driving towards Masvingo when, near the 42km peg close to Himalaya Turn-Off, he lost control. The Toyota GD6 swerved to the left, struck a concrete road sign, and overturned several times before landing on its roof.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) confirmed the accident in a statement shared on X (formerly Twitter). Police said four people were killed in the crash, stating:\n\nThe ZRP confirms a fatal road traffic accident which occurred at the 46 kilometre peg along Mutare  Masvingo Road on 28/08/25. A Toyota Fortuner GD6 vehicle with seven occupants on board veered off the road, hit a concrete road signpost, and overturned several times before landing on its roof. Resultantly, four people died on the spot while three others were injured. The bodies of the victims were taken to Victoria Chitepo Provincial hospital mortuary while the injured are admitted at the same institution.\n\nSeparately, on Friday, a private kombi carrying passengers, bricks, and tombstones overturned along the HarareNyamapanda Highway, killing five people on the spot.\n\n",

            "content": "By Business Correspondent  The struggling Econet Wireless has announced plans to roll out a 5G network, in what it claims is a major step towards improving its services. The announcement, however, comes at a time when the company faces widespread criticism over deteriorating network quality, exorbitant tariffs, and poor customer care.\n\nEconet deputy chief executive officer, Mr Roy Chimanikire, revealed the plans at the companys exhibition stand during the ongoing Zimbabwe Agricultural Show (ZAS). He said Econet has already deployed 300 5G base stations as of July 2025, extending high-speed connectivity to over 500,000 customers. Millions of others remain on 4G (LTE), with some still dependent on outdated 3G services.\n\nChimanikire described the rollout as a step towards positioning Zimbabwe for a full digital economy, saying 5Gs potential goes beyond faster internet speeds to transformative uses in business and industry through the Internet of Things (IoT). He highlighted applications such as smart water management, drone-assisted agriculture, and AI-driven smart parking, as well as the companys new chatbot,Yamurai, which communicates in Shona and Ndebele to resolve customer queries.\n\nIts about the next level of technology in terms of efficiency, scalability, and speed of delivering products and services, he said.\n\nDespite the upbeat messaging, Econets announcement comes against a backdrop of mounting customer dissatisfaction. Over the years, subscribers have repeatedly complained about dropped calls, slow internet speeds, failed mobile money transactions, and prolonged downtime without compensation.\n\nThe company has also come under fire for its steep data and airtime prices, which are among the highest in the region despite Zimbabwes low average incomes. Customers often complain that data bundles mysteriously vanish, while call tariffs rise regularly under the justification of inflation and foreign currency shortages.\n\nCivil society groups, consumer watchdogs, and even government regulators have at different times raised concern about the affordability of Econets services. For instance, while Econet enjoys a dominant market share, its pricing structure has often been accused of putting access to communication beyond the reach of ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nEconets customer care has also become a lightning rod for anger, with reports of subscribers spending hours without getting through to call centres, and unresolved complaints piling up. This has forced many to vent frustrations on social media platforms, turning #Econet and #DataMustFall into recurring trends.\n\nAnalysts say that while the companys 5G and artificial intelligence ambitions may sound impressive, Econet risks alienating its customer base if it does not first address long-standing grievances over affordability and service reliability.\n\nRolling out 5G is commendable, but it feels like a luxury when the basics  such as consistent 4G coverage, affordable data, and reliable customer care  remain unsolved, said one Harare-based telecoms analyst.\n\nEconet, which has faced financial pressures due to Zimbabwes unstable economy and rising operational costs, insists that its investments in next-generation technologies will eventually filter down to better customer experiences. However, until subscribers see tangible improvements in service quality and fairer pricing, skepticism is likely to overshadow the companys latest digital transformation drive.\n\n",

His motion quickly drew backing from fellow Zanu PF councillor Sheron Marombedze.\n\nBut the proposal sparked an angry backlash from opposition councillors Wilstaff Sitemere, Alaica Time, and Ester Zishiri, who accused Manyanga of hijacking the council platform for political mileage. This is not a campaign rally. We are here to focus on service delivery, not to heap praise on political parties, one councillor charged, as the heated exchange briefly brought proceedings to a standstill.\n\nThe tense standoff underscored the sharp political divisions that continue to undermine council business.\n\nA senior council official later played down the fracas, insisting the matter had been resolved. Yes, there was some shouting and strong words exchanged, but these things happen in council meetings, the official said. What is important is that we managed to continue with business after the incident. Everything is now under control.\n\n",
