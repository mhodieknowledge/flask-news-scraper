Her interview was broadcast live by Greathope Funeral Director Moreboys Munetsi, who has taken an active interest in the unfolding investigation.\n\nMunetsi, who was addressing his followers during a Facebook Live session, confirmed that the womanwho remains unnamedwas directly linked to the events that allegedly led to Emmanuels fatal altercation involving a Ugandan national. The live video, viewed by nearly 4,000 people in under an hour, promises to shed light on what transpired on the day Emmanuel was allegedly struck by a vehicle three times.\n\nThe live broadcast description read:\n\nI am talking to the lady arikunzi Emmanuel Mahamba was in a relationship with and she is the one who caused kuti Emmanuel aurayiwe ne this guy from Uganda. She is going to explain what happened on that day and what triggered kuti atsikwe nemota 3 times.\n\nIn his live remarks, Munetsi urged caution and strategy in handling the case, citing widespread police corruption and political interference. There is a lot of information that has surfaced tonight that we didnt know, he said. We need to be very careful and strategic with a lot of politics and corruption in the police, the investigating officer might be corrupted.\n\nMost significantly, Munetsi revealed that the murder case is now believed to be under the jurisdiction of Bryanston Police Station. While emphasizing that he was not drawing conclusions about the current officers involved, he warned of past incidents involving bribery and the silencing of key witnesses.\n\nThere is a recent case where a witness was gunned inside court. You will have to find a way of dealing with the case in a smart way, he cautioned. If they discover youre the one who is at the front, they can send someone to you to gun you down.\n\nWhile refusing to go into the legal merits of the case, Munetsi called for the protection of witnesses and suggested engaging trusted channels within the Sandton Police Station, where he claims to have strong professional relationships.\n\nThe public awaits further statements and potential arrests as Munetsi pledges to pursue the truth strategically. The case has captured national attention and raised questions about the intersection of personal tragedy, justice, and institutional integrity in South Africa.\n\nMore updates to follow.\n\n",

Whether youre driving to the corner store or embarking on a cross-country journey, fastening your seatbelt should be second nature.\n\nIts Not OptionalIts the LawSeatbelt use is mandated by law in many countries, including Zimbabwe, and failure to comply can result in fines, license penalties, or worseserious injury or death. Statistics consistently show that seatbelts significantly reduce the risk of fatal injuries during car accidents.\n\nEvery Trip CountsNo Matter the DistanceMany people tend to neglect seatbelts on short trips, believing that the lower speed or familiar roads make them safe. But research proves otherwise. Most accidents occur within a short radius of a persons home. That means even a quick drive without a seatbelt could turn deadly.\n\nProtect the Little OnesChildren must be properly secured in age-appropriate car seats or booster seats every time they travel. These safety devices are specifically designed to protect young passengers, whose bodies are more vulnerable during collisions. As the campaign says: Children should be buckled on child booster seats. No exceptions.\n\nClick It Every TripMaking seatbelt use a habit is a small action with life-saving results. Every time you enter a vehicle, take a moment to buckle upand ensure everyone else does, too.\n\nIts Simple: Click It and Stay SafeRoad safety begins with you.

When people tried to assist, he just shouted at them and told them to mind their business.\n\nWhat has shocked residents even more is what reportedly happened next.\n\nThe driver then bribed ZRP cops with cash before driving away, another eyewitness claimed. We saw him take out some moneylooked like 15 US dollarsand handed it to the police officers. After that, they just let him go.\n\nSources at the scene said three Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) officers were present but made no attempt to arrest or question the driver after receiving the alleged bribe.\n\nThe condition of the pedestrian remains unclear, and efforts to identify them are ongoing.\n\nThis incident has sparked fresh concerns about law enforcement accountability and the growing culture of impunity on Zimbabwes roads.\n\nLocal residents are now calling on authorities to investigate the matter thoroughly. Its disgraceful. If police can be bought off that easily, what hope do ordinary citizens have for justice? said another concerned bystander.\n\nThe ZRP is yet to issue a formal statement on the matter.\n\n",
