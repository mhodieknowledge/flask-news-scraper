            "content": "By A Correspondent Celebrated Kenyan author and academic Ngg wa Thiongo has died at the age of 87.\n\nRegarded as a titan of African literature, Nggs career spanned over six decades. He chronicled Kenyas journey from colonial rule to independence, using his pen to challenge both colonial and post-colonial regimes. His fearless commitment to writing in African languagesespecially Kikuyucemented his legacy as a literary revolutionary.\n\nBorn James Thiongo Ngg in 1938 in colonial Kenya, Nggs early life was shaped by the brutality of British repression during the Mau Mau uprising. His brother was shot by colonial soldiers, and his village was razed. These experiences heavily influenced his early works.\n\nNggs literary journey took off after he shared the manuscript of his first novelWeep Not, Childwith Chinua Achebe at Makerere University. The novel, published in 1964, was the first major English-language novel by an East African writer. He soon publishedThe River Between,A Grain of Wheat, andPetals of Bloodthe last of which criticized Kenyas new elite.\n\nIn 1977, Ngg abandoned English for Kikuyu and was imprisoned for co-writing a politically charged play. He famously wrote his first Kikuyu novel,Devil on the Cross, on toilet paper while jailed.\n\nExiled for over two decades, he taught at leading universities in the US, including Yale and UC Irvine. Despite enduring jail, exile, cancer, and a brutal home invasion, Ngg remained an outspoken champion of decolonising African literature.\n\nHis seminal workDecolonising the Mindchallenged African writers to abandon colonial languages. He had nine children, including author Mukoma wa Ngg.\n\nThough tipped for the Nobel Prize many times, he never won. Still, Ngg wa Thiongo leaves behind a legacy that reshaped African storytelling forever.\n\nSource: BBC\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent-President Emmerson Mnangagwa has declared the tragic road accident near Sebakwe River, which claimed 12 lives on Tuesday, 27 May, a national disaster.\n\nThe fatal crash occurred just a few kilometres from the Presidents private property, Precabe Farm, situated outside Kwekwe in the Midlands Province. The Sebakwe River area, close to the scene of the crash, is a known traffic black spot that has claimed numerous lives over the years due to its treacherous bends and high volumes of cross-country traffic.\n\nSebakwe River is a significant watercourse in central Zimbabwe, straddling the boundary between the Mashonaland West and Midlands provinces. It not only supports agricultural activities around President Mnangagwas sprawling Precabe Farm but also serves as a vital source of irrigation and livestock water for surrounding farming communities. The region has witnessed increasing vehicular traffic, particularly haulage trucks transporting fuel and agricultural produce.\n\nDetails of the Crash\n\nAccording to the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP), the collision involved a petrol tanker pulling two trailers, a two-tonne truck, and a Nissan AD van carrying 12 passengers. Preliminary investigations indicate that the fuel tanker side-swiped the smaller truck before ploughing head-on into the AD van. The tanker reportedly dragged the van for several metres before overturning and crushing it, resulting in a horrifying scene of destruction and loss of life.\n\nPresidential Condolences and Declaration\n\nIn a message of condolence, President Mnangagwa expressed deep sorrow over the tragedy and extended heartfelt sympathies to the grieving families. He also acknowledged the pressing need to enhance road safety measures across the country.\n\nI learnt with a very heavy heart of the horrific traffic collision yesterday in Midlands which claimed twelve innocent lives, Mnangagwa said.\n\nThe deadly incident adds yet another grim statistic to the needless toll which reckless driving levies on our people and our Nation.\n\nThe President commended the ZRP for deploying high-end technologies to improve traffic management but emphasized that more decisive action is needed to reduce the growing number of road fatalities.\n\nThe duty for safe traffic conduct squarely falls on all road users, while the responsibility to call out reckless road-users includes the general public who should support our law enforcement agencies to tame what in essence has become a traffic jungle, he added.\n\nHe announced that the government would take full responsibility for the burial of the deceased and provide support to the injured, who are currently receiving treatment in local hospitals.\n\nI have since directed the responsible arms of my Government to declare this traffic accident a national disaster, Mnangagwa said. This crucial legal step paves the way for Government to move in and take all-round responsibility for the interment of all those who perished in the accident, and for support to those hospitalised.\n\nPublic Response\n\nThe declaration has been welcomed by affected families and the general public, though it has also reignited calls for the government to invest more in road safety infrastructure, particularly in accident-prone areas like Sebakwe.\n\nAs investigations into the cause of the crash continue, authorities have urged all motorists to exercise extreme caution, especially when driving along highways with known danger zones.\n\n",

On a recent occasion, we submitted a formal letter to the Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, calling for their intervention in addressing the deepening crisis of state capture and presidential incapacity affecting our nation. The letter outlines rampant corruption by President Emmerson Mangagwa and his associates, which has plunged the country into unprecedented institutional collapse.Tragically, those who delivered the letter on behalf of the citizens are now being hunted and their lives are at serious risk. Some have fled to neighboring countries and are now living as undocumented immigrants, unable to regularize their stay due to the suddenness of their escape.We humbly appeal to you, as leaders of the SADC community, to protect these individuals from political persecution.We also wish to alert you to the emergence of a shadowy terror group within Zimbabwe, sponsored to abduct and intimidate citizens who oppose President Mangagwas attempts to illegally extend his term and entrench dynastic rule. This militia-like group represents a severe threat to national security and the safety of innocent civilians. We urgently call upon your offices to investigate and take immediate action against this threat.The scale of corruption perpetrated by the Mangagwa administration has become intolerable. State resources are being plundered for personal enrichment, leading to widespread deprivation and hardship across the country. We are convinced that only decisive regional action can help restore governance, accountability and democratic order in Zimbabwe.Accordingly, we respectfully request that you:\n\n",

They also dug trenches at the entrance and along several roads within the farm.\n\nWhen the police attempted to disperse the group, the accused and others already on remand resisted, leading to a commotion.\n\nThe disturbance caused a traffic jam on the highway, prompting the police to deploy tear smoke to try and disperse the settlers. Several police officers were injured during the confrontation. Amid the chaos, the accused allegedly took a riot gun from a police officer and fled with it. He was later arrested on May 26, 2025, by a Support Unit team, reads the court documents.\n\nIn March, Magistrate Moyo had found seven land invaders guilty of contravening the Regional Town and Country Planning Act for illegally occupying Cloverdale Farm.\n\nChirambadare was among the settlers.\n\nThe seven were convicted based on evidence presented in court, which confirmed that the land belongs to Glorious Properties, represented by Kagonye.\n\nThe magistrate also noted that Glorious Properties provided documentary evidence showing they had been allocated the land and granted permission to develop the stands by the Ministry of Local Government.-ZimEye\n\n",

Chivayos Online Meltdown Draws Mockery, Psychological Speculation\n\nHarare  28 May 2025\n\nBy Showbiz Reporter | Businessman Wicknell Chivayo has once again found himself at the centre of social media ridicule after launching a crude attack on exiled cricket icon Henry Olonga. But this time, its not just his target thats making headlines  its the publics blunt reaction to Chivayo himself.\n\nAs screenshots of Chivayos disparaging comment about Olongas nationality and hairstyle spread, Facebook users did not hold back in diagnosing the man behind the insult. From mockery to outright concern over his mental state, the comments reveal growing unease over Chivayos behaviour despite his immense wealth.\n\nWith all the money he has, why is he always mad??? questioned Mukundi Chifamba, whose comment sparked a flurry of responses dissecting Chivayos psychological state.\n\nPope Shumba TheTenth replied, He knows this guy who he is  thats a kind response judging with what he did. His comment hinted at an internal recognition of guilt or conflict.\n\nMai Tawana Pirie went further, suggesting Chivayos condition was supernatural: Haa maghost aya. Kune maghost akawanda akuzviti Chivhayo. (Translation: These are ghosts. There are many ghosts calling themselves Chivayo now.)\n\nTop fan Jo Jo added, Money is not everything. Hes lacking something, reflecting a sentiment echoed by many Zimbabweans who see Chivayos lavish lifestyle as masking deeper issues.\n\nJuwett Katyora concluded the thread bluntly: Ndo kuromba kwacho ikoko, implying that Chivayos wealth may be the result of occult practices or spiritual manipulationa controversial claim often levelled at sudden millionaires in Zimbabwe.\n\nAs social media users continue to dissect his erratic behaviour, questions loom over whether Chivayos public outbursts are signs of unresolved personal trauma, spiritual conflict, or simply the side-effects of unchecked ego.\n\nDespite his riches, Chivayo is discovering that in the eyes of the people, true respect is earnednot bought.\n\n ENDS \n\n",

Fans who once packed Rufaro Stadium with drums, chants, and sky-blue jerseys are now left disillusioned as the team lurches from one dismal performance to another.\n\nCritics point to poor administrative decisions, lack of investment in quality players, and coaching instability as major contributors to the decline.\n\nWhile other clubs have modernized and built on youth development, Dynamos appears stuck in the past, unable to adapt to the evolving dynamics of the modern game.\n\nThe loss of glamour is not just about resultsits about identity. Where once stood a proud symbol of footballing excellence in Zimbabwe, there now stands a team struggling to rediscover its soul. As rivals like FC Platinum and Highlanders continue to grow stronger, Dynamos risks becoming a relic of a bygone era rather than a pillar of the present.\n\nUnless urgent and meaningful reforms are implemented both on and off the pitch, Dynamos FCs legacy may be left to gather dust in history books, rather than being etched into new chapters of Zimbabwean football.\n\n",

There is a resilient economic structure in the country after surviving economic sanctions by Zimbabwe.\n\nHe further claimed that the local economy was outpacing global giants. England is struggling to revive its steel economy whilst we have a vibrant one, he said, in remarks many critics have since called tone-deaf given the daily economic struggles faced by ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nMutsvangwa defended Mnangagwas legitimacy, describing him as a leader elected by the people. He also took a swipe at opposition activists, particularly those associated with the failed March 31st movement. The people doing attacks against President Mnangagwa have a reckless unfulfilled ambition for power, he said. They thought chaos and confusion would transfer power to people who are power hungry.\n\nHe further claimed those plotting against the government had failed in their attempts. There is a lot of humble pie being eaten by those people who tried to cause chaos.

The sacrifice of the liberation struggle should never be taken in vain, President Mnangagwa is walking on a narrow path to make sure that Zimbabwe becomes a successful economy.\n\nDespite Mutsvangwas optimistic tone, Zimbabwe continues to grapple with soaring inflation, currency instability, and growing public unrest.
