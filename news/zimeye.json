            "content": "By A CorrespondentMARONDERA ZANU PF leaders in Mashonaland East have thrown their weight behind President Emmerson Mnangagwa, calling for him to continue steering the country past 2028 despite constitutional limits on presidential terms.\n\nThe announcement was made at a Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC) meeting held in Marondera, where party officials unanimously endorsed the push for Mnangagwa to extend his rule as part of advancing Zimbabwes Vision 2030 agenda.\n\nDelivering the official resolution, the partys Secretary for Legal Affairs in the province, Pension Chiutsi, said every district had rallied behind Mnangagwas leadership.\n\nAll structures in the province were clear in their submissions. The first resolution for 2025 states: His Excellency, President and First Secretary of ZANU PF, Cde Dr Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, must continue leading both the party and government until Vision 2030 has been fully realized, said Chiutsi.\n\nThe declaration drew resounding applause from senior party members, positioning Mashonaland East as the first province to formally endorse Mnangagwas continued stay in power beyond the current constitutional framework.\n\nBacking the resolution, Provincial Chairman  Daniel Garwe praised Mnangagwa for guiding the nation through difficult times, including natural disasters and economic shocks.\n\nWhether it was Cyclone Idai, the COVID-19 pandemic, or persistent droughts, the President ensured that people were not abandoned. He has shown resilience, foresight, and unity of purpose, Garwe said.\n\nHe added that the party believes Mnangagwas leadership is essential for the countrys long-term prosperity.\n\nThis is why we insist that Vision 2030 cannot be derailed. The President must remain in office until this national goal is achieved, Garwe declared.\n\nCalling for discipline and loyalty within party ranks, Garwe concluded: Our duty is to stand firmly behind the President and the party. Loyalty is the foundation of our success.\n\n",

It veered off the road, rolled several times, and landed in a ditch, Insp Kohwera said.\n\nMwingas father, an engineer, wasseriously injured, while three other family members, who were also in the car, remain hospitalised.\n\nAn eyewitness toldH-Metrothat the graduate was still in her academic gown when the crash happened.\n\nThe car burst a left-side tyre before overturning. I managed to pull out the father, mother, and the child. What pained me most was seeing people filming instead of helping, the witness said.\n\nThe CUT community described Mwinga as a talented student whose life ended far too soon.\n\nIt is with profound regret and a deep sense of loss that we inform you of the passing ofPanashe Mwinga, a gifted young lady who had just graduated. Her untimely passing is a profound loss to the university community and to all who had the privilege of sharing her journey, saidMalvin Saint Madanda, CUT SRC Minister for External Affairs, Information and Publicity.\n\nMwingas death marks thefourth loss of a CUT student within nine months. Two students have died in accidents, while two others recently took their own lives.\n\nJust last month, first-year Agricultural Engineering studentAbraham Chabatawas found dead after drinking poison at the campus sports field. He left a suicide note addressed to his family. His death came barely four days after another student,Takudzwa Alex Mapurisa, also took his own life following a long battle with mental health challenges.\n\nThe back-to-back tragedies have left the CUT community shaken and grappling with grief.\n\nMadanda said the campus had been plunged into mourning.\n\nIt is with deep sorrow that we inform you of the passing of Abraham Chabata. This loss has sent ripples of grief across our institution, and we extend our sincerest condolences to his family, friends, classmates, and all who knew him.\n\nAs we reflect on these tragedies, we are reminded of the silent battles many among us may be facing. We urge all students to open up about their struggles to family, trusted friends, or peer counsellors.\n\nIn response to Mwingas death, the CUT Students Representative Council declaredMonday a Black Day, urging students to wear black as a symbol of collective mourning and solidarity.\n\nWe encourage all students to wear black on this day as a sign of respect and remembrance, said Madanda.\n\nThe recent spate of deaths has raised alarm over the welfare and mental health of students, with the university community now calling for stronger support systems to help prevent further loss of young lives.\n\n",

The match eventually ended in a 22 stalemate against Kilmarnock, but Maswanhises sharp finish highlighted his growing importance to the side.\n\nOver in England, Warriors vice-captain Marshall Munetsi was once again influential in midfield.

Instead of begging for scraps from abroad, we need sound policies that create opportunities for our citizens at home. Its time for a new direction, one that prioritizes job creation, economic growth, and sustainable development.\n\nThe opposition leader outlined his partys economic vision, urging leaders to focus on reforms that will address Zimbabwes deep-rooted structural problems.\n\nWe urge our leaders to focus on creating a conducive business environment, investing in infrastructure, and promoting innovation, he said. Only then can we stem the brain drain and encourage our talented Zimbabweans to build their country.\n\nMakaza also said the September 13 launch of Freedom Fighters for Change would mark the beginning of a movement for economic revival and dignity that seeks to restore hope to ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nOur people deserve more than empty promises.
