            "content": "Road safety is not just a matter of government policy or law enforcement; it is a collective responsibility that falls on every individual.\n\nWhile authorities play a crucial role in setting rules, providing infrastructure, and enforcing traffic laws, the safety of our roads depends on how each of us behaves behind the wheel or as a pedestrian.\n\nIts easy to assume that road safety is solely the responsibility of lawmakers and authorities, but the reality is that every person who uses the road contributes to creating a safer or more dangerous environment. Drivers, passengers, cyclists, and even pedestrians all have a part to play in ensuring that our roads remain safe for everyone.\n\nThe Importance of Safe Driving\n\nOne of the most significant contributors to road safety is the way we drive. Speeding, distracted driving, and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs are all actions that put not only the driver but also other road users at serious risk. Being aware of road conditions, following traffic signals, wearing seat belts, and respecting speed limits are some of the simplest yet most effective ways to avoid accidents.\n\nDriving safely involves more than just adhering to the lawit means being conscious of other drivers and pedestrians, maintaining a safe distance, and reacting calmly in emergency situations. The decision to drive responsibly can prevent countless accidents and save lives.\n\nPedestrians and Cyclists: Sharing the Road\n\nRoad safety isnt just about cars. Pedestrians and cyclists also need to be vigilant and responsible. Pedestrians should use crosswalks, avoid jaywalking, and stay alert when walking near busy streets. Similarly, cyclists must wear helmets, signal their turns, and follow traffic rules to minimize the risk of accidents.\n\nEveryone, regardless of how they travel, plays a part in maintaining road safety. Drivers must be aware of pedestrians and cyclists, while pedestrians and cyclists should respect the rules designed to protect them.\n\nA Culture of Responsibility\n\nBuilding a culture of road safety starts with individuals taking responsibility for their actions. Whether you are driving, cycling, or walking, your behavior on the road can have a direct impact on others. Everyone should recognize that safety is not just a matter of personal well-being but also the well-being of everyone else on the road.\n\nConclusion\n\nRoad safety is not only about laws and regulations; it is about creating a culture where everyone takes responsibility for their actions. To ensure that roads are safe for everyone, we must all participatedrivers, pedestrians, cyclists, and law enforcement. The message is simple: Drive safely, save lives. Lets make road safety a shared priority for all.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.zimeye.net/2024/12/19/we-tried-to-manipulate-polls-and-failed-outgoing-ghanaian-president-concedes-defeat/",
            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a rare and admirable display of statesmanship, outgoing Ghanaian President Mahamudu Bawumia acknowledged his partys defeat in the recent elections and offered a candid reflection on the factors that led to the loss.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Bawumia openly admitted that his partys time had simply come to an end, and no amount of political manipulation could have reversed the outcome.\n\nBawumias election concession speech was a moment of profound introspection, as he addressed both his party members and the nation. No amount of monopolization of the media space could save us. No amount of money could stop our defeat. No amount of local and international celebrity endorsements could help us. And no amount of vote buying could stand the irresistible hurricane of change that shook our nation on Wednesday, he said, acknowledging that despite all efforts, the winds of change were too strong to resist.\n\nUrging his party members to stop the blamestorming that had begun after the election, Bawumia called for unity and reflection. We must stop blaming one another so we can brainstorm on how to get ourselves out of the mess we have put ourselves in, he stated, emphasizing that the future of the party appeared bleak and required serious reevaluation.\n\nThe future of our great party looks gloomy and we have to start work on how to get ourselves out of what appears like an eternal stay in opposition, Bawumia continued. In life, when you are hit by the subduing blow of misfortune, you have two options. You can allow that blow to crush you, or you can move on with the enormous lessons such misfortunes often present.\n\nWhile unsure of his immediate future in politics, Bawumia was clear about the lessons learned from the defeat. I cannot immediately tell my next move in life, politics and my role in our great party, he confessed. But if I should ever make a comeback to politics, the lessons I have learnt from our defeat should serve as the moral code which will guide how I guide myself.\n\nAmong the lessons Bawumia shared, he remarked that the Ghanaian voter, though largely uneducated and simple, proved to be far more sophisticated than his party had previously thought. I have learnt that the Ghanaian voter, though mainly uneducated and simple, is more sophisticated than we thought, he stated.\n\nHe also acknowledged the growing discontent with corruption, incompetence, and inequality, lessons that would inform his future political approach.\n\nReflecting on the elections results, Bawumia said, I have learnt that hate of corruption can win. It has taught me that hate of incompetence can win.\n\nOur defeat has taught me that hate of impunity can win. He continued by emphasizing that hatred of corruption and the obscene display of ill-gotten wealth were driving forces behind the defeat. I have learnt that the hate of the obscene display of ill-gotten opulence wins.\n\nI have learnt that hate of mediocrity and deception definitely wins. And I have learnt that hating evil will forever triumph over the love of evil. That was what happened on Wednesday.\n\nAnother key takeaway for Bawumia was the importance of surrounding oneself with capable and principled individuals. Reflecting on his own leadership, he noted, While Rawlings appointed the likes of Dr. Mohammed Ibn Chambas as deputy ministers, I made the mistake of giving that respectable position to the likes of John Oti Bless.\n\nHe acknowledged that had he kept voices of reason around him, such as Ben Dotsei Malor and Dr. Raymond Atuguba, they would have brought much-needed stability and respectability to his administration.\n\nI have now realised, rather too late, that if I had kept the likes of Ben Dotsei Malor and Dr. Raymond Atuguba around me, they would have injected some semblance of sanity into the presidency and given that high office an aura of respectability and decency, Bawumia reflected.\n\nHe also criticized the sycophants who surrounded him, stating, The praise-singing sycophants who act on the dictates of their stomachs are only specialized at telling you what you want to hear.\n\nUnfortunately, I did not listen to voices of reason. Our elders say a disease that will kill a man first breaks sticks into his ears.\n\nBawumias concession speech marks a moment of rare humility and reflection in Ghanaian politics, as he openly confronts the failures of his party and the lessons learned from their electoral defeat. Whether this will lead to a genuine transformation of the political landscape in Ghana remains to be seen, but Bawumias candidness in accepting responsibility for his partys loss is a significant step toward introspection and growth.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a bid to salvage the countrys struggling economy, the Zimbabwean government has launched a draconian, door-to-door crackdown aimed at confiscating smuggled goods that are flooding the nation, particularly during the festive season.\n\nThe move comes as the regime seeks to boost its revenue and combat the crippling losses incurred from smuggling, which officials estimate at up to US$1 billion annually.\n\nThe operation, which began as a response to the growing scale of illicit cross-border trade, is being described as one of the most aggressive measures the government has taken against smuggling in recent years.\n\nAs Zimbabweans flock home for the Christmas and New Year holidays, many of them bring goods, primarily from neighboring South Africa, leading to a surge in smuggled goods entering the country.\n\nEngineer Tafadzwa Muguti, the Permanent Secretary for Presidential Affairs in the Office of the President, spoke to the press yesterday, outlining the governments strategy for tackling this pervasive issue. This December, we will have inter-governmental agencies stationed at our major border posts to ensure zero tolerance for smugglers. The task force will conduct door-to-door inspections of all goods in wholesale and retail shops, Muguti said, emphasizing the governments commitment to eradicating smuggling at all levels.\n\nThe crackdown is not limited to the borders or businesses but extends to ordinary citizens. Those found in possession of smuggled goods will face imprisonment without the option for bail, sending a clear and chilling message to anyone involved in the trade of illicit goods. This move, while hailed by the government as necessary to protect the economy and curb tax evasion, has been met with widespread concern and resentment from the public.\n\nMany Zimbabweans, struggling under the weight of an already oppressive economic situation, view this latest initiative as another sign of a desperate regime clinging to power by any means necessary. With the country grappling with inflation, joblessness, and a broken economy, the governments sudden focus on smuggling smacks of a financially strapped administration scrambling for quick fixes rather than addressing the root causes of the nations woes.\n\nThe timing of the crackdown is particularly harsh, as it coincides with the holiday season, when many families depend on remittances and goods brought in from abroad to make ends meet. The governments actions have left citizens feeling persecuted during a time meant for celebration and family reunions. Critics argue that while smuggling may contribute to the economys woes, the governments methodstargeting struggling businesses and citizensserve only to exacerbate their suffering.\n\nWe are already living in dire conditions, and now they want to come to our homes and take whatever little we have, one local retailer lamented. The government is broke, and instead of tackling the real issues like unemployment and the collapse of industries, theyre focusing on poor people trying to survive. Its just another way to torment us.\n\nThe move has drawn comparisons to the governments previous attempts to increase state revenue through punitive measures. In 2024, the regime had already launched efforts to curb illegal businesses and smuggling at border posts and entertainment spots. However, the widespread crackdown on ordinary citizens goods has sparked a new wave of backlash, as people fear that even their personal belongings could be seized in the process.\n\nSmuggling has indeed become a serious problem, especially with many goods entering the country via informal routes. The Zimbabwean economy, which has been ravaged by years of mismanagement, corruption, and sanctions, now faces a difficult balancing act of trying to sustain itself through harsh fiscal policies while simultaneously suppressing any form of economic survival that its citizens may engage in.\n\nMinister of Finance and Economic Development, Professor Mthuli Ncube, recently addressed the issue in the context of the national budget.\n\nSmuggling undermines our economy and exacerbates the challenges faced by local industries, he said. We are prepared to take all necessary steps to safeguard our economic interests, even if it means taking tough actions against those who evade the law.\n\nDespite such assertions, the harsh measures have only underscored the governments desperation.\n\nAs one economist noted, Rather than addressing the structural issues causing smuggling, such as the lack of local production and widespread poverty, the regime is resorting to authoritarian tactics to generate quick revenue.\n\nThe governments door-to-door crackdown serves as a stark reminder of the lengths to which a financially crippled regime will go to shore up its coffers, often at the expense of its citizens. While the authorities claim that this operation is meant to protect local industries and consumer welfare, many Zimbabweans are left wondering whether their personal freedoms and hard-earned possessions will be the next casualties in the regimes desperate struggle for survival.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tinashe Sambiri\n\nZimbabwes opposition leader, Advocate Nelson Chamisa, has launched a scathing critique of President Emmerson Mnangagwas government, describing the countrys current state as trabablas.\n\nChamisas comments follow a controversial decision by the government to rename the Mbudzi Interchange in Harare to the Trabablas Interchange. The name change has sparked widespread public debate, with many seeing it as symbolic of the countrys spiraling troubles.\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, Chamisa seized on the renaming as a metaphor for Zimbabwes broader woes, which he argues are driven by an incompetent and disorganized administration.\n\nITS ALL TRABABLAS We are living in Trabablas times. Its really a trabablas administration, running a trabablas economy, with trabablas policies and a trabablas currency! Especially after trabablas elections, Chamisa declared, highlighting what he perceives as the absurdity of the governments actions amid widespread economic and political crises.\n\nChamisas use of the term trabablas is a direct attack on the ruling regime, suggesting that Mnangagwas government is ineffective and chaotic.\n\nThe term has quickly resonated with many Zimbabweans, who are grappling with a collapsing economy, high inflation, unemployment, and a currency that has lost much of its value.\n\nThe decision to rename Mbudzi Interchange, a key junction in Harare, has been widely criticized, with critics arguing that it reflects the governments misplaced priorities. Instead of focusing on addressing pressing issues such as poverty, healthcare, and infrastructure, Mnangagwas administration has been accused of engaging in symbolic gestures that do little to alleviate the countrys problems.\n\nChamisa, who has consistently challenged Mnangagwas legitimacy since the controversial 2018 elections, argues that Zimbabwes political and economic systems are in disarray under the current government. We have a country where everything is falling apart: the economy is crumbling, businesses are closing, and ordinary Zimbabweans are struggling to survive, he said.\n\nBut instead of focusing on real solutions, the government is changing names and engaging in trivial distractions.\n\nHis remarks also refer to the recent presidential elections, which he and many international observers have criticized as neither free nor fair. Especially after trabablas elections, Chamisa added, alluding to the contested nature of the polls that many believe were marred by irregularities and voter suppression.\n\nIn this context, trabablas has become more than just a catchphrase; its a symbol of the frustration and disillusionment felt by many Zimbabweans.\n\nThe term was also used by Mnangagwas deputy, Constantino Chiwenga three years ago at Great Zimbabwe Ruins.\n\nChamisas critique of the government resonates with the growing public sentiment that Mnangagwas administration is not only failing to address critical issues but is also increasingly out of touch with the realities faced by the people.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues to grapple with a myriad of challenges, Chamisas pointed remarks underscore the discontent that many Zimbabweans feel about the direction in which the country is headed. Whether the ruling government will heed these criticisms or continue with its current approach remains to be seen.\n\n",

            "content": "By Crime and Courts-The family of the late member of the Military Intelligence who died in unclear circumstances is demanding answers from Authorities.\n\nHillary Nleya went missing last month after being last seen at Redwood along the Plumtree-Bulawayo road.\n\nHis body was later discovered hanging from a tree in Figtree, Matabeleland South.\n\nSince then, the authorities have not provided clear answers to how the spy soldier died and rather said they were treating the case as a potential suicide.\n\nHowever, sources close to the investigation said the death was linked to his work in military intelligence, raising speculation about foul play.\n\nThe Military Intelligence operates as a covert arm of the Zimbabwe National Army, tasked with managing high-level state security matters.\n\nIts methods reportedly include eliminating individuals deemed security risks, with a chilling record of disappearances and killings.\n\nThe department is believed to have been involved in the disappearance of journalist and activist Itai Dzamara on March 9, 2015, whose fate remains unknown nearly a decade later.\n\nAnother infamous case tied to military intelligence is that of Rashiwe Guzha, a typist with the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) who disappeared in May 1990, amid reports of her romantic involvement with the late CIO Deputy Director Edson Shirihuru.\n\nShirihuru himself died in 1993 after vowing to reveal the truth behind Guzhas disappearance if convicted in court.\n\nFollowing the 2017 military coup that ousted President Robert Mugabe, President Emmerson Mnangagwa restructured the state security framework, sidelining the CIO, which he viewed as pro-Mugabe, and consolidated state security responsibilities under Zimbabwe Military Intelligence.\n\nCritics have accused Mnangagwa of using this unit to target his perceived enemies and suppress dissent.\n\nThe mysterious death of Hillary Nleya has drawn public attention, particularly after his relative, Senator Lwazi Sibanda, who delivered an emotional address in Parliament.\n\nSpeaking during a recent debate on the Death Penalty Abolition Bill, Sibanda described Nleyas death as a murder by unknown assailants.I rise with a heavy heart, she said. I am a woman, a mother, and a Senator of this country, yet I stand here with a cousin lying in the mortuaryHillary Nleyawhom we searched for over two weeks, only to find him dead in Figtree. He was murdered by a person we do not yet know.The Senator recounted the anguish of planning her cousins burial while fulfilling her parliamentary duties. Nleya is to be buried in Dombodema, Plumtree.\n\nIn her address, Sibanda condemned the increasing violence in Zimbabwe, citing a recent case in which a familys hut was burned down by unknown assailants while they were asleep inside.\n\nShe also lamented the challenges of forgiving perpetrators who show no remorse, highlighting the pain felt by families of murder victims.\n\nHer remarks resonated with broader concerns about the state of law and order in Zimbabwe, where politically motivated killings and disappearances have long been a source of public fear and distrust.\n\nEfforts to obtain a comment from the Zimbabwe National Army were unsuccessful.\n\n",
