            "content": "CAPS United president Farai Jere has put to rest speculation surrounding head coach Lloyd Chitembwes future at the club, affirming that he will remain in charge despite the teams poor start to the season.\n\nThe Green Machine is currently struggling in 17th position with four points after six matchdays, sparking calls for Chitembwes dismissal following losses to Ngezi Platinum Stars and Highlanders. However, Jere expressed confidence in Chitembwes abilities, citing his experience and achievements, including the 2016 championship win.\n\nLloyd Chitembwe is not going anywhere, Jere stated. We value his experience, and I plan to extend his contract by another three years. Chitembwes current contract is set to expire, but Jeres intention is clear.\n\nInstead of replacing Chitembwe, the club is looking to appoint a new assistant coach. Jere revealed that they are close to finalizing the appointment, having interviewed a promising candidate who is a CAF A-qualified coach with championship-winning experience. The new assistant coach is expected to join the team within two weeks.\n\n",

In the aftermath of the collision, a once-pristine Rovos Rail luxury carriage lies crumpled and torn, its fine finish reduced to wreckage. Coal is strewn across the ground like spilled ink, blackening the tracks and surrounding bush. Emergency responders, clad in heavy firefighting gear, climb across the unstable ruins, working against time to rescue the injured. Amid the chaos, stretcher teams carefully lift survivors from the tangle of metal and shattered machinery, as stunned onlookers gather below. Each image tells a story of sudden disaster, human resilience, and a scene transformed from opulence to calamity.\n\n",
