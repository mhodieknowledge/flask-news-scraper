            "content": "London  17 July 2025By A Correspondent | ZimEye | A Zimbabwean national based in the United Kingdom, Tatenda Nyamapfeka, also known as Johnson, has been exposed for orchestrating a high-value immigration scam involving the sale of non-existent Certificate of Sponsorship (COS) documents.\n\nAccording to a formal agreement signed on 10 October 2024, Nyamapfeka received 31,000 from a victim for what were claimed to be valid UK COS documents to support skilled worker visa applications. However, the documents were found to be invalid, leaving the client out of pocket and with no pathway to legal employment in the UK.\n\nTatenda Nyamapfeka\n\n The Fraud and Failed Repayments\n\nDespite acknowledging receipt of the money and signing a repayment agreement in the presence of his wife, Cindy Nyamapfeka, and a mediator, Nyamapfeka has failed to honour the agreed repayment plan.\n\nKey points of the agreement included: Initial repayment of 5,000 by 7 November 2024 A monthly payment plan to cover the remaining 26,000, with figures to be agreed upon by 13 October 2024 Witness oversight by Cindy Nyamapfeka\n\nAs of today, only 2,500 has been repaid, and no monthly payment plan was ever communicated. This has prompted calls for law enforcement agencies and immigration fraud investigators to act swiftly.\n\n Victim Speaks Out\n\nThe victim, who believed the COS would secure them a legitimate job in the UK, said:\n\nThis has not only cost me financially, but emotionally and mentally. I was desperate to regularize my status and support my family. Now Im left stranded and deeply betrayed.\n\n Community Urges Action\n\nObservers familiar with the case expressed concern over the growing number of similar scams in the UK diaspora community:\n\nThis case highlights how trust is being weaponized to exploit migrants. These scammers are destroying lives with impunity. Its time for community leaders and UK authorities to treat these incidents as serious criminal offences.\n\n Legal and Criminal Consequences\n\nLegal analysts say the case could trigger: A private prosecution for fraud and breach of contract Civil recovery action for the remaining 28,500 Investigation by the UK Home Office and police into immigration-related fraud\n\nNyamapfekas continued silence and failure to repay as agreed has now placed him in potential legal jeopardy, with signed documents and recorded calls confirming liability.\n\nIf you or someone you know has been defrauded under similar COS schemes, report immediately to Action Fraud UK or consult an immigration solicitor.\n\nStory developing\n\n",

            "content": "By Business Reporter-One of the countrys largest retail chains, OK Zimbabwe is auctioning off four supermarkets and other key properties in a desperate attempt to stay afloat amid Zimbabwes deepening economic collapse driven by the failure of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency.\n\nThe shocking move was announced Thursday at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) held in Harare, where shareholders endorsed a sweeping rescue package that includes raising US$20 million through a rights offer and disposing of immovable assets to raise an additional US$10.4 million.\n\nGroup chairman Herbert Nkala revealed that the affected properties include flagship outlets such as OK Mbuya Nehanda in Harare, OK Gweru, OK Glen View, and OK Malvern in Waterfalls. Other assets on the auction block include a warehouse in Workington, a commercial stand in Borrowdale, and another along the Harare-Masvingo Highway in Southlea Park.\n\nThe drastic measures come as the retail sector buckles under Zimbabwes hyperinflationary environment and chronic currency instability. The ZiG, introduced with much fanfare by the Reserve Bank in April 2024 to replace the Zimbabwe dollar, has already lost significant value, decimating consumer purchasing power and choking off capital for businesses reliant on local liquidity.\n\nThe economy is in freefall, and the ZiG has failed to inspire the confidence it was meant to restore. Companies are struggling to restock, pay suppliers, and even service basic debt, said an analyst with a leading financial services firm.\n\nNkala said the rescue planunderwritten by key shareholders such as the National Social Security Authority (NSSA), Datvest Nominees, and Old Mutual Life Assurance Companywill be used to restock shelves, repay overdue creditors, modernise stores, and implement new technologies.\n\nThe US$20 million renounceable rights offer will see the issuance of 1.83 billion new shares at a subscription price of US$0.0109 each, payable in hard currency. Shareholders will receive 1.37 new shares for every 1 share held as of July 21, 2025.\n\nIn a bid to steady the ship, the board has also been reconfigured, and former executives have been temporarily brought back to provide leadership while a new executive team is appointed to drive the recovery strategy.\n\nAccording to a circular issued ahead of the EGM, the asset disposal and recapitalisation efforts are part of a broader, long-term turnaround plan to rebuild supply chain trust, improve operational efficiency, and prevent further erosion of shareholder value.\n\nThe crisis at OK Zimbabwe reflects the wider economic devastation in Zimbabwes retail sector, where companies are closing branches, cutting staff, and scaling down operations due to a toxic mix of inflation, shrinking demand, and policy instability. As the government continues to blame sanctions and economic saboteurs, ordinary citizens and struggling businesses are left paying the price.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nHARARE In a move widely seen as yet another assault on free expression, the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ) has issued a chilling warning targeting digital content creators and online platforms. Critics say its nothing more than a renewed attempt to muzzle dissent and tighten state control over public discourse.\n\nDisguised in bureaucratic jargon about national values and responsible broadcasting, BAZs latest statement condemned what it called the rising trend of internet-based broadcasting allegedly violating national regulations. It cited vague concerns over unverified, harmful or offensive materialterms so broad they could be used to target virtually any criticism of the government.\n\nThese incidents represent a blatant disregard for the guidelines provided in the nations broadcasting laws, the statement readsthough it notably fails to offer a single example of what constitutes such violations, raising suspicions about the real intent behind this sudden concern.\n\nRather than defending ethics or media integrity, BAZs message reads like a threat. It explicitly warns that it will continue to monitor both traditional and digital media and will not hesitate to decisively enforce existing laws. For many Zimbabweans, this rings alarm bellsits a familiar tactic in a country where freedom of speech has long been under siege.\n\nAs traditional media continues to suffer from censorship and political interference, digital platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and X (formerly Twitter) have become lifelines for alternative voices. The regimes growing discomfort with these platforms signals a fear of losing control over the national narrative.\n\nBAZs heavy-handed warning appears less about upholding standards and more about intimidating those who dare to speak truth to power. Its a classic case of using vague legislation and broad interpretation to justify censorship.\n\nMeanwhile, the real issuespress freedom, media reform, and political accountabilityare ignored. Zimbabwes broadcasting laws remain archaic and overtly repressive, designed for an era of state monopoly over information. Instead of adapting to the realities of digital expression, BAZ seems intent on dragging the country backward.\n\nBy urging content creators to familiarise themselves with the Code of Conduct, BAZ reveals its true aim: silencing dissent and shielding the political elite from public scrutiny.\n\nUntil Zimbabwe confronts its outdated and authoritarian approach to media regulation, moves like these will continue to be seen not as protectionsbut as threats dressed in the language of law.\n\n",

            "content": "By Health Correspondent-The government, under fire for its failure to deliver basic health services in public hospitals, is now turning its attention to the private healthcare sector  proposing sweeping reforms that critics say amount to a veiled crackdown.\n\nThrough the Medical Services Amendment Bill, government seeks to regulate how much private hospitals can charge, and compel them to admit and stabilise patients in life-threatening conditions for at least 48 hours  even if those patients cannot pay upfront.\n\nJustice, Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi tabled the controversial proposals in Parliament this week, describing them as a necessary alignment of healthcare delivery with Section 76 of the Constitution, which guarantees every citizen the right to basic and emergency medical care.\n\nThe Bill will give the Minister of Health sweeping powers to cap fees and limit increases at private hospitals  effectively placing them under state control. Any attempt to exceed these limits, or raise charges beyond government-sanctioned thresholds, would require written approval from the Minister.\n\nThis Bill, Mr Speaker Sir, is a testament to our commitment to ensuring that every citizen and permanent resident has access to essential health services, said Ziyambi.\n\nBut critics argue that the move is less about protecting patients and more about shifting the burden of a collapsing public healthcare system onto private players. Zimbabwes state hospitals have been decimated by decades of underfunding, corruption, drug shortages, and the flight of skilled professionals. Most facilities lack even the most basic medical supplies.\n\nNow, rather than fixing that broken system, government is effectively forcing the private sector to carry the weight  without addressing the root causes of the crisis.\n\nClause 9 of the Bill proposes that no private hospital may impose fees above a prescribed amount, or increase them by more than a set percentage, unless explicitly authorised by the Minister. This includes removing an existing legal safeguard that exempted previously existing fees from regulation  meaning all fees will now fall under government control.\n\nThis change ensures greater oversight and control over the cost of private healthcare, aiming to protect patients from exorbitant charges, Ziyambi said.\n\nAnother key provision would compel private institutions to provide emergency care to patients in life-threatening situations, regardless of their ability to pay. These patients must be stabilised for no less than 48 hours before they can be discharged or referred.\n\nThe government, through the Health Ministry, may enter into cost-recovery agreements with private institutions for such services  though no clear mechanisms have been outlined for how or when this compensation would be provided.\n\nPerhaps, Mr Speaker, one of the most impactful provisions is the new Section 12(a), which prohibits private health institutions from refusing emergency medical treatment, aligning with Section 76(3) of the Constitution, said Ziyambi.\n\nThe Bill also proposes targeted health interventions for vulnerable groups, including children, people with chronic illnesses, persons with disabilities, and war veterans. It provides for the establishment of a National Consultative Health Forum to enhance citizen participation in health policy-making.\n\nWhile government claims the reforms are progressive and grounded in constitutional values of human dignity, many observers see them as a desperate attempt to compensate for the collapse of public healthcare  by offloading responsibility onto private institutions, without first addressing state mismanagement, systemic rot, and crumbling infrastructure.\n\n",

            "content": "War Veterans Win Court Battle Against Businessman Billy Rautenbach Over Farm Land Dispute\n\nHarare  17 July 2025\n\nBy A Correspondent | ZimEye | In a landmark ruling, the High Court has ruled in favour of a group of war veterans in their long-standing legal battle against businessman Billy Rautenbach, effectively setting aside the governments decision to withdraw their farm offer letters.\n\nPresiding Judge Justice Regus Dembure found that the government, through the responsible minister, had failed to properly oppose the application brought by the veterans, rendering the matter legally unopposed.\n\nJustice Dembure said the opposition submitted on behalf of the government was invalid because the affidavit was deposed by a permanent secretary (PS) who had no lawful authority to speak on the ministers behalf. Crucially, the court ruled that the minister, who holds the statutory power to make or withdraw such land offers, had not filed any affidavit in response to the case.\n\nI wish to point out that the law in relation to authority to act is already settled, said Justice Dembure in his ruling delivered ex tempore. Where the authority of a deponent is put in issue, there must be evidence of that authority before the court. A mere claim is not sufficient. One must produce a board resolution or formal proof of delegation.\n\nHe added that the affidavit presented was fatally invalid and amounted to inadmissible hearsay. The minister is the one who makes the decision and he must justify his actions. He cannot delegate his statutory powersonly administrative powers, said the judge. The PS has no such authority and cannot testify on behalf of the minister.\n\nJustice Dembure ruled that because no proper opposition had been presented, the applicants matter would proceed unopposed. He further criticised the ministers failure to consider the veterans long occupation of the land and the considerable improvements they had made over time.\n\nThe applicants had been on the farm for a long time and had made significant developments. The minister ignored this and failed to show that he applied his mind to the background of the case, Dembure noted.\n\nIn particular, the court observed that one of the applicants had entered into a joint venture with the government itself, an arrangement which was still active at the time of the withdrawaldemonstrating the irrationality and insensitivity of the decision.\n\nAccordingly, the court ruled:\n\nThis ruling represents a significant victory for the applicants, confirming the principle that ministerial decisions must be justified and lawfully defended, especially when they impact livelihoods and long-term investments.\n\n",

He has also been saying contrary to multiple allegations (including an investigation by his former employer Geoff Nyarota on the AMH newspaper website in 2021), his wealth did not at all come from foreign proceeds of crime and his first Chisipite home was bought from non-foreign money, but a local bank, CABS Zimbabwe mortgage. He would add saying this was because the Zim economy in 2001, was good.\n\nIn April 2023, following questions raised by Al Jazeera Media Network GoldMafia documentary founder, Simba Chikanza, he published a new claim to say his first home was truly  purchased from UK money in the form of a 50,000 sportscar 1996 loan, of a vehicle he quickly sold upon being illegally shipped to Zimbabwe. He emphasized that the 50,000 value realised from the sale is what created his property wealth.\n\nAt a time when he is still to disclose the identity of the British lender, Chinono has publicised a totally contradictory claim, this time to suggest that the money actually came from Boer goats which are worth up to 100,000.\n\nDuring interviews with his former employer Nyarota, Chinono failed to answer key questions one of them which was over the date when he started his boer goat farming.\n\nWhen pressed further by Chikanza in an online podcast, Chinono has said he could afford the 120,000 value(50,000) loan because he was working in the media in 1996 since I have worked for private media all my life. But he contradicts this claim by saying he worked as a cleaner when he arrived in UK in 1994.\n\nHe goes further to suggest that the UK embassy in Harare conducted a police clearance on his sportscar loan and also on his three identity cards with different names.\n\nThe UK embassy has twice denied ever issuing a police clearance on anyone at any time stressing that it has no such capabilities.
