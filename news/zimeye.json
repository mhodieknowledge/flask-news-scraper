Joelinton doubled the lead shortly after, making it 2-0 before the 20-minute mark. Although Manchester United showed signs of improvement as the match progressed, they never truly threatened to overturn the deficit.\n\nEddie Howes team climbed to 5th, just three points behind 4th-place Chelsea, who suffered a shock defeat to struggling Ipswich Town at Portman Road. Meanwhile, Manchester United remained in 14th.\n\nNewcastle started the game with confidence, quickly going ahead 1-0 thanks to an expertly crafted build-up and a well-placed cross from Hall that Isak finished off with a header. The visitors extended their lead soon after, with Joelinton outjumping Lisandro Martinez to head the ball past Andre Onana. A potential third goal from Isak was ruled out for offside.\n\nAt the other end, Rasmus Hojlund came close with a shot just wide, and Casemiro missed an opportunity from close range after a misstep by Fabian Schar. Uniteds struggles were evident, with their lack of control in midfield allowing Newcastle to dominate.\n\nThe defeat marked a historic low for Manchester United, as it was the first time since 1979 that they had suffered three consecutive league losses at Old Trafford. Despite a few fleeting moments of pressure, Newcastles early goals proved enough to seal the victory.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe issue of road traffic accidents has once again sparked debate, with the government placing a significant amount of blame on transport operators.\n\nRecent statements from the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe (TSCZ) urge transport operators to stop imposing unreasonable targets on drivers, claiming these pressures contribute to an increase in accidents. But is it fair to single out transporters for road crashes, and what role does the government play in ensuring road safety?\n\nAccording to TSCZ statistics, 94 percent of road accidents are caused by human error. This figure underscores the importance of driver behavior in preventing accidents.\n\nHowever, TSCZ managing director Mr. Munesu Munodawafa emphasizes that unrealistic targets set by transport operators are pushing drivers to exceed their limits, resulting in dangerous driving practices, particularly speeding. When you do an analysis of the accidents, particularly during this festive season, they are a result of speeding, and we believe they are a result of targets given to drivers that forces the driver to go beyond their limits, he stated. Our appeal to operators is to avoid giving those targets, they are not helpful, they endanger passengers.\n\nWhile transport operators role in creating a high-pressure environment for drivers cannot be overlooked, its crucial to ask: is it fair to place the blame entirely on them? Transport companies may prioritize timely deliveries or operational efficiency, but the drivers themselves are the ones who ultimately make decisions on the road.\n\nHuman error, often under pressure, seems to be a primary contributor to accidents. However, are there broader systemic factors at play?\n\nThe governments role in this issue is significant. The TSCZs call for safer practices highlights the lack of comprehensive regulation or enforcement in ensuring that transport operators prioritize safety over speed and efficiency.\n\nThe government must enforce stricter regulations, hold transport companies accountable, and ensure that safety guidelines are effectively communicated and followed. Without robust policies, it is difficult to ensure that operators are not overburdening drivers with targets that compromise road safety.\n\nIn addition to holding transporters accountable, the government must continue its work on improving infrastructure, enhancing driver education, and enforcing road safety laws. It is not just about blaming one party, but about creating a culture of safety on the roads, Mr. Munodawafa said.\n\nUltimately, road safety is a shared responsibility. While transport operators must be mindful of the pressure they place on drivers, the government must ensure the implementation and enforcement of policies that support road safety. Both sectors need to work together to prevent the rising number of accidents.\n\n",

            "content": "Driving requires more than just the physical ability to operate a vehicle; it demands total concentration and a sense of calm. How you feel behind the wheel can significantly impact your safety and that of others on the road. Whether youre feeling relaxed, anxious, or hot-tempered, your emotions affect your judgment, reaction times, and overall driving behavior.\n\nIts essential to recognize the profound influence emotions have on your driving and actively work to control them. Emotional reactions can alter your decision-making process, leading to dangerous maneuvers or poor judgment. For example, anxiety might cause you to overreact or hesitate, while anger could lead to aggressive driving and reckless behavior. Stress can cloud your focus, increasing the likelihood of mistakes.\n\nThe key to maintaining safety on the road lies in emotional regulation. Regardless of the emotional state youre in, never allow your feelings to dictate your actions behind the wheel. Losing control can lead to dangerous situations, not only putting yourself and your passengers at risk but also endangering other drivers and pedestrians.\n\nHere are a few strategies for managing emotions while driving:\n\nBy recognizing the link between emotions and driving behavior, and by taking steps to manage your stress, you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents. Remember, driving is a responsibility that requires a clear mind and a calm demeanor. Never let emotions take the wheel.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :tr*************@gm***.com\n\n",
