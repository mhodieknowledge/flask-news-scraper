            "content": "By Dorrothy Moyo | ZimEye | Zimbabweans have erupted in a wave of anger and ridicule following a social media post by Cabinet Minister Machakaire, who claimed to be deeply moved by the deplorable state of the countrys public hospitals. The post, which seemed to express personal concern and called on the president to witness the crisis firsthand, has instead triggered widespread public skepticism and accusations of political stagecraft.\n\nSocial media users were quick to condemn the ministers remarks, accusing him of playing to the gallery while failing to use his Cabinet position to push for real change.\n\nIwe handitika uno rapwa ku Singapore hospital, saka uri bho, tweeted @vsachi73, bluntly accusing the minister of hypocrisy for seeking treatment abroad while pretending to empathize with local struggles.\n\nStop madrama, we are not fools, added @DonaldMudowaya, summing up the widespread sentiment that the ministers public appeal was little more than an orchestrated drama to manage political optics.\n\nVivienne Marara (@vivienne_lt) added a sharp observation on the performative nature of such visits: Kana voyenda for the visit ngavangoyerekana vasvika. Vakapa advance notice vanosvika Hospital Admin yamhanya mhanya kuvhara magap. Her point reflects public suspicion that such visits are staged, with hospital authorities tipped off in advance to cover up the decay.\n\nBut perhaps the most piercing criticism came from Guguletu Dlodlo (@gugu_dl odlo): With all due respect Hon. @HonMachakaire why not raise these concerns directly in those forums and push for tangible action? Or is this just part of a staged political performance?\n\nThese comments, which have gone viral, reflect the growing frustration among citizens who see the governments response to Zimbabwes healthcare crisis as performative and disingenuous. For many, the ministers sudden show of sympathy rings hollow, especially given his proximity to the president and his long-standing access to decision-making spaces.\n\nAs public trust erodes further, one thing is clear: the people are no longer buying rehearsed empathythey demand accountability.\n\nStory developing\n\n",

His goalan expertly placed strike from the edge of the boxwas followed by a clever assist to Kylian Mbapp, further cementing his growing influence in Carlo Ancelottis side.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Gler expressed both pride and humility. We started very well with the 3-0 but we should have finished better, he said, referring to Madrids dominant start that nearly slipped away as Celta fought back late in the game.\n\nThe young midfielder also acknowledged the support he received from the Real Madrid faithful. Real Madrid fans gave me a lot of encouragement today, he said. Their support means everything to meit pushes me to do more on the pitch.\n\nWhen asked about his assist for Mbapps goal, Gler deflected the praise. My assist to Mbapp? It wasnt that greatit was all because of Kylians great run, he said modestly.\n\nGlers performance has sparked excitement among fans and pundits alike, with many now calling for him to feature more regularly in Madrids starting lineup as the season intensifies.\n\n",

            "content": "Part 1 of a 5-part investigative series on real estate fraud in Zimbabwe\n\nA couple of months ago, Zimbabwes business community was left reeling when Gray Homes Constructions owners, Annavestah and Gray Mudiwa, were accused of defrauding Miniyothabo Baloyi-Chiwenga, the wife of Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, of nearly US\\$1 million in a series of construction deals gone awry .\n\nThe audacity of the alleged scamtargeting someone so closely connected to the nations highest officehas sent shockwaves through the country. If individuals with such influence can fall victim to fraudulent schemes, what hope is there for the average citizen seeking to build their dream home?\n\nThis article marks the beginning of a five-part investigative series titled Distinguishing Between the Honest and the Deceptive  Property Development Fraud in Zimbabwe. We aim to shed light on the murky world of real estate fraud, starting with the Gray Homes saga.\n\nThe Alleged Deception Unfolds\n\nIn March 2023, the Mudiwas reportedly convinced Baloyi-Chiwenga that they could construct a double-storey house, a cottage, and a boundary wall within 90 days. Trusting their assurances, she paid them US\\$560,000. However, the project was never completed, and she suffered a loss of US\\$389,100 .\n\nThe pattern continued in June 2023 when the couple allegedly misled her into believing they could build a warehouse at Chivaraidze Farm in Goromonzi. She paid them US\\$550,000, but again, the project was left incomplete, resulting in a loss of US\\$390,000 .\n\nIn September 2023, the Mudiwas purportedly convinced Baloyi-Chiwenga to fund the construction of a shopping mall at Silalatshani Business Centre in Filabusi. She handed over US\\$158,000, but the funds were allegedly diverted for personal use, leading to a loss of US\\$151,000 .\n\nLegal Proceedings and Withdrawal of Charges\n\nThe couple was arrested and brought before the courts to face multiple fraud charges. However, in a surprising turn of events, Baloyi-Chiwenga withdrew the charges against them in February 2025. No reasons were provided for this decision .\n\nDespite the withdrawal, the Mudiwas legal troubles were far from over. Other victims came forward with similar allegations, leading to additional charges.\n\nA Pattern of Alleged Fraud Emerges\n\nBeyond the high-profile case involving Baloyi-Chiwenga, the Mudiwas faced seven counts of fraud from various complainants:\n\nBail and Ongoing Legal Battles\n\nAfter spending four months in custody, the Mudiwas were granted bail in February 2025. They were released on US\\$500 bail each, ordered to surrender their passports, report weekly to the CID, and reside at their given addresses .\n\nTheir legal battles continue as they face multiple fraud charges from various complainants.\n\nThe Broader Implications\n\nThe Gray Homes case underscores a troubling trend in Zimbabwes property development sector, where individuals and companies exploit trust to defraud clients. If someone as connected as the Vice Presidents wife can fall victim, it raises concerns about the vulnerabilities faced by ordinary citizens.\n\nThis series aims to delve deeper into such cases, exploring the mechanisms of fraud, the legal frameworks in place, and the stories of those affected.\n\n",

The attack on his family shows that as a nation, we are failing to observe the basic tenets of democracy and the opposition is clearly under attack from people that want to entrench dictatorship and authoritarianism.\n\nThe government of Zimbabwe must respect fundamental rights as enshrined under the constitution. Our Constitution guarantees freedom of expression and association and these rights should be respected . Victimising people because of their political affiliations is unacceptable and should be condemned in the strongest of terms, said Bvunzawabaya.\n\nA strong critic of the ZANU PF led government, Bvunzawabaya has been critical about human rights abuses and corruption in Zimbabwe.\n\nAs citizens, we have the right to call the government to order and this should never be criminalised. The government of Zimbabwe must learn to respect and appreciate political diversity and desist from persecuting dissenting voices, said Bvunzawabaya.\n\nHis wife, Alleta said she was deeply touched by the attack on Madzibaba Veshandukos homestead.\n\nAs a mother it pains me to see a family going through so much persecution. I can feel the pain and I will certainly mobilise more support for this family. No one deserves to live in this way in a modern world, said Alleta who also appealed to well wishers to come forward and assist Madzibaba Veshanduko.\n\n",

This campaign is a reminder that people share the responsibility to maintain a healthy environment for current and future generations.\n\nCity councillors, council officials, residents, business partners, and community organizations all took part in cleaning up streets, open spaces, and public facilities in the central business district. Key areas tackled included the Garikai Fruits and Vegetables Market, Chimusana Bridge, and the Chikato Police Station vicinity.\n\nYet, the campaign also exposed a deeper problem: the citys ongoing struggle with consistent waste management and public participation. Councillors reportedly expressed concern over the volume of litter found in areas that should be routinely maintained.\n\nOne city official, speaking on condition of anonymity, remarked, Its discouraging to see how much litter builds up just weeks after the last campaign. We need more than eventswe need a cultural shift.\n\nThe citys own statement echoed this sentiment, urging residents to go beyond monthly participation. The City encourages all residents to continue observing monthly clean-up days and to adopt sustainable waste management habits in their homes and workplaces.\n\nAs the city battles the visible signs of decay, the question lingers: is Masvingo doing enough to live up to its smart city ambitions?\n\n",
