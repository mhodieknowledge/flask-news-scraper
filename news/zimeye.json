            "content": "By Municipal Reporter-The Harare City Council, led by Mayor Jacob Mafume, has sparked public debate after announcing a sweeping renaming of key roads in the capital  a move that some say reflects growing political alignment with the ruling ZANU-PF party.\n\nThe council, now under the influence of the Sengezo Tshabangu-led faction of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), has renamed at least 18 major roads, replacing colonial and historic names with those of prominent local and international political figures, some closely associated with the liberation struggle and post-independence governance.\n\nAccording to an official post by the City of Harare, the new names include:\n\nWhile the renaming of roads is not unusual in post-colonial Zimbabwe, the decision has drawn scrutiny due to its political overtones, especially in light of recent comments by Tshabangu suggesting the construction of arotating statue of President Emmerson Mnangagwaat the newly commissionedTrabablas Interchange.\n\nYes, I said that in recognition of President Mnangagwas good work on this massive Trabablas Interchange, Tshabangu told journalists. Its good that a rotating statue that gives everyone an all-round view of the country be erected at the interchange. As the official opposition, we propose that.\n\nTshabangus remarks have been widely condemned by opposition supporters and civil society actors, who see them as a clear departure from his mandate to hold the ruling party to account. Many observers interpreted the statement as ablatant act of political bootlicking, unbecoming of a self-declared opposition leader.\n\nThe call for a presidential monument, coupled with the naming of a major road after Mnangagwa Enterprise Road is now ED Mnangagwa Road has deepened suspicions that Tshabangus CCC faction is working in concert with ZANU-PF interests.\n\nPolitical analyst Tawanda Moyo commented, Its no longer about symbolic gestures. This is about political realignment masquerading as civic recognition. Tshabangus actions suggest hes abandoning the watchdog role of the opposition in favor of personal or factional gain.\n\nWhile infrastructure development such as the Trabablas Interchange is often praised across the political divide, critics argue thatTshabangus tone and timingare alarming, particularly as Zimbabwe faces mounting international criticism over repression, economic collapse, and the shrinking of democratic space.\n\nFor many, these developments reflect a broader crisis in opposition politics, wherefragmentation, co-optation, and lack of principled leadershipare undermining efforts to challenge authoritarian rule.\n\nAs of now, there has been no official government response to Tshabangus statue proposal. But the controversy continues to intensify, raising difficult questions aboutthe independence, integrity, and future of opposition politics in Zimbabwe.\n\n",

However, with more international fixtures lined up, the Warriors will be looking to regroup, learn from their mistakes, and build toward a more solid team performance.\n\nThis fixture was part of Zimbabwes ongoing effort to re-establish themselves on the international stage following their return to FIFA-sanctioned competitions.\n\nFans remain hopeful that this loss will serve as a valuable lesson for the technical team as they continue to fine-tune the squad ahead of future challenges.\n\n",

I would like to thank you deeply for your love and support, she wrote. I had taken a break from speaking much about the rape case I reported one month ago. The time has come for the judiciary system to examine my case and give a judgement verifying available evidence and facts. Handina bakatwa, handina uta nemuseve  ndinofamba naJesu chete. May justice be served.\n\nShe added that those wishing to attend the trial are welcome to do so. The proceedings are scheduled for 13 June at 9:00 AM at Rotten Row Magistrates Court in Harare.\n\nTwo men, Thabo Blessing Dube (27) of Chitungwiza and Martin Charlie (25) of Manresa, are facing serious charges in the case.\n\nThey are accused of gang raping Mai Jeremia in an incident reported last month.\n\nThe pair recently appeared before Harare regional magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa .\n\nThe case has drawn widespread attention, partly due to Mai Jeremias strong public presence and also because of its broader implications in the fight against gender-based violence in Zimbabwe.\n\nHer statement, I walk only with Jesus, has been embraced by many who see her bravery as a call for justice and healing.\n\nAs the court date approaches, various womens rights groups and concerned citizens have expressed interest in attending or supporting the case, emphasizing the need for a transparent and survivor-focused legal process.\n\nAll eyes will now be on the upcoming 13 June hearing, where the judiciary is expected to begin examining the evidence, and possibly, take the first real steps toward justice in a case that has sparked national debate.\n\n",

The energy is electric as we mobilise for victory, standing firm in our commitment to the people and the vision for progress.\n\nThank you, His Excellency President Dr ED Mnangagwa, for your unwavering leadership and commitment to the people.\n\nThe bold promises come amid mounting criticism over the ruling partys failure to deliver meaningful development in rural communities over the past 45 years. Analysts have called the latest rhetoric a recycled campaign tactic, especially in constituencies like Gutu East, where access to basic services such as clean water, healthcare, and employment remains limited.\n\nDespite public scepticism, ZANU PF is banking on strong rural voter support and what it describes as grassroots mobilisation to secure victory in the upcoming by-election.\n\nWhether the promises of wealth and empowerment will translate into actual change  or simply fade like those of past campaigns  remains to be seen.\n\n",

He now awaits sentencing.\n\nBut public opinion is sharply divided. While the state proceeds with the case, many citizens online are pleading for compassion, asking the Vice Presidents wife to drop the charges and consider rehabilitating the youth instead of incarcerating him.\n\nIf I were Miniyothabo Baloyi Chiwenga, I would drop the charges, adopt Succeed Mukaro, and possibly employ him, wrote one commenter, Sekuru Sithole Makumbe, in a widely shared Facebook thread.\n\nA Cry for Mercy or a Slippery Slope?\n\nOthers in the thread pushed back, arguing that theft should not be excused regardless of circumstance.\n\nSo how many thieves have you adopted so far? asked Adrian Koto Chikambure.People need to be responsible for their actions he made his bed, let him lie on it, added Patty Moosheryeequa.\n\nStill, Sekuru Sithole stood firm, urging Zimbabweans to think beyond the crime itself and reflect on the systemic poverty and youth unemployment that may have driven the teenager to act out of desperation.\n\nDid he commit the crime out of greed or survival? The same money that couldve employed youths like Mukaro was looted  Gwanda Solar Project money, looted funds now buying luxuries. But we jump to punish a boy for phones while real criminals roam free.\n\nHis comments drew comparisons between Mukaros situation and Zimbabwes broader socio-economic collapse, where elite-connected tenderpreneurs live in luxury, and youths struggle to survive.\n\nThe Case for Restorative Justice\n\nSome advocates now call on the Second Lady  a senior officer in the Zimbabwe Defence Forces and respected figure in both military and business circles  to set a national example of restorative justice.\n\nThey argue that rehabilitation, mentorship, and employment might not only change Mukaros life but spark a conversation about how the state can redirect wayward youth without condemning them permanently.\n\nAn Open Letter to the Second Lady\n\nDear Colonel Miniyothabo Baloyi Chiwenga,\n\nSucceed Mukaro has erred. He has confessed. He is young. He is broken.\n\nBut what this moment calls for is not just the firmness of law, but the power of mercy. You have the ability to turn a court case into a national case study in redemption over retribution.\n\nA single act of grace could reframe Zimbabwes justice narrative  and transform a convicted boy into a reformed man, a future builder.\n\nSigned,The People of Zimbabwe.\n\n",

His legal representative, Mr Stephen Chikotora, told the court that the defense was putting the bail application on hold to focus on another legal matter involving Mapinga currently being handled in a different court.\n\nThe fatal incident took place on May 31, when Mapingas three Pit Bulls and a Rottweiler allegedly mauled a neighbour to death. According to the State, Mapinga acted negligently by releasing the unmuzzled dogs into the yard of his rented property, which is only enclosed by a low brick-and-mortar wall. After releasing the animals, it is alleged that Mapinga went back to his bedroom, leaving them unsupervised.\n\nThe decision to cancel the bail bid means Mapinga will remain behind bars as investigations and court proceedings continue. The case has drawn significant public attention, with many calling for stricter regulations around the ownership of dangerous dog breeds.\n\n",

Hes been there for three years. I think he is here.  And I asked him whether he is actually intelligent. He said, Im very intelligent. And to me, the most amazing thing is that hes in that space, but hes conscious that he must make a contribution. So hes trying to spread his tentacles here.  to bring the things that he has learned in that space to come and have them done here. And I conclude with what you said. This thing must be cascaded to rural Africa. It must not be a rare thing held in big conference centers. It must make sense to the people in general.  This girl is a Soweto girl and she has a story to tell.  Ill tell it. Because these stories must be told. Because they inspire others. So thank you very much.
