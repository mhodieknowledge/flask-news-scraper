The commission also exposed that the citys eight directors are entitled to fully paid holiday trips, covering spouses and up to three children at the expense of ratepayers, with destinations including Victoria Falls (local), Mauritius (regional), and Dubai (international).\n\nFurther bombshells emerged when assistant director to the town clerk, Matthew Marara, disclosed he received US$27,000 in holiday allowances while on suspension for 30 monthsincluding US$9,000 for local trips and US$18,000 for regional getaways.\n\nHarare residents, grappling with crippling service delivery failures, are left to question how a cash-strapped council can justify luxury vacations for executives while the citys basic infrastructure crumbles.\n\n",

            "content": "By Business Reporter  Renowned commercial lawyer and businessman Tawanda Nyambirai has been appointed the new Chief Executive of the troubled EcoCash Holdings Zimbabwe Limited (EHZL).\n\nNyambirai takes over from Eddie Chibi, who was, together with seven top executives, fired amid mounting dissatisfaction over the companys declining service quality.\n\nChibi, who has served as CEO since 2018\n\nNyambirai, who played a crucial role in the early days of Econet in the 1990s as a legal advisor and entrepreneur, has also been involved with Steward Bank, a subsidiary of EcoCash, since acquiring it in 2013.\n\nAnother high-profile departure is Darlington Mandivenga, a key figure in the rapid growth of EcoCash, who also stepped down.\n\nMandivenga was instrumental in establishing EcoCash as Zimbabwes leading mobile money service.\n\nEight directors have resigned, including Board Chairperson Sherree Gladys Shereni, while ten new directors havebeen appointedin a sweeping restructuring of EHZLs leadership.\n\nIn a notice to shareholders dated14 February2025 and signed by Group Company Secretary C.R. Daniels, EcoCash Holdings announced that Shereni had stepped down. Other directors who have resigned include:\n\nEcoCash expressed gratitude for the contributions of the outgoing board members and announced that Dominic Musengi and Elizabeth T. Masiyiwa will remain on the board.\n\nThe newly appointed directors include:\n\nThe leadership overhaul comesat a timewhen Econet Wireless, Zimbabwes largest telecommunications provider, faces intense scrutiny over declining service quality, exorbitant costs, and frequent system failuresparticularly with EcoCash, the countrys most widely used mobile money platform.\n\nOnFebruary 5, 2025, thousands of Econet subscriberswereleftstranded after EcoCash crashed, disrupting financial transactions for individuals and businesses.\n\nThe outage, lasting from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM, was the latest in a series of system failures that have frustrated customers.\n\nEconet acknowledged the failure in a statement but insistedthe issue had been resolved:\n\nWe experienced some issues on the platforms that enable our subscribers to make calls, use data, or carry out EcoCash transactions, resulting in some of our customers being unable to use the services for about an hour and a half. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience.\n\nHowever, many Zimbabweans remain unconvinced, as EcoCash has longbeen plaguedby persistent downtime, failed transactions, and delays in processing payments.\n\nThe services unreliability is especially concerning given that mobile money plays a crucial role in Zimbabwes cash-strapped economy.\n\nBeyond EcoCashs operational failures, Econets mobile network has alsobeen criticisedfor slow internet speeds, dropped calls, and high tariffs.\n\nZimbabweans pay some of the highest mobile data and voice call ratesin the region, yet they continue to endure subpar service.\n\nFrequent power cuts and inadequate investment in infrastructure have exacerbated the problem, while the company continues to hike prices under the guise of inflationary adjustments.\n\nThe timing of these service failures is particularly damaging for Econet, as competition in Zimbabwes telecom sector is heating up with the anticipated arrival of Starlink, Elon Musks satellite internet provider.\n\nStarlinkis expectedto revolutionise Zimbabwes digital landscape by offering high-speed, reliable internet access, especially in remote areas where traditional network providers struggle.\n\nUnlike Econets reliance on terrestrial towers, Starlinks satellite-based service provides a more stable connection and could offer an affordable alternative to Econets expensive and unreliable internet services.\n\nThe growing frustration with Econet has fueled anticipation for Starlinks launch, with many consumers eager for an alternative to Zimbabwes telecom monopoly.\n\nThe pressure is now on Econet to improve its services, lower costs, and enhance reliabilityor risk losing customers to a new, more efficient competitor.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent| Peoples Unity Party (PUP) leader Herbert Chamuka has strongly condemned the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) for launching a manhunt for war veteran and Zanu PF Central Committee member, Blessed Geza, over four criminal charges, including undermining the authority of the President.\n\nChamuka accused the police of being used as a political weapon by the ruling Zanu PF, stating that the allegations against Geza only resurfaced after his recent press conference, where he openly criticised President Emmerson Mnangagwas alleged bid for a third term in office, calling it unconstitutional.\n\nThe timing of these charges is highly suspicious. Where were these allegations all along? They are only being brought up now because Geza has spoken out against the unconstitutional extension of Mnangagwas rule.\n\nThe police should refuse to be used to fight political disputes within Zanu PF, Chamuka said.\n\nNational police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi recently released a statement, saying the police were searching for Geza, also known as Bombshell, and warned that anyone assisting him in evading arrest would also face prosecution.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police is seeking information on the location and subsequent questioning of a suspect, Blessed Geza Runesu, alias Bombshell.\n\nThe suspect is facing four counts of criminal charges as outlined; theft allegations as defined in Section 113 of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, Chapter 9 23, said Comm Nyathi.\n\nChamuka, however, argued that Geza and Mnangagwa, both veterans of the liberation struggle, should resolve their differences in a dignified manner rather than resorting to punitive legal action.\n\nMnangagwa and Geza know each other from the liberation struggle.\n\nInstead of humiliating an old comrade, the President should initiate a respectful counselling process.\n\nGeza is elderly, and throwing him into Zimbabwes inhumane jails will only jeopardise his health. They should counsel him, not jail him, Chamuka stated.\n\nThe PUP leader called for an end to the weaponisation of state institutions against political opponents and urged the police to maintain professionalism.\n\nThe ZRP should serve the people, not political interests. They must refuse to be used as enforcers of internal Zanu PF conflicts, Chamuka said.\n\n",
