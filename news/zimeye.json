            "content": "By A Correspondent | Barely 24 hours after publicly threatening Vice President Constantino Chiwenga with exposure, former Norton MP Temba Mliswa has unleashed a barrage of corruption allegations against President Emmerson Mnangagwas automatic successor, alleging multi-million dollar kickbacks and wedding indulgences.\n\nOn Sunday night, Mliswa announced what he called four explosive episodes designed to hold Chiwenga to account, adding that if the Vice President failed to respond he must resign.\n\nThe nation must brace itself for four episodes that require Chiwenga to respond if he is clean, Mliswa declared.\n\nIn a string of posts on Monday morning, Mliswa accused Chiwenga of soliciting lavish gifts, including six Rolls Royces for his wedding, US$250,000 for wedding preparations, another US$250,000 during the wedding itself, US$250,000 for a Seychelles honeymoon at the Four Seasons, and R2 million in shopping money in South Africa. He further alleged that Chiwenga demanded US$450,000 from Wicknell Chivayo to purchase three apartments for his children, claiming the scandal began when Chivayo allegedly failed to deliver one of the promises.\n\nMliswas revelations come amid intensifying manoeuvres to push Chiwenga out of office. According to sources close to the ruling party, an internal drive to force the Vice President to step aside has been launched, positioning Mnangagwa loyalists to consolidate power.\n\nThis marks a dramatic turn for Mliswa, whos a long time vocal campaigner for Emmerson Mnangagwa. He, Chiwenga, and activist Blessed Geza were among the earliest backers of Mnangagwas rise during the 2017 military coup that toppled Robert Mugabe, and later during the 1 August 2018 violent overthrow of Nelson Chamisas electoral win and the chaotic 2023 elections condemned by SADC. For years, the trio maintained public silence over abuses, including the use of impostor, Sengezo Tshabangu in Parliament  denounced by the Inter-Parliamentary Union  and caught on camera by ZimEyes Simba Chikanza at Harares Crowne Plaza in December 2023.\n\nNow, however, the alliance has splintered as Mnangagwa attempts to amend ZANU PFs constitution to extend his presidency to 2030. Mliswas latest allegations  if substantiated  represent the most direct challenge yet to Chiwengas credibility as Mnangagwas heir apparent.\n\nCritics of Mliswa, including activist Kerina Mujati, accuse him of hypocrisy and of benefiting from the same corruption he now condemns. But with the stakes so high, Zimbabwes political class is bracing for a public showdown.\n\nVP Chiwenga did not respond to the allegations. His supporters who include Mujati fired back with counter accusations against Mliswa.\n\n",

            "content": "By a Correspondent  Douglas Mwonzora is staring at a crushing symbolic defeat as the Harare City Council moves to shut down Harvest House, the iconic headquarters of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), over more than US$50,000 in unpaid rent and municipal charges.\n\nFor two decades, Harvest House  located in the heart of Harares central business district  stood as a towering emblem of opposition politics in Zimbabwe. Under the late Morgan Tsvangirai, it became a sanctuary of democratic resistance and a rallying point for millions who dreamed of political change.\n\nBut today, the building that once embodied hope risks descending into ruin.\n\nMwonzora seized control of Harvest House in 2020 after a bruising leadership battle that ended with a controversial Supreme Court ruling nullifying Nelson Chamisas presidency of the MDC. His takeover, widely seen as state-assisted, was marred by violent clashes between rival factions as he fought to secure control of the partys assets.\n\nSince then, however, Mwonzoras faction has struggled to keep the party afloat. Insiders admit that no meaningful rentals or municipal dues have been paid for years, with debts ballooning as donor support evaporated and disillusioned supporters defected in droves. Poor financial management and dwindling political relevance have left the party broke and rudderless.\n\nCity of Harare officials confirmed that unless the arrears are settled immediately, Harvest House will be shut down and possibly auctioned to recover the debt.\n\nPolitical analysts say the looming closure symbolizes the dramatic collapse of the MDC, once Zimbabwes most formidable opposition movement. What was once a hub of democratic struggle is now at risk of becoming a derelict relic on Harares skyline  a stark reflection of the partys deep fractures and Mwonzoras much-criticized leadership.\n\nFor Mwonzora, losing Harvest House would not just be a financial disaster. It would be a humiliating political setback, stripping him of the very symbol that lent his contested leadership a measure of legitimacy.\n\nAnd for many, the potential closure is a haunting reminder of how far the party has fallen since the days of Tsvangirai  a man whose vision and courage once inspired a nation, and who, as some critics bitterly note, must be turning in his grave.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nWhile schools across Zimbabwe face shortages of textbooks, congested classrooms, and demoralised staff, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has chosen to channel US$500 000 into the partisan Teachers for Economic Development (Teachers 4ED) grouping.\n\nCritics say the move is yet another example of misplaced priorities and political patronage.\n\nThe revolving fund, launched at the Teachers for ED Economic Empowerment Conference in Harare on Saturday, allocates US$50 000 to each of the countrys ten provinces for income-generating projects.\n\nPresidential Investment Advisor Dr Paul Tungwarara praised the initiative, claiming: Today we are here to celebrate and empower teachers. The Presidential Empowerment Programme is an initiative to empower teachers. All of us were taught by teachers and it is that same teacher that opened our minds to the world of wonders.\n\nYet for the vast majority of teachers outside the Teachers 4ED structure, the reality remains bleaksalaries that barely cover basic living costs and working conditions that continue to deteriorate.\n\nZANU PF Political Commissar Munyaradzi Machacha told the gathering: You must put this fund to good use and ensure everyone benefits. We have set up a monitoring and evaluation committee to ensure the funds are disbursed to the right beneficiaries and used for their intended purposes.\n\nTeachers for ED National Chairperson Ropafadzo Matemavi revealed the partisan nature of the group, saying: Our teachers under Teachers for ED have been attending lectures at the Chitepo School of Ideology. That is where we are taught about the need to decolonise the mind and empower ourselves. So, this fund will go a long way in sustaining our projects.\n\nOn top of the cash injection, Teachers for Economic Development also received 12 new vehicles for organisational mobility and coordination.\n\nObservers argue that such selective empowerment schemes reveal the governments prioritiesrewarding loyalty instead of addressing the deepening crisis in Zimbabwes education system.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has claimed that the black market is shrinking due to economic stability and rising foreign currency reserves.\n\nHowever, critics warn that the reported progress may be overstated, with informal currency trading continuing to affect ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nRBZ Governor Dr. John Mushayavanhu told The Sunday Mail that the year-long stabilization of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency had helped align retail and parallel market rates. The sustained stability in the exchange rate and inflation has supported robust economic activity and greater growth momentum in the economy, he said.\n\nMushayavanhu highlighted the role of foreign currency inflows, which reached US$10.4 billion between January and August, and reserves that have grown to about US$900 million. The low and stable month-on-month inflation is supporting the disinflation trajectory, which will result in annual ZiG inflation undershooting the initial target of 30 percent to levels around 20 percent by the end of 2025, he added.\n\nDespite these assurances, many economists and business owners remain skeptical about the central banks claims. While official rates and ZiG stability may look good on paper, the black market continues to flourish, said an independent analyst. Access to foreign currency remains limited, and many transactions are still taking place outside official channels.\n\nMushayavanhu insisted that fiscal restraint and prudent monetary policy had bolstered confidence in the financial system. Moreover, the Reserve Banks commitment to staying the course boosted confidence in monetary and financial affairs, thus eliminating the credibility premium on the exchange rate and inflation fronts, he said.\n\nYet traders report persistent challenges. Its nearly impossible to get enough US dollars at the official rate, so we are forced to use parallel market rates, which are often higher, said a Harare shop owner. The black market is far from disappearing.\n\nThe ZiG currency, introduced in April 2024 to replace the Zimbabwe dollar, was intended to restore public confidence, but experts warn that its stability is largely dependent on foreign inflows rather than a resilient domestic economy.\n\nAs Zimbabweans continue to face high prices and limited access to foreign currency, the so-called shrinking black market may prove to be more of a political claim than a reflection of reality.\n\n",

Every child is precious, every talent must be nurtured, and every community deserves a chance to thrive. That is the spirit of Mwana Anokosha, he declared to thunderous applause.\n\nThe Visual Arts Gallery, the first of its kind in Hwedza, is set to become a hub of creativity, offering young Zimbabweans a platform to showcase their artistry, preserve traditional expressions, and build sustainable livelihoods through cultural enterprise.\n\nMinister Machakaire hailed the launch as a turning point for Zimbabwean youth, praising Dr. Chiwengas vision and commitment. The Vice President has once again demonstrated that he is a true father figure to our young people. This initiative is about giving our children hope, dignity, and a future. It is about making sure that no talent is wasted, and no dream is left behind, said Machakaire.\n\nCommunity leaders, local artists, and residents echoed the ministers sentiments, describing the Vice Presidents efforts as transformative. Among the attendees was 19-year-old visual artist Tendai Mupakati, who expressed gratitude for the opportunity the gallery presents. For us as young artists, this is life-changing. Before today, many of us had no place to showcase our work. Now we have a home, a stage, and the recognition we have been praying for. The Vice President has given us a voice, said Mupakati.\n\nDr. Chiwengas growing connection with communities across the nation has positioned him as a unifying figure, admired for his dedication to people-centred development. Despite recent attempts by detractors to tarnish his image with baseless allegations, the overwhelming support from citizens reflects a leader whose actions speak louder than political noise.\n\nThe launch of Mwana Anokosha marks a significant milestone in Zimbabwes efforts to strengthen social cohesion, promote youth empowerment, and protect vulnerable groups  values that resonate with families across the country.\n\nWith this initiative, Dr. Chiwenga has not only placed Hwedza on the cultural map but also reaffirmed his role as a national leader determined to uplift Zimbabwe through vision, action, and an unshakable belief in its people.\n\n",
