            "content": "By Sports Reporter- Former Norton MP Temba Mliswa has once again found himself at the center of controversy, this time within Zimbabwean rugby.\n\nMliswa, a former fitness trainer turned politician, has caused the arrest of top Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) executives following his dismissal for allegedly breaching the sports constitution.\n\nThe outspoken politician argues that the rugby bosses were engaged in corruption and financial mismanagement, leading to a legal battle that has escalated into a criminal investigation.\n\nZRU Vice President Losson Mtongwiza and CEO Sifiso Made have since been arrested and appeared in court over corruption-related allegations.\n\nIn response to the unfolding saga, the ZRU issued a statement outlining the basis of Mliswas suspension.Specifically, the Union wishes to clarify that Mr. Mliswas conduct has been in direct violation of Section 19.1 of the ZRU Constitution. This section explicitly prohibits taking internal disputes to external courts outside of the structures outlined in the ZRU statutes, Rugby Africa, and World Rugby regulations.The ZRUs established disciplinary processes are designed to address such matters fairly and efficiently within the rugby framework. As a result of this constitutional violation, the ZRU Board resolved unanimously, in accordance with due process, to suspend Mr. Mliswa with immediate effect.His case has been referred to a disciplinary committee, where he will be given the opportunity to present his case in a fair and transparent manner, adhering to the established rules of the Union. The Zimbabwe Rugby Union remains committed to fostering a thriving rugby ecosystem built on respect, discipline, and unity.\n\nMliswa, however, has not taken the suspension lightly.\n\nUsing his X (formerly Twitter) account, he has publicly accused the ZRU leadership of corruption.\n\nHe claims his only offence was demanding transparency regarding the unions financial records.\n\nMy only crime has been the continued insistence for bank statements and breakdowns relating to money they used, Mliswa stated. However, I dont tire of such issues; they have only made it worse as they cant sustain me, and I will reveal more. No amount of name-dropping will work with some of us.\n\nThis latest scandal is not Mliswas first brush with controversy. Over the years, he has cultivated a reputation for being a firebrand politician unafraid of confrontation.\n\nMliswa was once a prominent member of the ruling Zanu PF party before being expelled in 2015 following allegations of factionalism.\n\nHis fallout with the party saw him become an independent MP for Norton, where he remained a vocal critic of government corruption and mismanagement.\n\nMliswa has had public spats with various political figures, including President Emmerson Mnangagwas allies. His combative nature has seen him engage in heated exchanges in Parliament and on social media, often exposing internal party rivalries.\n\nHe has also been accused of using his political influence and relationship with the former powerful CIO minister, Didymus Mutasa, to grab land and demand bribes from business figures, allegations he has consistently denied.\n\nHis aggressive approach to business and politics has made him a divisive figure.\n\nBefore venturing into politics, Mliswa was a fitness trainer, working with high-profile individuals, including former West Indies cricketer Brian Lara.\n\nBold moves and unfiltered commentary on governance issues marked his transition into politics.\n\nOver the years, he has been arrested multiple times on charges ranging from public disorder to alleged extortion.\n\nDespite this, he has remained a significant force in Zimbabwean politics and activism.\n\n",

            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda High Court judge Justice Zhou has nullified the congress that elected Douglas Mwonzora, the leader of the MDC-T, in December 2022.\n\nIn the judgement passed last week Friday, Justice Zhou found that the congress violated the partys constitution, rendering its outcomes null and void.\n\nThe court ruling comes after a challenge by former MDC-T vice president Elias Mudzuri and several senior party members, including Edward Kakora, Gift Kanjana, Den Moyo, and John Nyika.\n\nThe applicants argued that Mwonzora had orchestrated an illegitimate congress that failed to meet the constitutional requirements for such a gathering.\n\nThe purported National Congress held in December 2022 by the second respondent (Mwonzora) as the National Congress of the first respondent (MDC-T) is declared null and void for non-compliance with the first respondents constitution, ruled Justice Zhou.\n\nAccording to the judgment, the congress lacked a quorum, as key party structures such as the Womens Congress and Youth Congress were excluded.\n\nArticle 6.2.2 and 6.2.7 of the MDC-T constitution stipulate that at least two-thirds of entitled members must be present for a congress to be valid.\n\nThe congress convened by the second respondent did not meet such quorum as the Womens Congress and the Youth Congress were not held, the judgment read. The congress lasted for less than a few hours since there were not enough members to reach the quorum.\n\nAdditionally, the court found that Mwonzora had handpicked members of the National Executive Council instead of allowing democratic elections as required by the partys constitution.\n\nThe ruling also noted that notices for the congress were not properly published in national newspapers, violating Articles 6.2.4.1 and 6.2.4.2 of the MDC-T constitution.The ruling orders the party to convene a fresh congress within six months under an independent electoral commission.\n\nThe court battle is the latest in a series of internal conflicts that have plagued the MDC since the Supreme Courts 2020 ruling, which reinstated the partys 2014 structures and set the stage for Mwonzoras rise to power.\n\nInitially aligned with Mwonzora, Mudzuri fell out with him over leadership disputes and internal democratic processes.\n\nMwonzoras leadership has been marred by controversy, including allegations of expelling political rivals and sidelining key party organs.\n\nCritics argue that his tactics have contributed to the destruction of the MDC, which was once Zimbabwes strongest opposition force under its late founding leader, Morgan Tsvangirai.\n\nMudzuri and his allies contend that the 2022 congress was part of Mwonzoras broader strategy to consolidate power illegitimately.\n\nThe attempt to nullify the congress still leaves [Mwonzora] as the President by virtue of his election at the December 2022 congress, he argued in court.\n\nHowever, the High Court rejected this claim, ruling that his leadership position remains disputed.\n\nThe ruling adds further instability to the MDC, which has already suffered major electoral losses and defections.\n\nThe party, which once posed a formidable challenge to Zanu PF, has fractured into multiple factions, with Nelson Chamisas Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) emerging as the dominant opposition force.\n\nWith the court ordering a new congress, it remains to be seen whether the MDC-T can recover or if this marks the final chapter in its decline.\n\nThe decision could also have broader political ramifications, potentially influencing future opposition alliances ahead of Zimbabwes next elections.\n\n",

His case has been referred to a disciplinary committee, where he will be given the opportunity to present his case in a fair and transparent manner, the ZRU statement read.\n\nThe union further emphasized its commitment to respect, discipline, and unity, maintaining that its internal disciplinary mechanisms are designed to handle such disputes efficiently.\n\nMliswa Speaks Out\n\nResponding to his suspension, Mliswa took to his X (formerly Twitter) account, reiterating his claims that the ZRU leadership has been involved in financial misconduct.\n\nMy only crime has been the continued insistence for bank statements and breakdowns relating to money they used, Mliswa wrote.\n\nHe also suggested that more revelations about alleged corruption in the union were forthcoming.\n\nHowever, I dont tire of such issues; they have only made it worse as they cant sustain me and I will reveal more. No amount of name-dropping will work.\n\nArrests of ZRU Executives\n\nMliswas legal challenge against the ZRU resulted in the arrest of Mtongwiza and Made, who have since appeared in court to face corruption-related allegations. The nature of the charges against them has not been fully disclosed, but sources indicate they relate to mismanagement of rugby funds and lack of financial transparency.\n\nThe unfolding saga has put the spotlight on governance issues within Zimbabwean rugby, with growing concerns about accountability at the highest levels of the sports administration.\n\nWhats Next?\n\nWith Mliswas case now before a disciplinary committee, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining his future in Zimbabwean rugby. Meanwhile, the arrests of senior ZRU officials raise serious questions about financial oversight in the sport.\n\nAs the battle between Mliswa and the rugby union escalates, all eyes will be on how ZRU handles this crisisand whether it can restore credibility to its leadership.\n\nThis is a developing story. More updates to follow.\n\n",

Kingsford Sumana Bagbin,The Speaker of Parliament,Parliament House,Accra.\n\nBackground-\n\nA Century of Instability and Exploitation in the DRC.The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has endured over a century of conflict and exploitation.\n\nThe arbitrary borders imposed during the 188485 Berlin Conference fractured indigenous societies and disrupted traditional governance as expounded in the study of Teperek (2025).\n\nAlthough the nation gained independence in 1960, it has been trapped in cycles of violence, corruption, and foreign interference which is driven largely by the struggle over its vast mineral wealth.\n\nInternational and regional bodies (AU, EAC, SADC) and UN peacekeeping missions have made efforts, including the 2020 Silencing the Guns initiative, yet lasting peace remains elusive (Yeboah & Okoro, 2024).\n\nNeighboring states like Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi have been drawn into these conflicts, worsening regional tensions and fueling further instability.\n\nChallenges-\n\nThe Limits of Conventional Interventions\n\nTraditional external interventions and elite-driven governance models have repeatedly failed to secure peace in the DRC.\n\nKey Challenges include-\n\nWhat New Model Can Break the Cycle of Conflict and Foster Transformation?\n\nGiven the shortcomings of past interventions and centralized governance, how can the DRC achieve lasting peace, stability, and economic transformation?\n\nWhat model can empower local communities and leverage indigenous wisdom to counter external exploitation and internal divisions?\n\nThe way forward-\n\nA Federal or Confederate State Anchored in African-Led Solutions\n\nWe propose establishing a federal or confederate state between the DRC and Rwanda with potential inclusion of Burundi that prioritizes regional integration, grassroots participation, and economic self-reliance.\n\nThis approach includes-\n\nPrioritizing intra-African trade would harness the DRCs resources for the benefit of local populations, creating jobs, improving food security, and expanding access to vital services.\n\nA secure DRC could serve as a cornerstone for a united African governance model, echoing the visions of leaders like Dr. Kwame Nkrumah.\n\nIn a nutshell-\n\nA Radical Yet Practical Shift:This proposal represents a transformative shift from ineffective international interventions to African-led, bottom-up solutions.\n\nBy integrating traditional governance, unifying security, and fostering economic interdependence, a federal or confederate state between the DRC, Rwanda, and potentially Burundi provides a clear pathway to lasting peace and development.\n\nThe time for Africa to reclaim its destiny is now only through self-reliant, indigenous models can Agenda 2063 be truly realized.\n\nWe urge the SADC, EAC, COMESA, and the AU to consider this innovative proposal for a united, stable, and prosperous Central Africa.\n\nOn behalf of the Pan African Solidarity Group,\n\nBenjamin Anyagre Aziginaateeg\n\nCEO, AfriKan Continental Union Consult (ACUC)\n\nReferences:\n\nTeperek, A.

The congress lasted for less than a few hours since there were not enough members to reach the quorum.\n\nAdditionally, the court found that Mwonzora had handpicked members of the National Executive Council instead of allowing democratic elections as required by the partys constitution.\n\nThe ruling also noted that notices for the congress were not properly published in national newspapers, violating Articles 6.2.4.1 and 6.2.4.2 of the MDC-T constitution.The ruling orders the party to convene a fresh congress within six months under an independent electoral commission.\n\nThe court battle is the latest in a series of internal conflicts that have plagued the MDC since the Supreme Courts 2020 ruling, which reinstated the partys 2014 structures and set the stage for Mwonzoras rise to power.\n\nInitially aligned with Mwonzora, Mudzuri fell out with him over leadership disputes and internal democratic processes.\n\nMwonzoras leadership has been marred by controversy, including allegations of expelling political rivals and sidelining key party organs.\n\nCritics argue that his tactics have contributed to the destruction of the MDC, which was once Zimbabwes strongest opposition force under its late founding leader, Morgan Tsvangirai.\n\nMudzuri and his allies contend that the 2022 congress was part of Mwonzoras broader strategy to consolidate power illegitimately.\n\nThe attempt to nullify the congress still leaves [Mwonzora] as the President by virtue of his election at the December 2022 congress, he argued in court.\n\nHowever, the High Court rejected this claim, ruling that his leadership position remains disputed.\n\nThe ruling adds further instability to the MDC, which has already suffered major electoral losses and defections.\n\nThe party, which once posed a formidable challenge to Zanu PF, has fractured into multiple factions.\n\n",
