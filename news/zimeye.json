            "content": "Harare, Zimbabwe  Dorcas Vambe, the 36-year-old wife of popular musician Mambo Dhuterere, appeared before a Harare Magistrate on Thursday facing allegations of defrauding a local politician in a botched car deal worth US$16,000.\n\nThe court heard that Vambe, in collaboration with her brother, misled the complainant into believing that they could procure a Toyota Hilux GD6 for him from Botswana. The alleged incident took place in September this year when the complainant, who was in the market for the vehicle, disclosed his budget to the accused.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Vambe and her brother assured the politician that they had the means and connections to secure the vehicle at the stated price. Trusting their claims, the complainant reportedly transferred the money to the accused. However, after receiving the funds, Vambe and her brother allegedly failed to deliver the vehicle or refund the money.\n\nThe matter came to light when the complainant, after several unsuccessful attempts to recover his money or receive the promised car, reported the incident to the authorities. Following investigations, Vambe was arrested and charged with fraud.\n\nVambe, who is known for her close association with her husband, gospel musician Mambo Dhuterere, has yet to enter a plea. She remains in custody pending further court proceedings.\n\nThe case has drawn significant public attention, given her connection to one of Zimbabwes celebrated music figures. Legal experts suggest the trial could set a precedent for similar cases involving misrepresentation and fraud.\n\nAs of now, efforts to reach Mambo Dhuterere for comment have been unsuccessful. The court is expected to determine Vambes fate in the coming days.\n\n",

The government must engage the best companies or investors who can revive the Kariba Dam Hydro Power Plant.\n\nThe group also provided a visual explanation of the current state of the power supply. They shared two photos, with the first showing the turbines at the Kariba Dam, noting, These are our turbines, and only 2 out of 5 are working. Unfortunately, as of yesterday, only one turbine was functional.\n\nThe second photo depicted Zambias situation, which is similarly strained. Zambia also had only 2 turbines working. Water levels have decreased so much despite other challenges, they added.\n\nThe Varakashis comments highlight the growing frustration and urgency surrounding the ongoing power crisis in the country.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nInfighting within the ZANU PF Youth League has escalated, as Youth League Secretary Tinoda Machakaire has demanded that his deputy, John Paradza, immediately retract a circular that he issued, which allegedly nullified a recent reshuffling of the national executive council.\n\nOn December 9, 2024, Machakaire announced the reshuffle of the ZANU PF Youth League, a move that was met with resistance from Paradza. Paradza argued that the reshuffle was unconstitutional and instructed the affected officials to remain in their positions.\n\nIn his response, Paradza referred to specific provisions within the partys constitution, asserting, May you acquaint yourself with the provisions of Article 26(340)(1)&(2) which provide for the functions and responsibilities of the Deputy Secretary for Youth Affairs. He emphasized that as Deputy Secretary for Youth Affairs, Machakaire had no right to interfere with the functions of the Secretary for Youth Affairs, stating that Machakaire had no constitutional basis for making such a move.\n\nParadza further challenged Machakaires actions, saying, In your letter, you have made vague reference to the composition of the Youth League National Executive Council without particularity on the provision you rely on in making your assertions. He pointed out that there had been no breach of the constitution in the reshuffle, as no official had been removed from the National Executive Council.\n\nMachakaire, in his own letter, defended the reshuffle, stating, Adjustments in the departmental leadership of the Youth League National Executive Council have been implemented purely for the purposes of enhancing the fulfilment of the Youth Leagues constitutional obligations and the execution of the National Peoples Conference Resolutions.\n\nHe also made it clear that the changes were in line with guidance from his principal, asserting, As head of the Youth League, I have communicated the adjustments as I have been duly guided by my Principal in terms of Article 10(88)(1), (2)&(13) and Article 26(339)(1)&(4).\n\nIn conclusion, Machakaire ordered Paradza to withdraw his circular immediately, warning that failure to do so would result in further disciplinary actions. Your much circulated and published correspondence contesting the communicated position is irregular and must be withdrawn forthwith, failing which the appropriate measures shall be set in motion, he stated.\n\nThe growing tension within the Youth League highlights deepening divisions within ZANU PF, with significant implications for the partys future cohesion.\n\n",
