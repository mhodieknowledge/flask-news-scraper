Members are expected to be seated by 11:45hrs and 09:45hrs, respectively.\n\nWhile the official notice did not outline the agenda, party sources suggest the meetings are likely to focus on the escalating power struggles within Zanu PF, where President Emmerson Mnangagwa faces growing unease from factions aligned to his deputy, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe shadow of succession politics continues to loom large, with reports of renewed tensions between the two camps as the Mutare conference draws closer. The hurried convening of both the Politburo and Central Committee reflects Mnangagwas desire to consolidate control and silence dissent ahead of the crucial conference, where policy direction and leadership legitimacy are expected to dominate proceedings.\n\nOver the years, Zanu PF conferences have often been used as battlegrounds for internal power plays  from Robert Mugabes final years, when Mnangagwa himself survived purges, to the 2017 coup that catapulted him into power.\n\nNow, history appears to be repeating itself, with Mnangagwa under pressure to manage factional fissures that threaten to destabilize his grip on the party. Analysts note that the rushed meetings could also be a platform to discipline wayward members, rally loyalty, and project a semblance of unity ahead of Mutare.\n\nWith speculation rife about Mnangagwas succession and Chiwengas rising influence within the military-backed faction, this weeks double meetings could prove decisive in shaping the narrative that will define Zanu PFs Mutare conference and, ultimately, Zimbabwes political trajectory.\n\n",

            "content": "Harare  16 September 2025\n\nIn a major clarification of Zimbabwes inheritance laws, the High Court has ruled that Mjolorists  people living in informal Mapoto/Umasihlalisane arrangements  are not automatically entitled to inherit from a deceased partners estate.\n\nThe ruling, reinforced by the Office of the Master of the High Court, dismantles a widespread misconception that the countrys new Marriages Act puts cohabiting partners on the same legal footing as married spouses.\n\nMjolorists Are Not Surviving Spouses\n\nMr. Eldard Mutasa, speaking for the Master of the High Court, said Section 41 of the Marriages Act (Chapter 5:17)  which introduced civil partnerships  is being dangerously misinterpreted on social media.\n\nMjolorists are not entitled to inheritance at all, Mutasa stressed. Nothing in our laws accords them the status of a surviving spouse.\n\nHe explained that while the Act recognises civil partnerships as relationships between two unmarried adults who live together on a genuine domestic basis, their rights at separation or death are limited strictly to property acquired jointly  not the deceaseds full estate.\n\nCourt Recognition Still Needed\n\nMutasa added that a persons status as a civil partner is not automatic and only becomes legally relevant when a relationship ends.\n\nThey have to be declared a civil partner by the court, he said. This only comes into play when the relationship dissolves. The court is not there to confer inheritance status.\n\nMarriage Certificates Still Carry Legal Weight\n\nThe clarification comes amid a surge of online claims that simply living with someone makes you a wife or husband.\n\nThat is not correct, far from it, Mutasa said. Our laws still protect the institution of marriage, and a marriage certificate continues to carry legal weight for inheritance purposes.\n\nPublic Urged to Get Legal Advice\n\nThe Master of the High Court urged Zimbabweans to seek advice from qualified legal practitioners or estate administrators instead of relying on social media speculation.\n\nThere is nothing like a Mjolorist being entitled to inheritance, Mutasa said. We are here to clear these misconceptions and uphold the countrys laws.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThis ruling affects thousands of Zimbabweans who live in informal unions. While it protects the rights of legally married spouses, it underscores the vulnerability of Mjolorists who wrongly believe they have automatic inheritance rights.\n\nThe Master of the High Court  which handles deceased estates, liquidations, trusts, guardianships and the Guardians Fund  has pledged to step up public education to end misinformation and protect citizens from costly mistakes.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe much-publicised donation of textbooks, computers, internet access, and food aid to Cowdray Park Primary School in Bulawayo by the Mthuli Foundation over the weekend has sparked outrage, with critics arguing it only highlights the governments long-standing neglect of public education.\n\nFinance Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube, through his foundation, handed over mealie meal for the school feeding programme and a few textbooks to ease shortages. But instead of being celebrated, many have questioned why the state of Zimbabwes schools has been left to depend on personal charity from cabinet ministers.\n\nFor years we have been forced to share one textbook between five or more children. Some of us were failing to understand lessons because we had no reference material. Yes, this donation helps, but it should never have come to this. Where has government been all along? a frustrated pupil asked.\n\nParents echoed the same anger, with one noting, This gesture is welcome, but its also embarrassing. Why must an entire school depend on handouts from a minister when it is the governments constitutional duty to provide education? It shows the system has completely collapsed.\n\nEven school authorities admitted that the donation, while helpful, underscored how dire the situation had become. Deputy Head Mrs. Zanele Haruzivishe said, We are excited, but the truth is that for years our learners have been abandoned. This is just a drop in the ocean compared to what is really needed to fix our school.\n\nCritics also dismissed Ncubes claim that the donation was part of efforts to prepare children for the digital era. The only government school in this area is being turned into a photo opportunity for political mileage, one parent said. They talk of Vision 2030, yet our children are hungry and without basic books. How can you speak of digital literacy when the basics are missing?\n\nThe episode has reignited debate about the collapse of Zimbabwes education system, where schools survive on donations while government officials issue lofty promises.\n\n",
