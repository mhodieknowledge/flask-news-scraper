            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri  ZESA Holdings has unveiled plans to add four new electricity generation units to Zimbabwes grid, but the announcement has done little to reassure citizens who continue to experience frequent blackouts across the country.\n\nThe plan was revealed during an oversight visit by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Energy and Power Development to Hwange Thermal Power Station. The committee assessed ongoing projects and ZESAs preparedness to meet future energy demand.\n\nEngineer Cleopas Nyachowe, ZESA Holdings Group Acting Chief Executive Officer, said the new unitsHwange 9, 10, 11, and 12would be part of a mix of thermal, solar, and geothermal projects. This initiative is being pushed alongside green energy projects, such as solar and geothermal, which are also prominent around this place, Nyachowe explained.\n\nWhile Units 7 and 8 have recently been commissioned, providing some relief, power cuts remain a daily reality for households and businesses. Experts warn that merely adding more units will not solve systemic problems. The issue is not generation alone; distribution, maintenance, and management are equally critical, said an energy analyst.\n\nThe Parliamentary Portfolio Committee highlighted the importance of closely monitoring ZESAs operations ahead of the 2026 national budget, noting the capital-intensive nature of the utility.\n\nCritics argue that expansion plans may be more symbolic than practical. ZESA keeps announcing new projects, but citizens are still left in the dark, said one Harare resident. Without structural reform, these new units may end up benefiting a few politically connected interests rather than the public.\n\nWith industrial and household demand rising, skepticism remains high that ZESA can deliver reliable electricity in the near term, despite the ambitious expansion plans.\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri  Newly co-opted ZANU PF Central Committee member Dr Kudakwashe Tagwirei, widely regarded as President Emmerson Mnangagwas blue-eyed boy and a controversial businessman, has announced multi-million-dollar projects in Hatcliffe and Chitungwiza, prompting critics to accuse him of prioritizing personal gain over genuine community development.\n\nSpeaking at an inter-district meeting on Sunday in Hatcliffe, Tagwirei outlined plans to construct a multi-million-dollar complex at PaDust market, claiming it would accelerate growth in the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector.\n\nThe move is meant to empower everyone under the mantra of leaving no one and no place behind, he said.\n\nTagwirei also launched a US$200,000 revolving fund for all wings of the party in Hatcliffe Zone 4, with each wing expected to receive US$50,000. In addition, he announced community upliftment projects, including plans to drill 80 boreholes across Chitungwiza to improve access to clean water.\n\nDespite these promises, citizens and analysts have questioned the true motives behind Tagwireis initiatives. This is political cronyism at its finest, said one political analyst. Tagwirei is using these projects to build his empire and reinforce his position as Mnangagwas ally, rather than genuinely empowering communities.\n\nTagwirei framed his plans within the governments Vision 2030 programme, praising the presidents achievements. We have witnessed massive development in all sectors of the economy. A number of projects have been completed. We have seen the massive construction of dams, the New Parliament Building, rehabilitation of Robert Mugabe International Airport, food self-sufficiency, rehabilitation of major roads, among others, have been completed, he said.\n\nSocial media users and citizens were quick to express scepticism.\n\nHe talks about empowerment, but we all know about his controversial business dealings, one resident said.\n\nAnother added, These funds and mega-projects benefit Tagwirei and his allies more than ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nObservers warn that lavish projects led by politically connected businessmen risk being viewed as self-serving, and that without transparency and accountability, these initiatives may fail to deliver meaningful benefits. When someone with vast wealth and political connections spearheads community projects, you have to ask who truly benefits, said a Harare resident.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues to struggle with inflation, high unemployment, and limited access to basic services, critics say Tagwireis announcements highlight the contrast between political spectacle and the everyday realities of ordinary citizens.\n\n",

            "content": "South Africa  Operation Dudula has announced the death of one of its senior figures, Daniel Radebe, triggering a wave of public reactions that reflect both sympathy and the deep controversy surrounding the movements anti-immigrant campaigns.\n\nIn a statement posted on social media, the organisation confirmed the passing of Radebe, described as theformer National Deputy Chairperson, one of the Executors of the organisation.A tribute poster shared by the movement reads:Rest in eternal peace, commander morning,accompanied by Radebes image in military-style attire, a visual aesthetic long associated with Dudulas paramilitary identity.\n\nWhile Dudula members and sympathisers expressed condolences, other social media users responded with sharp commentary referencing the groups long-standing campaign against undocumented foreign nationals. One user wrote:He has gone to a place where documentation is not an issue. RIP,a pointed remark highlighting Dudulas reputation for aggressively targeting migrants accused of lacking immigration papers.\n\nRadebe was among the prominent figures involved in the movements early mobilisation, which began around 2021 in Soweto before spreading to Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Rustenburg, Cape Town and other urban centres. Operating through community patrols, protests, and business inspections, Operation Dudula positioned itself as a citizens movement fighting crime, drug trafficking and what it described as the economic displacement of South Africans by foreign nationals.\n\nHuman rights groups, however, have repeatedly criticised the movement, accusing it of vigilantism, unlawful profiling, intimidation and fuelling xenophobic attitudes. Reports over the past three years have documented Dudula activists shutting down informal businesses operated by migrants, conducting street-level ID checks, and demanding police action against foreign traders and residents. International organisations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have warned that such actions risk escalating violence and undermining constitutional protections.\n\nDespite the controversy, Dudula has maintained a significant grassroots following, particularly in low-income communities affected by unemployment and service delivery failures. The movements leaders have argued that government inaction on immigration enforcement left ordinary citizens with no choice but to intervene. Radebe, in particular, was viewed as one of the architects of Dudulas organisational structure and mobilisation strategies.\n\nHis death comes at a moment when Operation Dudula is attempting to reposition itself nationally through its political wing, the Dudula Movement South Africa (DMSA), which has signalled intentions to influence local and national policy debates. Analysts say Radebes passing may shift internal dynamics within the movement, though it remains unclear whether his role will be filled or reorganised.\n\nReactions to the news have therefore mirrored the broader national divide on immigration, security, and community activism. For supporters, Radebe is remembered as a patriot advocating for South Africans rights. For critics, his legacy is inseparable from Dudulas confrontational and exclusionary campaigns.\n\nOperation Dudula has not released information on the circumstances of Radebes death, funeral arrangements, or succession plans. However, the online tributes and criticisms underscore the enduring complexity of South Africas debates on migration, belonging and grassroots policingissues that will continue to shape the movement long after one of its key leaders has been laid to rest.\n\n",

He also promised to support small and medium enterprises, stating that SMEs would be capitalized to drive economic growth.\n\nTagwirei further advocated for protecting local industries, saying certain sectors of the economy should be reserved for Zimbabweans.

That is why Munhumutapa Day, on 15 September, will be declared a national holiday in his honour, Tavengwa said.\n\nThe meeting also unveiled a series of initiatives under the governments Vision 2030 agenda, including the expansion of the Chitepo School of Ideology to accommodate more cadres, expedited vetting of non-combatants, and the development of industrial hubs for small and medium enterprises.\n\nHowever, critics argue that these pledges do little to address Zimbabwes deepening economic and social challenges.
