            "content": "By James Gwati-Kudakwashe Tagwirei, the controversial oil tycoon, presidential ally, and alleged architect of grand-scale corruption in Zimbabwe, is now accused of deepening his ties with the military as part of a calculated power play to position himself for political office.\n\nLast week, Tagwirei orchestrated a high-profile event in Masvingo under the guise of a youth empowerment and land tenure programme. But behind the scenes, the gathering served as a soft launch for his political ambitions, an ambition reportedly enjoying the quiet endorsement of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, much to the chagrin of Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nIn a telling development, the wife of Presidential Guard Commander Brigadier General Fidelis Mhonda, Nyasha Mhonda, was a key figure in organising the event. Sources saidshe handled critical logistical arrangements and managed the guest list. Nyasha Mhonda was visibly present at the function, wearing a beret emblazoned with ED, Mnangagwas initials, cementing suspicions that the President is backing Tagwireis quiet power grab.\n\nFurther controversy surrounds claims by outspoken war veteran Blessed Runesu Geza, who recently alleged that Tagwirei is paying Brigadier General Mhonda a staggering US$25,000 per month for protection. The allegation suggests that Zimbabwes security apparatus is now on the payroll of an unelected businessman who is using state machinery to entrench his political interests.\n\nThe event, held under the banner of the Land Tenure Implementation Leadership Success Series Programme, was attended by senior government and ZANU PF officials, including Masvingo Minister of State Ezra Chadzamira, ZANU PF provincial chairperson Rabison Mavhenyengwa and his deputy, Trust Mugabe, as well as one of the Prisons and Correctional Services bosses, Stanley Kondongwe.\n\nThe initiativeled by Tagwireis newly formed Land Tenure Implementation Committeeis being implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Information Communication Technology, headed by youthful Minister Tatenda Mavetera. Framed as a national programme to empower youth through land, the scheme has drawn sharp criticism from war veterans, who view it as a potential reversal of the chaotic land reform programme of the 2000s.\n\nTagwirei has long been the poster child of state-capture in Zimbabwe. He rose to prominence through Sakunda Holdings, a company that was awarded multi-billion-dollar fuel importation deals and command agriculture contracts without public tender. Under the Mnangagwa administration, Tagwirei has enjoyed unchecked access to state contracts, allegedly inflating prices and receiving preferential treatment from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.\n\nHis business empire spans fuel, mining, banking, and agricultureoften linked to controversial asset transfers involving the state. A 2021United States Treasuryreport sanctioned Tagwirei for corruption, accusing him of using his close ties to the government to gain exclusive access to hard currency and corruptly acquire state assets.\n\nDespite mounting evidence of his influence-peddling, Tagwirei remains untouchable in Zimbabwe, protected by his financial contributions to ZANU PF campaigns and now, it appears, by direct military backing.\n\nTagwireis growing involvement in party politics, including reported efforts to secure a seat on the ZANU PF Central Committee in Masvingo and Harare provinces, has added fuel to speculation that he is being groomed as a successor to Mnangagwa. His land tenure events are now viewed as campaign-style rallies designed to build a grassroots base and curry favour with traditional leaders and war veterans.\n\nPolitical observers say his meteoric rise could trigger internal divisions within ZANU PF, particularly from the military faction aligned to Chiwenga, who sees himself as the rightful heir to Mnangagwa.\n\nYet by bribing generals and co-opting the military elite, Tagwirei is playing a dangerous gameone that could deepen Zimbabwes political instability and entrench oligarchic rule under the veneer of populist empowerment rhetoric.\n\n",

            "content": "By Showbiz Reporter- Veteran musician and mentor to some of Zimbabwes music legends,Shepherd Chinyani, has fallen on hard times. The Vhuka Boys frontman, once a pillar of the local music scene, is now broke, battling illness, and living in ruralSekeafter selling his Harare home.\n\nIn a recent interview withZimpapers Arts and Entertainment Hub, Chinyani, 66, expressed heartbreak over what he describes as abandonment by some of the very artists he helped nurture in the early days of their careers.\n\nI feel betrayed, he said, sounding disheartened. Some of the musicians I mentored have forgotten about me.\n\nChinyani, who spent 65 years as an urban resident, recently relocated to Seke, calling it his new home. He previously lived inDzivaresekwa, Harare, where he not only built his music career but also provided for some of Zimbabwes greatest artiststhe late John Chibadura and Tinei Chikupo, as well as living legendsMadzibaba Nicholas Zakaria andAlick Macheso.\n\nI supported some of these artists even though they were older than me, he said. But misfortune struck.\n\nChinyani sold his Dzivaresekwa house in 2022 forUS$18,000, citing the rising cost of living and mounting medical expenses.\n\nI moved to Seke near Besa Primary School with my two wives, he said. City life had become unbearable, and I needed to pay medical bills and secure shelter for my family.\n\nHowever, life in the communal lands has not brought the relief he hoped for. With no steady source of income, Chinyani said he and his family now survive by Gods grace.\n\nRight now, Im confined because of an infection in my leg, and my wife is battling breast cancer, he said. Its a grim situation. We live from hand to mouth, unlike in Dzivaresekwa where I used to make a little money repairing damaged speakers and guitars.\n\nHis home in Seke is also far from complete.\n\nI have a place to stay, but one side of the house needs roofing and the floors arent finished. Unfortunately, I just dont have the money.\n\nDespite his circumstances, Chinyaniwho turns67 on June 14remains eager to return to what he knows best: music and mentoring.\n\nMusic has been my life since childhood. I have a passion for teaching young people, and I see a lot of talent in this area. But I have no equipment, he said. I sold most of my sound system to feed my family. All I have left is my guitar.\n\nChinyani reflects on his decision with mixed feelings.\n\nSometimes I regret selling the house. But I had no choiceit was about saving lives. I have 12 children and 29 grandchildren. I also dreamed of building a bigger home where we could all live together. At the time, this seemed like the only option.\n\n",

It is this peace that has enabled us to achieve development at a faster pace, Mnangagwa said.\n\nHowever, critics argue that this so-called peace has come at the expense of democratic integrity. A local think tank recently described Zanu PF as anti-democracy, citing increasing repression of dissent, shrinking media freedom, and politically motivated arrests.\n\nIn his address, Mnangagwa also shifted focus to agriculture, urging party members to learn from successful farmers like himself. Each time you plant, you should aim to achieve better results than in the previous farming season, he advised.\n\nHe went on to express concern over Zimbabwes dependence on food imports. A nation should be fed by its own people, he declared. That is why here at Precabe, we are committed to producing crops all year round.\n\nDespite his self-congratulatory tone, Mnangagwas remarks have drawn backlash from civil society groups, who accuse his government of undermining democracy under the guise of stability.\n\n",

When shall all this end? Citizens are being pauperized left, right and centre, why does the citizenry of this country deserve so uncaring & heartless a leadership? he said.\n\nChamisa also challenged the relevance of the ZBC licence fee, arguing that citizens should not be forced to fund what he called partisan content.\n\nWhat are people supposed to do with all this cruel taxation? Why must I pay for a service I dont use? Why should I pay for partisan propaganda, where I am attacked in person and demonized from dawn to dusk? he asked.\n\nHe further questioned the role of Parliament in safeguarding citizens rights and labelled the situation in Zimbabwe as a crime scene.\n\nDo we have a parliament in Zimbabwe? Which other country does this to her citizens? Is this not naked provocation? Is Zimbabwe not a crime scene?
