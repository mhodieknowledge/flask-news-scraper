Many Zimbabweans interpreted his condition as a form of karma orngozi(atonement for past wrongdoing).\n\nAmong the most harrowing cases linked to Makendenge is that of opposition politicianJob Sikhala, who has publicly accused him of subjecting him to electrocution and other forms of torture during interrogations. Sikhala, however, has stated he would still choose to show Makendenge love and kindness despite the suffering inflicted upon him.\n\nJournalists were not spared either. Reporters who now work for independent outlets recall Makendenges relentless harassment, including raids, arrests, and interrogations designed to crush investigative journalism.\n\nThese actions were part of a broader state campaign to muzzle the independent press, which was viewed as a threat to Mugabes grip on power.\n\nNow reportedly struggling with mental health problems, Makendenges plight has become a subject of public reflection.\n\nMany Zimbabweans see it as a cautionary tale of the consequences of abusing authority and wielding state power to oppress others.\n\nThe reactions underline an enduring national conversation about justice, accountability, and the long-term impact of cruelty on both victims and perpetrators.\n\nWhile some believe Makendenges suffering is poetic justice, others argue that Zimbabwe still lacks a formal mechanism of transitional justice to address decades of human rights abuses committed by state security forces.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dr. Masimba Mavaza\n\nI was sitting at Gate 4, waiting to board the always-delayed Ugandan Airways flight. My heart was heavy as I prepared to leave the motherland once again for the so-called slave yard. Then a message flickered onto my phone from a colleague. It carried the heaviest, most painful news: Director Nyere is no more.\n\nI had just met him. I never knew that meeting was a farewell.\n\nToday, we mourn the loss of a remarkable individual who dedicated his life to serving our nation. As a distinguished intelligence officer, Director Michael Muchenje Nyere demonstrated exceptional skill, unwavering commitment, and unshakable integrity.\n\nIt is with profound grief and sorrow that the nation learnt of the untimely death of the late Cde. Michael Muchenje Nyere, who passed away suddenly on August 14, 2025. Known to those close to him as Cde. KIM, he was a practical officer who knew no bounds.\n\nMichael Muchenje Nyere was born on April 24, 1961, in Chigasiye Village, Goromonzi District, Mashonaland East Province, to Fidelis Samie Nyere and Regina Raganai. From 1968 to 1974, he pursued his primary education at Ushewokunze Primary School in Seke District, before proceeding to Harare High School in Mbare, where he studied from 1975 to 1978. He successfully completed his A Levels at the same school in 1979.\n\nHis journey in service began with civilian employment. After completing A Levels, he worked at Barclays Bank from March 1981 to March 1982, then as a teacher at Mukaro Secondary School in Gutu (April to August 1982). From September 1982 to September 1983, he served as a Personnel Clerk at Old Mutual.\n\nIn his pursuit of higher learning, Cde. Nyere enrolled at the University of Zimbabwe, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree in History (19841986). Motivated by the desire to defend the independence dividend, he was attested into the Presidents Department on May 1, 1988, as an Assistant Intelligence Officer under the External Branch.\n\nHe completed his Basic Intelligence Training Course at Hatfield Training Academy and began his career as an Evaluation Officer. His precision and devotion to duty saw him promoted to Assistant Senior Intelligence Officer (ASIO) in 1991.\n\nIn the same year, he was posted to Ethiopia as a Liaison Officer, where he served with distinction until 1995. On his return, he was appointed to the Evaluation Division and promoted to Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO) in January 1996. Four years later, in 2000, he rose to Divisional Intelligence Officer (DIO) and Deputy Head of the Evaluation Division.\n\nIn 2004, he was deployed to Rome, Italy, as Liaison Officer. During this tour of duty (20042011), he tenaciously defended Zimbabwes national interests against Western diplomatic onslaughts. Later, under Director General Isaac Moyo, he was tasked to engage private media journalists, encouraging them to defend their country with honesty and without bias.\n\nIn 2011, he was promoted to Principal Intelligence Officer (PIO) and appointed Head of Anti-Corruption Investigations under the Economics Branch. A year later, in August 2012, he became Principal Staff Officer (PSO) to the Director General.\n\nFrom 2015 onwards, Nyere continued to ascend through the ranks  redeployed as Head of Evaluation (PIO) in the External Branch, then promoted to Assistant Director, Planning and Co-ordination (2018), Deputy Director of the same (2020), and finally Director of Analysis and Co-ordination after the division was upgraded into a full branch. On February 6, 2025, he was redeployed to the Economics Branch, where he served until his sudden passing.\n\nCde. Nyere was more than just a senior officer; he was a fatherly figure whose wisdom and counsel guided many. In meetings, he often spoke of truth and responsibility. Loving a country does not mean lying through writing, he once told me. Let the truth be said responsibly.\n\nOn another occasion, he reflected: Some journalists will be punished in heaven for giving people an overdose of truth, and others for starving people of the truth. Strike a balancebe responsible and truthful.\n\nSuch was the depth of his wisdom.\n\nHe inspired not only his colleagues in the intelligence community but also writers and journalists. Unlike some officers consumed by pride, Nyere was humble, approachable, and deeply committed to nurturing others.\n\nJust days before his passing, I met him at the Monomotapa Hotel for one of our usual review meetings. He showed no signs of illness. We shared a warm, meaningful conversationhis dedication, expertise, and love for country still abundant and clear.\n\nHis contributions to Zimbabwes national security and defence will not be forgotten. His legacy is one of unwavering service, inspiring leadership, and unmatched integrity.\n\nAs we bid farewell to this remarkable patriot, we take comfort in knowing his work will continue to inspire and protect our nation.\n\nMay Director Michael Muchenje Nyere rest in eternal peace, knowing his service has made a lasting impact.\n\nFare thee well, comrade. Rest in peace, Simboti  the Leopard of Integrity.Your legacy lives on in the hearts of those you served and inspired.\n\n",

            "content": "By Political Reporter One of President Emmerson Mnangagwas staunch allies,David Munowenyu, has controversially secured a lucrative tender to supply ambulance services to Harare City Council, in a move that has triggered outrage among residents and split councillors.\n\nMunowenyu, the owner ofDiscovery Ambulance Services, has been closely linked with Mnangagwas health initiatives, frequently criss-crossing the country under thePresidential Emergency Medical Scheme, where his company provided services during state medical outreaches. His latest windfall follows a familiar pattern in which Zanu PF-aligned businesspeople and loyalists are awarded government and municipal tenders without going through transparent procurement processes.\n\nDuring the last full council meeting, councillors clashed bitterly over the deal, which will see Harare residents payingdouble feesfor ambulances  an upfront charge for services on top of the existingUS$1 monthly emergency services levyalready collected by council.\n\nCivil society groups argue that the contract is another example of the ruling partys patronage system at work.Precious Shumba, director of the Harare Residents Trust, blasted the arrangement:\n\nPrivatisation of public services is not the best way to improve health delivery. The Discovery Ambulance Services deal was not selected through a competitive bidding process but handpicked on an unsolicited submission. Such contracts, with financial implications for millions of residents, must be transparent and accountable.\n\nSimilarly,Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) coordinator, Reuben Akili, accused the city of being captured by political elites:\n\nThere was no proper tendering, no due processes. The City of Harare has been collecting emergency levy funds all year to buy ambulances, yet not a single vehicle has been procured. Instead, residents are being punished by deals that enrich Zanu PF-linked cronies.\n\nCurrently, Harares 2.4 million residents rely on onlyfour functioning public ambulances, compared to the international standard of at least 48, highlighting how dire the shortage is.\n\nCritics also point out that Munowenyu joins a long list of Mnangagwas allies who have benefitted from questionable state or council tenders. These include:\n\nThe latest ambulance deal fits into this entrenched system ofpolitical patronage and tenderpreneurship, where loyalty to Mnangagwa is often rewarded with contracts at the expense of transparency and service delivery.\n\nCouncil spokespersonStanley Gamareferred questions to mayorJacob Mafume, who was unavailable. CouncillorDenford Ngadziorecondemned the move:\n\nResidents are already paying an ambulance levy. Forcing them to pay cash again when picked up is exploitation. This deal benefits one businessman at the expense of the public.\n\nThe founder and CEO of Discovery Ambulance,David Munowenyu, did not respond to questions.\n\nIronically, in July, Health and Child Care MinisterDouglas Mombeshorahad hailed Discovery Ambulance Services as a partner in delivering free medical services under the Presidential Emergency Medical Scheme. The Harare deal, however, appears to contradict that promise  as instead of easing the health burden, it risks deepening the costs for residents already struggling under economic hardships.\n\n",
