            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe National Mine Workers Union of Zimbabwe ( NMWUZ) President, Kurebwa Javangwe Nhomboka has called for the amendment of the Collective Bargaining Agreement for workers in the mining sector.In a letter to the National Employment Council for the Mining Industry dated 19 September 2025, Nhomboka cited critical issues that include the need to revamp allowances given to mining workers such transport and housing.\n\n Most of the mining companies coming into existence are not providing their employees with transport and accommodation and thus creating a disparity in their earnings with those employees being provided with transport and those being provided with company accommodation, said Nhomboka.The transport and housing allowances will cushion these employees who are not being provided with these benefits.\n\nNMWUZ also called for the inclusion of a job evaluation committee under the Technical sub committee responsible for formulation of grades and evaluation process.\n\n Owing to the technological changes and taking into cognizance the current promulgation year of our CBA, some of the job titles are not existent in the current CBA and thus requiring a complete overhaul of the positions and grades and this process needs a job evaluation exercise to be conducted by a separate committee,said Nhomboka.\n\nNhomboka also called for the inclusion of paid educational leave and compulsory medical check ups as workers in the sector are subjected to a dusty mining environment during the course of their work.\n\nThere is need to include paid educational leave as an employee benefit provided that the education is industry related and that should be a subject for negotiations at the employment council.\n\n The proposed benefit is in line with the Labour amendment Act number 11 of 2023 under section 74 (3) (o).Mining employees are subjected to dust particles and thus raising their vulnerability to get infected with diseases such as pneumoconiosis. This therefore requires that there be periodical and compulsory medical check ups at least quarterly at the employers expense.\n\n Further that employees be placed on an employer contributed medical aid scheme.\n\nOther Amendments proposals also include to improve the grading of small workers and their employees who are to be graded into grades 1, 3, 7 and 11.\n\nThe justification is that in providing for grades 1, 5 and 11, there is too narrow a margin considering the many skills acquired by the modern-day employee and thus adding some grades in between the existing grades will cater for those employees under the small worker category.On freedom of association which is a workers constitutional right, Nhomboka called for the repeal of clause 7 (9) (a)(ii) (i) of CBA .\n\nThe provision under clause 7 (9) (a) (ii) (i) of the CBA which reads as follows should be repealed as it whittles down the employees constitutional right of freedom of association and the right to organize; Provided that(i) An employer who has received requests from less than 10 members of the trade union may refuse to make such deductions.Repeal of the provision under clause 7 (11) which reads: Provided that any dismissal shall be referred to a labour officer for an order or determination terminating the contract of employment in terms of regulations published under the Labour Act [Chapter 28:01], as amended from time to time. As it is no longer in sync with our current disciplinary mechanism.\n\nOn Proposal to review gratuity percentages, Nhomboka said:\n\nProposal to review gratuity percentages under clause 7 (13) to at least for 1 year  3% in that ascending order up to 40 years  42%.With regards to clause 7 (14) gratuity percentage proposal to review 5 years  7% in ascending order up to 40 years  42%.\n\nThe NMWUZ president also said there was need to review and ammend annual leave days, sick leave and maternity leave.\n\nWe propose to amend annual leave days under clause 18 (1) and schedule D so that it consistent with the current Labour Act provisions. The same should be the same with clause 18 (12) with regards to sick leave. Maternity to be amended from the current 90 days on full pay to 98 days on full pay as currently provided for by the Labour Act.\n\nThere are also calls to ammend the CBA to give contract workers in the mining sector, fixed term contracts.\n\nThere is need to incorporate under clause 34 (Contract workers), a subclause giving effect to a ceiling or number of fixed term contracts warranting an employee to be on an employment contract without limitation of time as has been mandated by the Labour Act Chapter 28:01.\n\nSchedule E on remuneration to be repealed on the basis that wage rates are now being negotiated separately from time to time.There were also proposals to ammend working hours and overtime.\n\nWe propose that no overtime shall be paid in lieu of overtime worked, if parties agree on time off and it should be paid as follows-when an employee works 10hrs on public holidays, the hours of rest should be 20hrs and in simple terms the hours worked should be doubled and on normal working days the hours worked multiplied by 1.5,said Nhomboka.\n\nWorking days should be from Monday to Friday with Saturday and Sunday being weekly rest days.Employees engaged on staff work to be paid 0.75% of their basic earnings for each hour worked beyond 208hrs in a working monthly wages and salaries.\n\n Overtime worked, bonus or any incentive should be paid separately from wages/salaries.\n\nNhomboka proposed that workers working with mechanised mining equipment without proper grades must be given acting 30 percent allowances.\n\nMechanised mining equipment positions without proper grades such as BolterRigLHD operator dumper,operator rockscaler/rockshield utility vehicles (transport/charging/Tyre handler), bobcat operator, grader operator must be given acting allowances.It should be paid as 30% of the grade one is acting on.\n\nMulti skilled employees, when one is qualified to operate more than one machine, that person should be remunerated by adding a notch on every extra machine being operated as follows:B4-1 machineB4-2 two machinesB5-3 three machines.\n\nNhomboka concluded:\n\nOn service pay, this is correct as it is regards to % ages but it should be added to the basic pay after every year completed.\n\nOn appeal period, the period should be amended from three (3) working days to seven (7) working days.\n\nThe provision requiring the employer to levy for the provision of water, electricity, fuel, e.t.c should be repealed and substituted with a provision compelling the employer to provide these utilities free of charge.\n\nGrades of the operators should be reviewed upwards as the industry is now being involved in mechanized mining and this should be done under the job evaluation exercise.Charge hands proposed allowance of $1 per shift worked. Underground work: Employees in grades 1-12 to receive a proposed allowance for working underground ranging from 20% of basic earnings per shift for it comes with high risks of accidents. Night work allowance to be reviewed from the current 10% of the basic earnings per shift to at least 1% of the monthly basic multiplied by the number of shifts worked in a month.We propose review of the current heat allowance to 10 % of one monthly basic multiplied by the number of shifts worked.\n\n",

When the rest of the nation is living in abject poverty whilst him and his cronies live as if they are in Monaco is unacceptable. ED is running a car-laden corrupt system, its now time he goes. We know he has volunteered that he wants to resign, if he does not, we will assist him. Thats the best decision and he has to GO! Its OVER, Kasukuwere wrote.\n\nKasukuwere, a former ZANU PF political commissar now in exile, has positioned himself as one of Mnangagwas fiercest critics since the 2017 coup that toppled the late Robert Mugabe. His latest remarks add to the growing chorus of discontent over Zimbabwes economic decline, with inflation, a weakening currency, and rising unemployment worsening living conditions for ordinary citizens.\n\nThe explosive claims come at a time when speculation over Mnangagwas political future is rife, amid internal ZANU PF succession battles and mounting criticism from opposition parties and civic groups.\n\nHowever, there has been no official confirmation from the Office of the President and Cabinet regarding Mnangagwas alleged willingness to resign.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent- The US Government has deported seven after serving jail terms and declared them undesirable US citizens.\n\nThe seven arrived at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport last week.\n\nThey were flown in on a chartered plane that also carried deportees from Ghana and Zambia, with Mozambique scheduled as the next stop.\n\nAccording to the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC), the men had served prison terms in the U.S. before being declared undesirable immigrants under American law.\n\nSome returned home with little more than the clothes on their backs. Tendai Moyosvi, a trained chef, told ZBC he plans to start a business in Zimbabwe after serving ten years in prison, while others expressed an interest in farming.\n\nFor one returnee, identified only as Mabhugu, reintegration presents unique challenges. Having left Zimbabwe as a child, he admitted he could no longer speak or understand Shona. I was born here, in Masvingo. I grew up in the United States, in Pennsylvania, he said.\n\nThe deportations reflect a broader reality for Zimbabweans abroad. Since the early 2000s, hundreds of thousands have left the country in response to economic collapse, political instability, and failing industries. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates that at least 908,000 Zimbabweans live outside the country, with South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States being top destinations. In the U.S., the population of Zimbabweans has doubled over the past decade, from about 60,000 in 2010 to more than 120,000 today.\n\nFor many, however, life abroad is precarious. American immigration law is particularly unforgiving toward noncitizens with criminal convictions, especially those involving aggravated felonies, which almost always trigger removal after sentences are served. Even those without convictions face risks if they overstay visas or breach immigration rules, as relief options such as asylum or cancellation of removal are limited.\n\nBack home, returnees struggle to restart their lives. Some, like Mabhugu, lack language fluency or family ties after decades abroad, while others encounter stigma attached to their deportee status. The Ministry of Social Welfare has provided initial support, but questions remain about long-term reintegration. Job training, psychological assistance, and targeted programs will be vital if deportees are to rebuild their futures.\n\nThe deportations also highlight the vulnerability of Zimbabweans abroad. Those with unsettled immigration status or criminal records face uncertain prospects, particularly in countries like the U.S. where enforcement has tightened. At the same time, the fate of these individuals underscores the delicate balance Zimbabwe must strike between engaging its diaspora and supporting those forced to return.\n\nThe diaspora has become an essential economic lifeline for the country. In the first nine months of 2024, Zimbabwe received about US$1.9 billion in remittances, a 16.5% increase from the same period in 2023, accounting for roughly a quarter of all foreign-currency receipts. More recent data shows that in February 2025 alone, remittances stood at US$165 million, up from US$153.8 million a year earlier, representing about 17% of total inflows. These funds not only sustain trade balances but also support education, healthcare, and household consumption, while helping stabilise the fragile currency system.\n\nUltimately, the story of these deportees is not just one of punishment but of the wider trajectory of a nation whose people continue to leave in search of opportunity and stability, and the painful realities that unfold when dreams abroad collapse.\n\n",

            "content": "By Showbiz Reporter  One of the top Star FM DJ Babongile Sikhonjwa, has died.\n\nHe was 49.\n\nIn a statement, Sunday, Star FM described Sikhonjwa as a cherished voice who joined the Star FM family in 2023 as host ofThe After Drive.\n\nKnown for his charisma, passion, and unwavering commitment to Zimbabwes creative industry, Sikhonjwa quickly became a popular voice on the airwaves.\n\nHis energy, laughter, and love for the arts made him not only a remarkable broadcaster but also a powerful advocate for Zimbabwes artistic community, read the statement from Star FM.\n\nSikhonjwa was widely credited with providing a platform for emerging talent, helping to profile and promote upcoming artists in a media environment where space for alternative and independent voices remains limited.\n\nStar FM was launched in June 2012 as Zimbabwes first commercial radio station, but its ownership has long drawn criticism.\n\nThe station is owned by Zimbabwe Newspapers (1980) Limited (Zimpapers), the countrys biggest media conglomerate, which is majority-owned and tightly controlled by the government.\n\nInstead of widening media plurality, critics argue Star FM extended the states dominance into the broadcasting sector.\n\nZimpapers already controlled the main daily newspapers (The HeraldandChronicle), the Sunday titles (The Sunday MailandSunday News), as well as provincial papers.\n\nWith Star FM, and later Capitalk FM, Diamond FM, and Nyaminyami FM, Zimpapers entrenched a monopoly that many see as squeezing out independent voices.\n\nSince independence in 1980, Zimbabwes media landscape has been shaped by partisan control and suppression of dissent.\n\nThe early post-independence years saw state dominance through the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) and Zimpapers, while critical voices were stifled.\n\nThe Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA), introduced in 2002 under President Robert Mugabe, became a notorious tool of repression, shutting down independent newspapers such asThe Daily Newsand intimidating journalists through arrests and license denials.\n\nWhile the law was repealed in 2021, its legacy lingers in a culture of self-censorship and restrictive regulation.\n\nIn this environment, the states media empire has consistently amplified ruling party narratives while muting dissent.\n\nOpposition voices, civic activists, and community-based media are often sidelined, forced into exile, or reduced to operating through online platforms and WhatsApp groups.\n\nSikhonjwas work at Star FM highlighted this contradiction.\n\nAs an advocate for the arts, he gave space to new voices in Zimbabwes creative community.\n\nYet, the very platform he worked for is part of a state-controlled media ecosystem that has historically limited diversity and excluded alternative political or civic perspectives.\n\nStar FMs tribute captures Sikhonjwas contribution as a broadcaster and cultural activist. But his death also underscores the unfinished struggle for media plurality in Zimbabwewhere many voices remain unheard, and ownership structures continue to tilt the airwaves in favour of the ruling elite.\n\n",

Despite these setbacks, Nengomasha credited her time at the SRC with meaningful progress. In her farewell message, she said:\n\nSport is richer because of the synergies created. I am grateful for the opportunity to have served my country at the realm of sports administration. I wish the sector all the best in its endeavours.\n\nThe SRC acknowledged her contributions, particularly in strengthening governance structures and enhancing stakeholder engagement during her leadership.\n\nIn the interim, Peter Mudzimiri, Director of Legal and Corporate Services, has been appointed Acting Director General with immediate effect.

Since 2003, policy missteps  including unrestrained money printing, command-style economic interventions, and the controversial 2009 abandonment of the Zimbabwe dollar  have undermined public confidence in local currency.\n\nAttempts to restore monetary sovereignty through the introduction of bond notes in 2016 and the RTGS dollar in 2019 collapsed under runaway inflation, forcing authorities to again allow the US dollar as legal tender.\n\nWhile Ncube insists the ZiG will anchor long-term stability, economists remain cautious. Professor Gift Mugano has repeatedly advised government to adopt prosperous monetary policies that restore confidence and ensure the local currency is backed by productivity rather than decree.\n\nHe warns that de-dollarisation without strong fundamentalssuch as export growth, fiscal transparency, and investor trustrisks repeating past failures.\n\nCurrently, both the US dollar and ZiG are in circulation, with the greenback still dominating daily transactions.\n\nGovernment has set 2030 as the deadline for a full return to a mono-currency system under ZiG. We will not return to full dollarisation, Ncube said firmly, adding that dual circulation is only a transitional measure.\n\n",

Those with unsettled immigration status or criminal records face uncertain prospects, particularly in countries like the U.S. where enforcement has tightened. At the same time, the fate of these individuals underscores the delicate balance Zimbabwe must strike between engaging its diaspora and supporting those forced to return.\n\nThe diaspora has become an essential economic lifeline for the country. In the first nine months of 2024, Zimbabwe received about US$1.9 billion in remittances, a 16.5% increase from the same period in 2023, accounting for roughly a quarter of all foreign-currency receipts. More recent data shows that in February 2025 alone, remittances stood at US$165 million, up from US$153.8 million a year earlier, representing about 17% of total inflows. These funds not only sustain trade balances but also support education, healthcare, and household consumption, while helping stabilise the fragile currency system.\n\nUltimately, the story of these deportees is not just one of punishment but of the wider trajectory of a nation whose people continue to leave in search of opportunity and stability, and the painful realities that unfold when dreams abroad collapse.\n\n",
