            "content": "By A Correspondent A promotional flier for President Emmerson Mnangagwas title deeds distribution programme in Mashonaland Central has ignited a storm inside Zanu PF, after businessman Kudakwashe Tagwireis image overshadowed the Presidents  fuelling speculation that the event is doubling as a joint political rally showcasing Mnangagwas preferred ally over Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe poster, which circulated widely ahead of todays Mazowe West event, announced that Mnangagwa would preside over the issuance of 1,000 title deeds and the launch of smallholder irrigation kits. But what dominated attention was not the policy programme  it was the branding: Tagwireis portrait appeared larger, placed in a commanding position, and accompanied by a bold pledge that he would give out two Ford Ranger trucks.\n\nFor many within Zanu PF, this was no accidental publicity slip. Instead, it was read as a symbolic gesture that Tagwireis political stock is rising, with Mnangagwa seemingly positioning him as a central player in the partys future while sidelining Chiwenga.\n\nThe ruling partys Zanu PF Patriots account condemned the flier as highly inappropriate and misleading.\n\nThis is a Presidential event, and it is unacceptable to place Cde Tagwireis image on the flier  worse still, positioning it above and larger than the Presidents. Such misrepresentation undermines the dignity of the occasion. We are confident that Cde Tagwirei does not endorse this distortion, the account posted on X.\n\nThe uproar comes against the backdrop of escalating succession battles. Chiwenga, the general who masterminded the 2017 coup that ushered Mnangagwa into power, has long been considered the natural successor. But Mnangagwa has steadily worked to curtail his deputys influence, instead elevating businessmen, technocrats, and family allies.\n\nTagwirei  a billionaire fuel tycoon and key financier of Zanu PF  has increasingly blurred the lines between business and politics. His visible role in state programmes and his rising public profile have unsettled Chiwengas military-aligned faction, which sees him as a growing threat to their political leverage.\n\nIn Zanu PF politics, symbolism is never neutral, one political analyst remarked. Allowing a businessman to dominate the Presidents poster sends a clear message  it hints at grooming Tagwirei as a trusted ally and sidelines Chiwengas camp.\n\nYet beyond the intrigue, todays event remains historic. Mnangagwa is set to hand over 1,000 title deeds  the largest batch since the programmes launch in December 2024  and roll out smallholder irrigation kits to boost food security and climate resilience. Crucially, 70 percent of the beneficiaries are war veterans, a constituency central to Zanu PFs internal power struggles.\n\nBut instead of cementing Mnangagwas empowerment credentials, the Mazowe programme has been overshadowed by succession politics. With Tagwireis face looming larger than both the Presidents and the absent Vice Presidents, the event has come to be seen less as a government programme  and more as a joint MnangagwaTagwirei rally, signalling where real influence in the ruling party may be shifting.\n\n",

God, wrote Lerato Sabangu, a comment that captured the collective shock.\n\nPublic Shock & Unanswered Questions\n\nThe tragedy has deeply disturbed many, not only due to Ndoros celebrity status but also the haunting manner of his death  found lifeless in his South African apartment after three days, only discovered when his phone went off and neighbours raised alarm.\n\n Chipo Mafukidze, a Facebook user, sparked widespread reflection with her chilling comment:\n\nNhai imi, ndinakatanga kuziva kuti afa.

Akawanikwa akafa mumba make.\n\nThere was growing concern around Ndoros health  with some commenters revealing he may have battled diabetes.\n\n DG Masiziva warned:\n\nNdakanzwa kuti this guy was diabetic. My advice: anyone diabetic, dont live alone. Sugar ikadonha, thats the end.\n\nOthers lamented the dangers of solitary living:Kupu Lacy Adam: Kugara wega akusibhoo guys.

His funeral procession made its way through familiar streets before settling at West Park Cemetery, where tears flowed freely.\n\nAt his Bulawayo Amphitheatre memorial, Ndoros brother-in-law Chrispen Ncube broke down as he recounted finding his body.\n\nI called him malume When I found him dead, I was disturbed and shocked Im grateful I managed to bring his body back to his parents.\n\nHis sister Lorraine added tearfully: Im in pain. I have no words.\n\nFrom government to club officials, heartfelt tributes poured in:We have lost a beacon, said Isaiah Mpofu, speaking for the Ministry of Sport.He was our first import and export, recalled Tavengwa Hara of Chicken Inn.Youngsters should take football seriously, said Madinda Ndlovu, representing the Ndlovu family.\n\nBut the most stinging words came from former Warriors manager Wellington Mpandare:\n\nZimbabweans, why are you so evil? Someone cheated Tendai out of his investments He did not waste money. May God bless that person, he declared, drawing applause.\n\n A Life Remembered, A Legacy Honoured\n\nNdoros twin brother Takudzwa, inconsolable at the gravesite, led mourners in a song they used to sing together: Ndimi makawuraya (You are the ones who killed), echoing both grief and a veiled cry for justice.\n\nNdoros passing at 36 leaves behind three children  Laizah (12), Christiano (7), and Mukundi (3)  and a country searching for answers.\n\nFrom the dusty pitches of Nketa to the grand stadiums of South Africa, Fire lived, loved, and inspired.\n\n Rest in Power, Tendai Ndoro  Our Fire Never Dies.\n\n Key Public Reactions:\n\n Kugara wega kwakaoma  Living alone is dangerous Diabetes inonzi silent killer  Fans urged others with chronic illnesses to never stay alone Phone yadzima, ndipo zvikanzi ngaatariswe  His silence led to his discovery He was robbed, not reckless  Claims of fraud against him Ndimi makawuraya  Crowd song blaming society\n\n Call to Action:Zimbabwes health and sports institutions are being urged to:Provide wellness checks for retired athletesOffer mental health and chronic illness supportInvestigate cases of property theft and exploitation of vulnerable public figures\n\n",

In that incident, an airtime vendor in Garikai was robbed of ZAR 15,000 and two cellphones.\n\nMoyo was arrested while offloading airtime vouchers at cut-price rates, which raised suspicion, said Nyathi.

            "content": "By Dr Masimba Mavaza | Zimbabwe has been reeling under extreme, evil sanctions imposed by the West at the request of the opposition. It took great leadership from ZANU PF to navigate through the storms brought on by these illegal sanctions. Zimbabwes survival under such conditions can be attributed to several factorschief among them, the wisdom and strategic foresight of ZANU PF.\n\nThrough the innovative strategies of the ruling party, the country managed to survive the cruel and punishing sanctions. The government encouraged thinking outside the box to overcome economic challenges. The late Foreign Affairs Minister, Frederick Shava, consistently emphasized the need for innovative approaches to survive in spite of the sanctions.\n\nImport SubstitutionZimbabwe promoted import substitution systems, similar to those adopted during the Rhodesian era, to reduce dependence on external goods. This approach has helped the country secure food self-sufficiency and relative economic stability.\n\nAgricultural DevelopmentFaced with the devastating impact of sanctions, the government prioritized agricultural development, resulting in record production levels of crops like wheat and tobacco. This significantly contributed to national food security.\n\nInternational EngagementZANU PFs leadership concentrated on strengthening global engagement. Zimbabwe pushed for the removal of sanctions and bolstered multilateral relations. President Mnangagwa, for example, highlighted the successes of the land reform program at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nEconomic ResilienceDespite sanctions, Zimbabwe has shown remarkable economic resilience. Key sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing have continued contributing to the countrys growth, illustrating the nations ability to withstand adversity.\n\nChallenges AheadTargeted sanctions remain the greatest challenge Zimbabwe faces. These measuresimposed by Western countries, including the US and UKare framed around alleged human rights and property rights issues. But in reality, they aim to force Zimbabwe to reverse its land reform program and bow to foreign pressure.\n\nSteady Economic GrowthDespite these demonic sanctions, Zimbabwe has recorded steady economic growth. However, to sustain this growth, the country must continue addressing underlying issues such as corruption and governance inefficiencies.\n\nGlobal CooperationZimbabwes continued engagement with the global community will be crucial for economic recovery and development. The country must remain innovative and resilient in the face of illegal sanctions imposed by Western powers.\n\nEven under such pressure, we must survive as a nation. We must continue to think creatively and ask ourselves: if these sanctions last for years to come, how do we ensure Zimbabwe thrives?\n\nSanctions or no sanctions, Zimbabwe will survive. As long as ZANU PF remains in power, we will overcome.\n\nZimbabwes ability to adapt and withstand the economic and political pressures of sanctions speaks to its: Endurance  The capacity to persevere through hardship using innovative and resourceful methods. Self-sufficiency  Reducing dependency on external forces by harnessing domestic capabilities. Triumph  Achieving success against sanctions through diplomacy, resilience, and intelligent leadership. Liberation  Breaking free from externally imposed constraints to reclaim political and economic independence. Empowerment  Gaining strength, confidence, and self-determination through overcoming adversity.\n\nIn Zimbabwes context, surviving sanctions is a powerful testament to our resilience and determination.
