            "content": "By Showbiz Reporter Popular musician Baba Harare, born Braveman Chizvino, has officially returned to the energetic Jiti sound that first made him a household name, sending fans into a frenzy across the country.\n\nAfter briefly rebranding asKing Davidand venturing into gospel, where he produced songs such asSukaiin collaboration with Takesure Zamar, Baba Harare has decided to hang up the collar and pick up the guitar once again for the dancefloor.\n\nAnnouncing his big comeback on social media,The Reason Whyhitmaker revealed he is working on a sizzling collaboration with Gemma Griffiths, a project that has already set the entertainment scene abuzz. To cement his return, he is currently in the studio working on a brand-new Jiti album and is also set to headline the highly anticipatedDoek and Slayconcert on December 14 in Harare. Fans are confident the stage will be on fire as the man behind crowd favourites likeGuzuzuandRamba Wakadzvanyareclaims his throne.\n\nBaba Harares career has been one of evolution, reinvention, and resilience. He first rose to prominence as the lead guitarist for Jah Prayzahs Third Generation Band, where his lively stage presence and signature guitar riffs made him a standout performer. His unique energy helped shape Jah Prayzahs sound during a golden period in which the band produced several chart-topping hits.\n\nIn 2017, he broke away from Jah Prayzah to pursue a solo career, a move that initially drew skepticism from fans who doubted he could sustain himself outside the shadow of the internationally acclaimed superstar. However, Baba Harare quickly silenced critics with his breakout hitThe Reason Why (Hat Dzemurara), which became a wedding anthem and cemented his place in the Zimbabwean music landscape.\n\nRiding on that momentum, he fully embraced the Jiti genre  a fast-paced, dance-oriented sound rooted in Zimbabwean traditional rhythms but blended with contemporary flair. Songs likeGuzuzu,Ramba Wakadzvanya,Prove Them Wrong, andRestmade him a darling of the dancefloor and earned him loyal followings across age groups. His ability to capture everyday Zimbabwean experiences in light-hearted but infectious melodies made him one of the few artistes able to compete with the dominance of Zimdancehall.\n\nDespite this success, Baba Harare shocked many by rebranding asKing Davidand venturing into gospel music. While his gospel tracks attracted a new audience and showcased his versatility, many of his loyal fans viewed the move as a temporary detour from the raw energy of Jiti that had made him a superstar.\n\nNow, with his official return to Jiti, Baba Harare has reignited excitement within Zimbabwes music industry. His promise of fresh collaborations and a new album has rekindled hope among fans who have missed his party-starting sound.\n\nFor many, his gospel chapter has only added depth to his artistry, and the blend of spiritual maturity with his high-tempo rhythms may well define the next phase of his career. As one fan wrote on social media, The king is back  and Jiti will never be the same again.\n\nWith theDoek and Slayconcert and a new album on the horizon, all eyes are now on how Baba Harare will balance his gospel lessons with his Jiti identity. What remains certain is that Zimbabwes dancefloors are about to come alive once more under the man who gave Jiti a modern, mainstream voice.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent Zanu PFs cell verification programme in Hwange District has stirred deep fears among villagers, who view it not as a routine party exercise but as a chilling reminder of the ruling partys long history of coercion, intimidation, and abuse of rural communities.\n\nAt an inter-district meeting held at Hwange Colliery Club, Politburo members Advocate Jacob Mudenda and Deputy Secretary for Youth Affairs Tino Machakaire publicly framed the campaign as a crucial step in strengthening grassroots structures and mobilising the youth.\n\nThe young people have always been very important to the party and government. We thank them for their support and that is why we always put up empowerment programmes that also benefit them immensely, Mudenda declared.\n\nMachakaire echoed: This is an important exercise which should be done in the district of Hwange. While they are lagging behind, we encourage them to move and regularise their cell membership. It is an exercise which must include all key stakeholders.\n\nBut beneath this polished rhetoric lies a darker reality. Villagers say the so-called verification drive has already unleashed an atmosphere of terror, with traditional leaders and youth militias reportedly pressuring residents to fall in line. Many fear that non-compliance will invite reprisalsranging from denial of food aid to violent assaultsechoing past experiences whenever Zanu PF rolls out grassroots campaigns.\n\nSince independence in 1980, Zanu PF has weaponised rural structures to entrench its grip on power. Chiefs, headmen and village heads have long been co-opted through government incentives, from vehicles and allowances to preferential access to land. In exchange, these leaders often act as enforcersordering villagers to attend Zanu PF rallies, blocking opposition meetings, and punishing dissent.\n\nThe pattern reached brutal levels during watershed elections in 2000, 2002, 2008 and 2013, when Zanu PF-aligned militias, including the feared Green Bombers from the National Youth Service, were unleashed to terrorise rural communities. Thousands were beaten, tortured, displaced, or forced to pledge loyalty to the ruling party. In many cases, life-saving food aid was distributed strictly along party lines, with opposition supporters deliberately excluded.\n\nHwange, a district known for its pockets of resistance to Zanu PF dominance, has now become the latest target of this machinery of control. To villagers, Mudendas directive signals not empowerment but renewed intimidation, where fear, poverty and traditional authority are wielded to suffocate democratic choice.\n\nThe cell verification programme, presented as mere administration, is thus being experienced on the ground as yet another weapon of political terrorunleashed under the command of Jacob Mudenda.\n\n",

On one side stood Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi SC, marshalling case law and constitutional rights with fiery energy. On the other was Advocate Ben Stoop SC, whose steady hand and mastery of precedent ultimately doused the blaze.\n\nAt stake was the Lungu familys bid to appeal an earlier judgment that authorised the Zambian government to repatriate the late Presidents body for a state burial at Embassy Park in Lusaka.\n\nNgcukaitobi Sets the Court Ablaze\n\nNgcukaitobi began by insisting that South African law forbids contracting over a corpse. To support the point, he cited a scholarly journal and historical case law, stressing that any agreement between the family and government had no legal standing.\n\nHe pressed further: the High Court erred by applying Zambian law in the first place. Zambian law has no extraterritorial reach, he argued. If South African law applied, then the widows right to decide burial arrangements would prevail, backed by constitutional guarantees of dignity and autonomy. Cases from the 1970s were brought forward to illustrate this principle.\n\nStoops Cool Response\n\nUnmoved, Stoop countered that the contract was not over the corpse itself but over burial rights, which legitimately led to the agreement on repatriation. The original court, he argued, recognised this distinction.\n\nOn the choice of law, he invoked the doctrine of the closest connection: when a South African court faces a conflict of laws, it must apply the system most closely tied to the dispute. Given that Edgar Lungu was Zambias former President, Zambias law clearly had the tighter link. He even anchored the point with a precedent case.\n\nAnd Stoop didnt stop there. Even if South African law had applied, he said, recent precedent would still tilt the scale in favour of public interest. He cited Sengadi v Tsambo (2018) and the Supreme Court of Appeals ruling in Tsambo v Sengadi (2020), which held that for figures of significant national importance, family rights must yield to the broader public interest. That, Stoop said, was the twin brother to Zambias Kaweche Kaunda precedent.\n\nThe older cases Ngcukaitobi cited from the 1970s, he added, simply could not stand against modern rulings of higher authority.\n\nThe Clash Over Lungus Status\n\nNgcukaitobi sought to draw a distinction: unlike Kaunda, who enjoyed state benefits as a former President, Lungu had been stripped of his. He died a common man, Ngcukaitobi said, meaning the state had no special claim to him.\n\nBut Stoop dismissed this as otiose and ridiculous. Loss of benefits, he argued, did not erase the fact that he once served as President of Zambia for seven years. National importance did not vanish with the stroke of a benefits order.\n\nThe Turning Point\n\nThe exchange reached its climax when Ngcukaitobi insisted again that the widow alone had the burial right because Lungu had been stripped of his entitlements.\n\nThe judge intervened:\n\nThe contradiction was fatal. By conceding that benefits still flowed to the widow, Ngcukaitobi had effectively undermined his own claim that the states hand was erased. Observers whispered: the fire had gone out.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe day ended with judgment reserved. But in the court of impressions, Ngcukaitobis sparks of principle seemed outshone by Stoops calm reliance on precedent and public interest. The governments position  that a former head of state belongs to history as much as to family  appears to have carried the stronger weight.\n\nThe final decision now lies with the Pretoria High Court.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent Operation Dudula leader Zandile Dabula has escalated tensions with Zimbabwes ruling Zanu-PF, openly lashing out at President Emmerson Mnangagwas party after it condemned the movements stance on foreign nationals accessing healthcare in South Africa.\n\nIn an interview withIOL News, Dabula warned that South Africa would not take instructions from outsiders, accusing Zanu-PF of hypocrisy and failure to address Zimbabwes deepening crisis that continues to push citizens across the border.\n\nWe will not be dictated to by foreigners on how to run our country. We have the Constitution that is supposed to be guiding us, we have immigration laws that we use as guiding documents, Dabula declared.\n\nHer comments came after Zanu-PFs director of information, Farai Marapira, criticised Operation Dudulas campaign against undocumented migrants as a betrayal of Ubuntu and a continuation of colonial-era tactics of dividing Africans. Marapira argued that Africans could not be called foreigners on their own continent, stressing that borders were imposed during colonialism.\n\nBut Dabula fired back, calling the remarks baseless and aimed at deflecting attention from Mnangagwas failures at home.\n\nFor Farai (Marapira) to talk about these unfounded allegations, that we are funded by former colonisers, that is definitely not true. How are we going to be funded by the very same people who we are working against? she asked.\n\nThey should focus on fixing their country, Zimbabwe. It is the very same former colonisers they chased away in their country, hence they are in problems. They are sitting with land, and they are doing nothing about it. That is why the very same Zimbabweans are fleeing to South Africa, to take up our spaces, not just in South Africa but all over the world seeking a better life.\n\nDabula insisted that Zimbabweans were flooding into South Africa in far greater numbers than official estimates suggest, burdening jobs, schools, and public services.\n\nHe (Marapira) spoke about us having one million Zimbabweans in this country. Thats a lie. There are way more than that. There are millions of Zimbabweans in this country. We are on the ground. We see them, we know where they work, their own businesses, they are in our schools, she said.\n\nOn healthcare, Dabula clarified that Operation Dudula was not calling for a blanket denial of treatment to migrants, but for foreign nationals to pay for medical services instead of overloading the already stretched public system.\n\nHer hard-hitting remarks have been interpreted as a direct challenge to Mnangagwas government, laying bare growing tensions between Operation Dudula and Zanu-PF. The clash underlines how Zimbabwes economic meltdown continues to reverberate across the region, fuelling resentment and sparking diplomatic friction between Pretoria and Harare.\n\n",

He was 72.\n\nZimbabwe has expressed sorrow over the loss of a distinguished diplomat and public servant. Social media is ablaze with the news of his passing, as the nation lights up timelines in honour of a life of service and grace.\n\nThe global diplomatic community stands in solemn reflection, paying tribute to an extraordinary diplomat whose legacy continues to inspire. Ambassador Stuart Comberbach is being remembered in powerful memorial contributions from people all over the world.\n\nHis 51-year career in the Zimbabwean Foreign Service culminated in him achieving the rank of Career Ambassadorthe highest honour in diplomacy. He is celebrated not only for his professional achievements but also for his unwavering mentorship and compassion. Fellow diplomats have sent heartfelt condolence letters, while civil servants described him as a trailblazer who embodied servant leadership and touched thousands of lives across generations. He loved Zimbabwe with all his heart and was indeed the true definition of a patriot.\n\nOne poignant moment came from his early life: when told as a young man that his career would not progress in a black government, he vowed to blur colour divisions while serving the worldand did so, becoming one of the most respected diplomats of his time.\n\nDeputy President, Retired General Constantino Chiwenga, paid tribute to Ambassador Comberbach, describing him as a beacon of light and a pillar of strength whose kindness and empathy left a lasting impression on all who knew him. Comberbach served in key diplomatic roles, including as Advisor to His Excellency, Dr. Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa.\n\nDuring his five decades of professional service to the Government, Ambassador Comberbach demonstrated a rare and unwavering commitment to duty, said Acting President Chiwenga. His patriotism was never in question, and he believed that our differences in race, colour and creed only served to enrich our shared humanity as one family in a unified Zimbabwe.\n\nHis legacy will be honoured at the UN General Assembly as a symbol of integrity and peacekeeping. His personal journal, Markings, will become a spiritual classic, revealing the depth of his moral convictions. He was, indeed, one of the greatest statesmen of our century.\n\nVice President Chiwenga added: On behalf of His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Cde Dr. Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, and the First Family, the Government and ZANU PF party, the entire nation, and on my own behalf, I wish to express my sincere condolences to Mrs. Comberbach and the entire family following the loss of their loved one. May they take comfort from the knowledge that their loss is shared by the whole nation, in whose service he contributed immensely.\n\nFriends held a moving ceremony highlighting his trailblazing role as the long-serving white diplomat in a new Zimbabwe. His treasured pin collectionsymbols of his wit and strategic brilliancebecame a reminder of his unique contribution.\n\nVP Chiwengas words captured the essence of Comberbachs legacy: what should linger in our hearts are bright memories, laughter shared, and lessons taught and learnedall these being precious gifts that will never grow old.\n\nThese tributes remind us that diplomacy is not just about policyit is about people, connection, and the quiet power of integrity.\n\nThe lamps are going out all over the world; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime. His legacy will forever stand as one of the most eloquent and moving reflections on the cost and value of human rights and diplomacy.\n\nAmbassador Comberbach served as Zimbabwes envoy to Italy, Japan, and South Korea, and most recently as Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva. He was a respected voice in international diplomacy, tirelessly advocating for Zimbabwes values and aspirations.\n\nThroughout his career, he held various key positions: Special Advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (20182021) Secretary of the Corporate Governance Unit, Office of the President and Cabinet (20142018) Ambassador to Japan and South Korea (20032014) Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Industry and International Trade (20002003) Director, Special Information Unit, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (19992000) Ambassador to Italy and Permanent Representative to the UN FAO (19941999) Head of the Zimbabwe Trade Mission and Representative Office, Johannesburg (19871994) Head of the Information and Research Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (19821987) Officer in the Multilateral Affairs Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (19801982).\n\nRest in power, my friend and my Ambassador. We will meet again when Christ comesin a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent As schools open tomorrow, the government has directed all public schools to display approved tuition fees and School Development Association (SDA) levies, along with their local currency bank account numbers, at their administration blocks. The move is designed to clamp down on illegal and unjustified fee hikes that have become a perennial burden for parents and guardians.\n\nSchool heads who fail to comply with the directive will face disciplinary action, while district-level monitoring units have already been deployed to track compliance and handle complaints.\n\nAccording to regulations, schools are only permitted to charge tuition and levies that are agreed to by parents at formal meetings and subsequently approved by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education.\n\nPrimary and Secondary Education Minister Torerayi Moyo reiterated that government will no longer tolerate institutions milking desperate families through hidden charges.\n\nThe ministry has strict measures to prevent overcharging by schools, Moyo said. For a start, all fees must be approved by the Secretary, having been agreed upon by parents. Schools must comply with approved structures. Enforcement measures include district-level monitoring units to address complaints, while penalties include charging the school head for misconduct. Schools must display approved fee breakdowns publicly for parents and guardians, and also display the ZiG account number at the administration block.\n\nFor years, parents across Zimbabwe have complained about being forced to fund dubious projects or pay unexplained charges that are neither sanctioned by the government nor supported by parents resolutions. Some schools have been accused of introducing hidden fees under the guise of development levies or special projects, often demanding payments for items such as classroom furniture, security walls, or computer labs without transparent accounting.\n\nIn many cases, parents have had to fork out money for entrance tests, registration packs, or compulsory uniforms supplied by school-linked vendors at inflated prices. Paid-for extra lessons have also been a major flashpoint, with some teachers deliberately under-teaching during normal class hours to compel learners to pay for private sessions.\n\nEducation watchdogs and civil society groups have long argued that these practices not only exploit struggling families in a collapsing economy but also widen inequality in access to quality education. Families from poor backgrounds are often forced to choose between paying the inflated school charges or withdrawing their children from school altogether.\n\nMinister Moyo emphasized that both paid-for extra lessons and entrance examinations for Form One enrolment remain banned.\n\nForm One entrance examinations are outlawed. Offending schools risk deregistration, and private paid-for extra lessons by teachers are prohibited. Parents are encouraged to report any illegal extra-lesson charges, and our command centres established at all levels will address complaints, he said.\n\nExtra lessons and entrance exams were outlawed because they placed an unfair financial burden on families, turning education into a privilege rather than a right.\n\nMoyo added that government remains committed to ensuring financial barriers do not block childrens access to education and called on schools to focus instead on preparing learners for end-of-year public examinations.\n\nThe minister also updated the nation on the rollout of the Heritage-Based Curriculum (HBC), introduced this year to promote Zimbabwean culture, innovation, and practical skills. He said teachers had undergone extensive training and new syllabi and digital resources would be distributed to all schools by the end of 2025.\n\nBy now, every teacher is in sync with the HBC, Moyo said. We have prioritised teacher capacity through intensive workshops, mentorship programmes and subject-specific panels. Ministry officials have also been visiting schools to provide support and ensure compliance.\n\nWhile governments tough stance is likely to be welcomed by parents weary of unexplained fees, critics argue that enforcement has been weak in the past, with offending schools often escaping with light penalties. This latest push will therefore be a key test of whether the authorities can finally rein in a culture of profiteering that has long haunted the education sector.\n\n",

The shocking confrontation unfolded in full view of teammates, coaches, and ZIFA officials, forcing administrators to step in before the situation escalated.\n\nThe journalist, visibly shaken, demanded to know why Kadewere was behaving aggressively, but the striker instead hurled insults, mocked her appearance, and accused her of damaging his reputation through negative coverage of his performances.\n\nZIFA compelled Kadewere to apologise immediately, but those present described his apology as insincere. Media watchdogs and journalist associations have since demanded a written statement from the football body, warning that such conduct tarnishes both the player and the national teams image.\n\nWith the Warriors set to face Rwanda in a crucial World Cup qualifier, the incident has cast a dark cloud over the camp, raising questions about discipline and professionalism within the squad.\n\n",
