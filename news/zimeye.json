It is about leadership in action and empowering communities to participate fully in the countrys development programmes.\n\nHighlighting the focus on land reform, the official added: Part of the visit included deepening awareness about national commitments, such as the issuance of title deeds to A1 and A2 farmers, which is critical for advancing Masvingos agricultural productivity and prosperity.\n\nThe inter-district meeting held by Zanu PF Masvingo Province on Sunday aimed to cascade decisions and feedback from the National Peoples Conference to grassroots structures. The party official said: This is an opportunity to strengthen communication between provincial and local structures, ensuring that communities are empowered and that the national vision is implemented effectively.\n\nCritics, however, argue that such donations  particularly the cattle to traditional leaders  raise concerns about the use of resources to influence local leadership in favour of political agendas rather than purely community development.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.zimeye.net/2025/12/01/who-is-faz-boss-now-zna-commander-general-asher-walter-tapfumaneyi/",
            "content": "By A Correspondent-General Asher Walter Tapfumaneyis rise to the top of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA), following last weeks formal handover of command by General Emmanuel Matatu at Charles Gumbo Barracks, represents the culmination of one of the most politically consequential security careers in post-independence Zimbabwe. His trajectoryfrom shadowy intelligence operative to FAZ boss and now army commandermirrors President Emmerson Mnangagwas long-term project of restructuring the states coercive institutions to eliminate rivals, both within ZANU PF and the broader political landscape.\n\nTapfumaneyi first emerged prominently in Zimbabwes security architecture between 2005 and 2009, when he served as a director in the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO). During this period, the CIO was deeply embedded in the high-stakes political repression that characterised Zimbabwes violent 2008 election cycle.\n\nHis name surfaced publicly after the abduction and torture of human rights advocate Jestina Mukoko in 2008. Justice Nyaradzo Priscilla Munangati-Manongwa later ruled that Mukoko could sue CIO boss Didymus Mutasa and police senior official Peter Magwenzi in their personal capacitiesan indictment that also implicated Tapfumaneyi, who was identified among operatives involved in the abduction sting. This episode set the tone for his reputation as a ruthless intelligence operative whose work often intersected with political intimidation.\n\nDuring the following decade, Tapfumaneyi moved through key state positions tied directly to ZANU PFs power preservation matrix. He served as a Principal Director in the Ministry of Presidential Affairs, later becoming Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of War Veterans. These roles placed him at the centre of the partystate apparatus that Mnangagwa, then Vice President with ambitions for higher office, was already cultivating.\n\nTapfumaneyis administrative reach expanded across the security bureaucracy, sharpening his reputation as a dependable operator willing to execute political tasks without hesitationcrucial for Mnangagwa, whose rivalry with thenDefence Forces commander Constantino Chiwenga had begun to define succession dynamics inside ZANU PF.\n\nThe 2017 military-assisted transition that pushed Robert Mugabe from power reshaped Zimbabwes political order. Mnangagwa emerged as President, but the coup had been spearheaded by Chiwenga and his allies in the military. This created an unstable dual-power arrangement: the Chiwenga-aligned military bloc versus Mnangagwas civilianintelligence faction.\n\nTo rebalance power, Mnangagwa quietly strengthened intelligence networks within the state, elevating officers loyal to him. This is where Tapfumaneyi became indispensable. In 2020, Mnangagwa appointed him Deputy Director-General of the CIOone of the most powerful posts in the security state. This appointment consolidated the civilian-intelligence wing that Mnangagwa relied on to counter Chiwengas dominance in the army.\n\nAround this period, Tapfumaneyi was also named in investigative reports linking him to a proposed US$300,000500,000 British American Tobacco bribe during turf wars against rival cigarette manufacturers. While politically damaging, this scandal did not weaken his standing. Instead, it underscored his usefulness in politically sensitive environments where party, state, and private interests converged.\n\nTapfumaneyis most consequential role came with the formation and rise of Forever Associates Zimbabwe (FAZ), an intelligence-aligned mobilisation structure that replaced the conventional Joint Operations Command (JOC) machinery once used by ZANU PF to control elections.\n\nAs the architect and de facto commander of FAZ, Tapfumaneyi oversaw the establishment of parallel structures that monitored communities, gathered voter intelligence, coordinated mobilisation, and allegedly intimidated opposition activists. FAZ effectively became the backbone of ZANU PFs 2023 electoral operations.\n\nDuring the 2023 general elections, FAZ operatives were stationed across polling stations nationwide, running what many observers described as a shadow election administration that undercut the independence of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission. Tapfumaneyis hand in ZANU PFs victory was openly acknowledged by senior ruling party officials, including Minister Ezra Chadzamira.\n\nOne of his wives, Jessica Tapfumaneyi, also emerged as a mobilisation figure in Mashonaland West, reinforcing the integration of intelligence operations, party structures, and family networksan arrangement typical of Mnangagwas patronage architecture.\n\nIn 2024, Mnangagwa initiated a new phase in restructuring the military. The Chiwenga-aligned generation of commanders was approaching retirement, creating an opening to install loyalists who were not products of the old liberation-war military elite.\n\nMid-year, Tapfumaneyi was quietly reintegrated into the Zimbabwe National Army and promoted to Major General. Security insiders described the move as a deliberate step towards positioning him for top command. General Philip Valerio Sibanda welcomed him back, but his remarkscarefully neutralreflected unease among traditional military circles.\n\nAt a public event in Masvingo, in October, Tapfumaneyi openly declared that army recruitment was politically vetted, with opposition supporters excluded. Such statements confirmed his role in deepening the politicisation of the militarya central pillar of Mnangagwas strategy.\n\nBy late 2025, Sibandas contract neared expiration. Speculation around his successor intensified. Traditional command protocol suggested ZNA commander Emmanuel Matatu would rise to ZDF commander, but at 72, he was too old for long-term succession planning. Mnangagwa needed a loyalist with intelligence credentials, political obedience, and no ties to Chiwengas military faction.\n\nTapfumaneyi met every criterion.\n\nHis reintegration into the army, his leadership of FAZ, his CIO background, and his role in the 2023 elections formed a trail of loyalty and operational efficiency that Mnangagwa could rely on to secure ZANU PFs internal contest ahead of the 2027 congressand to block Chiwenga or any military-aligned rival from mounting a challenge.\n\nLast Thursdays formal handover of command at Charles Gumbo Barracks was the climax of this long political project. Before hundreds of officers, General Matatu entrusted Tapfumaneyi with the ZNA colours. Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri hailed his liberation-war roots, intelligence experience, and administrative skillwhile emphasising unity and loyalty, coded language underscoring Mnangagwas demand for political obedience.\n\nTapfumaneyi pledged allegiance to Mnangagwa, promising continuity in defending sovereignty and territorial integrityphrases that, in Zimbabwean political language, have long served as justification for suppressing internal dissent.\n\nGeneral Tapfumaneyis rise is not merely a military appointment. It is the clearest signal yet of Mnangagwas long-term strategy:\n\nFrom his early days in the CIO to last weeks installation as ZNA Commander, Tapfumaneyi has been central to the construction of a security state designed not only to preserve ZANU PF rule, but to protect Mnangagwa personally from internal and external challengers.\n\nHis appointment marks the consolidation of that strategyand signals a new era where intelligence networks, military command, and ruling party structures operate as a single, fused political weapon.\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri Citizens leader Advocate Nelson Chamisa on Sunday appeared in Mbare, firmly dispelling claims circulating in Zanu PF circles that he had relocated to the United States of America.\n\nFor weeks, ruling party officials and affiliated commentators had pushed the narrative that Chamisa had abandoned Zimbabwean politics and moved abroad  allegations that sparked debate across social media. But the opposition leaders public appearance in Mbare, and his own statement, directly contradicted those claims.\n\nChamisa was in the high-density suburb to offer condolences to the Dadzwa family following the passing of a community elder. In a brief statement, he said: Im in Mbare to pay condolences to the Dadzwa family for the loss of our beloved mother. I remain deeply touched by the love of the citizens of Zimbabwe. RIP Mama Dadzwa #Godisinit.\n\nPolitical analysts say Chamisas appearance serves as both a personal gesture of solidarity and a strategic rebuttal to narratives aimed at undermining his presence on the ground. They note that such rumours often emerge in moments of political tension, attempting to shape public perception about a leaders commitment or whereabouts.\n\nResidents in the area reportedly received him warmly, with some expressing relief that he had responded to the circulating rumours in person rather than through political surrogates.\n\nWhile Zanu PF had previously insisted that the opposition leader was now based in the US, Chamisas visit suggests he remains active within local communities  maintaining visibility despite ongoing political pressures.\n\nHis statement, simple yet pointed, reinforces his message of proximity to citizens: that he is physically present, engaged, and still connected to grassroots structures.\n\nChamisas appearance in Mbare now puts to rest  at least for the moment  claims about his alleged relocation, shifting political attention back to his next strategic moves.\n\n",

            "content": "By Showbiz Reporter-Upcoming musician, Saintfloews weekend  show suffered a major blow drawing only a handful of fans as the majority flocked to Jah Prayzahs packed HICC concert.\n\nFor months, Saintfloews team had been building momentum around the event, hoping to replicate the energy of his October 2023 album launchan unforgettable spectacle where the rapper emerged from a coffin, sparking countrywide debate and propelling his name deeper into the mainstream.\n\nBut this time, the magic simply did not materialise.\n\nBy 9:30 PM, the City Sports Centre told a different story: rows of empty chairs, a cavernous hall, and a silence that echoed louder than the music. Photos circulating online captured the disappointment, prompting an immediate wave of commentary. What was expected to be a night of celebration for a fast-rising artist instead became a talking point about the state of Zimbabwes live music scene.\n\nFans and commentators pointed to several reasons for the flop. Foremost was the unfortunate timing. Saintfloew found himself in direct competition with Jah Prayzaharguably Zimbabwes biggest contemporary musician, known for drawing thousands to his shows. With JP performing at the HICC on the same night, many fans simply chose the more established crowd-puller. Jah Prayzahs loyal, cross-generational following, built over years of polished performances, military-precision choreography and chart-topping albums, left little room for a parallel event to thrive.\n\nEconomic pressures also played a role. Zimbabweans online noted that the timingjust before schools reopenleft many households prioritising fees over entertainment. Others criticised the show for inadequate promotion, saying the advertising lacked the energy and reach needed to pull fans to a major venue.\n\nThe flop also came on the heels of another disappointing turnout, this time for Tocky Vibes, a once-dominant urban grooves star whose audience has dwindled in recent years as new sounds and younger artists reshape the landscape. This back-to-back pattern sparked debate about whether fans are becoming more selective, whether economic hardship is shrinking audiences, or whether only heavyweight acts like Jah Prayzah can still reliably fill venues.\n\nFor Saintfloew, whose rise to fame has been buoyed by a loyal youth following and support from business mogul Tinashe Mutarisi, the night was a sobering reminder of how unpredictable the music industry can be. While his artistry and previous buzz remain intact, Saturdays show will likely become a cautionary tale about timing, competition, and the realities of performing in a harsh economy.\n\nAs one social media page summed it up under a photo of the empty venue: Sad scenes at Saintfloews album launch. This comes soon after Tocky Vibes also had a poor launch. Only a few fans showed up.\n\n",
