            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, Masvingo-based clergyman Prophet Lovemore Chevure has condemned veteran musician Clive Malunga for criticizing President Emmerson Mnangagwas bid for a third term.\n\nThe controversy began after a video surfaced last week in which Malunga, who is also a war veteran, argued that Mnangagwa was not divinely appointed and therefore had no mandate to extend his rule.\n\nYes, I clearly said that Mnangagwa wont see 2030 or even 2026 because he isnt God and wasnt appointed by God to be President of Zimbabwe, Malunga stated.\n\nIn response, Chevure, leader of Prophetic Grace International Church, rebuked Malungas remarks in an interview with a local publication. Chevure invited Malunga to visit his church for instant deliverance.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has every right to rule. The power of life and death lies in your tongue, as the scriptures say. Therefore, the President has every right to say, I can be there and lead even up to 2040,' Chevure asserted.\n\nChevure continued by addressing Malunga directly: As for you, Clive Malunga, you dont have the power to say the president wont be around in 2026. Who are you? Who gave you that authority? Regardless of our political affiliations, we must accept that the current president of Zimbabwe is Emmerson Mnangagwa. Scriptures urge us to respect the authority of our leaders, and by showing disrespect to the President, Malunga has invited a curse on himself and his family.\n\nHe further invited Malunga to his church for deliverance, claiming that if Malunga could not see the progress made under the Second Republic, he was in need of spiritual intervention. The problem with some of our countrymen is that they focus only on the negative side, Chevure said.\n\nChevure also reminded listeners that no one is perfect. You must know that if you are praying for your enemies to die, remember that you, too, are someones enemy, and they might be wishing the same for you. No human has a clean record; we all have offended someone at some point.\n\n",

He said, Unity Day is not a Zanu PF initiative but is for the citizens of Zimbabwe.\n\nReflecting on the days significance at the weekend, Chamisa stated, Unity Day reminds us all of the elusive promise of a united and prosperous Zimbabwe! A promise that has been broken by bad governance, toxicity, inequality, mistrust, and injustice.\n\nHe stressed that true unity goes beyond political parties or individuals.\n\nTrue unity is not about the unity of political parties or individuals. It must be the unity of all citizens founded on shared values and mutual ideals, built on love, peace, and shared prosperity, Chamisa added.\n\nChamisa argued that unity should not be a symbolic gesture or limited to one day. Unity must neither be a one-day event nor a concept on paper. Unity must be practiced, palpable, and experienced daily in all facets of life.\n\nLooking ahead, Chamisa envisioned a new and genuine unity for Zimbabwe. In the coming Zimbabwe, there will be new and genuine unity, powered by love and mutual respect, where every Zimbabwean is proud to belong, and their dignity is protected and well treasured.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has reaffirmed his commitment to achieving Zimbabwes Vision 2030, a plan aimed at transforming the country into an upper-middle-income society. While his leadership has often been scrutinized, particularly regarding his adherence to the constitution, Mnangagwas latest statements suggest a focused pursuit of this national agenda. He has been consistent in outlining a path for economic growth, social cohesion, and unity, emphasizing that all sectors of society must collaborate to realize the vision.\n\nSpeaking on the trajectory towards Vision 2030, President Mnangagwa assured that the country is progressing steadily on the path to economic development. Vision 2030 shall surely become a reality, he stated, Never, never, never again should anything ever divide us. United we must stand, strong and solid as the walls of great Zimbabwe, from which we derive our nations name. The Presidents words underline the importance of unity, not just for political stability, but as a cornerstone for economic prosperity.\n\nAt the core of the Vision 2030 agenda is a call for collaboration across all levels of society. Mnangagwas vision requires the active participation of citizens, businesses, and the government. He expressed this sentiment clearly, saying, Hand in hand, in unity, from village to the provincial level, sector by sector and industry by industry, Vision 2030 shall surely become a reality. His message is clear: the achievement of the nations aspirations is only possible through collective effort.\n\nCentral to the governments strategy for achieving Vision 2030 is fostering national unity and social cohesion. President Mnangagwa emphasized that the country is building a cohesive society through grassroots development and decentralization. These include accelerated development at grassroots level and broader decentralisation. Home-grown unity and peace-building processes, led by our chiefs, are a testimony of the effectiveness of our heritage-based strategies in addressing contemporary realities, he explained.\n\nThe Presidents focus on heritage-based strategies and decentralization underscores a commitment to local-level engagement, particularly through traditional leadership. Chiefs, who have been instrumental in peace-building efforts, are seen as vital players in uniting communities and fostering a sense of shared purpose.\n\nAs the country marks 37 years since the signing of the Unity Accord, which ended the civil strife between Zanu PF and the PF-Zapu, President Mnangagwa used this significant milestone to remind Zimbabweans of the values that have shaped the nations progress. Unity, patriotism, peace as well as love and respect for one another are indispensable values to accelerate the development of our country, he asserted. The Unity Accord, signed in 1987, remains a pivotal moment in Zimbabwes post-independence history, and Mnangagwas reference to it calls for a renewed commitment to peace and national reconciliation.\n\nWhile President Mnangagwa has faced scrutiny regarding his constitutional adherence, particularly his statement about stepping down in 2028 as required by the constitution, his consistent rhetoric about unity, peace, and development provides a clear narrative about his vision for the country. The challenge for Mnangagwa, however, remains in balancing his public pledges with the need for genuine democratic reforms. His statement about not staying in power beyond 2028, in accordance with the constitution, invites further scrutiny into whether his actions will align with this promise.\n\nIn conclusion, President Mnangagwas insistence on Vision 2030 being on course, along with his emphasis on national unity and grassroots development, presents a roadmap for Zimbabwes future. However, his adherence to the constitution and his commitment to democratic processes will remain key indicators of his sincerity in achieving the vision he has outlined. Let us therefore, look ahead to a brighter future as we continuously discover the strength that resides in our diversity, culture, and traditions, Mnangagwa concluded, encapsulating his vision for Zimbabwes unity and progress.\n\n",

His courage to speak out is seen by many as a sign of the kind of leadership needed to address the countrys political challenges.\n\nMalunga appeared in a video clip last week attacking Mnangagwa over the 2030 mantra.\n\n",

            "content": "VP Chiwenga Caught On Camera With A Totally Non-ED Red Scarf\n\nBy A Correspondent | ZimEye | The choice of attire by Zimbabwes Vice President Constantino Chiwenga and his wife Minnie Baloyi during their recent visit to India has sparked significant speculation and debate. Notably absent was the Zimbabwean flag-colored scarf, a signature symbol often associated with the countrys current president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. Instead, Chiwenga adorned a conspicuously red scarfa stark visual departure with profound symbolic undertones.\n\nSo conspicuous is the red scarf on the twos shoulders, that none of their Indian hosts have any such on their bodies.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, red is often associated with blood, danger, and sacrifice. Its use in this context could suggest a deliberate message, especially considering Chiwengas role in the 2017 coup that ousted Robert Mugabe and installed Mnangagwa as president. Many of the military figures who aided Chiwenga in executing the coup have since died under suspicious circumstances, fueling rumors of political purges within Zimbabwes corridors of power. Against this backdrop, Chiwengas red scarf might be interpreted as a subtle cry for help or a forewarning of his own peril, particularly given the high stakes and treacherous dynamics of Zimbabwes political landscape.\n\nThe imagery becomes even more loaded when considering the setting in which Chiwenga wore this attire. In one photograph, he is seen speaking near the ritually preserved remains of an Indian legend, a sacred and deeply symbolic act in itself. Such a setting adds an aura of gravitas and mystery to his choice of dress. Was the red scarf a silent acknowledgment of danger, a plea for protection, or perhaps an expression of solidarity with the bloodshed and sacrifices that have defined his political journey?\n\nFurthermore, the red scarfs absence among the Indian hosts raises questions about its specific significance to Chiwenga and his delegation. Could it symbolize a break from Mnangagwas leadership, a subtle declaration of independence, or even a veiled protest? In a political culture where symbols carry immense weight, this sartorial choice cannot be dismissed as mere coincidence.\n\nChiwengas precarious health, often discussed in Zimbabwean media, also lends credence to interpretations of the red scarf as a harbinger of his own mortality. The deaths of his allies and his rumored frailty create an atmosphere of looming tragedy, with the red scarf serving as a chilling visual metaphor. Chiwengas red scarf during this high-profile visit seems to carry layers of meaning that extend far beyond fashion. It is a bold and potentially calculated statementone that could be interpreted as a warning, a lament, or a declaration of defiance in the face of both political and personal adversities.\n\nThe political rivalry between Zimbabwes President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputy, Chiwenga, has evolved into a dangerous power struggle, one that increasingly threatens national stability. At the heart of this escalating tension lies a tangled web of personal ambition, political paranoia, and a shadowy security apparatus allegedly cultivated by Mnangagwas wife, Auxillia. Her emergence as a central figure with unprecedented power has added another volatile element to the already fraught relationship between the two men.\n\nAuxillia Mnangagwas Shadow Power\n\nAuxillia Mnangagwas role in this conflict cannot be overstated. Since 2021, she has played an active role in assembling a clandestine network of loyalists, including armed robbers, soldiers, and state security operatives. This network serves as a counterforce to Chiwengas military base, signaling a strategic move by Mnangagwa to consolidate power and neutralize potential threats from his deputy. The First Ladys apparent ability to deploy military resources for personal and political gain underscores her unique influence within Zimbabwes power structure.\n\nA particularly alarming instance of this came in her use of over 80 soldiers and riot police to impose her convicted armed robber brother, Paradzai Kutyauripo, as Chief Negomo in 2021. Despite her public denials, video footage and eyewitness accounts paint a starkly different pictureone where Auxillia personally oversaw the operation, complete with an intimidating military motorcade. The forced takeover of Chief Negomos kingdom not only violated Zimbabwean law but also demonstrated Auxillias willingness to bypass legal and traditional norms to achieve her objectives.\n\nKutyauripos criminal history, which includes a very long stint in Chikurubi Maximum Prison for armed robbery, raises serious questions about national security. As Director of State House Residences, a position granted by Mnangagwa, Kutyauripo now holds significant sway over Zimbabwes most sensitive government properties. This dual role amplifies fears that state institutions are being repurposed to serve private and criminal interests, further eroding public trust.\n\nThe Red Scarf and Chiwengas Warning\n\nAmidst this backdrop, Chiwengas recent appearance in India wearing a conspicuously red scarfabsent of Mnangagwas trademark Zimbabwean flag-colored accessorytakes on heightened significance. In Zimbabwean symbolism, red is a color of blood, sacrifice, and danger. Given the spate of suspicious deaths among Chiwengas military allies who orchestrated the 2017 coup, the red scarf could be interpreted as a silent yet ominous warning: Chiwenga perceives himself as a target, standing on the precipice of political and physical peril.\n\nChiwengas symbolic act, coupled with his visit to the mummified remains of an Indian legend, adds a ritualistic and almost prophetic dimension to his narrative. It is as if the Vice President, increasingly isolated and encircled, is signaling to the world that the endgame in Zimbabwes power struggle is nearing a critical and potentially violent climax.\n\nMnangagwas Strategy: Building a Shadow Army\n\nPresident Mnangagwas alleged efforts to build a parallel power base composed of armed robbers and other unsavory figures reveal his strategy to counter Chiwengas military influence. This dangerous move not only reflects the depths of distrust between the two leaders but also highlights the lengths to which Mnangagwa is willing to go to secure his hold on power. The implications for Zimbabwes security and governance are dire. As state institutions are weaponized for personal battles, the rule of law is undermined, and ordinary citizens bear the brunt of the fallout.\n\nThe creation of such a shadow army also raises existential questions for Zimbabwes democracy. If individuals with criminal backgrounds can rise to positions of authority through political patronage, what does this mean for the integrity of the state? The appointment of Kutyauripo as Chief Negomo and Director of State Residences exemplifies how loyalty to Mnangagwas regime trumps merit, legality, and ethical considerations.\n\nA Looming Showdown\n\nAs Mnangagwa fortifies his position and Auxillia deepens her involvement in security and political affairs, Chiwenga finds himself increasingly cornered. The Vice Presidents health struggles, coupled with the loss of his closest allies, compound his vulnerability. The red scarf he wore in India could be his way of crying out against an impending assassination or political sidelining, a fate that has befallen many before him in Zimbabwes treacherous political landscape.\n\nThis showdown is no longer just about two men vying for powerit is a battle for the soul of Zimbabwe, with Auxillia Mnangagwa emerging as a wildcard whose ambitions and actions could tip the scales. As the lines blur between the personal and the political, the stakes for Zimbabwes future have never been higher.\n\nThe struggle between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga is emblematic of a deeper rot within Zimbabwes political systema culture of betrayal, violence, and unchecked ambition. Auxillias unprecedented role in this conflict adds a layer of complexity that challenges traditional notions of power and governance. Meanwhile, Chiwengas red scarf and public gestures serve as a chilling reminder of the human cost of this power struggle.
