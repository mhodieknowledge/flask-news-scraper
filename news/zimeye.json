Last year, Tafireyi paid R98,000 per straw for Picassos semen, underlining his commitment to acquiring elite genetics.\n\nAccording toFarmers Weekly, Boran cattle are prized for their hardiness, fertility, and premium beef quality, making them highly sought after for both commercial and stud operations.\n\nJarren Hurwitz explained thatCyclonesrecord-breaking price is rare and speaks to the bulls superior pedigree and physical attributes. From a structural and genetic standpoint,Cycloneis exceptional. When those traits align, you get unprecedented demand, he said.\n\nSinyo Boran Stud celebrated the purchase, calling it a game-changer for Zimbabwes livestock industry. We are humbled and incredibly excited. This is a testament to our mission to become Africas leading Boran stud, read their social media post.\n\n",

            "content": "JOHANNESBURG  South Africas embattled ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), is this weekend hosting a high-level gathering of former liberation movements from the region,  most of  which are grappling with legitimacy crises, declining popular support, and accusations of authoritarianism, corruption, and repression.\n\nThe event, which begins Sartuday, brings together leaders from Angolas MPLA, Mozambiques FRELIMO, Namibias SWAPO, Tanzanias Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), and Zimbabwes notorious Zanu PF. The meeting is convened under the theme:Defending the Liberation Gains, Advancing Integrated Socio-Economic Development, Strengthening Solidarity for a Better Africa.\n\nWhile cloaked in the language of unity and pan-African development, the gathering comes at a time when these liberation-era parties face mounting public disillusionment. The ANC itself suffered a historic setback in the 2024 general elections, losing its parliamentary majority for the first time since the end of apartheid, a dramatic fall from grace driven by corruption scandals, economic mismanagement, and deteriorating public services.\n\nZanu PF,  one of the ANCs closest allies,  continues to be one of the most discredited parties in the region. Despite presiding over a country plagued by economic collapse, rampant inflation, and mass emigration, the party has retained power through repeated allegations of electoral fraud, systematic intimidation of the opposition, and gross human rights abuses. The August 2023 general elections were widely condemned as flawed by international observers, with the opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) calling the process a democratic sham.\n\nNamibias SWAPO and Angolas MPLA have similarly faced waning public trust, especially among the youth, who increasingly view these parties as relics of the past more interested in preserving elite privileges than advancing genuine development.\n\nANC NEC member Nomvula Mokonyane framed the event as a moment of renewal and relevance:\n\nThis is a good reawakening. People have been wishing us well Theres an appetite to engage and contribute. Those who are angry are saying: why did it take us so long?\n\nHowever, critics argue that rather than reflecting a vision for a better Africa, the gathering exposes a deepening crisis within these former liberation parties  a political class unwilling to let go of power or acknowledge their failures.\n\nAs Southern Africa confronts rising inequality, democratic backsliding, and youth unrest, the nostalgic rhetoric of liberation gains may no longer be enough to secure legitimacy for parties long out of touch with the people they once claimed to liberate.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nSouth African police boss General Nhlanhla Lucky Mkhwanazi has made explosive claims in an official report submitted to the President of South Africa, accusing Zimbabwes ruling party, Zanu PF, of operating as an international criminal organization.\n\nGeneral Mkhwanazi, who serves as the Provincial Police Commissioner for KwaZulu-Natal, stated in the report that high-ranking members of Zanu PFincluding individuals said to be from the office of President Emmerson Mnangagwaare working with senior officials in South Africas ruling party, the ANC, to engage in a web of illicit cross-border activities.\n\nZanu PF has lost its status as a liberation movement. It is now an international criminal organization, Mkhwanazi wrote.\n\nAccording to the report, these activities include illegal transportation of money, minerals, and goods into South Africa, which are then exported to countries where Zanu PF officials are under international sanctions. In exchange, the report claims, Zimbabwe is supplying South Africa with untraceable, military-trained gunmen, allegedly involved in political violence, including the ongoing ANC factional killings in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nWe have concrete evidence that some of the individuals involved in violent political crimes in this province are not just South Africans, Mkhwanazi noted. They are trained members of the Zimbabwe National Army.\n\nThe police boss also detailed a large-scale money laundering operation, stating that dirty money from South Africa is being cleaned through Zimbabwe using channels connected to President Mnangagwas close allies.\n\nZimbabwe is now a laundering zone, Mkhwanazi said.\n\nThis operation involves known associates of the Zimbabwean Presidentnames like Wicknell Chivayo and Kudakwashe Tagwirei appear in the intelligence documents we have.\n\nMkhwanazi recommended that the South African President raise the matter during the upcoming liberation movements summit, urging direct dialogue with President Mnangagwa.\n\nIt is now extremely difficult for us to contain crime here in South Africa because we are dealing with military-trained professionals who are being deployed into our already fragile criminal environment, he said. This must be addressed at the highest level.\n\nHe concluded by stating that Zanu PF has mutated into a profit-driven syndicate, no longer driven by any liberation mandate but rather by the personal enrichment of top officials in both Zanu PF and the ANC.\n\nThe revelations are expected to ignite intense debate within the region, particularly as both South Africa and Zimbabwe face increasing scrutiny over governance, corruption, and political violence.\n\n",

The football had been signed by the President himself during the event.\n\nScottland FC is owned by businessman and Zanu PF affiliate Scott Sakupwanya, a figure often linked to controversial gold dealings and corruption allegations. Sakupwanya was joined at the golf event by Kuda Tagwirei, another powerful and polarizing business figure who is under international sanctions for alleged looting of public resources.\n\nMnangagwas close association with both men was on full display.\n\nKuda is a son of the soil. Scott is a young man with energy and loyalty, a Mnangagwa loyalist said. We must support our own who are doing great things for the country.\n\nCritics, however, view the event as symbolic of how the President continues to reward those accused of siphoning national wealth, despite growing public anger over economic hardship and elite corruption.\n\nBoth Tagwirei and Sakupwanya have been repeatedly accused of exploiting Zimbabwes natural resources and state institutions for personal gain. Their involvement in state-sanctioned dealsespecially in the gold and fuel sectorshas attracted sharp scrutiny.\n\nObservers say Mnangagwas decision to highlight and publicly praise such individuals under the guise of charity and sport signals his disregard for mounting pressure on government to tackle elite corruption.\n\nThis wasnt about football or golf, said one political analyst who requested anonymity. It was a power showan endorsement of the very people many Zimbabweans believe are bleeding the nation dry.\n\nDespite the optics, Mnangagwa appeared unfazed, beaming as he posed for photographs with the ball and its new owners.\n\nAs tensions continue to rise over political repression, economic decay, and rising inequality, the Presidents embrace of figures like Sakupwanya and Tagwirei adds fuel to an already simmering public discontent.\n\n",
