            "content": "By A Correspondent  The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and municipal police have launched a crackdown on motorists to fundraise for Zanu PFs October conference in Mutare.\n\nThe ruling party is targeting at least US$5 million for the high-stakes gathering, where President Emmerson Mnangagwas succession battle is expected to dominate.\n\nHis loyalists are pushing for him to extend his stay in power beyond his constitutional term limit in 2028, while a rival faction aligned with the military is backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga to take over.\n\nIn the latest scheme, police officers and Harare municipal authorities have intensified roadblocks and patrols, extracting hefty spot fines for petty traffic offences.\n\nMotorists report being charged between US$120 and US$200 for violations such as parking at undesignated points, using mobile phones while driving, failing to observe stop signs, or not producing valid licences.\n\nOfficers are said to be using both official and unmarked private vehicles, spreading their operations from the city centre to suburban areas.\n\nCars impounded by council require registration books and proof of ownership before they are released, creating further frustrations for drivers.\n\nResidents have taken to WhatsApp groups to warn each other about the new police crackdown. One widely shared message reads:\n\nHi all. Please lets be advised  Council & ZRP are on full force around Harare. Roadside parking on undesignated points, being on the phone while driving, licenses, failing to observe stop signs, etc, are some of the issues they are targeting. For 1 to be out of council, you will have to release about $120 to $200. Also, these guys are using private cars and sometimes council patrol cars. Their target is not limited to the CBD, even sub urban areas. If the council impound your car, they will need a car book and owner id for the process to start. So lets all be warned.\n\nThe tactic is a throwback to the Mugabe era, when then-police chief Augustine Chihuri turned the ZRP into a cash cow for Zanu PF. At the time, police stations were given daily revenue targets, with a significant share funnelled into party coffers.\n\nDuring the height of Zanu PFs factional wars, money squeezed from motorists and businesses was channelled to bankroll the G40 faction against the Lacoste camp that eventually propelled Mnangagwa to power.\n\nThe latest fundraising drive highlights how Zanu PF continues to weaponise state institutions for its survival, while leaving ordinary citizens to carry the burden.\n\n",

            "content": "The National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) has confirmed that nine Chinese nationals arrested for cocaine possession in Harare  and fined just US$150 each  are now awaiting deportation.\n\nThe nine, identified as Yu Hefeng, Dong Yunmei, Yang Wanwan, Wu Yuejun, Yang Qin, Fang Yue, Sun Jie, Yao Wenming and Li Zhongju, were apprehended in the capital after allegedly being found with cocaine. Their sentencing  a small fine rather than imprisonment  has sparked public outrage and accusations of double standards in Zimbabwes handling of drug-related crimes.\n\nIn a strongly worded statement issued on Thursday, the NPAZ said it was aware of the publics concern about the case and vowed to strengthen its prosecution of future drug offences.\n\nThe National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) is aware of the publics concern regarding the sentence handed down in the case involving nine Chinese nationals who pleaded guilty to using dangerous drugs (cocaine). We are taking this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the diligent and fair prosecution of all criminal cases, the statement read.\n\nThe NPAZ stressed that the nine individuals are currently awaiting deportation and reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring that all individuals are held accountable for their actions in accordance with the laws of Zimbabwe, regardless of their nationality or status.\n\nThe statement came as Zimbabweans vented frustration on social media, citing cases where locals have been denied bail for possessing cannabis or received harsh sentences for minor drug offences, while foreigners walked free after paying what many called token fines.\n\nGoing forward, the NPAZ said all public prosecutors had been instructed to prefer the correct charges in all drug-related cases and aggressively pursue stiffer sentences in court to secure penalties that truly reflect the seriousness of these offences.\n\nThis stance is a direct reflection of the direction that Zimbabwe has taken to combat drug abuse. We appreciate the publics vigilance, as it reinforces our shared commitment to combating drug abuse in our society. We are committed to a future where drug-related offences are met with sentences that truly reflect their gravity, the NPAZ said.\n\nThe move to deport the nine Chinese nationals now places pressure on Zimbabwes justice system to prove that future drug cases  regardless of nationality  will be treated with consistency, severity, and transparency.\n\n",

I am pleased that the Party machinery is demonstrating concerted refocusing and recalibration at all levels to achieve the set out decisions and objectives, Mnangagwa declared.\n\nCritics argue this kind of self-congratulation is detached from the daily reality of Zimbabweans, who continue to suffer under a collapsing economy, spiraling inflation, and crumbling public services.\n\nMnangagwa speaks as though all is well, yet ordinary citizens cannot even afford bread or transport, said one political commentator. These empty slogans of refocusing and recalibration mean nothing when hospitals lack medicine and families go hungry.\n\nAnalysts say Mnangagwas continued obsession with internal party politics reveals a leadership more concerned with preserving ZANU PFs grip on power than rescuing the country from its downward spiral.\n\nAs the ZANU PF conference looms, Mnangagwas speech underscores the widening disconnect between the ruling elites rhetoric and the harsh realities faced by the nation  a reminder, critics say, that Zimbabwe remains trapped in the clutches of a failing state.\n\n",

Mnangagwa, who turned 83 on Monday, basked in the adoration and took the opportunity to poke fun at his own age.\n\nI want to thank you, my colleagues in the party who are celebrating with me on my 83rd birthday. I have another 83 years to go. I will clock another 83, he declared, leaving his loyal audience laughing.\n\nMnangagwa insisted he still feels youthful and credited divine providence for his longevity. Let me assure you that this is the Grace of God, it is not my design or anybodys design. It is the will of God that I reach that age. I dont feel it, I think sometime in future I might begin feeling the age but for now I am strong, he said.\n\nWhile the President was shown glittering pictures, carvings and a wooden lion representing his totem, millions of Zimbabweans outside the ZANU PF bubble continue to battle crippling inflation, food shortages and collapsed public services. To many, his claims of being fit as a fiddle only underscore how insulated the ruling elite has become.\n\nIt is disturbing that Mnangagwa can talk of another 83 years while people are starving and hospitals have no drugs, one analyst said.\n\nHis jokes may entertain ZANU PF staffers, but they mock the daily struggles of the nation.\n\nMnangagwas self-congratulatory birthday address, delivered amid cheers from loyalists, highlighted once again the widening gulf between a President obsessed with his own survival and a population desperate for real solutions.\n\n",
