We must continue to protect our hard-won independence. We cannot allow Western-sponsored elements like Nelson Chamisa to reverse the gains of the liberation struggle.\n\nZanu PF Political Commissar Munyaradzi Machacha praised Gomos legacy, singling him out as the architect behind the partys network of affiliates that played a key role in votermobilisationduring the disputed August 2023 general elections.\n\nWhen I came into the commissariat, I was introduced to these affiliates and quicklyrealisedthatDrGomo had meticulouslymouldedthem into powerful extensions of the partysmobilisationmachinery, Machacha said. He gave the commissariat strategic depth.

We will carry forward your legacy bymobilisingdiasporans to return and contribute to rebuilding Zimbabwe under Zanu PF.\n\nBornface Mutize, another party loyalist and affiliateorganiser, added: As we move forward, we must remain resolute in defending the party for future generations.\n\nWhile Gomos retirement marks the end of an era in the commissariat, critics argue that his influence will continue to loom large, particularly through the affiliate structures he helpedinstitutionalise.\n\nCivil societyorganisationsand opposition parties continue to accuse Zanu PF of using these affiliates to entrench authoritarianism, control rural communities, and undermine democratic processes under the guise of grassrootsmobilisation.\n\n",

            "content": "Sports Correspondent\n\nOnce again, Norman Mapeza has found himself at the centre of controversy.After overseeing a dominant FC Platinum performance that saw them comfortably dispatch a struggling CAPS United side at Rufaro Stadium on Wednesday, the coach made headlines not for the football, but for a fiery exchange with the media.\n\nA brace from Thandolwenkosi Ngwenya, scored on either side of halftime, sealed a well-earned second victory of the season for the Zvishavane-based outfit in the 2025 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League. While the match itself was a showcase of fluid football and tactical discipline, what followed overshadowed the on-field display.\n\nDuring the post-match press conference, a journalist posed a seemingly routine question regarding FC Platinums previously inconsistent scoring form. The inquiry touched on whether Mapeza still had concerns about his teams conversion rate, given their improved showing in recent games. That was the spark.\n\nMapeza, visibly agitated, launched into a tirade, pointing a finger and accusing the reporter of misrepresenting him.You have got a problem my friend, you are a very young man, dont ever make the mistake of putting words in my mouth. If he (the journalist) comes to press conferences next time, I wont speak to the press, Mapeza snapped, before abruptly exiting the room.\n\nHe then took his grievance a step further, claiming the journalists approach could result in restricted access for other members of the media  a threat that raised eyebrows and suggested an inflated sense of self-importance.\n\nThis isnt the first time Mapeza has leaned on his past achievements  including his UEFA Champions League experience with Galatasaray  to position himself as above criticism. Yet, such behavior runs contrary to the professional standards seen in European football, where difficult questions are part of the job, and decorum is expected in response.\n\nIronically, Mapezas frustration stemmed from a question rooted in reality. Despite denying any previous expression of concern over his sides lack of goals, the coach had in fact voiced such worries. Ahead of a goalless draw with MWOS on March 27, he remarked: Goals are not coming, I dont think Im the only coach who is worried about lack of goals. Other coaches are worried too because goals are just not coming.\n\nHis outburst, therefore, not only reflected poorly on his temperament but also contradicted his own public statements.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa has placed the blame for Bulawayos stalled development squarely on the shoulders of the citys mayor, David Coltart, accusing him of prioritizing political agendas over economic progress.\n\nSpeaking during a press briefing held on May 1, Mutsvangwa took aim at Coltart, saying the mayor was failing to recognize the national efforts being made to drive industrial growthparticularly those led by President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nHis Excellency President Dr. E.D. Mnangagwa is committed to providing working capital for the people of Zimbabwe, Mutsvangwa declared, before criticizing Coltart for being oblivious to the developments taking place under the presidents leadership.\n\nMutsvangwa pointed to the launch of a new steel plant as a major success story, saying it marked Zimbabwes emergence as a key player in the regional steel industry. Zimbabwe leads Sub-Saharan Africa in this sector, with only Egypt and Morocco as our closest competitors, he said.\n\nHe argued that steel was critical to any countrys urbanization process and stressed that the presidents efforts were laying a foundation for a modern and industrialized Zimbabwe.\n\nTurning to the state of Bulawayo, Mutsvangwa lamented what he described as a lack of initiative from the citys leadership. Bulawayo should not only be celebrated as the City of Kings and Queens but must also reclaim its status as a thriving industrial hub, he said. He urged residents to hold their mayor accountable: We encourage citizens to ask Mayor Coltart what tangible steps he has taken to restore Bulawayos industrial legacy.\n\nThe ZANU PF official further accused Coltart of being more concerned with tribal disputes and politicking than with attracting investment or driving the citys economic recovery. He recalled a conversation in which he claims Coltart dismissed engaging with a local steel company due to its Chinese ownership.\n\nI posed a question to Mr. Coltart about how he plans to leverage the presence of a modern steel company, but his response was that, since its a Chinese-owned enterprise, he prefers not to be involved, said Mutsvangwa. He has an attitude against the Chinese.\n\nThe remarks are part of a broader pattern in which Mutsvangwa has consistently shifted responsibility for local governance challenges to opposition-led councils, often portraying ZANU PFs initiatives as being obstructed by what he frames as uncooperative or politically motivated local leaders.\n\n",
