This paves the way for women and girls across our continent to excel, proving that with determination, every ceiling can be shattered. Karibu sana Rais!\n\nHer message sparked controversy, as critics argue that congratulating Hassan overlooks allegations of electoral irregularities and the exclusion of main opposition candidates.\n\nTanzanias electoral commission declared Hassan the winner with 31.9 million votes, accounting for 98% of the ballots, while her nearest rival received just 213,414 votes, or 0.65%. Official reports noted that voter turnout reached 87% of the 37.6 million registered voters, despite violent protests erupting in several regions over the sidelining of opposition leaders.\n\nOpposition activists and political analysts have questioned Maveteras public endorsement, suggesting it sends a worrying signal about Zimbabwes stance on free and fair elections in the region.\n\nOne political commentator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: By congratulating a leader whose victory is widely disputed, Mavetera risks undermining Zimbabwes credibility on democratic principles.\n\nDespite the backlash, Maveteras office has not issued a clarification, leaving the debate over the appropriateness of her comments ongoing.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nMutare  Critics have accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his ruling ZANU PF party of exploiting religion and community empowerment funds for political gain.\n\nAt a Presidential Empowerment event in Mutare on Sunday, National Multi- Faith Economic Dialogue (NAMFED) chief convener Mr Obey Mapuranga declared, We believe that the spirit of God has ordained President Mnangagwas leadership and we stand in support of his vision for economic development through NAMFED.\n\nAs a faith community, we pledge to support the President during the upcoming elections and beyond.\n\nObservers argue that such statements turn faith leaders into political mouthpieces, undermining the independence of religious institutions. The ceremony also involved the distribution of substantial funds to organisations aligned with ZANU PF. NAMFED, the Vapostori and VaZion for ED, and the Children of War Veterans each received US$50,000, while Cross-Border Traders for ED, Hairdressers for ED, Health Ambassadors for ED, Boys Dzamudhara, Vendors for ED, and Pastors for ED received US$20,000 each.\n\nPresidential Investment Advisor Dr Paul Tungwarara described the funds as a revolving facility meant to benefit future recipients as well, presenting the initiative as a tool for unity and grassroots economic transformation. Critics, however, contend the programme is primarily a mechanism to secure political loyalty ahead of elections rather than a genuine effort to empower communities.\n\nHuman rights advocates warn that using religious endorsement and targeted funding to influence voters erodes democratic principles and entrenches patronage networks at the expense of impartial development.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nHarare  Zanu PF-linked personalities have mocked Zimbabwean mixed martial artist Themba Gorimbo following his weekend loss to American fighter Jeremiah Wells at UFC Vegas 110, a match he lost by unanimous decision.\n\nOn Sunday controversial businessman Wicknell Chivayo led the charge, ridiculing Gorimbo in a social media post that many described as petty and uncalled for. Chivayo wrote: Useless anzwa butter & kuswera uchitsvaga mbiri pa social media uchituka vanhu ne nyika instead of training. Too many losses, dzoka kumusha uite bouncer ku mabhawa, Chikomana.\n\nIn a sharp and emotional response, Gorimbo clapped back at Chivayo, accusing him of flaunting stolen wealth while undermining hardworking people. Joke of the day today was Wickednel telling me I must come back and be a bouncer, he said. Bro please relax. Honestly, do you think my life has always been rosy? I was once a garden boy, painter, and security guard. With the real Gods grace I am here.\n\nGorimbo went on to say his story had inspired countless people around the world. I am not a yahoo boy, my guy. I sweat for everything. And alongside, I meet good people who have sweated for their money and help me, he said.\n\nThe fighter also questioned Chivayos moral influence, saying, I dont know who Wickednel can inspire in this world. Maybe goons who also want to steal, but real inspiration chaiyo hamuna wamumopa. Ndiyo last post I will ever mention you.\n\nHe further accused the businessman of trying to silence critics through money and influence. Imagine buying people with cars to silence their critical thinking skills so they may turn a blind eye to evil being done. You might have a lot of money, but one thing you can never do is buy me because I dont have a price. I am different.\n\nDespite the loss, Gorimbo remained defiant and optimistic. From nothing to something I won, even when I am losing in your eyes. Bikita to Miami. I thank God, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Zanu PF online activist Dereck Goto joined the mockery, writing: Id been scratching my head wondering why our dear Themba Gorimbo had suddenly gone mute on social media  little did I know the brothers spirit was warning him kuti brace yourself, disaster incoming.\n\nGoto went on to gloat over the result, saying, Cdes, the silence is over! I come bearing fantastic news  the self-proclaimed loudmouth has been clobbered again this very morning! Thank you Jeremiah Wells for doing the Lords work. We appreciate you. Lots of love from Zimbabwe.\n\nGorimbos defeat may have cost him a win inside the octagon, but for many fans, his resilience, humility, and faith continue to make him a symbol of perseverance beyond the cage.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent-Vice President Constantino Chiwenga last week missed the State of the Nation Address delivered by President Emmerson Mnangagwa after he had left for South Africa for a medical check-up.\n\nGovernment sources said Chiwenga had a doctors appointment in South Africa on the day of the address.\n\nThis was also confirmed by Presidential spokesperson George Charamba to a local online portal.\n\nAt 69 years old, Chiwengas absence from the opening of the third session of the tenth Parliament was conspicuous. Vice President Kembo Mohadi attended in his place. In a terse response to a ZimLive inquiry, presidential spokesman George Charamba stated:\n\nThe vice-president had a medical review in South Africa.\n\nChiwenga is believed to have since returned to Zimbabwe. His last public engagement was on 25 October, when he attended the 75th-anniversary celebrations of St Lukes Mission and St Lukes Mission Hospital in Lupane (Matabeleland North), following a tour of development projects in Matabeleland South.\n\nHis absence at such a key national event has sparked speculation about internal manoeuvring within the ruling party, ZANUPF. Reportedly, allies of Mnangagwaincluding influential businessman Kudakwashe Tagwireiare said to be manoeuvring to sideline Chiwenga from the party and government, effectively eliminating him from the succession contest. Meanwhile, Chiwenga is believed to be resisting efforts to extend Mnangagwas presidency beyond 2028, when his second and final term is due to end under the 2013 constitutionan issue that has placed him at odds with powerful loyalists who privately harbour ambitions of their own.\n\nMnangagwa came to power in November 2017, following the removal of longtime leader Robert Mugabe. Chiwengathen commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forcesplayed a decisive role in the transition, making him a central figure in the new administration. (He was appointed Vice President shortly afterwards.)\n\nOver the years, a succession contest has simmered within ZANU-PF. Mnangagwa has stressed constitutional limitstwo five-year terms ending in 2028but internal signals suggest efforts to extend his stay or pick a loyal successor are ongoing. Analysts note that the contest is not simply about time in office, but about securing patronage networks, control of the party apparatus, and future access to state resources.\n\nChiwenga, as a former military chief and long-standing figure in the liberation war generation, has been widely viewed as a potential successor. At the same time, his presence also threatens other power centres within ZANU-PF that favour alternative successors or narrower patronage networks linked to Mnangagwas inner circle. Conflicts over corruption, control of tenders, and influence in the security sector further deepen the fault lines.\n\nIn early 2025, reports pointed to a growing rift between Chiwenga and Mnangagwas allies, especially after Chiwenga publicly criticised tenderpreneurs and implied that the Vision 2030 agenda must be inclusive and not monopolised by party elites. Such remarks were widely seen as signalling his disapproval of how power was being exercised and how succession plans were being manipulated.\n\nChiwengas health has been a subject of public and political concern for several years. In February 2019 he was treated in India for an unspecified ailment, and the government acknowledged he was not feeling well. On that occasion, he was described as having swollen hands and discoloured skin patches. By November 2019, he had spent four months in China for medical treatment, after prior treatment spells in South Africa and India.\n\nThese prolonged absences and opaque explanations fuelled speculation about his fitness for officeespecially given his prominent role in succession politics. More recently, in 2023 a court heard evidence that Chiwenga was unconscious when hospitalised in July 2019 in South Africa, and that his doctor had been furious when he was flown out of the country. While the exact details of his condition remain undisclosed, it is clear his health remains fragile and politically sensitive.\n\nGiven the combination of illhealth and highstakes internal party dynamics, Chiwengas absence from major eventssuch as the SONAat a time of intensified succession manoeuvring magnifies public speculation about his status and future within the party.\n\nChiwengas non-attendance at the SONA may reflect more than a routine medical appointment. In the current context, it underscores three inter-linked dynamics:\n\n",
