Efforts to disqualify certain candidates have intensified, creating a contentious atmosphere.\n\nThis week, the ZIFA Ethics Committee, which will review candidates before announcing the final list on December 23, was presented with objections against Machana, popular cleric Walter Magaya, and Northern Region Soccer League chairman Martin Kweza. A letter from K. Mugadzaweta, also sent to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), accused Machana of financial misconduct and fraud related to a forensic audit of ZIFAs finances from December 2018 to November 2021.\n\nIn response, Machana, through his legal team at Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, dismissed the allegations as unfounded and politically timed, noting that the complaints were lodged with ZACC only after the ZIFA election nominations had closed.\n\n",

Such behaviour is unacceptable.\n\nThe Zanu PF leader emphasized the importance of maintaining discipline within the party and adhering to its constitution, making it clear that internal disputes should be resolved within the party structures rather than on public platforms.\n\nThose who are doing it, spit on the ground and never do it again, Mnangagwa added, sending a stern message to party members who have been engaging in such behavior. Every party member must adhere to the party constitution.\n\nThe comments come amidst rising tensions within Zanu PF, where internal divisions have been increasingly evident. Social media, often a space for public debate, has become a battleground for party members to express their discontent, contributing to the deepening rift at the top levels of the ruling party.\n\nMnangagwas call to restore discipline within Zanu PF is seen as an effort to regain control over the partys narrative and prevent further damage to its image.\n\nHowever, his statement also raises questions about how the party intends to address the underlying issues fueling such public outbursts.\n\nWith political infighting growing, Mnangagwas warning signals a tough stance on party loyalty and unity in the face of mounting internal challenges.\n\n",
