            "content": "By A Correspondent| A shocking press statement released by the legal representatives and supporters of Frank Buyanga Sadiqi has exposed egregious violations of his fundamental rights and systemic abuses of power by South African authorities.\n\nSadiqi, a prominent businessperson and philanthropist, has been subjected to unlawful detention, procedural irregularities, and a blatant miscarriage of justice. His detention contravenes Section 50 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which mandates that an arrested person must be brought before a court within 48 hours.\n\nThe statement highlights several key violations, including:\n\nThe statement demands the immediate and unconditional release of Sadiqi, dismissal of all charges, and a thorough investigation into the abuses of power by the Hawks, SAPS, and other involved authorities.\n\nThe judiciary is urged to expedite the review of Sadiqis case and ensure that justice is served without further delay. The statement also appeals to the judicial and executive community, human rights organizations, and all people of conscience to stand in solidarity with Sadiqi.\n\nAs reported earlier, Sadiqis detention has taken a toll on his health, with reports indicating that he has fallen sick in prison. His supporters argue that his prosecution is concocted and malicious and that he has been denied his fundamental rights, including access to private medical healthcare.\n\nThe case has sparked widespread outrage, with many calling for Sadiqis immediate release and an end to the alleged persecution. As the matter continues to unfold, one thing is clear: justice must be served, and those responsible for these egregious violations must be held accountable.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nAs Zimbabwe grapples with an escalating economic crisis, the government is scrambling to implement measures it hopes will stabilize the nations deteriorating economy. Despite these attempts, experts are skeptical about the effectiveness of the actions, given the severity of the challenges the country faces.\n\nIn a bid to counter the spiraling inflation, devaluation of the local currency, and declining investor confidence, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) recently announced a series of economic interventions. One of the most notable actions involves reducing exporters foreign currency retention thresholds. However, many believe that these actions are merely cosmetic attempts to address much deeper economic issues.\n\nDuring the 2025 Monetary Policy Statement presentation in Harare this Thursday, RBZ Governor Dr. John Mushayavanhu outlined the banks strategy to boost growth and stabilize the currency market. He revealed that exporters foreign currency retention thresholds would be lowered, signaling a shift towards deeper reliance on the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) for financial transactions.\n\nTo guarantee continued stability in the interbank foreign exchange market, we have augmented the foreign currency supply needed to support the ZiG, Dr. Mushayavanhu stated. This means the portion of export proceeds that must be surrendered has increased from 25 percent to 30 percent, effective immediately.\n\nThis move, the governor emphasized, was necessary to bolster Zimbabwes currency reserves. However, it also places more pressure on exporters, many of whom are already facing mounting operational challenges. The increased 5 percent surrender requirement, according to Dr. Mushayavanhu, is designed to ensure that exporters mobilize enough ZiG to meet their local currency obligations, including tax payments.\n\nDespite the governments insistence that these policies are designed to bring stability, critics argue that the root causes of Zimbabwes economic collapsesuch as a loss of investor confidence, rampant corruption, and mismanagementremain unaddressed.\n\nThe economy is at a breaking point, said one economist .\n\nThese measures, while they may provide short-term relief, do little to fix the underlying issues that are driving inflation and unemployment through the roof.\n\nThe use of ZiG, a government-backed digital currency, has been promoted as a solution to the countrys cash shortages and to limit the dependence on foreign currencies. However, Zimbabweans remain wary, given the persistent depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar and the governments history of failed economic policies.\n\nZimbabweans have little trust in the governments ability to manage the economy, said the economist. The crisis is too deep for cosmetic measures to have any lasting impact.\n\nAs the central bank continues to refine its foreign exchange management system, many Zimbabweans fear that without significant structural reforms, the country will continue to spiral into a deeper economic abyss.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.zimeye.net/2025/02/08/what-is-mnangagwa-doing-in-tanzania/",
            "content": "By A Correspondent | Dar es Salaam, Tanzania  Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa has arrived in Tanzania to chair an extraordinary summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the East African Community (EAC). But the burning question remains: What is Mnangagwa really doing in Tanzania?\n\nAt first glance, the purpose of his visit seems clearleading the SADC Double Troika in high-stakes negotiations to address the escalating crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Alongside Kenyan President William Ruto, who chairs the EAC, Mnangagwa is overseeing efforts to persuade warring factions to lay down arms and restore peace in the mineral-rich but war-ravaged eastern DRC.\n\nHowever, is there more to Mnangagwas presence in Tanzania than meets the eye?\n\nDiplomacy or Strategic Influence?\n\nMnangagwas role as chairperson of SADC places him at the center of one of Africas most complex conflicts, but some analysts question whether Zimbabwes leader is simply fulfilling a diplomatic duty or positioning himself as a key regional powerbroker.\n\nThis joint summitan unprecedented meeting between SADC and EACsignals a shift in Africas approach to conflict resolution. The deteriorating security situation in the DRC, worsened by alleged Rwandan support for the M23 rebels, has drawn in multiple regional actors, each with their own interests. Mnangagwas leadership in this forum raises questions about Zimbabwes own geopolitical ambitions.\n\nCould his presence in Tanzania signal Zimbabwes growing influence in regional security affairs? Is Mnangagwa leveraging this summit to assert his leadership beyond SADCs borders?\n\nA Strategic Military Move?\n\nZimbabwe has historically played a military role in the DRC, having deployed troops under former President Robert Mugabe during the Second Congo War. Now, with SADCs military mission in the DRC gaining momentum, could Mnangagwas involvement be more than just diplomatic?\n\nThere are whispers that Zimbabwe might be angling for a stronger military or economic role in the DRC crisis. The mineral wealth of the eastern DRChome to vast reserves of cobalt, gold, and coltanhas long been a magnet for regional and international powers. Could Mnangagwas presence in Tanzania be linked to Zimbabwes interests in the DRCs lucrative resources?\n\nThe Rwanda Factor\n\nAnother key question looms over Mnangagwas mission: how will he handle the delicate issue of Rwandas alleged support for the M23 rebels? President Paul Kagame, who is also attending the summit, has repeatedly denied involvement, despite accusations from the DRC government.\n\nMnangagwas challenge is to balance diplomatic neutrality while pushing for a resolution that aligns with SADCs stance. However, Zimbabwes own historical ties with both Rwanda and the DRC complicate matters. Could Mnangagwa be brokering a behind-the-scenes deal between Kinshasa and Kigali?\n\nPossibility of Collusion: A Hidden Agenda?\n\nAdding to the intrigue surrounding Mnangagwas visit to Tanzania is the growing speculation about possible collusion with corrupt motives. Tanzania is the same country where convicted and controversial Zimbabwean businessman Wicknell Chivayo has been frequently spotted, raising questions about whether Mnangagwas presence in Dar es Salaam is purely diplomatic or linked to clandestine business dealings. Chivayo, known for securing questionable government contracts in Zimbabwe, has reportedly been expanding his network in Tanzaniasparking concerns that his business interests could be intertwined with political maneuvering at the highest levels.\n\nGiven the secretive nature of Chivayos dealings and his close ties to Zimbabwes ruling elite, is it possible that Mnangagwas trip to Tanzania involves more than just peace talks? Could high-level corrupt dealings be unfolding under the guise of regional diplomacy? If so, what financial or political benefits might be at play, and who stands to gain?\n\nAs Mnangagwa chairs this crucial summit, these unanswered questions add another layer of mystery to his presence in Tanzania, raising concerns that the DRC peace process may be a smokescreen for deeper, undisclosed agendas.\n\nA Bid for Political Legacy?\n\nWith his term as SADC chairperson giving him a rare international platform, could Mnangagwa be looking to cement his legacy as a statesman beyond Zimbabwes borders? Domestically, his leadership has faced criticism over economic struggles and governance concerns. Successfully steering the DRC peace process could boost his standing both at home and in the region.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nThe outcomes of this summit will determine whether Mnangagwas presence in Tanzania is a mere diplomatic duty or part of a larger strategic maneuver. If he manages to push warring factions toward a resolution, he could emerge as a key figure in regional diplomacy. But if the talks fail, the crisis in the DRC could deepen, with dire consequences for the entire Great Lakes region.\n\nFor now, as the world watches, the question remains: What exactly is Mnangagwa doing in Tanzania?\n\n",

Its a waste of taxpayers money to pay someone who isnt doing their job properly.
