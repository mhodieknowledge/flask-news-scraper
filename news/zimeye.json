            "content": "By Religion Reporter | Harare, Zimbabwe  In a dramatic proclamation that went into Saturday midnight, Andrew Wutaunashe, the self-proclaimed chief prophet of Emmerson Mnangagwa, has declared that the Zimbabwean President has reached the end of his divine seven-year rule, comparing his fall to that of King Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian ruler who was humbled by God and reduced to spend the next 7 years eating grass, among animals.\n\nWutaunashe, addressing his prayerfull congregation, claimed that God first revealed Mnangagwas rise and fall to him in 1997 and again in 2010, which would be only for a seven year glorious period, after which Mnangagwa would lose supernatural power and start manifesting humannness. He suggested that his expiration is part of Gods divine plan.\n\nA Leader Humbled, Like Nebuchadnezzar\n\nWutaunashe directly suggested Mnangagwas downfall, emphasizing that it was Gods doing, not mans will:\n\nI wanted to just hear from God, and God told me hes being humbled, Amen. Everyone is saying whatever they want to say. But when people say things they want to say about a leader, dont make the mistake of thinking that that unmakes him as a leader, he said.\n\nHe stressed that while Mnangagwas humiliation is trending on social media, it does not negate his divine calling, even after its expiration.\n\nReinforcing that leaders are chosen by God, not by popular opinion, he said,\n\nLeaders are not raised because of peoples opinions. They are raised because of Gods calling, those callings which are without repentance, Hallelujah.\n\nDespite acknowledging Mnangagwas divine humbling, Wutaunashe warned that no one should dare take his throne:\n\nGod said hes being humbled, but no one must take his throne, and he must fulfill his ministry. Say, Hallelujah. He must fulfill the mission that God has given him.\n\nA Call for Military Action Against Mnangagwas Challengers?\n\nIn an unsettling twist, Wutaunashe likened Blessed Geza, the war veteran and military strategist leading calls for Mnangagwas resignation, to Absalom, the Biblical son of King David who attempted to seize his fathers throne but was ultimately slain by the military.\n\nNow some of you may not understand this, but this happened to David as a king. His own (Blessed) Geza was his own son who rose up against him and almost took the kingdom, but God had not changed His mind.\n\nHe further suggested that the solution to this political rebellion is military action, drawing a direct parallel to Absaloms fate. His remarks implied that Geza and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga must be removed through force, just as Absalom was.\n\nZimbabwe at a Crossroads: Prophecy or Political Turmoil?\n\nWutaunashes remarks have sent shockwaves through Zimbabwes political and religious circles. His acknowledgment of Mnangagwas humiliation, combined with his insistence on preserving the leaders throne and his biblical justification for military action, raises serious concerns.\n\nWith political tensions already at a boiling point, could Mnangagwas military backers heed Wutaunashes call? Will Zimbabwe see a violent power struggle, or will Mnangagwa accept his prophetic humbling?\n\nFor now, the nation watchesand praysas this prediction continues to appear to unfold, as if it was truly divine.\n\nTWO LIVE BROADCASTS ARE SET TO BE BEAMED OVER THE MATTER ON ZIMEYE ON SUNDAY 12NOON (30min), and ANOTHER AT 5pm (30min), and present will be leading war veterans and tacticians involved in the Geza led movement.\n\n",
