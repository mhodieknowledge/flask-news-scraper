Their triumph earned the club an estimated $114.6 million (84.4m) in prize money, with around $15.5 million (11.4m) earmarked as bonuses for the players.\n\nA share of those bonuses was voluntarily set aside to support Jotas grieving family, in a move that has been widely praised as a rare example of unity and compassion in the modern game.\n\n",

            "content": "By Engineer Jacob Kudzayi Mutisi | Now that Zimbabwe is back in the Rugby World Cup final 2027, countries that dominate the world rugby stage share one common trait,they play the sport throughout the year. Whether it is New Zealand, South Africa, England or France, rugby is embedded into the school calendar and the national psyche. Young players do not simply pick up a rugby ball for a term, play a handful of matches, and then hang up their boots until the following year. Instead, they live and breathe the sport, training, competing and honing their skills for months on end.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, however, the reality could not be more different. At most schools, rugby is confined to a short three-and-a-half-month window, usually squeezed into the second term. Once the term ends, the season is over. The fields grow quiet, the balls gather dust and promising talent is left to fade while our young athletes focus on other sports or no sport at all.\n\nThe consequence is obvious, our players never get the chance to reach their full potential. Rugby is a skill-based, tactical and physical game. Mastering its complexities requires time, hours upon hours of drills, matches and fitness work. In the leading rugby nations, schoolboys and schoolgirls often log hundreds of hours of structured play each year before they even reach adulthood. By contrast, a Zimbabwean school rugby player might only get a fraction of that experience over the course of their entire school career.\n\nIf Zimbabwe is serious about becoming the rugby powerhouse many of us dream of, the first and most urgent change must be extending the school rugby season. Rugby should be played across all three terms, with different formats to keep the sport fresh and to avoid player burnout. For example, the traditional 15-a-side game could dominate the main season, while sevens rugby and touch rugby could be introduced during the off-season months. This approach would keep players engaged, improve overall fitness and develop versatile skills.\n\nMoreover, an all-year rugby programme would allow coaches more time to work on player development. Skills such as tackling technique, decision-making under pressure and positional awareness cannot be mastered in just a few weeks. Longer seasons also create space for strength and conditioning work, injury prevention programmes and mental preparation, these are all vital aspects of modern rugby.\n\nThe benefits extend beyond the field. Year-round rugby would instil discipline, teamwork and resilience in our youth. It would also create a stronger culture of the sport, where communities rally around school games and local clubs thrive. The more rugby is played, the more it becomes part of the national sporting identity.\n\nCritics may argue that schools need to balance rugby with other sports. That is true, but the answer is not to limit rugby to a single term  it is to schedule it creatively, integrating it alongside other disciplines. Successful sporting nations understand that variety is possible without sacrificing intensity or commitment.\n\nThe question is not whether Zimbabwe has rugby talent? we do. The question is whether we are willing to nurture it properly. Playing rugby for only three and a half months a year will never make us world-beaters. If we want to compete with the best, we must follow the example of those who already are the best and make rugby a year-round passion, not a seasonal hobby.\n\nEngineer Jacob Kudzayi Mutisi+263772278161\n\n",

Mathys showed bravery and courage to step forward and take a penalty, yet those who abuse him are nothing but cowards  hiding behind anonymous usernames and profiles to spout their abhorrent views.\n\nThe club vowed to assist law enforcement and work with social media platforms to ensure offenders are brought to justice. We will work with the authorities and social media platforms to take the strongest possible action against any individual we are able to identify, Tottenham declared.\n\nThe incident has reignited calls for stronger action against online abuse in football, with players and clubs urging platforms to clamp down on hate speech.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nA senior member of Varakashi4ED, has claimed that Zimbabweans are increasingly embracing the ZiG currency.\n\nDereck Goto, a popular figure within the movement, made the remarks on Wednesday in a Facebook post titled ZiG and the Economics of Sovereignty  Why Zimbabwes Mid-Term Statement Matters.\n\nGoto argued that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwes latest Mid-Term Monetary Policy Statement was more than just financial data, describing it as an emphatic vindication of the Second Republics economic vision and ZANU PFs unwavering commitment to restoring Zimbabwes sovereignty over its own economy.\n\nHe noted that the statement came less than a year after the launch of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency in April 2024, which he said signalled stability is here, recovery is real, and the architecture of a self-reliant economy is steadily being built.\n\nHighlighting monetary discipline, Goto wrote: Monthly inflation from February to July 2025 averaged a mere 0.6%. This was not achieved through gimmicks, but through deliberate, sustained policy action. He added that while annual inflation remains high due to past price shifts, it is projected to drop to around 30% by year-end.\n\nGoto also pointed to the steadiness of the ZiG/US dollar exchange rate, crediting it to hard economic fundamentals rather than the false calm of overregulation. He said foreign currency inflows rose from US$5.9 billion in the first half of 2024 to US$7.2 billion in the same period of 2025, supported by exports and diaspora remittances.\n\nAccording to Goto, GDP growth is expected to reach 6% in 2025, up from 1.7% in 2024, driven by targeted investments in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and tourism. These are not abstract numbers  they translate into jobs, higher household incomes, and renewed fiscal space for national development, he said.\n\nHe noted that confidence in the ZiG is strengthening visibly, with the share of ZiG-denominated electronic transactions rising from 26% in April 2024 to over 40% by June 2025, aided by improved cash availability.\n\nGoto said the RBZ had maintained stability through careful liquidity management, doubling foreign currency reserves from US$285 million in April 2024 to over US$730 million by June 2025.\n\nHe claimed that stakeholders from business, industry, and civil society had endorsed the direction of economic policy, calling for a de-dollarisation roadmap and continued sectoral support.\n\nThe ZiG is more than a currency  it is a statement of intent, a symbol of restored confidence, and a tool for national self-determination, Goto concluded.\n\n",
