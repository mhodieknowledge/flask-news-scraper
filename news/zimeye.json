            "content": "ByPolitical Reporter- President Emmerson Mnangagwa has revealed that some ministers were skipping cabinet meetings.\n\nMnangagwa, who did not name the troublesome minister, told the last 2024 cabinet meeting held at State House that the absenteeism behaviour was untenable and a dereliction of duty.\n\nHowever, sources close to this development said that thesaidministersare alignedwith Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nLet me, however, hasten to emphasise that Cabinet processes are anchored on the timely submission of vital documents and regular attendance by Ministers and officials, Mnangagwa stated. The worrisome tendency by Ministers and senior officials to absent themselves from meetings is untenable. Permanent Secretaries should ensure that in their absence, only directors and above should attend working party meetings.\n\nThe presidents remarks cement the tension claims between Chiwenga and Mnangagwa.\n\nSpeculation suggests that these absences are part of a coordinated effort to challenge Mnangagwas leadership ahead of Zanu PFs next elective congress.\n\nMnangagwa directed Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet, Martin Rushwaya, to tighten monitoring of ministerial attendance starting in 2025.\n\nHe warned that ministers and senior officials who fail to comply risk dire consequences.\n\nThe president also criticised deputy ministers, accusing them of being poorly prepared and undermining his authority by failing to participate effectively in government operations.\n\nIn cases where Deputy Ministers are assigned, they should be adequately capacitated to enable active participation in the requisite deliberations. To this end, I direct that Deputy Ministers must now sign performance contracts in 2025, Mnangagwa announced.\n\nThese measures follow Mnangagwas earlier introduction of performance contracts for senior government officials as part of his Vision 2030 agenda to foster a culture of accountability and servant leadership.\n\nMnangagwa and Chiwenga have shared a tumultuous political relationship since the military-assisted transition that brought Mnangagwa to power in 2017.\n\nChiwenga, who played a pivotal role in that transition, has grown increasingly influential, with his allies occupying key government and security positions.\n\nObservers note that Chiwengas loyalists have become emboldened, with their defiance of Mnangagwas directives interpreted as challenging his grip on power.\n\n",

            "content": "By Showbiz Reporter |Breaking News: Winky Ds HICC Drama Sparks Debate Over SDA Churchs Role\n\nHarare, Zimbabwe  The fallout from Winky Ds reported exclusion from performing at the Harare International Conference Centre (HICC) has ignited a fierce public debate, with Advocate Thabani Mpofu and UK-based lawyer Brighton Mutebuka exchanging sharp opinions over the Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) Churchs alleged involvement.\n\nWinky D, a celebrated Zimbabwean musician known for his politically charged lyrics, was scheduled to perform at the HICC on December 31. Reports suggest the event was abruptly canceled due to pressure allegedly linked to the SDA Church, which owns the venue. Advocate Thabani Mpofu, a staunch defender of the church, has vehemently denied the allegations, branding them as completely false.\n\nThe SDA church is a reputable Christian denomination that promotes peace and harmony, not conflict or manipulation, Mpofu asserted in his statement. It is committed to spreading love, kindness, and understanding and holds these values so close to its teachings and actions. The allegation is the very antithesis of the churchs thrust, which strives to maintain a good reputation and promote positive values.\n\nMpofu, affectionately known as Advocate Fulcrum, dismissed claims linking the church to political interference, emphasizing that the SDA does not engage in fighting for turf with a secular artist.\n\nHowever, UK-based lawyer Brighton Mutebuka has challenged Mpofus defense, arguing that the political climate in Zimbabwe makes it plausible for influential figures, including business tycoon Kudakwashe Tagwirei, to exert pressure on institutions like the SDA Church.\n\nMutebuka cited Tagwireis close ties to President Emmerson Mnangagwa as a potential factor in the HICC controversy. No single sector in Zimbabwe is beyond EDs overbearing reach or tentacles. The SDA is no exception, he said.\n\nHe further elaborated: The digital and evidential footprint is highly significant. While the SDA Church is dear to you, the bright-line approach cant be sustained in this context. There are too many grey areas, and the allegation cannot be discounted. Secularism is as important as religion in objective terms. It covers atheists and is a fundamental right.\n\nMutebuka urged Mpofu to separate his personal commitment to the SDA Church from its susceptibility to external influence, particularly given the controversy surrounding Tagwireis involvement with the church.\n\nThis is a messy situation, Mutebuka concluded. Theres a lot about Tagwirei thats in the public domain. Its enough to make it plausible for him to use his power and influence to dislodge Winky Ds booking to placate ED and his regime.\n\nThe dispute has sparked widespread public debate over the intersection of religion, politics, and artistic expression in Zimbabwe. Many have called for greater transparency regarding the circumstances surrounding Winky Ds canceled performance, while others have defended the SDA Churchs integrity.\n\nFor now, Winky Ds fans are left disappointed as the artist, known for his fearless critique of social and political issues, remains at the center of this brewing controversy. As the debate rages on, the country watches closely to see whether this high-profile clash will lead to accountability or further division.\n\n",

            "content": "Road safety is not just a matter of government policy or law enforcement; it is a collective responsibility that falls on every individual.\n\nWhile authorities play a crucial role in setting rules, providing infrastructure, and enforcing traffic laws, the safety of our roads depends on how each of us behaves behind the wheel or as a pedestrian.\n\nIts easy to assume that road safety is solely the responsibility of lawmakers and authorities, but the reality is that every person who uses the road contributes to creating a safer or more dangerous environment. Drivers, passengers, cyclists, and even pedestrians all have a part to play in ensuring that our roads remain safe for everyone.\n\nThe Importance of Safe Driving\n\nOne of the most significant contributors to road safety is the way we drive. Speeding, distracted driving, and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs are all actions that put not only the driver but also other road users at serious risk. Being aware of road conditions, following traffic signals, wearing seat belts, and respecting speed limits are some of the simplest yet most effective ways to avoid accidents.\n\nDriving safely involves more than just adhering to the lawit means being conscious of other drivers and pedestrians, maintaining a safe distance, and reacting calmly in emergency situations. The decision to drive responsibly can prevent countless accidents and save lives.\n\nPedestrians and Cyclists: Sharing the Road\n\nRoad safety isnt just about cars. Pedestrians and cyclists also need to be vigilant and responsible. Pedestrians should use crosswalks, avoid jaywalking, and stay alert when walking near busy streets. Similarly, cyclists must wear helmets, signal their turns, and follow traffic rules to minimize the risk of accidents.\n\nEveryone, regardless of how they travel, plays a part in maintaining road safety. Drivers must be aware of pedestrians and cyclists, while pedestrians and cyclists should respect the rules designed to protect them.\n\nA Culture of Responsibility\n\nBuilding a culture of road safety starts with individuals taking responsibility for their actions. Whether you are driving, cycling, or walking, your behavior on the road can have a direct impact on others. Everyone should recognize that safety is not just a matter of personal well-being but also the well-being of everyone else on the road.\n\nConclusion\n\nRoad safety is not only about laws and regulations; it is about creating a culture where everyone takes responsibility for their actions. To ensure that roads are safe for everyone, we must all participatedrivers, pedestrians, cyclists, and law enforcement. The message is simple: Drive safely, save lives. Lets make road safety a shared priority for all.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

This is contrary to claims of starvation and suffering of citizens.\n\nThe food relief programme has been a huge success, Mutsvangwa said. He continued to praise the Presidents efforts, referring to the assistance provided to vulnerable groups across the country.\n\nMutsvangwas comments, however, have been met with skepticism by many, as the economic situation in Zimbabwe remains dire.\n\nRising inflation, unemployment, and food insecurity continue to affect a large portion of the population.\n\nMany citizens report that they are still struggling to access basic necessities, with food prices soaring and the cost of living escalating.\n\nIn his address, Mutsvangwa also took aim at critics of the governments relief efforts, saying, Naysayers have been put to shame. We thank the President for his resilience in the face of such challenges.\n\nHowever, opposition leaders and civil society groups have rejected Mutsvangwas claims, pointing out that while food aid may have reached some, large portions of the population remain unaddressed. These critics argue that the scale of the food crisis in Zimbabwe is far greater than the government admits, with the vast majority of citizens still experiencing food insecurity.\n\nAs the political rhetoric continues, many Zimbabweans are left wondering if the governments promises can match the lived reality of a nation still struggling to recover from years of economic decline.\n\n",
