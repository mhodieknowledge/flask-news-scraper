            "content": "Speech by Venncio Mondlane  Friday Afternoon\n\nFellow citizens, comrades, and supporters,\n\nWe are gathered at a pivotal moment in our history, where the call for justice, democracy, and accountability grows louder each day. The events unfolding in our nation reveal a deliberate plan to manipulate the masses by creating fear and chaos. These tactics aim to distract us from the reality of the election results and to undermine our collective resolve.\n\nExposing the Manipulation\n\nIt is no coincidence that over 1,500 prisoners escaped from a maximum-security prison in Maputo shortly after the Constitutional Council announced the contested election results on December 23rd. This is not an isolated event; it is a calculated effort to destabilize our communities and shift attention away from the growing evidence of electoral fraud.\n\nWe have also seen security forces facilitating looting, as evidenced by videos of armored vehicles breaking walls to allow looters into stores. How can these same forces, so quick to disperse peaceful protesters with tear gas, stand idle or even enable such acts of chaos? The answer is clear: this is part of a broader strategy to create a climate of fear.\n\nFrelimos Diplomatic Isolation\n\nBy enabling the prison break and fostering unrest, Frelimo has shot themselves in the foot. Their actions have isolated them diplomatically. Major international playersthe United States, the United Kingdom, the European Unionhave yet to recognize the legitimacy of this regime. Even Portugal, after prematurely congratulating Frelimo, is reconsidering its position. This regime has lost credibility both domestically and abroad.\n\nA Clear Plan Forward\n\nAs we look ahead to Monday, I am calling for a partial shutdown. While I urge the informal sector to continue their work to sustain livelihoods, I encourage others to join this strategic act of defiance. This phase of our movement, which I am callingPonta de Lanaor Spearhead, marks the final push.\n\nThe new president is set to be sworn in around January 15th, but we will not relent. Protests will continue as we fight for the electoral truth and a government that reflects the will of the people.\n\nA Message to the International Community\n\nTo our international partners: Mozambique needs your attention and support. The manipulations, violence, and oppression we face are symptoms of a regime desperate to cling to power. Stand with us as we seek to restore democracy and build a just and prosperous nation.\n\nUnity and Determination\n\nLet us remain steadfast, united in our resolve. We are not intimidated by their tactics. We seek changenot for ourselves, but for the future of our children and the generations to come. We will expose the lies, confront the injustices, and demand accountability.\n\nThe journey is far from over, but together, we will prevail.\n\nThank you, and may justice and democracy guide us forward.\n\n",

Mutasa stated:\n\nI regret to inform you that, following the integrity checks required for candidacy in the upcoming Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) Executive Committee elections, it has been determined that you have not met the necessary criteria to proceed as a candidate.\n\nSpecifically, this pertains to the late submission of your name change on the O and A Level certificates.\n\nWe understand that this news may be disappointing. The integrity checks are a crucial part of our commitment to upholding the highest standards of ethical conduct within our organization. This process is essential for fostering trust and transparency in our operations and ensuring that all candidates meet the rigorous standards expected by the football community.\n\nWe encourage you to remain engaged with ZIFA and continue to contribute to the development of football in Zimbabwe. Should you have any questions regarding the integrity check process or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nShould you wish to appeal, please kindly note the process is outlined in Article 85(9) of the ZIFA Statutes.\n\nThank you for your understanding and continued support.\n\n",

He ignores everything that they are seeing in between and says, when we get to this futuristic year, we will be what? He says what? He says 2030, we will still be what? He says 2030 we will still be there?,he asked.\n\nThere were no further the details after this; but the thorny talk was seen as the beginning of the end for Mnangagwa as the video went viral on social media networks.

            "content": "Seatbelts are one of the most vital safety features in any vehicle, designed to protect drivers and passengers in the event of an accident. Much like airbags, seatbelts serve as a life-saving measure, reducing the risk of injury or death during a collision.\n\nDespite the proven effectiveness of seatbelts in preventing serious injuries, many people still choose not to wear them while driving or riding in a vehicle. This reckless behavior significantly increases the risk of harm in the event of an accident.\n\nWhen a person fails to wear a seatbelt, they are at a much higher risk of being ejected from the vehicle during a crash, which can be fatal. Even at low speeds, the force of a collision can cause severe injuries to unrestrained individuals. Seatbelts keep occupants securely in their seats, preventing them from being thrown around inside the vehicle or from being ejected through the windshield.\n\nThe benefits of seatbelt use are undeniable. Studies consistently show that seatbelts reduce the risk of fatal injury by 45% for drivers and 60% for passengers.\n\nFor children, the risk is even more significant, as seatbelts, when used correctly, can prevent serious injury or death.\n\nWhile seatbelts are an essential safety feature, their effectiveness depends on consistent and correct usage.\n\nSimply having a seatbelt in the car is not enough; everyone in the vehicle, regardless of age or seat position, should always buckle up. It is crucial for drivers to set an example and encourage all passengers to wear their seatbelts.\n\nIn conclusion, the importance of seatbelts cannot be overstated. They are a simple yet effective tool that saves lives and prevents serious injuries. Those who choose not to wear them are putting themselves in great danger. Buckling up should always be a top priority for anyone behind the wheel or riding as a passenger.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nOn Thursday, President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe released a festive statement wishing citizens a joyful holiday season. However, his message has sparked criticism, with many observing that it may come across as out of touch with the ongoing economic hardships facing the country.\n\nIn his message, Mnangagwa stated:\n\nOn behalf of my family, the Government, and myself, I wish Merry Christmas wishes to all Zimbabweans, at home and abroad. May this season bring joy, peace, and unity, and may 2025 be a year of renewed hope and prosperity for our beloved Zimbabwe.\n\nThe presidents words, which he shared via social media, included hashtags such as #MerryChristmas and #Prosperous2025, promoting a hopeful outlook for the year ahead.\n\nHowever, many Zimbabweans have taken issue with the timing and tone of the message, given the dire economic conditions many are enduring. The country continues to face soaring inflation, widespread poverty, and severe shortages of basic goods, including food and fuel. Observers argue that such a statement may feel insensitive, as many citizens are struggling to make ends meet during the festive season.\n\nOne critic remarked, While we appreciate the festive greetings, it is difficult to celebrate when the majority of the population is grappling with poverty and inflation. A message of hope rings hollow when people are unable to afford basic necessities.\n\nThe presidents words of unity and prosperity for 2025 have also been met with skepticism, with some questioning whether the governments policies will be able to deliver on these promises. Zimbabwe has faced a long history of economic challenges, and many are wary of political statements that lack tangible results.\n\nHow can one wish prosperity when millions of Zimbabweans are unemployed and struggling to survive? The government needs to address the core issues affecting peoples lives, said a local activist.\n\nWhile Mnangagwas message sought to inspire hope and peace, the reality of widespread suffering has made it difficult for many to accept such well-wishing as sincere. As Zimbabwe enters the holiday season, the divide between the governments optimistic rhetoric and the harsh reality for ordinary citizens remains painfully evident.\n\n",
