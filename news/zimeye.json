            "content": "In todays fast-paced world, we often overlook one of the simplest yet most effective ways to safeguard our lives and the lives of those we care about: wearing helmets and seat belts.\n\nWhether youre cycling, riding a motorcycle, or simply driving a car, these preventive measures play a crucial role in reducing the risk of injuries and fatalities in the event of an accident.\n\nHelmets: A Life-Saving Accessory\n\nHelmets are an essential piece of safety equipment for anyone participating in activities such as biking, motorcycling, or even skateboarding. They are designed to protect the most vital part of your bodyyour brain. In fact, research has shown that wearing a helmet significantly reduces the risk of head injury and death. According to studies, wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle can reduce the risk of a head injury by up to 70%. For motorcyclists, this number is just as impressive, with helmets reducing the risk of a fatal head injury by 37%.\n\nDespite the overwhelming evidence, many people still neglect to wear helmets, often due to inconvenience, discomfort, or a sense of invincibility. The truth is, accidents can happen in the blink of an eye, and in those moments, a helmet can be the difference between life and death.\n\nSeat Belts: A Simple Yet Effective Safety Tool\n\nSeat belts are just as crucial for protecting yourself while driving or riding in a car. In the United States alone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that seat belts save thousands of lives each year. Wearing a seat belt reduces the risk of fatal injury to front-seat passengers by 45%, and it lowers the risk of moderate to severe injuries by 50%.\n\nWhile many people might think theyre safe driving short distances or at low speeds, the reality is that most car accidents happen within a few miles of home or at low speeds. Even minor accidents can result in serious injuries or fatalities if youre not wearing a seat belt. Unfortunately, many people still neglect to buckle up, putting themselves and their passengers at risk.\n\nBe Your Own Advocate\n\nOne of the most empowering actions you can take for yourself and your loved ones is to become your own advocate when it comes to safety. This means consistently wearing a helmet when engaging in activities like biking or motorcycling, and always buckling up before you start driving or riding in a car. Taking these precautions not only ensures your own well-being, but it also sets a positive example for your family and friends.\n\nMoreover, educating othersespecially children and teenagersabout the importance of wearing helmets and seat belts can have a lasting impact. Encourage your loved ones to adopt safe practices, and dont hesitate to speak up if you see someone not wearing their helmet or seat belt. By advocating for safety, you contribute to creating a culture of care, responsibility, and mutual protection.\n\nThe Power of Prevention\n\nIn life, there are many things we cannot control. Accidents, however, are one thing we can work to prevent. By wearing helmets and seat belts, you are taking proactive steps to protect yourself and your loved ones from preventable injuries and deaths. These simple actions dont just save livesthey also provide peace of mind.\n\nUltimately, the decision to wear a helmet or seat belt isnt just about following the law or avoiding finesits about being a responsible individual who values their life and the lives of others. Become your own advocate for safety, and inspire others to do the same. Protect yourself, protect your family, and together, lets make safety a priority.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nGeorge Foreman, one of the most iconic figures in boxing history, has passed away at the age of 76. Known as Big George in the ring, Foreman became a legend due to his remarkable career and unparalleled resilience in the sport of boxing. His journey from Olympic gold to heavyweight world champion, not once, but twice, cemented his place as one of the greatest fighters of all time.\n\nForemans career began with a bang in 1968 when he won Olympic gold in Mexico City. However, it was his professional journey that would truly define him. Foremans first taste of heavyweight glory came in 1973 when he claimed the WBC World Heavyweight title. But it was his infamous loss to Muhammad Ali in the 1974 Rumble in the Jungle that would become one of boxings defining moments. Despite this defeat, Foreman would go on to solidify his legacy.\n\nIn a remarkable turn of events, Foreman made an extraordinary comeback to the sport after a 10-year hiatus. In 1994, at the age of 45, he reclaimed the heavyweight title, becoming the oldest man in boxing history to do so. This achievement was a testament to his enduring power, strength, and determinationtraits that had defined him throughout his career.\n\nThroughout his boxing career, Foreman accumulated an incredible 76 wins, 68 of which were knockouts, nearly double the number of knockouts recorded by his great rival, Ali. His aggressive and formidable style earned him the respect of the boxing world, and his place in history was further solidified by his many legendary victories.\n\nHowever, Foremans post-boxing career proved just as lucrative and influential. After retiring from the ring in 1997, he entered the world of entrepreneurship. His decision to lend his name to the George Foreman Grill turned out to be a monumental one. The grill became a sensation, selling millions of units worldwide and making Foreman a fortune far beyond his boxing earnings. This savvy business move demonstrated the diverse talents of the man who was once only known for his powerful fists.\n\nGeorge Foreman leaves behind an indelible legacy both in and out of the ring. His achievements in boxing will never be forgotten, and his impact on popular culture through his post-boxing endeavors is equally significant. The sports world and fans everywhere mourn the loss of a true champion.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nAs hospitals across Zimbabwe face critical shortages of essential medications, Zanu PF has drawn attention for its lavish spending on party infrastructure, diverting public funds to build a 10,000-seater conference center, lodges, and new administrative offices in Masvingo.\n\nThe announcement came on Monday when Zanu PF Masvingo province revealed plans to construct a massive conference facility, complete with new offices and accommodation for party officials.\n\nThe extravagant project is being funded by state resources, despite the countrys growing healthcare crisis. The building materials for the project were donated by President Emmerson Mnangagwa through his special advisor, Dr. Paul Tungwarara, with the official handover conducted by Honorable Ezra Chadzamira, the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Masvingo Province.\n\nThe donation of construction materials600 bags of cement, 10,000 bricks, roofing materials, window panes, and door frameswas delivered to the Zanu PF Masvingo provincial leadership, including Provincial Chairman Senator Robson Mavhenyengwa. The new administrative offices and conference center, to be located in Clovelly along the Masvingo-Bulawayo road, will serve as a hub for major Zanu PF events and will reportedly improve the partys organizational capacity.\n\nDespite the governments continuous promises to prioritize healthcare, Zimbabwes hospitals are grappling with severe shortages of critical medicines and medical supplies. Doctors and healthcare workers have repeatedly raised alarm about the dire situation, with many essential drugs unavailable, and patients suffering as a result.\n\nIn stark contrast, the ruling partys commitment to constructing lavish infrastructure at the expense of public health is raising concerns over the misuse of state funds.\n\nNational Secretary for Finance of the Children of Zimbabwe Liberation War Veterans Association (CZLWVA), Muteuri Madovi, emphasized the importance of the new conference center in advancing the partys administrative needs, claiming it will enhance party organs and affiliates administration.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the priority given to building a grand political facility highlights the governments misplaced priorities, especially while basic public services such as healthcare continue to decline.\n\nThe controversial use of state funds for party infrastructure comes at a time when Zimbabweans are struggling to access even the most basic healthcare services.\n\nHospitals are frequently turning away patients due to a lack of medications for conditions such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, and high blood pressure. Many Zimbabweans are now forced to seek private healthcare or cross borders to neighboring countries for treatments that should be available locally.\n\nThe construction of the Zanu PF conference center and offices in Masvingo raises questions about the accountability of government spending and the ethics of using public resources to serve the interests of a political party.\n\nWhile Zanu PF celebrates its new administrative capabilities, citizens continue to endure the devastating effects of an underfunded and overburdened healthcare system.\n\nIn the face of mounting criticism, Zanu PFs focus on party development, while public health collapses, reflects a disturbing trend of prioritizing political gain over the well-being of ordinary Zimbabweans. With the ruling partys priorities under scrutiny, many are left wondering how much longer the government can justify such lavish spending while essential services fall into disarray.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nA public feud involving hip-hop musician Holy Ten, fellow artist Mudiwa Hood, and controversial preacher Uebert Angel has sparked chaos within Zanu PF, Zimbabwes ruling party.\n\nHoly Ten recently accused both Mudiwa Hood and Uebert Angel of pretending to be religious, fueling tensions between the figures and intensifying a public dispute.\n\nReports suggest that Holy Ten is currently on the run, with police actively searching for him in connection to a cyberbullying case involving well-known Zimbabwean podcaster and former Star FM DJ, Ollah 7.\n\nOllah 7, whose real name is Owen Madondo, turned himself in to the polices Law and Order section on Saturday afternoon after being summoned for questioning.\n\nHe faces allegations related to improper use of social media, particularly his online exchanges with Mudiwa Hood.\n\nHoly Tens involvement in the case has only added to his growing scrutiny, particularly regarding his close ties with Zanu PF.\n\nThe musician, who has faced backlash for his perceived alignment with political elites, has sparked controversy in recent years for publicly praising Zanu PF leaders and accepting financial and promotional support from individuals linked to the ruling party.\n\nCritics argue that this association undermines his earlier image as a champion of the youth and marginalized communities.\n\nAs the feud unfolds, there are accusations that Holy Ten may be receiving protection from legal consequences due to his political connections.\n\nThis has raised concerns about selective law enforcement in Zimbabwe, with critics arguing that the government is using its power to shield political allies while targeting independent voices.\n\nOllah 7s arrest is seen in the broader context of state repression against journalists and independent media figures in Zimbabwe. His detention follows the recent arrest of Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) journalist Blessed Mhlanga, who is also facing charges related to the misuse of digital platforms.\n\nThis wave of arrests highlights a growing crackdown on free speech, with the government accused of using laws like the Cyber and Data Protection Act to silence critics.\n\nSince the 2017 coup that brought President Emmerson Mnangagwa to power, the administration has intensified efforts to suppress dissent and independent journalism. Critics argue that Zimbabwe is sliding back into authoritarianism, with press freedom increasingly under threat.\n\nOllah 7s arrest has also raised questions about political motivations, particularly given his recent hints at securing an exclusive interview with President Mnangagwa. The arrest could signal the governments discomfort with independent media gaining access to power structures.\n\nAccording to Zanu PF sources, the ongoing clash between Holy Ten and Uebert Angel is likely to result in further internal chaos within the party. Both figures are said to have significant backing from party heavyweights, adding complexity to the situation.\n\nBoth Uebert Angel and Mudiwa Hood have long been controversial figures, often accused of hiding behind the church while secretly engaging in illicit business deals. Their actions have sparked public debate about the intersection of religion, business, and politics, further intensifying the ongoing tensions within Zanu PF.\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri\n\nNorton Member of Parliament, Honourable Richard Tsvangirai, made a stunning political statement on Friday, claiming that the ongoing infighting within Zanu PF has little to no impact on the daily suffering faced by ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nRichard Tsvangirai, son of the late Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) founding President Morgan Tsvangirai, is no stranger to political commentary. However, his latest remarks have sent ripples across the political landscape, as he sharply critiqued Zanu PFs internal struggles, suggesting they are detached from the needs of the people.\n\nIt feels hard to believe that any faction within ZANU-PF has what it takes to introduce the necessary reforms to transform the institution of governance, which is autocratic in nature, said Tsvangirai. He continued by emphasizing that, despite the ongoing battles for power within Zanu PF, the partys leadership lacks the political will required to address the countrys broader challenges. Any leader who lacks the political will to strengthen democratic institutions is not the right person to lead this country, he added.\n\nTsvangirais statement points to a broader critique of Zimbabwes political environment, which he argues has failed to evolve. I dont think that whoever succeeds in the factional battles within ZANU-PF will have the political will to spearhead the reforms needed to transform democratic institutions, he said, effectively dismissing the idea that Zanu PFs internal disputes will bring any meaningful change for the citizens who are struggling in the face of economic challenges.\n\nThe political tension within Zanu PF has been further exacerbated by the remarks of war veteran Blessed Geza, who has publicly rejected President Emmerson Mnangagwas attempts to extend his rule beyond the constitutional limits. Geza has dismissed Mnangagwas aspirations for a third term, asserting that such ambitions would be an attempt to undermine the Constitution.\n\nIn response, hardline members of Zanu PF have fiercely criticized Geza, accusing him of attempting to destabilize the party and even overthrow Mnangagwa. However, Geza has remained resolute, insisting that the Zanu PF leader should step down immediately for the betterment of the country. Mnangagwa must step down with immediate effect, Geza firmly stated, underscoring his belief that the current leadership is failing the people of Zimbabwe.\n\nAs the political turmoil within Zanu PF continues, Richard Tsvangirais comments underscore the growing frustration among opposition voices. His remarks reflect a sentiment that many Zimbabweans sharethat the political elite, locked in factional battles, are more concerned with their power struggles than with addressing the countrys crippling economic and social issues. Tsvangirais bold assertion that the current system is incapable of meaningful reform echoes the concerns of many who see the infighting as yet another distraction from the pressing issues facing the nation.\n\n",

If we had a wider coverage area, we could have disseminated life-saving information before the dam burst, potentially reducing the damage by half,said Madhuku.\n\nChipingesvulnerability is far from over. Authorities have sounded alarm bells oversix more damsin the districtthat arenow at risk of collapse, threatening over600 families downstream.\n\nTheDistrict Development Coordinator, William Mashava, who also chairs theChipinge Civil Protection Unit (CPU), has warned thatNew Castle Dam, which spansLots 8, 11, and 12, is on the verge of giving way.\n\nDespite this looming catastrophe, thegovernmentsresponse has been sluggish.\n\nA site visit by government officials, including theMinister of State for Manicaland, the Deputy Minister for Local Government, and the Deputy Minister for Transport and Infrastructure Development, took place48 hours after the disaster, a move critics, including Madhuku, have dismissed as merely cosmetic.\n\nThe 2019Cyclone Idai disaster, which killed hundreds and displaced thousands in Chipinge and Chimanimani, was a wake-up call for authorities to prioritize disaster preparedness.\n\nAs part of the response, theBroadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ)licensedtwo community radio stationsVemuganga FM and Ndau FMpartly to serve as early warning systems for climate disasters.\n\nHowever, Madhuku points out that these stations are stillwoefullyunderutilised, operating withina combined reach of only 10kmless than1% of Chipingedistrictstotal land area of 5,220km.\n\nCoordination between theBAZ, Transmedia, and disaster response agencieshas been poor, leaving criticalgaps inpublic information and awareness.\n\nMadhuku insists thatexpanding the coverage and upgrading the equipment of community radio stations like Vemuganga FMis not just about enhancing communicationit is aboutsaving lives.\n\nIf local community radio stationsare givenmodern equipment and their broadcasting range is increased, Chipinge will have a better chance at responding to disasters effectively. Thelevel ofpanic, misinformation, and disinformation we handled during this dam burst was unnecessaryproperly functioning community radios could have prevented it,he said.\n\nThe recent disaster has alsoexposed weaknesses in coordination among key stakeholders, includingprivate dam owners, the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA), Chipinge Rural District Council (RDC), the Civil Protection Unit (CPU), and civic organizations.\n\nMadhuku stresses that these actors must be aligned tostrengthen monitoring, improve disaster awareness, and create an effective early warning system.\n\n",

Yet, beneath the praise lies a troubling reality:\n\nshe has hijacked state resources to fund lavish events and glorify herself under the guise of tourism promotion.\n\nHer latest obsession? Cooking sadza at high-profile events using government fundsactivities disguised as cultural preservation while burning through state resources.\n\nShe has become more visible than Mnangagwas own deputies, securing elite privileges, including exclusive use of the Zimbabwe House, a state residence meant for the Prime Minister.\n\nWith a battalion of state security at her disposal and endless public appearances, Auxillia Mnangagwas influence is expanding unchecked.\n\n",
