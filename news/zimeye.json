But some people are saying these food hampers are being used to buy loyalty.\n\nThe source added that the donations were not random but targeted.\n\nThey gave mealie meal and other groceries to be distributed in Ward 4, the insider claimed. This is meant to ensure the structures remain strong despite the losses in 2023.\n\nAnother community member questioned the timing of the handouts.\n\nWhy now? the resident asked. People need development, not mealie meal when election seasons come closer.\n\nThe development comes as critics continue to accuse Zanu PF of using food aid as a political tool, especially in rural areas. However, party members insist they are merely following President Mnangagwas directive.\n\nThe President told Shadow MPs to keep serving the people, the source said. This is what they are doing.\n\nWhile the political motivations remain a subject of debate, the food donations were reportedly received by local structures in Ward 4 and are set to be distributed in the coming days.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent  Controversial businessman and Zanu PF figure Kuda Tagwirei has once again raised eyebrows after making bold pledges at the partys Harare Province meeting over the weekend, fueling concerns about growing authoritarian ambitions.\n\nObservers say Tagwirei, widely seen as President Emmerson Mnangagwas blue-eyed boy, is using his wealth and influence to consolidate power within the ruling party, raising fears about the marginalization of opposition voices in the capital.\n\nZanu PF online activist Cleopas Mukungunugwa lauded Tagwireis rise in a statement, describing him as a principal in the partys leadership matrix. Mukungunugwa added that one of Tagwireis non-negotiable priorities is to ensure that Harare becomes a Zanu PF stronghold.\n\nThe time for mere talk is over. Politics is done, its not just discussed, Mukungunugwa said. The deliberative whispers of the past have given way to the decisive action of the present, and in this new era, Cde Tagwirei is now solidly in the Zanu PF leadership matrix.\n\nCritics, however, warn that the rhetoric amounts to a thinly veiled threat to opposition parties and independent political activity in Harare. This is a billionaire using his wealth to manipulate politics and suppress dissent, said political analyst Tendai Moyo. Its not about delivering servicesits about creating a political monopoly in the capital.\n\nTagwirei and his supporters insist the pledges, which include promises to restore municipal services such as electricity, water, and garbage collection, are genuine efforts to improve governance. Mukungunugwa said, This means the lights will stay on. The water will flow. The piles of uncollected garbage will vanish from the streets. It means creating an environment where commerce thrives not by accident, but by design.\n\nYet residents of Harare remain sceptical. Weve heard promises before, but the city remains in chaos, said one local business owner. This is not about service delivery; its about intimidation and political control.\n\nAs Tagwirei cements his position within Zanu PFs central structures, critics fear that Harare could see increased political pressure, marginalizing opposition parties and reducing civic space. The capital is being turned into a laboratory for power consolidation, Moyo added. If unchecked, this could stifle democracy in one of Zimbabwes most important urban centers.\n\nThe unfolding developments suggest that Zanu PF, backed by influential figures like Tagwirei, is focused not only on service delivery but also on reshaping the political landscape of Harare to ensure dominance in upcoming elections.\n\n",

Bereaved families bank details shared via WhatsApp, not verified by any institution. Contributions sent to personal bank accounts, bypassing UK charity regulations.\n\nA former MNBF treasurer described the operation as an unregulated cash game run under the guise of community support.Once the money is sent, theres no audit, no oversight  its gone, they said.\n\n Violations of UK Law\n\nUnder the UK Charities Act 2011 and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules, any organisation collecting public funds for welfare or mutual aid purposes must: Maintain transparent financial records, Have registered trustees, and File for oversight if annual turnover exceeds 5,000.\n\nMNBF has failed to meet all three conditions, yet continues to circulate payment appeals across diaspora WhatsApp groups.\n\n ZimEyes Ongoing Investigation\n\nZimEye calls on UK authorities  including the Charity Commission, FCA, and Metropolitan Police Economic Crime Unit  to open a full audit into MNBFs activities, freeze implicated accounts, and interview its management.\n\nMeanwhile, the suspicious duplicate payment remains unexplained  a silent testament to the growing rot in a fund once marketed as a compassionate lifeline for Zimbabwean families in mourning.\n\n Editors Call to Action\n\nHave you paid into MNBF or been denied assistance?If you are a UK-based Zimbabwean affected by the Matabeleland National Bereavement Fund, contact the ZimEye Investigations Desk confidentially at[emailprotected].\n\nTheyve turned grief into a business, one victim said.You help others bury their loved ones, but when your time comes  youre abandoned.\n\n",

This is not about serving the people, it is about consolidating power and ignoring the will of the electorate, said political analyst Tendai Moyo.\n\nThe 2030 VaMnangagwa vanenge vachitonga slogan, now backed by Tagwirei, has been criticized as a disturbing sign that the party is preparing to extend Mnangagwas rule indefinitely, sidelining proper succession planning and accountability.\n\nResidents in Harare expressed concern over the messaging. It is frightening that they are already talking about 2030 as if elections dont matter, said one local. This is about keeping the same people in power while ordinary Zimbabweans continue to suffer.\n\nPolitical commentators argue that such endorsements highlight the symbiotic relationship between businessmen and political elites, where wealth is used to secure influence rather than genuine development. Tagwireis support is more about self-interest than national progress, Moyo added.\n\nAs Zanu PF pushes for term extensions, critics warn that the party is eroding democratic institutions and normalizing a culture where loyalty to the ruling elite is valued above the needs of the people.\n\n",
