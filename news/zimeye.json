            "content": "By A Correspondent  Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe  Drivers and pedestrians have been urged not to use or wear headphones on the roads, as maintaining alert hearing is vital to avoiding accidents.\n\nThe warning was issued by Officer Commanding Harare Province, Commissioner Maxwell Chikunguru, during the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims at Manyame Bridge, a known accident blackspot along Seke Road, on Monday.\n\nComm Chikunguru highlighted mobile phone use as a growing contributor to road accidents and specifically addressed kombi drivers about an ongoing police operation targeting unroadworthy vehicles and those stopping at undesignated points.\n\nToday we join the world in remembering road traffic victims whose lives were tragically lost in preventable crashes, Comm Chikunguru said. I commend Chief Seke for organising this event which brings together the police and all like-minded stakeholders. This memorial gathering allows us to unite in reflection on the lives lost and remember the families forever affected along this stretch of Seke Road.\n\nHe added: We honour the men, women and children whose lives were cut short, and we remember survivors living with pain, trauma and long-term injuries. On behalf of the Zimbabwe Republic Police, I extend heartfelt condolences to all bereaved families. We mourn with you, empathise with your pain, and stand in solidarity with you. While no words can erase your loss, today affirms that your loved ones are not forgotten.\n\nComm Chikunguru stressed that the event was a call for unity, reflection, and responsibility. Road safety is not abstract; it is about preserving human life. The tragedies here have been linked to speeding, reckless overtaking, drunk driving and unroadworthy vehicles, behaviours that can be prevented. We must act collectively to halt further loss of life.\n\nHe announced that police would intensify enforcement along Seke Road, increase visibility, and conduct awareness campaigns. However, enforcement alone is not enough. We appeal to all road users to adopt life-saving measures: maintain safe speeds, especially near bus stops, residential areas and curves; overtake only when the road is clear; never drink and drive or use mobile phones behind the wheel.\n\nComm Chikunguru urged drivers and pedestrians to ensure vehicles are roadworthy with functional brakes, tyres, and lights, to use designated crossing points, and for passengers to speak up against dangerous driving. Every life lost was a valued family member. Every safe journey begins with discipline, patience and respect for others on the road, he said.\n\nTogether with community leaders, transport operators, traditional leaders and the public, we can transform this blackspot from a place of grief into a symbol of collective responsibility and hope. We remain committed to supporting road safety and sanity. Let us honour the memories of those we lost by choosing safer roads and actions. Together we can prevent the next tragedy.\n\nChief Seke, whose birth name is Stanley Chimanikire, criticised traffic police for allowing unroadworthy vehicles through checkpoints. I feel compelled to fight this menace that claims lives along Seke Road. It is our communitys reputation that is at stake, tainted by reckless drivers who disregard the sanctity of life. We feel humiliated and traumatised whenever we pass this spot where 17 lives were lost. We plan to engage bereaved families to consider erecting a statue to honour the deceased.\n\nMadzibaba Simbarashe Nengomasha added that the church is praying for an end to road traffic accidents caused by drug-abusing drivers. Many drivers are using drugs leading to accidents. Substance abuse is an enemy on the roads and in our homes, causing untold suffering for parents of those involved, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Reason Wafawarova\n\nThere are clowns, there are loud clowns, and then there is Temba Mliswa  Zimbabwes unrivalled national public-address system; a man who has turned shouting into a political career and conspiracy-theorising into a gym routine. If ever Zimbabwe needed proof that a pigs bladder hanging on a stick can rise to ZANU PF Provincial Chairperson and even become a Member of Parliament, Mliswas biography stands as the definitive case study.\n\nOn paper, Mliswas political CV is impressive  a polished catalogue of posts held, committees chaired, and power accidentally stumbled upon. But just beneath that shimmering surface lies a trail of academic rubble, failed sporting dreams, and the unmistakable odour of manufactured relevance. For a man who markets himself as a former rugby great, his sporting record reads less like Jonah Lomu and more like played a few games with the under-15s at Prince Edward.\n\nTHE FALL, THE RISE, AND THE NORTON ACCIDENT\n\nAfter losing the political powers thrust upon him by ZANU PF  the same powers he now pretends he earned by merit  Mliswa surprised everyone by doing something for himself. In 2018, he entered the Norton race as an independent and defeated Chris Mutsvangwa, another walking pigs bladder imposed on the constituency by ZANU PFs patronage machinery. It was a contest of the unwanted, the politically recyclable, the men whose names voters circled only because abstaining felt too polite.\n\nMliswa came out on top. And for a brief moment, Zimbabwe thought perhaps, just perhaps, the man had turned a corner. But 2023 arrived with the predictability of a Harare pothole. Mliswa lost his Norton seat. The ZANU PF machinery rolled back in and packed him off to Shurugwi  where, in classic Mliswa fashion, he overthrew a village head and installed himself as the new emperor of a rural ward that never hired him.\n\nUnable to adjust to life away from Parliaments microphones, Mliswa took to Twitter (or X for the pretentious) like a drowning man grabbing at straws. He picked fights with anyone whose name trends longer than five minutes, fashioning himself as Zimbabwes anti-corruption prophet, an uncle to the First Family, and the countrys unofficial National Security Advisor  depending on which donor he met the previous night.\n\nENTER TAGWIREI: THE CONTRACTOR OF LOUD VOICES\n\nThen came the Tagwirei-Chiwenga feud, the civil war inside ZANU PFs succession race  a war fought through whispers, proxies, paid tweets, and memoranda that read like failed spy novels.\n\nMliswa, who never misses a chance to insert himself into national crises, picked a side early. He defended Tagwirei with the zeal of a paid influencer and condemned Chiwenga with the enthusiasm of a man anticipating a reward. And sure enough, he was noticed. Hired. Equipped. Financially lubricated.\n\nOvernight, Mliswa became the official attack dog tasked with eliminating the Chiwenga factor from the succession matrix.\n\nThe timing was perfect: Chiwenga had confronted Mnangagwa and the Politburo with a dossier so detailed, so forensic, and so incriminating that it made Command Agriculture look like petty theft. The document spelled out exactly how Tagwirei and a cartel linked to the First Family siphoned billions through state projects. No one refuted it. Not even those whose names featured prominently.\n\nMnangagwas response  that he was ready to resign but only if procedure was followed  said everything. The Politburos refusal to discuss the dossier without knowing its author said even more.\n\nChiwenga owned the document. And with that admission, Tagwirei needed a counteroffensive.\n\nEnter Mliswa, fresh from a night meeting in Borrowdale, armed with a script so poorly written it would embarrass a Nollywood extra.\n\nPHASE ONE: THE EXPOS THAT EXPOSED ONLY THE AUTHOR\n\nMliswa launched his attack with the enthusiasm of a man who had just received an ECOCASH message titled Transfer from Sakunda.\n\nChiwenga was corrupt, he declared. Chiwenga was a beneficiary of Wicknell Chivayos stolen money, he thundered. Chiwenga had plundered diamonds in the DRC and Marange, he bellowed. But in the same breath, Chiwenga was so broke he had begged Chivayo to fund his wedding.\n\nEven ZBC sound engineers would have demanded a retake.\n\nThe contradictions were too large to ignore. The entire expos collapsed under its own nonsense. But Mliswa, a man incapable of shame, promised a Phase Two.\n\nZimbabwe braced for fireworks. What came was a wet matchstick.\n\nPHASE TWO: THE LAND SCANDAL THAT WASNT\n\nTwo days ago, Mliswa re-emerged, panting with self-importance, to announce the next big revelation. And what did we get?\n\nA Harare City Council land dispute. One among the thousands that litter the capitals urban landscape  all caused by ZANU PFs interference and its breeding of land barons like rabbits.\n\nThe story:\n\nA piece of land allegedly repossessed by the council from politically linked land barons, supposedly meant for the Catholic Church, with Mliswa speculating  not proving  that Chiwenga was the shadowy beneficiary.\n\nChiwenga had not grabbed the land. Had not applied for the land. Had not even visited the land.But this, Mliswa declared, was corruption.\n\nHe even roped in George Charamba, rebranding the Presidential Spokesperson as Chiwengas personal spokesman, as though the country was watching a poorly scripted sitcom.\n\nWHAT MLISWA WONT TALK ABOUT\n\nFor all his loudness, Mliswa has never once confronted the real corruption scandals highlighted in Chiwengas dossier:\n\nthe Command Agriculture heist,\n\nthe dodgy tenders,\n\nthe Kuvimba Mining House labyrinth,\n\nthe Sakunda hijacking of Noczim,\n\nthe First Familys dealings with known criminals,\n\nand the billions moved in quiet, untraceable loops.\n\nNot a word from Mliswa. Not a whisper. Not even one of his famous sweating monologues.\n\nFor the US$300,000 Tagwirei reportedly paid him, the return on investment is catastrophically low. Even the most nave oligarch would demand a refund.\n\nTHE HIRED TROLL WHO ADMITS HE KNOWS HE IS WRONG\n\nBut perhaps the most telling moment was Mliswas own pre-emptive confession. He told viewers:\n\nI know you will scold and attack me, but I dont care.\n\nThat is not confidence.That is not courage.That is a man who knows he is on the wrong side of history but must soldier on because the cheque already cleared.\n\nThis is not activism. It is not patriotism. It is mercenary politics  loud, clumsy, and embarrassingly cheap.\n\nA COUNTRY DESERVES BETTER THAN HIRED MEGAPHONES\n\nZimbabwes political discourse has been hijacked by men who shout for a living. Men who mistake volume for wisdom. Men who measure patriotism by the number of retweets from anonymous burner accounts.\n\nAnd Mliswa stands at the front of this choir  a hired megaphone serving those who can afford to switch him on.\n\nHis attacks on Chiwenga are not ideological. They are not patriotic. They are not principled. They are not even logical.\n\nThey are paid-for noise.\n\nZimbabwe deserves better.\n\nThe public deserves truth.\n\nAnd history will record Mliswa not as a reformist, not as a whistleblower, not even as a political maverick  but as a loud, clumsy troll hired to fight battles whose logic he himself cannot defend.\n\nThe tragedy is not that he shouts.\n\nThe tragedy is that for a price, he will shout for anyone.\n\n",

He wrote: The COS route is no longer viable. This will likely lead to an increase in individuals falsely claiming abduction in an attempt to seek asylum elsewhere. We should anticipate a rise in such narratives and understand the strategic reasoning behind them.\n\nMangwana emphasized that reported abductions should not automatically be taken at face value and must be carefully investigated to determine their authenticity.\n\nHuman rights activists based in Harare have strongly criticized Mangwanas statement, describing it as reckless and demeaning. One activist said: Such comments undermine real cases of abduction and harassment in Zimbabwe. Suggesting that citizens fabricate such incidents casts doubt on the genuine suffering of vulnerable people.\n\nAnother activist added: This kind of rhetoric shifts blame onto victims and absolves authorities from addressing the root causes of insecurity and human rights abuses in the country.\n\nThe statement has sparked outrage on social media, with many accusing the government of dismissing serious human rights concerns while unfairly targeting citizens who seek safety and justice abroad.\n\n",

Yet in Binga the service delivery, infrastructure, opportunities remain severely lacking, said Cumanzala.\n\nHe called on government to expedite the upgrading of the Cross-Dete/ Binga road and other feeder roads to open the district for tourism, markets and investment.\n\nThe provision of reliable energy and water is important. Communities should be provided with backup power for pump stations, ZINWA and ZETDC should coordinate and provide reliable supply and ensure communities are not forced to fetch water from hazardous sources, he said.\n\nRecognise the unique vulnerabilities of riverine/fisher folk communities and climate-sensitive agriculture; support sustainable fisheries, livestock insurance, drought-resilient crops, and market access for local products such as baskets, fish, tourism services.\n\nIn his address to parliament, Cumanzala detailed a series of critical challenges facing the community. Residents reportedly endure weeks without reliable water, at times forced to draw water directly from the crocodile-infested Zambezi River. Deplorable road conditions are constraining tourism and market access, while traditional livelihoods like fishing and livestock farming are under severe strain from overfishing and drought.\n\nCumanzala also raised the alarm on social issues, noting that children are being withdrawn from school due to hunger and poverty, leading to a rise in child labour.\n\nThe MP called for a direct and immediate translation of national strategy into concrete deliverables.\n\nHe presented a list of specific demands for the government, including investing in education with better school infrastructure, teachers, and vocational training linked to the local economy.\n\nCumanzala also called on government to guarantee and ensure transparent community benefits from mining and tourism ventures in the region.\n\nHe concluded by emphasizing that for the people of Binga, the national vision is more than policyit is a matter of survival, dignity and opportunity.\n\nThe vision set by the President is laudable, he said. But vision becomes meaningful only when translated into bricks, roads, pumps, schools, jobs and dignified lives.\n\n",

Cases are not won by police statements on social media. The investigating team must take a leaf from their homicide counterparts.\n\nHe warned that ongoing postponements would be prejudicial to our clients.\n\nRubayas criticism comes days after the Zimbabwe Republic Police issued a public statement warning of alleged attempts to bribe investigators and derail the Magaya cases  a statement the defence says improperly places their clients in a prejudicial spotlight.\n\nSTATE: Investigations Still Underway\n\nProsecutors insisted that more time was needed to consolidate witness statements, update dockets, and finalise aspects of parallel investigations involving Magaya, his wife, and associated corporate entities.\n\nMagaya is jointly charged with Tendai in the CR 720/12/23 docket, which details alleged misrepresentations involving land supposedly available in New Donnington, Chishawasha, Bulawayo, Mutare, and other areas.\n\nMAGAYA ARRIVES HOLDING WIFES HAND\n\nMagaya, dressed in a grey suit, arrived at court hand-in-hand with his wife Tendai, accompanied by a small entourage of PHD officials.Photographs captured by Munashe Chokodza show the couple walking calmly into the courthouse despite the growing pressure surrounding their cases.\n\nTheir demeanour appeared notably composed, even as critics and complainants continue to demand accountability over the multi-year allegations.\n\nBACKGROUND: A CASE HEADING TOWARD TRIAL\n\nMagaya is currently out on US$3,000 High Court bail granted last week by Justice Gibson Mandaza.He remains under strict conditions, including: Surrendering his passport Reporting weekly to police Avoiding contact with complainants\n\nHis wife Tendai, and companies Plannet Africa and Yadah Connect, also remain central to the fraud docket, which alleges that over US$50,000, R190,000 and other amounts were collected from church members for non-existent projects.\n\nNEXT COURT SESSION: 9 DECEMBER\n\nThe matter has officially been rolled over to 9 December, when the court is expected to set a firm trial date  provided the State has completed its investigations.\n\nZimEye will continue providing live updates as the case progresses, with additional analysis from the investigative files that have been tracked since 2014.\n\n",
