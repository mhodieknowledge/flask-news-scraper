            "content": "By A Correspondent Sex scandal Yesteryear US televangelist Jimmy Swaggart has died.\n\nHe was 90.\n\nSwaggart was one of the United States most influential televangelists during the 1980s until a scandal involving a prostitute brought his soaring career to an abrupt halt.\n\nJimmy Swaggart Ministries confirmed his death via Facebook. His family expressed gratitude to the medical staff at Baton Rouge General Medical Center in Louisiana. The cause of death was not disclosed.\n\nAt the height of his career as a fiery Pentecostal preacher, Swaggart reached an estimated global audience of 200 million. That influence came crashing down in 1988 when he tearfully confessed to his congregation, without offering specifics, that he had sinnedfollowing revelations of his involvement with a sex worker.\n\nBorn on March 15, 1935, in the racially segregated backwaters of Ferriday, Louisiana, Swaggart grew up alongside two cousins who also rose to famerock n roll legend Jerry Lee Lewis and country music star Mickey Gilley.\n\nImmersed from an early age in Pentecostalisms fervent, emotional style of worship, Swaggart claimed to have received a divine calling at age nine: You will preach my Gospel all over the world. You will even take it to Africa, he said God told him.\n\nHe left school early, doing manual labor before marrying 15-year-old Frances Anderson at age 17. Inspired by the rise of revivalists like Oral Roberts, Swaggart began preaching on street corners and in rural churches. By 1969, he had launchedThe Camp Meeting Hourradio show, and by 1973, his sermons were airing on television, catapulting him to stardom.\n\nA staunch conservative, Swaggart often stirred controversy with his attacks on Catholics, Jews, and the LGBTQ+ community. He became a leading figure in the rise of the U.S. religious right, using his platform to push for public policy grounded in biblical doctrine. His international crusades took him to Latin America and even apartheid-era South Africa, where he drew crowds in places like Soweto.\n\nThe New York Times reported that his 1988 scandal was exposed by rival preacher Marvin Gorman, who supplied compromising photos and claimed Swaggart had falsely accused him of adultery.\n\nIn February that year, a sobbing Swaggart stood before the congregation at his Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, begging for forgiveness. However, the Assemblies of God defrocked him after he refused a proposed suspension.\n\nFurther damage to his reputation came in 1991 when California police found him with another prostitute following a traffic stop. Though he initially announced plans to step down, he later told his congregation, The Lord told me its flat none of your business.\n\nSwaggart, who had once railed against pornography and immorality, drew fresh backlash in 2004 for declaring on his TV show that if a gay man approached him sexually, Im going to kill him and tell God he died  a remark he later dismissed as a joke.\n\nAlthough his influence waned after the scandals, his ministry endured in a diminished form. He continued to appear on cable TV occasionally, with his son Donnie playing a central role in keeping the ministry alive.\n\nSwaggart is survived by his wife Frances and their son Donnie.\n\nSource  Reuters\n\n",

It was an issue that was troubling us as a club, considering how much we want to improve our fortunes in the second half of the season.\n\nChikomo added that the club can now fully participate in the mid-season transfer window and hopes this marks a turning point for the struggling side.\n\nThe news comes as a welcome boost for Dynamos, who have endured a disappointing first half of the campaign. Sitting 17th on the league table with just 15 points from 17 matches, the Glamour Boys are hoping to reinforce their squad in a bid to escape the relegation zone.\n\n",

He was brought before Gweru Regional Magistrate Christopher Maturure and remanded pending a bail hearing that took place on Monday, June 30, 2025.\n\nAlthough he has since been released on US$200 bail, the gravity of the allegations and his high-ranking position have drawn widespread attention. Human rights activists are calling for a transparent judicial process to ensure justice is served.\n\nCourt documents detail the alleged events, which unfolded on the morning of Monday, June 23, 2025. Around 7:00 AM, Manyadze reportedly phoned the young maid, who informed him that her employer  his girlfriend  was not at home. She also advised that there was no reason for him to visit.\n\nIgnoring the warning, the accused is said to have arrived at the residence at around 10:00 AM, entering the premises after the complainant opened the gate. Once inside, Manyadze allegedly instructed the maid to follow him into the house.\n\nIt is alleged that inside the kitchen, where there was a bed, he sat down and called the complainant to come closer. When she refused, he allegedly grabbed her by the waist and began fondling her, despite her resistance. He is then said to have thrown her onto the bed, forcibly undressed her, and raped her without protection.\n\nAfter the assault, the accused reportedly told the complainant to get dressed and see him out of the property.\n\nThe incident came to light after the maid confided in her twin sister in Bulawayo, who encouraged her to report it. Her mother later took the matter to the police, leading to Manyadzes arrest.\n\nThe case remains under investigation, with the public closely monitoring developments due to the sensitive nature of the allegations and the accuseds powerful position.\n\n",

However, it emerged last week that the training would feature sessions led by officials from the ruling Zanu PFs Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology and the Central Intelligence Organisation, prompting a fierce backlash from lawyers and civil society.\n\nIn a memorandum dated July 2 and addressed to all heads of courts, the JSC Secretary confirmed the cancellation of the workshop, citing ongoing consultations with the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC). The memo stated that the judiciary was re-evaluating the training content to ensure it aligns with the constitutional requirement of judicial independence.\n\nThe decision has been taken to cancel the IRBM training, with the view of coming up with a program content administered by the judiciary and suitable to the requirement for Judicial Independence, the JSC wrote.\n\nThe about-turn follows threats by the Law Society of Zimbabwe and independent lawyers to stage a protest march against what they described as an unconstitutional attempt to politicise the judiciary.\n\nCritics argued that exposing judges to Zanu PF ideological training would severely compromise their impartiality and independence. Some judges were reportedly also uncomfortable with the planned programme.\n\nThe JSC said new arrangements would be communicated in due course and instructed court heads to inform all judges of the cancellation.\n\nThe cancellation is being viewed as a rare victory for the legal fraternity and civic groups who had accused the government of attempting to erode judicial independence through ideological indoctrination.\n\n",

It was disheartening that the situation was allowed to deteriorate, he said.\n\nWhile calling for urgent corrective measures, the President fell short of taking direct responsibility for the crisis that has unfolded under his administration. Instead, he challenged all stakeholders  including government departments, the private sector, and ordinary citizens  to work together in rebuilding the sector.\n\nMore is expected from stakeholders. Blame-shifting will not get us anywhere. We must learn from our shortcomings and work hand in hand, as the public sector, private sector and individuals, to build our country, Mnangagwa said.\n\nDespite leading a government long criticised for underfunding health services, the Presidents remarks signal a recognition of the deep-rooted dysfunction. Zimbabwes healthcare system has been plagued by crumbling infrastructure, chronic drug shortages, underpaid staff, and an exodus of skilled medical professionals.\n\nCritics argue that mere calls for cooperation are insufficient without bold policy shifts and increased budgetary commitments from the very top. As one health union leader put it off record, We dont need statements  we need action. The government is the biggest stakeholder and must lead with serious investment, not rhetoric.\n\nMnangagwas comments may be viewed as a rare public concession, but many believe the time for words is long past. With hospitals in crisis and ordinary citizens bearing the brunt, pressure continues to mount for tangible reform in Zimbabwes healthcare system.\n\n",
