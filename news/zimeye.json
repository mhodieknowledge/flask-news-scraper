            "content": "By A Correspondent| Simon Muzviyo, the managing director of City Parking, is under scrutiny for alleged financial mismanagement, personal enrichment, and authorizing failed foreign investments that reportedly cost theHarare CityCouncil (HCC) over US$4 million.\n\nCity Parking is tasked with managing parking spaces inHarares central business district (CBD). However, Muzviyo has claimed the company operates as a private entity and is not subject to oversight under the Public Finance Management Act.\n\nDuring his testimony before the Justice Cheda-led Commission of Inquiry investigating the operations of HCC since 2017, Muzviyo admitted to entering a joint venture with a Ghanaian company in 2015. Under the agreement, City Parking held a 45% stake and anticipated returns of US$1 million after purchasing equipment. However, the deal fell apart, resulting in significant losses for the council.\n\nMuzviyo disclosed that he spent a month in Accra at City Parkings expense but failed to account for his daily allowances for accommodation, meals, and other expenses when questioned by evidence leader Thabani Mpofu.\n\nOther questionable foreign investments approved by Muzviyo, without proper due diligence, involved ventures in South Africa and Zambia, with cumulative losses amounting to approximately US$4 million.\n\nInsiders allege that Muzviyos actions went unchecked due to the influence of his second wife, Tsitsi Samapundo, who manages the councils Business Development Unit (BDU). The BDU oversees entities such as City Parking, Rufaro Marketing, and Harare Quarry.\n\nAn ex-employee of the department claimed Samapundo helped conceal irregularities, including the lack of proper accounting, undocumented contracts, and the manipulation of both ZWL and USD accounts.\n\nSamapundos position allowed her to shield Muzviyo from accountability, the source alleged. Her failure to question his actions made her complicit in the maladministration.\n\nAttempts to contact Samapundo for comment were unsuccessful, and she reportedly sent proxies to threaten media outlets with legal action. Similarly, Muzviyo could not be reached, with sources claiming he is vacationing in the United Kingdom.\n\nCity Parkings alleged financial mismanagement and internal corruption further fuel concerns about systemic issues at the Harare City Council. These challenges have hindered the citys efforts to achieve its ambitious goal of becoming a world-class city by 2025.\n\n",

            "content": "The controversial Forever Associates Zimbabwe (FAZ), a shadowy organization condemned by SADC electoral monitors for its role in violent coercion during Zimbabwes 2023 elections, has come forward to deny that ZANU PF Youth League deputy chair Lewis Matutus X (formerly Twitter) account was hacked. This follows the circulation of a cryptic post attributed to Matutu that warned of impending violence and unrest across Zimbabwe.\n\nMatutus now-deleted post read:\n\nThree nights ago, I had a very scary dream about our motherland Zimbabwe, chaos and violence all over the country with people killing each other in a merciless manner like wild animals. Men of cloth, please pray for our country Zimbabwe. I rarely miss when it comes to dreams, and this particular dream makes me nervous and shaken, for it shall come to pass. As I received it, sharing makes me feel relieved and vindicated.\n\nThe post caused a firestorm on social media, with many interpreting it as a direct acknowledgment of the growing discontent within Zimbabwe under President Emmerson Mnangagwas leadership.\n\nIn response, FAZ tweeted:\n\nHis X account was hacked. Be factual.\n\nHowever, the explanation was met with widespread skepticism, as the cryptic post aligns with increasing reports of unrest and dissatisfaction among citizens over Mnangagwas perceived stranglehold on power. Critics of FAZ argue that the denial is part of an attempt to silence dissent within ZANU PF ranks or control the narrative surrounding Matutus alarming statement.\n\nZimEye questioned FAZs claim in a tweet:\n\nAre you not the hacker, @faz_trust, who has hacked the X account after Lewis Matutus announcement of this Mnangagwa-Armageddon message that indicates the end of the ZANU PF leader is nigh?\n\nFAZ, already under fire for its involvement in violence and electoral manipulation, faces growing scrutiny over its role in this latest controversy. The organization was previously condemned by SADC observers for undermining democratic processes in Zimbabwe, and its involvement in this incident has reignited debate over its shadowy tactics.\n\nThis development comes at a time of heightened tensions in Zimbabwe, with signs of internal factional battles within ZANU PF and widespread public dissatisfaction. As the fallout from this incident continues, many are left questioning the stability of Mnangagwas leadership and the increasing cracks within the ruling party. ZimEye\n\n",

The systematic sidelining of Chiwengas allies is a clear message that dissent will not be tolerated.\n\nThe growing divide within Zanu PF has raised concerns about the potential for further destabilization.\n\nAnalysts caution that the removal of Chiwengas military loyalists could embolden his faction to retaliate, with some suggesting the possibility of another coup.\n\nMnangagwas survival now hinges on parliamentary backing and a neutral military, political analyst Mutodi remarked. But if Chiwengas camp feels sufficiently marginalized, they may challenge his legitimacy outright.\n\nWith Zanu PFs history of violent power struggles, the deepening conflict between the President and his Vice President threatens to plunge Zimbabwe into another period of uncertainty.\n\n",

            "content": "Emmerson Mnangagwas @CNN promise to step down in 2028, even if the people would love me to the heel, I will still go away | 2025 STATUS @ZANUPF_Official  @nickmangwana   @amanpourpic.twitter.com/BCXaeeXlQc\n\nMnangagwas Promise of Constitutional Adherence Cast in Doubt Amid Contradictory Actions.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwas recent pledge to step down in 2028, in accordance with Zimbabwes constitutional two-term limit, has come under scrutiny as recent actions and remarks suggest a lack of commitment to this promise. While speaking to CNNs Christiane Amanpour, Mnangagwa declared:\n\nWe have now limited the terms of presidencyjust two terms, five to five. If you are able to have two terms, then the maximum a person can remain in office is two terms. But beyond that, you know the Constitution forbids it Even if the people would love me to stay, I will still go away because I believe constitutionalism is important. In fact, you must give your people a chance to have other people come. Ten years is not a short period.\n\nHowever, this statement sharply contrasts with recent developments that suggest Mnangagwas commitment to constitutionalism may be performative rather than genuine. Critics point to the presidents political history, particularly the events of August 1, 2018, when the army was deployed to quash protests over disputed election results, leading to civilian deaths. This violent crackdown undermined Mnangagwas initial promises of democratic reform following Robert Mugabes ousting.\n\nMore recently, concerns have been amplified by a controversial gathering at Mnangagwas farm during his holiday, where he hosted opposition MPs. During this event, former ZANU-PF Information Minister Webster Shamu openly suggested disregarding constitutional term limits, saying:The children have wept, boss,a symbolic plea for Mnangagwa to remain in office beyond 2028. Mnangagwas failure to challenge or rebuke this statement has raised alarm bells among observers who fear he may not honor his pledge to step down.\n\nThese developments paint a contradictory picture. While Mnangagwa positions himself on the international stage as a champion of constitutionalism, his domestic political conduct tells a different story. Hosting opposition MPs and permitting unchecked statements advocating a breach of constitutional limits suggest a strategy aimed at consolidating power, potentially laying the groundwork for a term extension.\n\nZimbabweans, having endured decades of authoritarian rule under Robert Mugabe, are acutely aware of the gap between political rhetoric and reality. Mnangagwas repeated emphasis on constitutional adherence will mean little without concrete action, such as publicly disavowing any calls for a third term and strengthening the independence of democratic institutions.\n\nAs 2028 approaches, the stakes are high. Mnangagwas credibility, and the future of Zimbabwes fragile democracy, rest on his willingness to match words with deeds. Until then, his promise remains overshadowed by actions that suggest a potential disregard for the very constitutionalism he claims to uphold.\n\n",

The case came to light after a mother who had given birth to a baby boy was handed a baby girl by hospital staff, sparking widespread concern and outrage.\n\nThe incident has prompted a formal investigation initiated by the Ministry of Health and Child Care, which is currently underway. Responding to the situation yesterday, the Ministrys Permanent Secretary, Dr. Aspect Maunganidze, expressed the Governments concern and assured the public that steps are being taken to address the matter.\n\nThe Ministry is aware of the unfortunate incident of baby swapping that occurred at United Bulawayo Hospitals and awaits the results of the investigation that we instructed the hospital to undertake, said Dr. Maunganidze.\n\nHe emphasized the need for a swift yet thorough investigation, while also recognizing the emotional sensitivities surrounding the matter. While we expect the investigation to be concluded expeditiously, we acknowledge the sensitivities around the matter. Parallel to the investigative process, we have instructed the institution to assist with counselling all affected parties (including the staff), reorient or refresh our staff on the standard operating procedures during and after delivery, and reinforce the importance of good moral and ethical practice, added Dr. Maunganidze.\n\nThe affected mother, who has chosen to remain anonymous for ethical reasons, initially raised concerns with the hospital after being informed by a nurse that she had delivered a baby girl via Cesarean Section. The nurse attributed the mix-up to potential confusion caused by the mother being under sedation during the procedure.\n\nHowever, the mother maintained that she had delivered a baby boy and resorted to DNA testing to confirm her claims. The tests were conducted at a private DNA laboratory in Bulawayo and the National University of Science and Technology (NUST), providing the evidence needed to support her case.\n\nThe Government has assured the public that measures will be implemented to prevent similar incidents in the future. These include reinforcing standard operating procedures for maternity care, providing ethical training for healthcare staff, and offering psychological support to those affected by the incident.\n\nThis case has raised serious questions about the hospitals protocols during and after childbirth and highlighted the need for improved safeguards to protect the integrity of maternal and neonatal care in public health institutions. The Ministry has called for patience from the public as the investigation proceeds and has reiterated its commitment to transparency and accountability in addressing the matter.\n\n",

He wrote:\n\nGet ready for the return of Mutapa, The day of his resurgence is now marked on the calendar. Let us reform our constitution, transitioning from a republic to a kingdom. No more elections  instead, let Mutapa reign supreme, forever. ED is the rightful heir to Mutapas throne.\n\nHis comments have ignited a fierce debate on social media, with many questioning whether such an idea is in the best interest of the country. Zivhus call for the total abolition of elections and the establishment of a monarchy under Mnangagwa has drawn widespread criticism, as critics argue that it undermines democratic principles.\n\nBy proposing a system where Mnangagwa would rule indefinitely, Zivhus comments seem to challenge Zimbabwes constitution, which establishes the country as a republic with regular elections. The proposal to ditch elections has raised concerns among those who value democratic processes and the right of citizens to choose their leaders.\n\nSupporters of Zivhus view, however, argue that a more centralized form of governance could bring stability and long-term leadership to Zimbabwe, avoiding the disruptions often associated with frequent elections. But critics are quick to point out the risks of absolute power, with some warning of the potential for corruption and abuse of authority if power remains unchecked.\n\nPolitical analysts have condemned the idea, emphasizing that any push to abolish elections would be detrimental to the nations progress. Zimbabwe has experienced significant political turmoil in the past, and many believe that the path to a prosperous future lies in strengthening democratic institutions, not dismantling them.\n\nIn light of Zivhus controversial statement, the question remains: Should Zimbabwe abandon elections and embrace an unchallenged, perpetual rule under Mnangagwa, or is it crucial to uphold the democratic values enshrined in the countrys constitution?\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear  Zivhus remarks have reignited conversations about Zimbabwes political future and the importance of elections in ensuring a fair and accountable government.\n\n",
