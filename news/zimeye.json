            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nLast Maengahama, a former political prisoner, has celebrated the recent abolition of the death penalty in Zimbabwe, calling it a major step forward for the country. In a powerful statement, Maengahama expressed his personal relief and approval of the governments decision to end capital punishment.\n\nThis is a huge relief for me personally, said Maengahama, who once served as a councillor for the Movement for Democratic Change. As someone who narrowly escaped the hangmans noose, I could have been an innocent person wrongfully condemned. Since my release, I have devoted myself to advocating for the abolition of the death penalty.\n\nThe governments announcement on Friday, which revealed the removal of the death penalty from Zimbabwes justice system, was met with widespread praise, particularly from human rights organizations. Maengahama, among the most vocal supporters of the decision, continued, I wholeheartedly welcome the abolition of the death penalty in Zimbabwe. This is a long-overdue step toward creating a more just and humane society.\n\nHis comments reflect the sentiments of many who have campaigned tirelessly for the end of capital punishment in the country. For Maengahama, this victory represents not only a personal triumph but also a symbol of the strength and resilience in the fight against systemic injustice.\n\n",

            "content": "ByCrime and Courts ReporterRetired Police Commissioner-General (CG) Godwin Matanga has publicly addressed his retirement, shedding light on howhe was removed from office by President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nMatanga retired at the end of last year and officially handed over to Deputy Commissioner-General (DCG) Stephen Mutamba during a ceremony in Harare on Friday amid reports he had resisted leaving office.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Matanga dismissed speculation surrounding his exit:\n\nIn the same manner, may I also take this opportunity to clarify an incorrect positionthat has beenpeddled in the media recentlypertaining tomy retirement. Ladies and gentlemen, listen carefully: I wasproperlyserved by the President of Zimbabwe, His Excellency Dr. Mnangagwa,at a timewhen my retirement was due.\n\nIam so content with the contribution and service I gave to the country in pursuit of national goals and aspirations. Suffice to say, the bar to modernize the police service is relatively high in view of resource constraints, skills flight, and crippling sanctions we have endured for decades, among other challenges.\n\nMatanga expressed confidence in his successor, saying:\n\nIam comfortable to pass the baton to Cde Stephen Mutamba, whom I have been with in the trenches for many years. I have no doubt in his capacity to steer the ship going forward.\n\nIn October, Mnangagwa dismissed the head of the Zimbabwe RepublicPolices(ZRP) paramilitary Support Unit, with reports suggesting the move was a forced retirement.\n\nTwo deputies from the unitwere also reassignedto ZRP headquarters in Harare.\n\nInsiders alleged these changes stemmed from power struggles within Zanu PF, where police operations conflicted with the interests ofMnangagwaspolitical allies.\n\nAppointed in 2018 after RobertMugabesouster in the 2017 military coup,Matangastenure has been contentious.\n\nSources suggest he couldbe reassignedto a diplomatic post.\n\nThe Support Unit, nicknamed theBlack Boots,isheadquartered at Chikurubi and operates in multiple districts, including Fairbridge (Bulawayo), Buchwa (Zvishavane), and Changadzi.\n\nInitially tasked with crowd control, disaster response, border patrol, and high-profile security, the unit under Matanga became increasinglymilitarised, effectively serving as a paramilitary arm of Zanu PF.\n\nTheBlack Bootswere frequently deployed to suppress protests and intimidate opposition, particularly during elections.\n\nAs dissent grew under the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the Support Unit gained infamy for its heavy-handed tactics against opposition supporters, students, and civil society.\n\nWhen Mnangagwa assumed power in 2017, he sidelined the police, whose loyalty hadbeen closely tiedto Mugabe.\n\nFollowing the disputed 2018 election, Mnangagwa deployed the military to suppress opposition protests in Harare, resulting in the deaths of at least six unarmed civilians.\n\nThismarked a dramatic escalation in civilian repression, drawing comparisons to the Gukurahundi massacres of the 1980s.\n\nWhile Matanga portrayed his retirement as amicable, his legacy remains intertwined with the complex power struggles and repressive tactics.\n\n",
