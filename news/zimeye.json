            "content": "By Business Reporter-Zimbabwe is losing up to 40% of its gold revenue to smuggling syndicates, Mines and Mining Development Minister Winston Chitando has revealedconfirming long-standing allegations of systemic looting raised in high-profile international investigations.\n\nSpeaking at the 2025 First Quarter Gold Mobilisation Workshop held in Harare on Wednesday, Chitando said illicit trade in gold continues to pose a serious threat to Zimbabwes economic recovery, despite improved deliveries to the states gold-buying agencies.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge, however, the significant challenges that continue to face our gold mining sector, Chitando said. Foremost among these are illicit activities and the ongoing issue of gold smuggling. Due to its inherent nature as a high-value and low-volume commodity, gold is particularly susceptible to leakages to various international markets.\n\nThis public acknowledgement by a senior government official lends credence to a 2023 investigative documentary series byAl Jazeera, titledGold Mafia, in which ZimEye largely contributed to, which exposed elaborate gold smuggling and money laundering networks operating with impunity in Zimbabwe. The investigation, based on undercover footage and leaked documents, linked several gold smugglers to individuals within President Emmerson Mnangagwas inner circle, including diplomats, senior clergy, and politically connected businessmen.\n\nTheGold Mafiaexpos revealed that Zimbabwean gold was being moved illicitly to international marketsparticularly the United Arab Emirates and South Africathrough sophisticated networks involving fake invoices, diplomatic cover, and shell companies. Among the central figures implicated were self-styled prophet Uebert Angel, Zimbabwean presidential envoy and ambassador-at-large, and business mogul Simon Rudland, whose role in these schemes stirred intense local and global criticism.\n\nThe extent of Zimbabwes gold losses is staggering. A 2020 report by the International Crisis Group estimated that the country loses about US$1.5 billion annually to gold smugglingequivalent to 22.4 tonnes a year or approximately 1.87 tonnes every month. If current gold pricesreported by BullionVault Ltd to be around US$3,338.19 per ounceare applied, this means Zimbabwe could have forfeited around US$660 million in just the first quarter of 2025 alone due to smuggling.\n\nDespite these losses, Zimbabwe recorded gold export earnings of US$755.24 million in the first quarter of 2025, a significant increase from US$385.13 million during the same period in 2024, according to the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZimStat). Yet experts suggest these figures still fall far short of what the country could earn if all gold was sold through formal channels.\n\nChitando noted that total gold deliveries for the first quarter reached 8.5 tonnes, surpassing the quarterly target of 7 tonnes. He attributed much of this progress to the small-scale mining sector, which consistently contributes around 60% to Zimbabwes gold output.\n\nIn January, February and March 2025, small-scale miners delivered 2.27 tonnes, 1.64 tonnes and 1.86 tonnes respectively, averaging 68% of the total monthly production, Chitando said. This consistent performance underscores the effectiveness of our efforts to formalise and empower this pivotal industry.\n\nThe minister reaffirmed the governments commitment to supporting artisanal miners through training, formalisation, and improved access to fair markets. However, observers say real progress will depend on political will to dismantle entrenched smuggling cartels and ensure accountability for those implicated in the looting.\n\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs has previously estimated that Zimbabwe loses at least US$100 million monthly to gold smugglingan issue that has persisted despite various attempts to increase transparency and regulatory oversight.\n\nAnalysts and civil society organisations continue to call for an independent inquiry into theGold Mafiarevelations and prosecution of those involved. Without this, critics argue, Zimbabwes gold sector risks becoming a permanent tool for elite enrichment and international money laundering.\n\n",

A contractor assigned to overhaul the playing surface has attempted to reassure the public, outlining steps aimed at improving the pitchs drainage system and general condition.\n\nWe are currently focused on reconstructing the substructure, which includes proper drainage channels to ensure water flows away quickly during rains. Once the base is stable, new turf will be installed to meet international standards, said the contractor during a site update.\n\nHowever, football analysts and fans remain skeptical, citing a lack of visible progress and clear timelines.\n\nIts taking too long. Weve heard similar promises before, yet nothing substantial has changed, said one local football expert. The pace is disappointing, and its unfair to clubs and fans who rely on the stadium for major fixtures.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) has previously faced sanctions and international scrutiny over the condition of the stadium, which has led to national teams being forced to host matches abroad. With the refurbishment now in the spotlight, there is renewed pressure on authorities to deliver tangible improvements.\n\nFor now, the once-mighty stadium continues to bear the weight of expectationsand skepticism.\n\n",

It is clear to me that this is an attempt to silence a dissenting political perspective.\n\nVisibly frustrated, Malema revealed that he had been waiting at OR Tambo International Airport, expecting resolution by mid-afternoon.We are currently at the OR airport, as we were promised that everything would be sorted by 15:30. Instead, we received a regret letter just four hours before our departure. This is unacceptable and spineless, he added.\n\nThe British High Commission has since issued an apology, acknowledging its failure to process the visa in time. However, the apology has done little to ease tensions, with the EFF calling it a transparent attempt to avoid accountability.\n\nThe visa denial has also sparked political reactions back home. While Malemas supporters have rallied behind him, AfriForuma civil rights group that has long clashed with the EFF leaderwelcomed the outcome, claiming it validates their international lobbying against Malema.\n\nPolitical analysts say the incident could strain diplomatic relations and fuel ongoing debates around freedom of speech, international gatekeeping, and the political treatment of African leaders on the global stage.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZimbabwes economic outlook continues to darken as inflationary pressures mount, prompting strong warnings from the countrys largest business lobby. The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has raised red flags over surging consumer prices and questioned the effectiveness of recent monetary reforms.\n\nAccording to the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZimStat), annual inflation for April 2025 stood at 85.7%, the first such figure released since the rollout of the ZiG currency in April 2024. However, economists and independent analysts argue the real inflation rate could be far higher.\n\nWe are deeply concerned about the trajectory inflation is taking, CZI stated in its latest Inflation and Currency Developments Update. Although the official figure is 85.7%, businesses on the ground are grappling with much steeper cost increases. Its affecting borrowing, pricing, and long-term planning.\n\nThe ZiGintroduced as a replacement for the collapsing Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL)was initially hailed as a stabilizing force. But just a year after its launch, its credibility is under strain. The ZiG was meant to restore confidence, the CZI noted. Instead, what were seeing are lingering effects of cumulative shocks from 2024, which have fueled persistent month-on-month inflation.\n\nRising inflation has also pushed up interest rates, compounding the challenges facing both industry and households. The cost of borrowing is now unsustainable for many companies, a CZI spokesperson said. This undermines production and ultimately impacts jobs and prices.\n\nDoubts over official inflation data are also growing. Bretton Woods institutions have reportedly requested access to ZimStats raw figures, expressing concern over the transparency and accuracy of the methods used.\n\nAs consumer purchasing power continues to erode, the private sector is urging authorities to urgently address economic fundamentals. Stabilization must go beyond currency changes, CZI emphasized. It requires consistent policy, transparency, and confidence-building measures.\n\nWith no clear relief in sight, both businesses and citizens are bracing for more difficult months ahead.\n\n",
