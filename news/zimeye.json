            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nTawanda Chirewa emerged as the hero for Zimbabwe after scoring a last-gasp equaliser to secure a 1-1 draw for the Warriors against Nigerias Super Eagles in their 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers Group C match in Uyo, Nigeria, on Tuesday.\n\nChirewa, who came on as a substitute in the final ten minutes, made an immediate impact, finding the back of the net in injury time to level the score. Earlier in the match, the Super Eagles had taken the lead through a header by Victor Osimhen in the 73rd minute, after a sustained period of pressure from the hosts.\n\nNigeria had dominated possession from the start, with Moses Simon and Osimhen creating early chances. However, Zimbabwes goalkeeper, Washington Arubi, was in fine form, making crucial saves to deny Nigeria the opening goal.\n\nThe Warriors largely relied on counter-attacks but were unable to threaten Nigerias goal during the first half. Despite creating multiple opportunities, Nigeria could not find a way through, and the first half ended goalless.\n\nThe second half saw Nigeria continue to press, firing shots from all angles, but Zimbabwe held firm until the 73rd minute. It was then that Osimhen broke the deadlock, heading in Simons cross to give the Super Eagles the lead.\n\nZimbabwe nearly responded immediately when Knowledge Musonas effort hit the crossbar just three minutes later. Terrence Dzvukamanja also had a chance but blasted his shot over the bar from the edge of the box.\n\nAs the match seemed to be slipping away from Zimbabwe, substitute Tawanda Maswanhise provided the assist for Chirewa, who calmly slotted home the equaliser in the dying seconds of the match, ensuring a dramatic 1-1 draw for the Warriors.\n\nWith the draw, Zimbabwe moved to four points in the group, while Nigeria remains on seven points. The match highlighted Chirewas potential and brought a sense of hope for Zimbabwes qualification campaign.\n\n",

            "content": "Sports Correspondent\n\nBafana Bafana coach Hugo Broos was left visibly frustrated after his team was denied access to train at the Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, ahead of their crucial 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifier Group C match against Benin. The match is set for Tuesday evening.\n\nThe South African team was blocked from using the stadium for a pre-match training session due to a scheduled game between Ivory Coast and Gambia on Monday night. The situation left Broos enraged, as he voiced his concerns during a press conference ahead of the game.\n\nFirst of all, I have to tell you that Im really not satisfied with the decision that we cant have a pre-match training in the stadium where the game takes place, Broos stated. I think this is a FIFA rule, that every team has the right to have a preliminary training before the game of 60 minutes in the stadium where you play, where the match takes place.\n\nThe coach further expressed his dissatisfaction, saying, Will that have an influence on the game? I dont know. But I know if, tomorrow after the game, Im not at the press conference, there will be a sanction, so we have to follow the rules, where are the rules now?\n\nBroos also pointed out the perceived unfairness in the situation, emphasizing that Benin, the opposition, had already trained at the stadium earlier due to their earlier arrival. You will tell me, Oh, its for both teams. I dont think so. I think Benin has already trained in that stadium because they were here sooner than we were.\n\nThe Bafana Bafana coach made it clear that he felt the situation was unfair, stating, So its all nice to say, Oh, follow the rules! Follow this! We have to follow everything, but we have the right to train in the stadium today where the match will take place, and we cant, and that is not honest and that is not correct.\n\nCurrently, Bafana Bafana are leading Group C with 10 points, while Benin sit in second place with 8 points.\n\n",

            "content": "When walking along the road, it is crucial to prioritize your safety by always walking facing oncoming vehicles. By doing so, you enhance your ability to see approaching traffic and stay aware of your surroundings, relying on both your sight and hearing to assess potential dangers. This simple precaution allows you to step aside or into a safe area, such as a ditch, if a vehicle unexpectedly loses control.\n\nWalking with your back to traffic, on the other hand, puts you in a vulnerable position. In such a scenario, you would have to rely only on your ears to detect a vehicle approaching from behind, which can be risky. A driver may unintentionally hit you without you being aware of their presence, especially if they are speeding or driving too close to the edge of the road.\n\nAdditionally, to avoid the dangers of distracted walking, always keep your focus on the road ahead rather than on your mobile phone. While listening to music or podcasts can make your walk more enjoyable, it can be risky if it prevents you from hearing nearby vehicles. A simple solution is to keep one earphone out, ensuring you can still listen for approaching cars while enjoying your walk.\n\nWhile walking facing oncoming traffic is generally the safest option, its important to note that some areas, such as hills or sharp curves, may make this practice dangerous. In such areas, visibility is limited, and both you and oncoming vehicles may not see each other until its too late. In these situations, walking on the opposite side of the road might be the safer choice.\n\nBy staying alert, walking facing traffic, and avoiding distractions, you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and ensure a safer walking experience.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

The necessary administrative measures will be taken to inform the President and the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) of the existence of the vacancy in line with section 39 (1) of the Electoral Act [Chapter 2:13].\n\nThe expulsion of Ganyiwa marks another chapter in the ongoing political infighting within Zimbabwes ruling party.\n\nWith his removal from Parliament, Zanu PF now faces the challenge of filling the vacant seat in Gutu East, which may lead to a by-election as stipulated by the Electoral Act.\n\n",

What if we had our own stadium? one fan asked, pondering the potential of the team if the necessary infrastructure were in place.\n\nThe question remains: when will the Zimbabwean government recognize the value of investing in sports and provide the Warriors with the stadiums they deserve?\n\nUntil that time comes, the Warriors will continue to fight on, representing Zimbabwe with pride and determination on international turf, even as the Mnangagwa regime fails to support them with the resources they need to succeed at home.\n\n",

I am calling on all Zimbabweans to join us in demanding accountability.\n\nThe economic hardships are too much to bear, and we will no longer stay silent.\n\nAs Gezas call for protests gains momentum, Zanu PF has moved to downplay the significance of the protests. Taurai Kandishaya, a Zanu PF youth league official, attempted to deflate the threat posed by Gezas planned demonstrations.\n\nGeza will be marching online, Zoom Demo. Saka iwewe washinga here kuuya panyama? Wadii wangoitawo Zoom Demo nhai shamwari? he quipped, dismissing the protests as an online event that wouldnt have a real-world impact.\n\nHowever, Kandishayas dismissal has not stopped the growing wave of support for Gezas cause.\n\nMany Zimbabweans, particularly those suffering under the current economic conditions, have pledged their support.\n\nTaurai Garwe, a local activist, declared: Tosangana mumastreet d*ko iwe Ed must go newe wacho, meaning that they will take to the streets to demand Mnangagwas resignation.\n\nOther citizens have also voiced their frustrations. A commenter identified as De Klerk added, Even ku Mozambique leadership yanga isipo. General Tongo was in Mozambique, referencing the challenges of leadership and governance within Zimbabwe and the region. Another individual, Shoko, expressed: Tichangomacha hazvititadzisi nhamo. Yakanyanya munyika vanodya vashoma, highlighting the extreme hardships that ordinary Zimbabweans are facing, with a small elite benefitting while the majority suffer.\n\nGezas call for protest is shaping up to be a significant moment in Zimbabwes political landscape, with mounting frustration among the populace against the governments inability to address the countrys economic woes.\n\nThe stage is set for March 31 to reveal whether this movement will gain substantial traction on the streets of Zimbabwe or whether Zanu PF will manage to quell the wave of discontent.\n\nTosangana nhasi manheru na 2030.

We have overcome disruptive elements that seek to hinder our progress.\n\nZANU PF is an unstoppable force, like an unstoppable train.\n\nThe declaration comes amid increasing political tension, particularly in light of recent calls for Mnangagwas resignation.\n\nWar veteran Blessed Geza has publicly demanded that Mnangagwa step down immediately, further escalating the pressure on the President.\n\nAdding to the political unrest, there are also protests scheduled for March 31, aimed at opposing Mnangagwas bid to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional limits.\n\nThese developments underscore the political challenges faced by the president and his party, even as Mnangagwa maintains a firm stance on the partys resilience and commitment to its goals.\n\nDespite these challenges, Mnangagwas speech at the Politburo reflects his unwavering confidence in ZANU PFs ability to push through any opposition. The presidents characterization of the party as an unstoppable train is seen as a rallying cry to strengthen the partys resolve in the face of growing dissent and pressure from opposition groups.\n\nAs the political landscape continues to evolve in Zimbabwe, all eyes will remain on ZANU PF and its leadership, with many questioning whether Mnangagwas assertion of invincibility can withstand the mounting internal and external challenges facing the party.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a heated exchange this week, Paul Tungwarara, President Emmerson Mnangagwas presidential investment advisor, lashed out at war veteran Blessed Geza and his supporters, defending the Presidents leadership and dismissing their online criticism as ineffective.\n\nTungwararas comments come amid rising discontent within certain factions of the Zimbabwean political landscape, with protests and calls for the Presidents resignation growing louder.\n\nTungwarara, speaking to reporters earlier this week, vehemently asserted that President Mnangagwa was delivering on his promises, contrary to the claims made by critics like Geza. We are walking the talk while some are busy making noise on social media, Tungwarara said. He accused Geza and others of relying on digital platforms to undermine the Presidents efforts, rather than engaging in meaningful, real-world change.\n\nThey are good at using WhatsApp and online activism to criticize President Mnangagwa, who is busy working on the ground to improve peoples lives, Tungwarara added.\n\nHis comments reflect the growing frustration within Zanu PF over the persistent online activism and the criticism that has surfaced in recent months, especially as some of the partys heavyweights struggle to manage the rising protests.\n\nMeanwhile, Blessed Geza, a prominent war veteran, has been vocal in his criticism of Mnangagwas leadership. Just days before Tungwararas comments, Geza made a public call for President Mnangagwa to resign, citing the governments failure to deliver on its promises and address the countrys economic challenges. Geza accused the President of not fulfilling his obligations to the people of Zimbabwe, arguing that his continued rule is detrimental to the nations future.\n\nMnangagwa has failed; he must resign, Geza stated in his address to the nation. The call has amplified tensions within the political elite, particularly as protests have intensified both in Zimbabwe and among the Zimbabwean diaspora in South Africa, where Geza has been active.\n\nThe exchange between Tungwarara and Geza is a microcosm of the mounting internal pressure within the ruling Zanu PF party. As protests over economic issues and governance grow, heavyweights within the party are facing increasing difficulty in balancing their allegiance to the President with the rising dissatisfaction among citizens.\n\nWhile Tungwarara defends Mnangagwas administration, the political climate suggests that divisions within Zanu PF are becoming harder to ignore, and the calls for reform, or even resignation, are likely to escalate in the coming months.\n\n",

Ecobank again refused to comply, maintaining that the corporate rescue order applied to Sinosteel Zimasco (Pvt) Ltd, not Zimasco (Pvt).\n\nIn response, Zimasco (Pvt) Ltd has urgently filed a High Court application to block the court order.\n\nThe company has also lodged formal complaints with the Judicial Service Commission regarding Justice Mambaras handling of the matter and with the Law Society of Zimbabwe against Manase & Manase and Kwande Legal Practitioners for alleged unethical conduct.\n\nSources say the Chinese embassy in Harare has expressed strong concern over the attempt to seize control of Zimasco (Pvt) Ltd, a key Chinese government investment. The Embassy wants the Government of Zimbabwe to protect the investment, in accordance with the Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement between China and Zimbabwe, a source said.\n\n",
