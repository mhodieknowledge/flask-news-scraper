            "content": "By Business Reporter WestProp Holdings this week, for the second consecutive year, took centre stage as themainline sponsorof the annualZimReal Property Investment Conference, a premier gathering that attracted over 300 participants, including property developers, owners, pension fund managers, bankers, and other industry professionals.\n\nThemedCementing Growth and Growing Value,the conference provided a platform to deliberate on the challenges and opportunities shaping Zimbabwes real estate sector.\n\nOpening the event,WestProp Holdings CEO Ken Sharpehighlighted stark realities confronting the sector. He noted that while real estate contributes about20% to global GDPand12% across Africa, Zimbabwes property market accounts for a mere2% of the countrys GDP. Even more concerning, he said, was that the states mortgage contribution stands atjust 0.04%, compared to125% in Switzerland.\n\nMeaningful growth cannot be achieved without unlocking capital, Sharpe stressed. Mortgages and long-term financing are the arteries of a functional property market. Without them, we build, but we do not grow. The absence of these instruments constrains not only developers, but also the dreams of ordinary Zimbabweans who aspire to own a home, a shop, or a piece of land.\n\nIn his closing remarks,WestProp Chairman Dr Michael Louisurged the industry to engage government in frank dialogue on the structural challenges undermining growth. He citedbureaucracy, infrastructure bottlenecks, policy inconsistencyparticularly around currency and exchange ratesas persistent barriersthat continue to erode investor confidence.\n\nIf we are serious about growth, these matters cannot remain at the fringes of policythey must be core agenda items, Dr Louis said. We cannot talk of cementing growth when the foundations are shifting beneath our feet.\n\nCalling for stronger collaboration, he added: Policymakers must walk with the real estate industrynot behind us, not in front of us, but beside us as true partners in progress. Stable currency policy, consistent land administration, and predictable legal frameworks must not be ambitionsthey must be the norm.\n\nDr Louis concluded by stressing that the sectors mission extends beyond constructing buildings. What we are doing is about laying strong foundationsfor families, for businesses, and for national pride. If we think long-term, act collaboratively, and lead with vision, we will not just participate in the futurewe will shape it.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nFormer South African President Jacob Zuma has called on African nations to ditch the US dollar and rally behind the BRICS alliance as an alternative route to economic freedom and stability.\n\nSpeaking at the 2025 UPSA Annual Leadership Lecture in Accra on Tuesday, August 19, Zuma said Africa could no longer afford to remain tied to Western financial systems that have historically disadvantaged the continent.\n\nAfrica needs to wake up and stop depending on systems that were designed to keep us poor, Zuma declared.\n\nBRICS is the future for Africa. It offers us an opportunity to rewrite the global economic rules in our favor.\n\nThe event, themedThe Geopolitics and Geo-Economics of De-dollarisation: BRICS Currency Strategy, Lessons for Africas Common Currency and Beyond, focused on the growing debate around abandoning the dollar in international trade and strengthening African economic integration.\n\nZuma, who was instrumental in expanding BRICS during his presidency, described the bloccomprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africaas a powerful tool for challenging global financial dominance. We have modelled our economies to serve other nations, yet the benefits have not been ours, he said. The dollar is oppressing everyone, let us create our own.\n\nHe also criticized decades of exploitation and dependency, arguing that Africas vast resources have not translated into real development. I do not think there is a continent that has suffered more than Africa, Zuma said. Its time to stand on our own.\n\nThe former president paid tribute to Ghanas role in the liberation struggle, hailing Dr. Kwame Nkrumah as a visionary who wanted Africa to lead its own destiny.\n\nEducation Minister Haruna Iddrisu praised UPSA for sparking dialogue on economic sovereignty, noting that these conversations are critical as Africa searches for independence beyond politics and into economics.\n\nUPSA Vice-Chancellor Prof. Kwaku Mensah Mawutor emphasized the importance of the lecture series in shaping thought leadership on issues that affect Africas future. This is not just an academic exercise, Prof. Mawutor said. Its about equipping our students and the wider society to champion Africas voice in the global arena.\n\nSince its inception in 2017, the UPSA Annual Leadership Lecture has hosted prominent figures, including former President John Agyekum Kufuor, Dr. Mohammed Ibn Chambas, and Otumfuo Osei Tutu II.\n\n",

The meeting underscored the critical role of water in advancing child health, education, nutrition, and protection, while also addressing the pressing challenges of climate change and water scarcity.\n\nDuring the engagement, Prof. Jiri highlighted the Ministrys mandate to coordinate all WASH activities nationwide through the National Action Committee. He outlined the robust structures already in place, including Rural WASH, Urban WASH, and Water Resources Management sub-committees, and commended UNICEF for its continued support in emergencies such as cholera outbreaks, as well as in information management through national dashboards that track sanitation and water supply across the country.\n\nMs. Ekole reaffirmed UNICEFs commitment to working with government in building resilience against climate shocks such as El Nio-induced droughts. She emphasized the disproportionate impact of water scarcity on children, noting how the burden of fetching water often compromises their protection, health, and development.\n\nShe also shared insights from her recent field visits to Matabeleland South and Manicaland, where UNICEF projects are improving access to safe water and strengthening community resilience.\n\nBoth parties stressed the importance of expanding partnerships in the water sector. Unlike health and education, which benefit from well-established consortia of development partners, WASH remains underfunded and has limited private sector involvement. Ms. Ekole proposed mobilizing bilateral and multilateral partnersincluding new actors such as China and local private sector playersto boost resource mobilization and investment in the sector.\n\nThe courtesy call concluded with a shared vision to align efforts with Zimbabwes National Development Strategy (NDS1 and NDS2) and to prepare for a high-level policy dialogue in early 2026. This platform is expected to rally stronger international and private sector partnerships for WASH, positioning water as a central driver of human capital development and resilience building.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dr Masimba Mavaza |\n\nNelson Chamisas new party, born out of his fallout with the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), is not regarded as a significant threat by the ruling party ZANU PF. According to ZANU PF, merely changing the name of a party does not alter its substanceit remains the same entity.\n\nHowever, some analysts have raised concerns about Chamisas leadership style, pointing to a lack of transparency and democratic practices. These concerns have already tainted his new party before it has even taken off.\n\nChamisa was once a charismatic force in Zimbabwes opposition politics. Yet his charisma proved no match for the relatively unknown but highly calculating Sengezo Tshabangu, who forced him out of the CCC. Having faced mounting criticism over his leadership style in CCC, Chamisa now promises to unveil a new outfitthough with the same colour.\n\nHis leadership approach first drew controversy when he took control from Dr. Thokozani Khupe and went on to form the CCC, sidelining established party members while relying on a bottom-up structure driven by newcomers.\n\nChamisas leadership has often been described as a demigod style, where he exercises exclusive control over decision-making. This has led to allegations of undemocratic practices, such as imposing candidates and failing to conduct transparent internal polls. Consequently, CCCs stature as a credible alternative diminished amid internal divisions and power struggles.\n\nDespite calls for a more structured and constitutional framework, Chamisas strategy remains vagueand this is now evident in his new party. Ironically, his erratic leadership has offered him a lesson: to observe how ZANU PF has maintained consistent leadership and constitutional order, while avoiding unstable movements that neglect peoples needs and development.\n\nChamisas lack of leadership depth has perpetuated divisions and infighting, further eroding his credibility as a viable alternative to ZANU PF. Senior opposition figures have voiced similar concerns, warning that his new party may suffer the same fate.\n\nKey Challenges Facing Chamisas New Party Leadership-driven collapse: The party risks an early demise due to Chamisas own leadership weaknesses. Imported divisions: The internal conflicts and power struggles from CCC have already spilled over into the new formation. Lack of transparency: Chamisas leadership style continues to be criticized as undemocratic and opaque. Eroded credibility: Internal recalls and conflict have stained the partys image before it has even begun. Cronyism and paganism: The new party is weighed down by accusations of favouritism and questionable practices.\n\nDespite all these challenges, Chamisa still believes he remains a popular figure in opposition politics. Yet, the success of his new party will depend on whether it can resolve these issues and project a united front.\n\nFor now, Chamisa and his party risk being little more than loud-sounding nothing.\n\nHis greatest dilemma is deciding who will serve as his vice president, perhaps, Thabani Mpofu Advocate Mpofu, who has been linked to attempts at reshaping the judiciary, is said to enjoy the backing of judges and senior members of the Judicial Service Commission.\n\nBy the time ZANU PF emerges from what critics call its Zvigananda opium, Chamisa may already have positioned his hand-picked judges to serve his political agenda.\n\n",
