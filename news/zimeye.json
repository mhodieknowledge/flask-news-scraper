            "content": "By A Correspondent  A controversial figure known for his strong alignment with ZANUPF, self-styled pastor and party apologist Obadiah Musindo has publicly defended President Emmerson Mnangagwas inner circle, including those labelled by Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga as Zvigananda.\n\nMusindo dismissed critics of these figures as jealous of successful people and urged Zimbabweans to respect those whom God has blessed.\n\nSpeaking at a pastors conference in Chinhoyi this week, Musindo declared:\n\nThere is nothing wrong with success  those you call Zvigananda are blessed people who are using their wisdom to prosper. We must not demonise them because of envy.\n\nHis comments drew sharp criticism from citizens who accused him of glorifying corruption and shielding politically connected business elites. One Chinhoyi resident who attended the event responded:\n\nHow can a pastor defend looting and call it a blessing? People are hungry because of these so-called blessed businessmen.\n\nAnother added:\n\nIf these men are truly patriotic, let them show us their tax records and how many jobs theyve created without government handouts.\n\nMusindos remarks come amid mounting public anger over corruption and inequality. Civil society groups condemned the clerics words as dangerously tone-deaf. According to one activist with the Zimbabwe AntiCorruption Forum:\n\nReligious leaders should be standing with the poor, not with looters  To call those accused of corruption visionaries is to normalise theft.\n\nMusindo has a history of serious allegations that have drawn into question his moral authority. He was charged in 2006 with five counts of raping his 22-year-old domestic servant, after accusations that he had assaulted her multiple times and threatened her if she reported him. A magistrate ruled there was a prima facie case against him. More recent reports allege he has locked up vulnerable girls in a Harare hotel and used political connections to intimidate them from reporting.\n\nDespite these serious accusations, Musindo has continued to appear at state-linked events and publicly support ZANU-PF, raising concerns that politically connected figures remain accountable to little more than the party line. Critics say that when a pastor known to face such allegations turns to defending elites, it symbolically erodes the moral standing of the church and weakens the countrys ethics\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa has said that growing discussions about extending President Emmerson Mnangagwas term in office are a reflection of the publics confidence in his leadership rather than a political ploy.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with SABC News on Tuesday, Mutsvangwa dismissed reports of internal divisions within the ruling party and claims of a brewing succession battle. He said Zimbabweans overwhelmingly support President Mnangagwa and trust his leadership to continue guiding the nation.\n\nThe people have spoken, Mutsvangwa said. Zimbabweans are behind President Mnangagwa. Leadership transitions are determined by the will of the people through elections, not rumours or factional speculation.\n\nAddressing speculation that Vice President Constantino Chiwenga might be next in line for leadership, Mutsvangwa stressed that the countrys Constitution does not provide for automatic succession.\n\nIt is not correct to assume the vice president is next in line, he said. There is no constitutional provision for automatic succession. Anyone who wants to lead must contest in an election, just like any other citizen.\n\nUsing a pointed analogy, the ZANU PF spokesperson compared Zimbabwes political system to that of the Vatican. This is not Rome, where cardinals sit in secret and decide who becomes pope. This is a democratic country  our leaders are chosen by the people, Mutsvangwa said.\n\nHe further argued that citizens discussions around Mnangagwas possible term extension should be interpreted as a sign of trust, not ambition. When people talk about the duration of the term, it is because they trust his leadership. The public has shown its confidence in him, he said.\n\nMutsvangwas comments come as debate intensifies over President Mnangagwas political future, with some ruling party members reportedly advocating for constitutional amendments to allow him to serve beyond his second term.\n\nDespite rising speculation, Mutsvangwa maintained that the Presidents popularity remains intact and that the people, not internal factions, will determine the countrys political direction. The people are the ultimate authority, he said. As long as the President continues to deliver, the people will continue to support him.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nAddis Ababa / Dar es Salaam  The African Union has issued a statement endorsing the results of Tanzanias controversial presidential election, which saw President Samia Suluhu Hassan declared the overwhelming winner amid allegations of irregularities and the exclusion of key opposition candidates.\n\nIn a statement released on Saturday, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, H.E. Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, congratulated President Hassan on her victory while expressing regret over the loss of life during post-election protests.\n\nThe Chairperson deeply regrets the loss of human life during the post-electoral protests and extends his sincere condolences to the families of the victims, the AU statement read.\n\nHe underscores the imperative of upholding fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to peaceful assembly and expression, and encourages the authorities to safeguard these rights within the framework of the law. He also calls on citizens to exercise their rights in a peaceful and responsible manner.\n\nThe AU emphasized the importance of democratic principles, recalling the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. The Chairperson recalls the principles of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, in particular respect for the rule of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms, and political pluralism, which are the cornerstones of democratic and stable societies, the statement continued.\n\nDespite the violence and widespread concerns over the fairness of the polls, the AU reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Tanzania. The African Union reaffirms its readiness to support the people and Government of Tanzania in their efforts to preserve peace, national cohesion, and democracy, the statement concluded.\n\nAccording to the countrys electoral commission, President Hassan won 97.66 percent of the vote in Wednesdays election, dominating every constituency after leading opposition figures were barred from participating. Critics argue that the election lacked competitiveness and that the exclusion of opposition candidates undermined the legitimacy of the results.\n\nPresident Hassans near-unanimous victory comes amid post-election unrest, with several protesters killed in clashes with security forces following the announcement of the results. The AUs endorsement has drawn mixed reactions, with some observers warning that legitimizing the polls without addressing human rights concerns could set a worrying precedent for democratic processes in the region.\n\n",

Across the cage stood a snarling Jeremiah Wells  stocky, explosive, and desperate to save his career. The air in Las Vegas was thick with tension. It wasnt just a fight; it was survival.\n\nThe opening bell rang  and Gorimbo struck first. Lightning-fast, he ducked under Wells wild right hand and scooped the American clean off his feet. The crowd gasped as the Zimbabwean slammed him to the mat, sliding into full mount like a predator that had done this a thousand times before. For two minutes, Wells could barely breathe as Gorimbo rained down punches and hunted for position, his face calm, his heart pounding like tribal drums from the Matabeleland highlands he calls home.\n\nBut Wells is a veteran of chaos. He rose from the canvas with blood in his mouth and fury in his eyes, pressing Gorimbo to the cage, reversing the tide with brute strength. The first round ended with Wells on top, elbows cocked, but the horn spared Gorimbo  for now.\n\nThe second round was a storm. Wells came out swinging, ripping body kicks and combinations that echoed through the Apex. Gorimbo absorbed them like a man possessed, answering with relentless takedown attempts. But this time, fatigue crept in  the kind that burns your lungs and betrays your muscles. Each time he shot, Wells sprawled. Each time he stood, Wells pressed him back down. Wells began to flow, chaining strikes with wrestling, his rhythm sharp, his intent cruel. Gorimbos face told a story  pain, defiance, and something else: refusal to quit.\n\nBy the final round, both men looked like soldiers crawling through the trenches. Wells still had fire in his legs; Gorimbo had only pride  but that pride was pure iron. When Wells dragged him down again, the crowd could see it  the American was the fresher fighter, but the Zimbabwean refused to die in there. Even as Wells hunted for arm-triangle chokes, even as the seconds ticked away, Gorimbo kept moving, kept fighting, kept trying to stand.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, both warriors collapsed  drained, battered, but unbroken. Wells hand was raised by unanimous decision (29-28, 29-28, 29-28), but Gorimbo had once again shown what Zimbabwean grit looks like under pressure.\n\nHis record now stands at 146, but numbers dont tell the story. This was a fight of spirit  of a man who rose from poverty, who once slept in a bush as a refugee, now bleeding under Vegas lights against one of the worlds best.\n\nAs Gorimbo walked out of the cage, he smiled through a swollen lip and said simply:\n\nThis is not the end. Its part of the journey. Ill come back stronger. Zimbabwe, this one was for you.\n\nAnd thats the thing about The Answer  he doesnt fade when the lights get bright. He bleeds, he learns, and he keeps coming. Always.\n\n",

We remain committed to defending the Constitution and upholding the rule of law.\n\nThe caucus expressed concern over what it described as deliberate attempts to discredit principled parliamentarians who have remained steadfast in representing citizens interests.\n\nThe accusation that opposition Members of Parliament participated in singing a song encouraging the President to extend his term to 2030 is entirely false, the statement continued.

            "content": "By A Correspondent-Vice President Constantino Chiwengas conspicuous absence from last weeks State of the Nation Address (SONA) by President Emmerson Mnangagwa has reignited speculation about his health and political future amid renewed succession tensions in ZANU-PF.\n\nAccording toZimLive, Chiwenga missed the key national event due to a medical review in South Africa. Presidential spokesperson George Charamba confirmed the trip, saying only, The vice president had a medical review in South Africa. Chiwenga, 69, is said to have since returned to Zimbabwe.\n\nHis last public appearance was on 25 October during the 75th-anniversary celebrations of St Lukes Mission and Hospital in Lupane, following a tour of development projects in Matabeleland South. Vice President Kembo Mohadi stood in for him at the SONA.\n\nHowever, Chiwengas absence at such a crucial event has fuelled speculation of renewed friction between him and Mnangagwas inner circleparticularly as political manoeuvring intensifies ahead of ZANU-PFs 2028 succession question.\n\nSources within the ruling party suggest that powerful figures aligned with Mnangagwaincluding businessman Kudakwashe Tagwireiare working to sideline Chiwenga from both party and government structures, effectively neutralising him as a future contender.\n\nChiwenga, who played a decisive role in the November 2017 military intervention that brought Mnangagwa to power, has long been viewed as his most likely successor. Yet, his deteriorating health and growing isolation have weakened that position.\n\nOver the years, the vice presidents medical condition has been the subject of intense public concern. He has sought treatment in India, South Africa, and China for undisclosed ailments, spending months out of the country between 2019 and 2020. A court case in 2023 even revealed that he was once unconscious during a hospitalisation in South Africa before being airlifted abroad.\n\nAnalysts say these recurring health issues have become both a personal vulnerability and a political tool within the ruling party. Health in ZANU-PF politics is not just a private matterits leverage, a Harare political commentator noted. When a senior official disappears from public view, speculation immediately turns to whether theyre being pushed aside or simply too weak to fight back.\n\nTensions between Chiwenga and Mnangagwas loyalists reportedly deepened earlier this year after the vice president publicly criticised tenderpreneurs and hinted that the Vision 2030 agenda should benefit ordinary citizens rather than a select elite. The remarks were widely interpreted as a veiled attack on Mnangagwas business allies.\n\nMnangagwas second and final term under the 2013 Constitution ends in 2028, but whispers within ZANU-PF suggest efforts are underway to extend his stay or anoint a loyal successor. Chiwenga is believed to oppose such manoeuvres, insisting on constitutionalisma stance that further isolates him from the presidents faction.\n\nIn this charged environment, Chiwengas absence from the SONA may signal more than just a medical appointment. It reflects three interlinked dynamics shaping ZANU-PFs internal battlefield:\n\nWhether Chiwengas SONA snub was truly about health or strategy remains unclear.
