It ensures trust and traceability, allowing them to seek employment and contribute meaningfully, said Mukonoweshuro.\n\nHe added that discussions with Botswanas Ministry of Immigration are underway to turn the presidents pronouncement into action.\n\nAt the Zimbabwean Embassy in Gaborone, consular services are in high demand, with up to 150 Zimbabweans seeking assistance daily for passport renewals, birth certificates, and permits.\n\nThe embassy also compiles a comprehensive list of Zimbabweans in Botswana to streamline the documentation process.\n\nZimbabweans in Botswana, including professionals like Dr. Brighton Hurombo, a lecturer at the University of Botswana, have expressed satisfaction with the embassys services. I am pleased with the efficiency of the embassy. Their support ensures smoother processes for those of us traveling or renewing documents, he said.\n\nPresident Bokos initiative represents a significant step toward strengthening Botswana-Zimbabwe relations while addressing the needs of Zimbabwean expatriates.\n\nThis progressive approach acknowledges the skills and commitment of Zimbabweans and underscores the importance of inclusive policies in fostering regional stability and development.\n\n",

By voluntarily staying compliant, you contribute to a fair and sustainable tax system that supports national development, the authority stated.\n\nCritics argue that some churches exploit vulnerable congregants under the guise of faith.\n\nThe taxation ofcommercial activities within religious institutions is seen as a step toward curbing abuse while ensuring financial accountability.\n\nZIMRA plans to host a stakeholder engagement forum to discuss tax compliance further, with details tobe announced.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nInfighting within the ZANU PF Youth League has escalated, as Youth League Secretary Tinoda Machakaire has demanded that his deputy, John Paradza, immediately retract a circular that he issued, which allegedly nullified a recent reshuffling of the national executive council.\n\nOn December 9, 2024, Machakaire announced the reshuffle of the ZANU PF Youth League, a move that was met with resistance from Paradza. Paradza argued that the reshuffle was unconstitutional and instructed the affected officials to remain in their positions.\n\nIn his response, Paradza referred to specific provisions within the partys constitution, asserting, May you acquaint yourself with the provisions of Article 26(340)(1)&(2) which provide for the functions and responsibilities of the Deputy Secretary for Youth Affairs. He emphasized that as Deputy Secretary for Youth Affairs, Machakaire had no right to interfere with the functions of the Secretary for Youth Affairs, stating that Machakaire had no constitutional basis for making such a move.\n\nParadza further challenged Machakaires actions, saying, In your letter, you have made vague reference to the composition of the Youth League National Executive Council without particularity on the provision you rely on in making your assertions. He pointed out that there had been no breach of the constitution in the reshuffle, as no official had been removed from the National Executive Council.\n\nMachakaire, in his own letter, defended the reshuffle, stating, Adjustments in the departmental leadership of the Youth League National Executive Council have been implemented purely for the purposes of enhancing the fulfilment of the Youth Leagues constitutional obligations and the execution of the National Peoples Conference Resolutions.\n\nHe also made it clear that the changes were in line with guidance from his principal, asserting, As head of the Youth League, I have communicated the adjustments as I have been duly guided by my Principal in terms of Article 10(88)(1), (2)&(13) and Article 26(339)(1)&(4).\n\nIn conclusion, Machakaire ordered Paradza to withdraw his circular immediately, warning that failure to do so would result in further disciplinary actions. Your much circulated and published correspondence contesting the communicated position is irregular and must be withdrawn forthwith, failing which the appropriate measures shall be set in motion, he stated.\n\nThe growing tension within the Youth League highlights deepening divisions within ZANU PF, with significant implications for the partys future cohesion.\n\n",
