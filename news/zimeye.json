His return highlights how Mugabe-era officials, once sidelined, are being reintegrated into state institutions under Mnangagwas administration.\n\nAddressing the media, Sibanda said he was honoured to lead efforts to revive NRZ, a parastatal that has long been the backbone of Zimbabwes transport system but has been crippled by decades of neglect, corruption and mismanagement.\n\nOur President has long recognised that NRZ is not delivering what it should to the economy. He has directed that its resuscitation be accelerated, and I am committed to ensuring this institution once again becomes a driver of growth, he said.\n\nNRZs collapse mirrors the wider decay of Zimbabwes parastatal sector. Once engines of national development, most state-owned enterprises have been systematically looted by Zanu PF elites since the Mugabe era, serving as vehicles for patronage and personal enrichment rather than public service.\n\nFrom the Grain Marketing Board to Air Zimbabwe, parastatals have been riddled with scandals, debt and inefficiency. NRZ, in particular, has suffered from the diversion of resources, opaque procurement deals and failed recapitalisation efforts tied to politically connected cartels.\n\nAt its peak, NRZ moved over 18 million tonnes of cargo annually and employed more than 20,000 workers. By 2017, output had plummeted to just 3.4 million tonnes, forcing industries to rely on costly road transport.\n\nThe deterioration not only increased logistics costs but also damaged highways as bulk minerals and agricultural goods were moved by trucks.\n\nMnangagwa has repeatedly promised to revive NRZ, with successive deals announced with Indian, Russian and Chinese partners  most of which have collapsed amid allegations of corruption.\n\nThis week, during his state visit to China, Mnangagwa revived talks with China Railway International Group (CRIG) over a proposed US$600 million package to rehabilitate the network.\n\n",

Eyewitnesses said police officers reacted violently to Marigas attempts to capture the incident on camera. His cellphone and camera were seized, his shirt was torn, and he was taken into custody at Masvingo Central Police Station.\n\nOne bystander described the shocking events: The police went too far. They beat him up and humiliated him for simply doing his job.\n\nThe attack quickly sparked chaos in the city, with angry residents confronting the officers. Crowds reportedly forced the police to retreat, allowing the mshikashika driver to escape to loud cheers. A tow truck called to haul the vehicle away was also chased off after residents threatened to torch it.\n\nThe Masvingo Mirror condemned the assault and said Marigas detention was unlawful. A senior official at the paper demanded his immediate release, stressing: Nyasha has committed no crime. He is a fully accredited journalist with the Zimbabwe Media Commission and has every right to be on the scene taking pictures.\n\nMasvingo police spokesperson Inspector Kudakwashe Dhewa was not immediately available for comment.\n\n",

The polished black stonework and roofed structure, adorned with the word MUM in bold yellow flowers, dwarfs surrounding graves and resembles a private mausoleum more than a public cemetery plot.\n\nBut in Bulawayo, such extravagant tombstone designs are now under threat of demolition.\n\n City Council Declares Clampdown\n\nBulawayo Town Clerk Christopher Dube has issued a stern warning: tombstones erected at new cemeteries in defiance of the 2018 city policy will be demolished, citing the Cemeteries Act and Bulawayo Cemeteries Regulations of 1967.\n\nThe policy is clear, said Dube in the latest Health, Housing and Education Committee report. Only headstones are permitted. Residents who have put up tombstones in violation of this directive will be issued with demolition orders.\n\nThis directive specifically targets new cemeteries such as Athlone West, where graveyards are becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to overgrowth and restricted maintenance access.\n\n Chivayos Grave Sparks Debate\n\nAlthough Chivayos mother is not buried in a Bulawayo cemetery, his flamboyant show of wealth at her grave  complete with imported granite, a shaded roof, and designer finish  has reignited national debate over economic disparity, cultural excess, and now municipal policy enforcement.\n\nThe image of Chivayos monument has gone viral, with critics arguing it symbolizes unchecked privilege, even in death, while thousands of Zimbabweans are buried in unmarked or poorly maintained graves.\n\n Why the Ban?\n\nThe city says the new policy is practical, not punitive:\n\n Regulations at a Glance\n\nFamilies wishing to install a headstone must:\n\nSix known cases of non-compliance have already been documented, with councillors pushing for stronger enforcement and community awareness through radio, funeral parlours, and ward meetings.\n\n Running Out of Space\n\nAs Bulawayos burial space continues to shrink, the council is also encouraging cremation as a long-term solution.\n\nWhile Wicknell Chivayos mausoleum-like grave may escape municipal reach due to its location, it now stands as a symbol of a growing class divide  even in how the dead are remembered. Meanwhile, the City of Bulawayo is drawing a line: graves are for mourning, not monuments of wealth.\n\n",

The court heard that Moyo persistently called Ms Nyathi demanding the money before being caught red-handed at her house receiving the cash.\n\nDefence Plea\n\nMoyos lawyer, Prince Butshe of Butshe and Associates, pleaded for leniency, arguing that his client is a first-time offender, a breadwinner supporting his wife and two young children, and that the money in question was recovered during the trap.\n\nThe mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors. According to Section 260 of the Criminal Law Codification Act, entrapment is a mitigating factor. I therefore appeal for six months imprisonment, wholly suspended on condition that Moyo performs community service at Emganwini Clinic, Butshe submitted.\n\nHe further warned that Moyo is likely to lose his councillorship as a result of the conviction.\n\nDeputy Mayor Cleared\n\nMoyo was initially charged alongside Bulawayo Deputy Mayor Councillor Edwin Ndlovu, but Ndlovu was acquitted after the State failed to provide evidence directly linking him to the alleged offence.\n\nZACC Sting Operation\n\nAccording to the State, Moyowho chaired the Finance and Development Committeedemanded the bribe to fast-track approval of a 5.6-hectare piece of land in Cowdray Park. The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) arrested him shortly after he received the cash at Ms Nyathis residence.\n\nMoyo now awaits sentencing on Monday, in a case that underscores ZACCs ongoing crackdown on corruption in local government.\n\n",

She argued she should not be penalised for the sins of her legal representative.\n\nThe Defence Minister also dismissed the damages as excessive and unreasonable, seeking to refer the matter back to the High Court Registrar for a full hearingeffectively delaying justice for the widow and her family.\n\nHuman rights activists condemn the move as yet another example of the Mnangagwa administration shielding its officials from accountability. This is a government that kills its citizens and then refuses to own up, said a source familiar with the case.\n\nThe application by Muchinguri-Kashiri has not yet been scheduled for hearing, leaving the widow waiting for compensation that could help her rebuild her shattered life. Critics say the administrations actions highlight a pattern of impunity and contempt for the rule of law in Zimbabwe.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent Armed robbers struck again in Bulawayo on Wednesday morning, storming a bureau de change in the citys central business district and escaping with more than US$18,000 and R151,000 after overpowering a security guard.\n\nNational police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident, describing it as a highly coordinated operation that pointed to the possibility of an inside job.\n\nThe robbery took place at about 8AM at Nkolozi Investments, located on the first floor of the CIPF Building at the corner of Jason Moyo Street and 9th Avenue.\n\nThe three suspects walked into the complex pretending to be customers. They then attacked the guard, disarmed him, and demanded access to the safes and a remote key. They tampered with the CCTV system, erasing footage from that morning, before seizing employees cellphones and cash, said Comm Nyathi.\n\nHe said police were investigating leads and warned that the net was closing in on the suspects. We suspect this could be an inside job because of the precision with which the robbery was executed. However, I want to assure the public that it is only a matter of time before the culprits are apprehended. Investigations are underway.\n\nA witness said the robbers fled on foot, suggesting they may have had a getaway car parked nearby. It happened so fast that no one could react. We were all shocked and immobilised. It was terrifying, said the witness.\n\nCompany officials declined to comment, citing ongoing investigations.\n\nThe latest heist adds to a worrying surge in violent robberies that has gripped Bulawayo in recent months. Criminal gangs have increasingly targeted forex traders, businesses, and individuals handling large sums of money, often using military-style precision.\n\nJust last month, suspected robbers shot and injured a 33-year-old man believed to be a foreign currency dealer before robbing him of US$4,000 and R60,000.\n\nIn one of the most high-profile robberies in recent memory, gunmen staged a daring raid on Ecobank in Bulawayo in October last year, intercepting a security van transporting cash. The robbers fled with US$4 million, the countrys biggest cash heist in years, sparking national outrage and exposing the extent of organised criminal syndicates operating in the city.\n\nSecurity analysts say Bulawayos rising crime wave reflects broader socio-economic hardships, with desperate individuals teaming up with sophisticated syndicates  some with alleged links to rogue elements in the security services.\n\nPolice have since intensified crackdowns on armed robbery gangs, urging businesses to tighten security protocols, avoid moving large sums of money without adequate protection, and install tamper-proof surveillance systems.\n\n",
