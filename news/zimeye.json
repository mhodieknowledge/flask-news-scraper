            "content": "Vatican City The Vatican has said Pope Francis Pope died of a stroke and subsequent irreversible heart failure.\n\nThePopedied early Monday, and his death marks not just the end of a papacy but also the closing chapter of one of the most transformative eras in the modern Catholic Church.\n\nRevered as the Peoples Pope, Francis, who passed thismorning, willbe rememberedfor reshaping the Churchs tone and posture inways both subtle and profound.\n\nBut as the world mourns this towering spiritual figure, a centuries-old process quietly moves into motion  the sacred, symbolicandhighly ceremonial rites that follow the death of a pope.\n\nPope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was the first Jesuit pope, the first from the Americas, and the first non-European in more than 1,200 years. Throughout his 12-year papacy, he steered the Church toward humility, social justice, and environmental stewardship, often drawingbothadmiration and criticism for his candid remarks and reformist zeal.\n\nHe emphasized compassion over condemnation and inclusivity over rigidity  a style rooted in the simplicity of his Jesuit background.\n\nIn November 2024, just months before his death, the Vatican confirmed that Pope Francis had revised the rites for papal funerals.\n\nHis wish was clear: strip away excessive pomp to emphasize the pastoral nature of his mission  the funeral of a shepherd and disciple of Christ, not of a powerful man of this world, said Monsignor Diego Ravelli, the Vaticans master of liturgical ceremonies.\n\nSo, what happens when a pope dies?\n\nThe first step is certification of death, a solemn task carried out by theCamerlengo, the cardinal who temporarily oversees Church affairs between pontificates.\n\nIn this case,Cardinal Kevin Farrell, thecamerlengo, pronounced the papal name Franciscus three times.\n\nWhen no response followed, the death was declared official. Farrell then notifiedCardinal Vicar Baldassare Reinaof the Roman Diocese and issued a death certificate.\n\nOne of the most symbolic acts comes next: thedestruction of the papal ring.\n\nKnown as theRing of the Fisherman, it represents thepopesauthority and is ceremonially crushed with special shears to prevent forgery and mark the end of his reign.\n\nFollowing tradition, thepapal apartmentsare sealed, a practice that dates back centuries to prevent looting and interference with personal effects and private correspondence.\n\nPope Francis body, dressed in simple papal garments, will lie in state atSt. Peters Basilicafor public viewing.\n\nThisbegins theNovemdiales, a nine-day mourning period rooted in ancient Roman traditions.\n\nDuring this time, daily Masses and prayersare held, culminating in the funeral and burial.\n\nWhile most popes in recent history have opted for elaborate arrangements,Francisowninstructionsinsisted on amodest funeral.Instead of being encased in the traditional triple coffin  cypress, lead, and oak Francis will be laid to rest in a single, zinc-lined wooden casket, according toReuters.\n\nHe also reportedly declined embalming, favoring a more natural return to the earth, in contrast to many predecessors.\n\nNotably,Pope John Paul IImade a similar choice, whilePope John XXIII, embalmed and entombed in an airtight coffin, was famously found to be incorrupt when exhumed in 2001.\n\nUntil a new pope is elected, the Church enters a period known assede vacante the Seat is Vacant.\n\nDuring this time, thecamerlengoand a small group of senior cardinals manage the daily affairs of the Church but cannot introduce newpolicyordoctrine.\n\nWithin 15 to 20 days, theCollege of Cardinals all under age 80  will conveneinconclaveto elect the nextpope.\n\nThe processis steepedin secrecy, with ballots burned after each vote. Black smoke signals an inconclusive vote; white smoke tells the worldhabemus papam we have a pope.\n\nFrancis papacy may be over, but his imprint on the Catholic Church and the world will not fade. He was a pontiff who urged the Church to smell like the sheep, to walk with the poor, and to serve as a field hospital in a wounded world.\n\nEven in death, his choices  from funeral rites to burial style  reinforce his commitment to simplicity, service, and faith.\n\nAs millions of faithful gather, mourn, and reflect, the Church preparesnot justto bury apope,but tocarry forward a legacy of mercy, justice, and humility that defined one of its most beloved modern leaders.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jamers Gwati-In what appears to be a clear sign of panic, the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has issued a stern warning against participation in a planned two-day national shutdown led by ex-combatant Blessed Geza, also known as Cde Bombshell.\n\nThe shutdown, set for Tuesday and WednesdayApril 22 and 23is Gezas latest attempt to force President Emmerson Mnangagwa out of office.\n\nIt follows last months protests in Harare, which saw over 100 people arrested in whatwas widely viewedas the first wave of visible resistance against Mnangagwas authoritarian rule.\n\nDespite these arrests and a warrant out for hisownarrest, Geza remains defiant, calling on Zimbabweans to stay at home in a peaceful show of disobedience.\n\nThis is to send a strong message to Mnangagwa and hiszvigananda, Geza said in a viral online broadcast. Shops and industries must not open. Kombis should be parked. The police will not teargas youbut if they come, you have the right to defend yourselves.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the ZRP said it had deployed officers nationwide to maintain law and order, particularly in urbancentres, residential areas, and industrial zones.\n\nAlthough the police did not explicitly name Geza or the shutdown, their language left little doubt.\n\nIn this regard, the police will arrest anyone who interferes with the smooth flow of traffic and the movement of the public, the statement reads.\n\nThe police also warned citizens against abusing social media and urged them to ignore what they called social media postings meant to cause chaos and alarm in the country.\n\nThe timing of the ZRPs response appears designed to reassure both local and international visitors expected at this years Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) in Bulawayo, which coincides with the planned protests.\n\nBut critics say the authorities hardline stance reflects a government increasingly afraid of itsowncitizens.\n\nWith the economy in freefall, widespread corruption, and a collapsing public service, discontent is risingand fast.\n\nGezas call to action has struck a chord, especially with unemployed youths, frustrated civil servants, and disillusioned war veterans.\n\nFrom hiding, he has continued to rally support through social media, describing the stay-away as one of the few remaining peaceful tools left for resisting Zimbabwes authoritarian drift.\n\nMnangagwa has captured the judiciary and suspended Parliament at will, Geza said. Zimbabwe is now one of the few countries in the world where the right to protest no longer exists. But weve discovered that staying at home is a powerful weapon.\n\nSince seizing power in a 2017 military coup, Mnangagwa has promised a Second Republic and a break from Robert Mugabes repressive legacy.\n\nBut nearly eight years later, those promises have faded into disillusionment.\n\nThe Zimbabwean dollar has collapsed. Inflation is rampant. Basic goods are unaffordable for the majority. Salariesespecially in the public sectorare eroded within days of being paid.\n\nCorruption scandals involving COVID-19 funds, gold smuggling, and shady procurement deals have gone unpunished, with manyof thealleged perpetrators linked to Mnangagwas inner circle. Meanwhile, journalists, human rights defenders, and opposition activists continue to face arrest, harassment, and persecution.\n\nThe Presidentis also accusedof dismantling key democratic institutions to cement his grip on power. Parliament hasbeen sidelined.\n\nThe judiciaryis stackedwith loyalists. Promised electoral reforms have not materialized.\n\nAndthe Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) remains discredited after overseeing elections tainted by irregularities, voter suppression, and allegations of rigging.\n\nInternally, ZANU PFis increasingly divided. Behind Mnangagwas strongman persona lies a party riven by factionalism.\n\nVice President Constantino Chiwengawho led the 2017 coupis said to be quietly consolidating his influence withinboththe military and the party, sparking growing tensions ahead of the next ZANU PF congress.\n\nIn his Independence Day address on April 18 in Gokwe, Mnangagwa issued a thinly veiled threat to social media activists accused of inciting unresta clearjab at Geza and otherswho have beenusing digital platforms to mobilize resistance.\n\nBut Geza remains undeterred.\n\nIm pleading with you to stay home, he said in a final rallying cry. I know its hardwere living from hand to mouth. But this is our only hope to make Mnangagwa hear us. We are staying away to force him to step down.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe death of much-loved comedian Charles Mapalume, affectionately known as Marabha, has been met with a wave of grief across Zimbabwe. However, the sorrow was overshadowed by outrage as some Zanu PF-aligned social media users, known as Varakashi, took to Facebook to mock the late comedian.\n\nMarabha, who passed away over the weekend after a long illness, was a beloved figure in Zimbabwes entertainment scene, known for his iconic skits and comedic timing. But instead of condolences, certain Zanu PF youth supporters used the opportunity to rekindle an old political grudge.\n\nIn a widely circulated Facebook post, one Varakashi wrote:Ndanzwa kuti kunhamo kwamarabha vanyimwa body vashaya mari $200. Ndozvinoitika izvi ukatuka vakuru. Do you remember video rake President vachiti 2030 ndenge ndichipo iye akati tokumamisa. Now ndiani amamiswa manje. Kunyadzisa nemuguva nemuguva. Respect your elders.\n\nThe post refers to a viral comedy clip from years back in which Marabha was accused of mocking President Emmerson Mnangagwas 2030 vision. The Varakashi insinuated that Marabhas misfortunes were a result of his past disrespect.\n\nAnother comment added fuel to the fire, stating:Zvekunzi afa anaka zviya haa hameno. Uyu akanditukira Baba Vangu murume akarara apo uyu.(Translation: That saying about the dead being good people, well I dont know. This man insulted my father, now he lies lifeless.)\n\nThe comments sparked widespread backlash from members of the public and social media users who condemned the lack of empathy and politicisation of Marabhas passing.\n\nEven in death, this is the cruelty we have to endure, said one Twitter user. Marabha made people laugh. He was not a politician. Show some humanity.\n\nCultural analysts and media commentators have also weighed in, warning against the growing trend of cyberbullying and the toxic politicisation of public discourse in Zimbabwe.\n\nMarabha brought joy to many. The attempt to reduce his legacy to a single comedy clip taken out of context is not only unfair but reflects the erosion of values in our political culture, said media scholar Dr. Tinashe Chikomo.\n\nAs preparations for his burial continue, fans and fellow artists have called for Marabha to be remembered for the smiles he brought to millions  not for the political divisions others now try to attach to his name.\n\n",
