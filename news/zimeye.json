            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri Zimbabwes Minister of ICT, Hon. Tatenda Mavetera, on Tuesday officially commissioned the new Innovation Hub at TelOne, describing it as a state-of-the-art facility designed to nurture creativity and empower young innovators. The launch coincided with the graduation of TelOne students, whom Mavetera said represented a new generation of ICT professionals ready to shape the future.\n\nWhile the event was framed as a milestone in Zimbabwes digital transformation journey, some observers have criticized the timing and relevance of the project, given the countrys ongoing economic and technological challenges.\n\nBuilding a fancy hub is all well and good, but most young people in Zimbabwe still struggle with access to basic internet and electricity, said one ICT sector analyst who asked not to be named. This feels more like a PR exercise than a meaningful step toward real digital transformation.\n\nAnother critic added, Its hard to celebrate innovation when the country is drowning in economic instability. Hubs and graduations wont put food on peoples tables or fix the broken infrastructure that young innovators actually need.\n\nDespite the criticism, Minister Mavetera praised the hubs potential, saying it would accelerate Zimbabwes shift toward a knowledge-driven economy and foster skills development in the ICT sector.\n\nHowever, for many Zimbabweans, the excitement over the Innovation Hub is tempered by skepticism. Observers argue that while institutional growth is important, projects like this may appear disconnected from the everyday struggles faced by the nations youth, who are grappling with unemployment, limited resources, and a struggling digital ecosystem.\n\n",

            "content": "By Desmond Nleya and Shelton Muchena| Business tycoon Kudakwashe Tagwirei is facing renewed accusations of having used his financial influence to systematically weaken ZANU PFs internal structures, with opposition leaders warning that the ruling party is being transformed into a network of personal loyalists aligned to President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nOpposition leader Charlton Hwende said on Tuesday that Tagwireis growing political role had contributed to the disintegration of ZANU PFs long-standing organisational framework.\n\nPosting on X, Hwende wrote: Chakanwirwa ichi chinhu! The destruction of structures was a well-calculated move. So sad.\n\nHis remarks referred to what he described as choreographed rallies linked to Tagwirei and the ever-expanding network of Mnangagwa-affiliated organisations.\n\nMeanwhile, Tagwireis growing public profile has also sparked legal and ethical questions. The businessman has recently been seen travelling in convoys of unregistered vehicles without number plates, behaviour critics say resembles that of a head of state.\n\nProminent lawyer and former opposition spokesperson Fadzayi Mahere took to X to challenge Transport Minister Felix Mhona over the matter.\n\n*Good morning Minister @MhonaFelix.\n\nIn addition, the rise of ED affiliates, many of which now operate with greater visibility and influence than official ZANU PF structures, had diluted the authority of the ruling partys organs.\n\nAnalysts have echoed this sentiment, saying the recent reshuffles, demotions, and sidelining of several senior officials and politburo members indicate that the party is being reshaped into a personalised political vehicle.\n\nThe question is how ED affiliates will continue to flourish after Mnangagwa relinquishes power, one analyst noted. The signs point to attempts at creating a political dynasty that outlives his presidency.\n\n",

            "content": "By Shelton Muchena| In 2017 the second Republic was born with the mantra Zimbabwe is open for business.This message went along with the phrase  the voice of people is the voice of God..but to day as Zimbabwe marks its anniversary the voice of people is now falsely translated as vision 2030.\n\nBack in 2017, Mnangagwas ascent to power was framed as the dawn of a new era. The global world was informed that Zimbabwe was open for business, ready to attract foreign investment, and eager to leave behind the shadows of economic isolation, bad governance and political turmoil. However, as the years have passed, the bright promises have dimmed into a harsh reality.\n\nToday, the nation grapples with cancerous corruption epidemic that has tainted almost every layer of governance. While Mnangagwa once positioned himself as a champion against corruption, the past years proved an endless growing list of scandals, allegations, and systemic entanglement that has made it clear: the country is not truly open for business. Instead, it is increasingly open to a cycle of patronage, mismanagement, and unchecked separation of power.\n\nThe irony is not lost on many that the same man who once invoked the constitutionalism to topple Mugabe is now battling the very corruption he once denounced. It is a bitter twist of fate that the fight against graft has become a struggle for the very soul of the nation.\n\nMoreover, the relationship between Mnangagwa and his Vice President, Constantino Chiwenga, has also been thrown into the spotlight. Recent events, including the controversial airport video circulating on social, have highlighted the deepening rift and lack of coordination at the highest levels of government. This breakdown in communication and trust only underscores the instability that continues to plague Zimbabwe.\n\nAs the nation reflects on these years since the so-called new dawn, it is clear that the promises of 2017 have not been fully realised. Instead of an open, transparent, and thriving business environment, Zimbabwe faces entrenched corruption and political instability.\n\nThe battle against corruption is far from over, and the journey toward a truly open-for-business Zimbabwe remains fraught with challenges. Yet, the nations resilience and the hopes of its people continue to demand better, even as the battle for integrity and genuine reform rages on.\n\n",

            "content": "At least 7,000 families many of them long-standing ZANU-PF supporters have been ordered to leave Old Willdale Compound in Mount Hampden with residents accusing Willdale Bricks of using threats, political pressure and police intimidation to force them out.\n\nIn a video circulating on social media, Willdale Bricks Chief Executive Officer Nyasha Matonda is heard telling the families that they must vacate the compound by Wednesday morning.\n\nHe warns that those who fail to comply will face police action.\n\nKindly take note, as youre aware that we have an eviction order which says you should vacate this area. We are giving you until tomorrow morning or else the police will unleash violence on you, Matonda said.\n\nHe went on to tell the residents that they should vote for a proper government accusing their MP, Kudakwashe Mananzva of misleading them by encouraging them to remain on the property.\n\nFrom tomorrow, you are going to learn where to put your vote. You should vote for proper leadership, Matonda added.\n\nResidents insist they have nowhere else to go and are relying on government assurances that no one will be left homeless.\n\nWilldale Bricks recently secured a High Court order allowing it to reclaim the land, which the company once used for clay extraction but now describes as overrun by illegal brickmakers.\n\nThe firm hopes to sell the Mt Hampden land valued at US$3 million to revive its struggling operations and is considering developing the 123.6-hectare property into housing stands and an industrial park.\n\nZvimba East MP Kudakwashe Mananzva said he had engaged government ministries in an effort to halt or delay the mass eviction.\n\nAs your MP, I have approached the relevant ministry and they are seized with the matter, he said. This caring ZANU-PF-led government is committed to ensuring every affected family is resettled in safe and dignified conditions.\n\nHe urged residents not to panic, saying provincial authorities had already visited the area and that government was working to secure alternative accommodation in line with Vision 2030s pledge to leave no one and no place behind.\n\nWitnesses say the attempted eviction involved Matonda, Willdales security officer Mr Mawarire and a convoy of police officers led by Harare Province Deputy Commissioner Masimba, Assistant Disposal Officer Masawi of Harare Suburban, Chief Inspector Chirambiwa of ZRP Marlborough and members of the Police Support Unit.\n\n",
