            "content": "Road safety is not just a matter of government policy or law enforcement; it is a collective responsibility that falls on every individual.\n\nWhile authorities play a crucial role in setting rules, providing infrastructure, and enforcing traffic laws, the safety of our roads depends on how each of us behaves behind the wheel or as a pedestrian.\n\nIts easy to assume that road safety is solely the responsibility of lawmakers and authorities, but the reality is that every person who uses the road contributes to creating a safer or more dangerous environment. Drivers, passengers, cyclists, and even pedestrians all have a part to play in ensuring that our roads remain safe for everyone.\n\nThe Importance of Safe Driving\n\nOne of the most significant contributors to road safety is the way we drive. Speeding, distracted driving, and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs are all actions that put not only the driver but also other road users at serious risk. Being aware of road conditions, following traffic signals, wearing seat belts, and respecting speed limits are some of the simplest yet most effective ways to avoid accidents.\n\nDriving safely involves more than just adhering to the lawit means being conscious of other drivers and pedestrians, maintaining a safe distance, and reacting calmly in emergency situations. The decision to drive responsibly can prevent countless accidents and save lives.\n\nPedestrians and Cyclists: Sharing the Road\n\nRoad safety isnt just about cars. Pedestrians and cyclists also need to be vigilant and responsible. Pedestrians should use crosswalks, avoid jaywalking, and stay alert when walking near busy streets. Similarly, cyclists must wear helmets, signal their turns, and follow traffic rules to minimize the risk of accidents.\n\nEveryone, regardless of how they travel, plays a part in maintaining road safety. Drivers must be aware of pedestrians and cyclists, while pedestrians and cyclists should respect the rules designed to protect them.\n\nA Culture of Responsibility\n\nBuilding a culture of road safety starts with individuals taking responsibility for their actions. Whether you are driving, cycling, or walking, your behavior on the road can have a direct impact on others. Everyone should recognize that safety is not just a matter of personal well-being but also the well-being of everyone else on the road.\n\nConclusion\n\nRoad safety is not only about laws and regulations; it is about creating a culture where everyone takes responsibility for their actions. To ensure that roads are safe for everyone, we must all participatedrivers, pedestrians, cyclists, and law enforcement. The message is simple: Drive safely, save lives. Lets make road safety a shared priority for all.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

This is contrary to claims of starvation and suffering of citizens.\n\nThe food relief programme has been a huge success, Mutsvangwa said. He continued to praise the Presidents efforts, referring to the assistance provided to vulnerable groups across the country.\n\nMutsvangwas comments, however, have been met with skepticism by many, as the economic situation in Zimbabwe remains dire.\n\nRising inflation, unemployment, and food insecurity continue to affect a large portion of the population.\n\nMany citizens report that they are still struggling to access basic necessities, with food prices soaring and the cost of living escalating.\n\nIn his address, Mutsvangwa also took aim at critics of the governments relief efforts, saying, Naysayers have been put to shame. We thank the President for his resilience in the face of such challenges.\n\nHowever, opposition leaders and civil society groups have rejected Mutsvangwas claims, pointing out that while food aid may have reached some, large portions of the population remain unaddressed. These critics argue that the scale of the food crisis in Zimbabwe is far greater than the government admits, with the vast majority of citizens still experiencing food insecurity.\n\nAs the political rhetoric continues, many Zimbabweans are left wondering if the governments promises can match the lived reality of a nation still struggling to recover from years of economic decline.\n\n",

            "content": "Harare, Zimbabwe In a bold step toward combating climate change and fostering sustainable development, Zimbabwe has officially launched a comprehensive carbon market framework. The initiative, unveiled at a high-profile event at the COP29 climate conference in Balu Azerbaijan, aims to position the country as a leader in carbon market development while advancing national commitments under the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe new framework, developed in collaboration with international environmental experts and local stakeholders, provides a regulated platform for the development and trade of Article 6 compliant carbon credits.\n\nBuilding on the experience of other early movers like Ghana, Zimbabwes framework includes several first of their kind innovations including:\n\nThe framework introduces clear guidelines for verifying, registering, and trading carbon credits, ensuring transparency and alignment with international standards. Clear guidelines not only guide investors through the project development process, but streamline the steps needed for end users to purchase and use Article 6 eligible credits.\n\nIn addition to requiring all project developers to increase their investment in community development, the government has pledged to allocate the majority of all carbon market proceeds to the National Climate Fund (NCF) to finance national climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives.\n\nThe framework comes at a crucial moment, paving the way for existing projects to transition to Article 6 eligibility. By generating Article 6 eligible credits, local developers will not only be able to achieve higher profits but will be able to access new markets including CORSIA and national compliance markets abroad.\n\nWith this framework, Zimbabwe joins a growing list of African nations leveraging carbon markets to address climate change while creating economic opportunities. The countrys abundant natural resources and commitment to sustainability make it well-positioned to become a key player in the global carbon trading ecosystem. Environmentalists and economists alike have welcomed the initiative, noting its potential to balance environmental concerns with economic development.\n\nThe carbon market is expected to commence operations in 2024, with pilot projects already underway. Experts believe this could unlock millions of dollars in green investments while reinforcing Zimbabwes role in the fight against global climate change.\n\n",

The worrisome tendency by Ministers and senior officials to absent themselves from meetings is untenable. Permanent Secretaries should ensure that in their absence, only directors and above should attend working party meetings.\n\nThe presidents remarks come amidst increasing reports of cabinet ministers allegedly loyal to Chiwenga snubbing key meetings, undermining Mnangagwas authority.\n\nSpeculation suggests that these absences are part of a coordinated effort to challenge Mnangagwas leadership ahead of Zanu PFs next elective congress.\n\nMnangagwa directed Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet, Martin Rushwaya, to tighten monitoring of ministerial attendance starting in 2025.\n\nHe warned that ministers and senior officials who fail to comply risk dire consequences.\n\nThe president also criticised deputy ministers, accusing them of being poorly prepared and undermining his authority by failing to participate effectively in government operations.\n\nIn cases where Deputy Ministers are assigned, they should be adequately capacitated to enable active participation in the requisite deliberations. To this end, I direct that Deputy Ministers must now sign performance contracts in 2025, Mnangagwa announced.\n\nThese measures follow Mnangagwas earlier introduction of performance contracts for senior government officials as part of his Vision 2030 agenda to foster a culture of accountability and servant leadership.\n\nMnangagwa and Chiwenga have shared a tumultuous political relationship since the military-assisted transition that brought Mnangagwa to power in 2017.\n\nChiwenga, who played a pivotal role in that transition, has grown increasingly influential, with his allies occupying key government and security positions.\n\nObservers note that Chiwengas loyalists have become emboldened, with their defiance of Mnangagwas directives interpreted as challenging his grip on power.\n\nThe presidents remarks about errant ministers couldbe seenas aveiledwarning to Chiwenga and his faction.\n\n",
