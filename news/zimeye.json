            "content": "By A Correspondent-A group opposed to President Emmerson Mnangagwas controversial 2030 agenda is reportedly planning to disrupt ZANU PFs annual national conference set to take place in Mutare this week.\n\nSources say the anti-Mnangagwa faction  made up of disgruntled senior officials and provincial delegates  intends to embarrass the President by derailing discussions at the conference, which runs from October 13 to 18 at the Mutare Polytechnic Pavilion Grounds.\n\nThe plan is reportedly part of a growing backlash against efforts by Mnangagwas loyalists to extend his rule beyond the constitutional two-term limit. Insiders toldZimEyethat some within the partys structures are mobilising quietly to resist the so-called 2030 agenda, which they view as unconstitutional and a direct threat to ZANU PFs internal democracy.\n\nTheres a serious mood of resistance building up, said one insider. The conference is no longer just a routine gathering  its a test of loyalty, and some are ready to defy orders from the top.\n\nTensions over the issue spilled into the open last week when ZANU PF Womens League boss, Mabel Chinomona, publicly warned against spoilers bent on sabotaging the event. Speaking at a Womens League empowerment programme at Chiwetu Training Centre in Makoni West Constituency, the visibly agitated politburo member read the riot act to party members.\n\nWe have the conference which is coming up in Mutare next week. We dont want people who are destroying our party. Dont destroy your own party, Chinomona said.I am ready to suspend people who are spreading falsehoods ahead of the conference. We dont want that, please.\n\nHer remarks exposed the growing panic within the ruling party as internal divisions threaten to overshadow Mnangagwas leadership ahead of the conference.\n\nThe tensions largely stem from a campaign by Mnangagwa loyalists pushing for a constitutional amendment that would allow him to stay in office until 2030. Senior party members opposed to the move argue that it violates the spirit of Zimbabwes 2013 Constitution, which restricts presidents to two five-year terms.\n\nIronically, Chinomona herself was part of the infamous 2004 Tsholotsho Declaration  a failed plot to alter ZANU PFs leadership structure in Mnangagwas favour  which led to her suspension along with several provincial chairpersons, including current Speaker of Parliament and now party secretary-general Jacob Mudenda.\n\nAt the same event in Makoni West, Information Minister Jenfan Muswere and ICT Minister Tatenda Mavetera  both known Mnangagwa loyalists  pledged allegiance to the President.\n\nWe have a training centre here at Chiwetu; its going to train women and youths, Muswere said, carefully avoiding the succession debate.Mavetera, however, was blunt: We are also saying that our President should rule until 2030.\n\nManicaland Provincial Affairs Minister Misheck Mugadza also called for unity and announced plans to build a rehabilitation centre in the province  a gesture seen as an attempt to downplay the rising tensions.\n\nHowever, behind the rhetoric of unity and development, the Mutare conference has become a battleground for power within ZANU PF. Party insiders say some provincial delegates aligned to Vice President Constantino Chiwengas faction may use procedural disruptions, walkouts, or coordinated protests to embarrass the President during the proceedings.\n\nIf the anti-Mnangagwa group succeeds, the Mutare conference could mark the most visible sign of defiance against Mnangagwas leadership since the 2017 military-assisted transition that brought him to power  exposing how deeply divided the ruling party has become over its future direction.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent-President Emmerson Mnangagwa faces possible humiliation at ZANU PFs upcoming annual conference in Mutare amid reports that a faction aligned to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga is crafting a new strategy to derail Mnangagwas bid to extend his stay in power beyond 2028.\n\nZimEye can reveal that disgruntled ZANU PF officials  believed to be sympathetic to Chiwenga  are plotting to disrupt the Mutare conference, scheduled for October 1318, in protest against the controversial campaign to push Mnangagwas presidency to 2030.\n\nSources within the ruling party say the Chiwenga camp has quietly mobilised provincial delegates opposed to the 2030 Agenda, arguing that any attempt to amend the Constitution to extend Mnangagwas tenure undermines democratic principles and the partys legacy.\n\nTensions boiled oveer last week when ZANU PF Womens League boss, Mabel Chinomona, publicly warned against spoilers seeking to sabotage the conference. Speaking at a Womens League empowerment programme at Chiwetu Training Centre in Makoni West Constituency, the visibly agitated politburo member read the riot act to party members.\n\nWe have the conference which is coming up in Mutare next week. We dont want people who are destroying our party. Dont destroy your own party, she warned.I am ready to suspend anyone spreading falsehoods ahead of the conference.\n\nHer remarks exposed growing panic within ZANU PF as factional tensions threaten to overshadow Mnangagwas leadership ahead of the 22nd Annual National Peoples Conference, to be held at the Mutare Polytechnic Pavilion Grounds.\n\nThe fault lines have deepened over the push by Mnangagwa loyalists to engineer a constitutional amendment allowing him to remain in power until 2030  a move fiercely resisted by senior figures aligned to Chiwenga. The Vice Presidents allies argue that Mnangagwas insistence on extending his term violates the spirit of the 2013 Constitution and betrays the promise of leadership renewal made during the 2017 military intervention that ousted Robert Mugabe.\n\nIronically, Chinomona herself was part of the 2004 Tsholotsho Declaration  a failed bid to alter ZANU PFs leadership structure in Mnangagwas favour  which led to her suspension alongside other provincial chairpersons, including current Speaker of Parliament and now party secretary-general, Jacob Mudenda.\n\nAt the same event, Information Minister Jenfan Muswere and ICT Minister Tatenda Mavetera  both loyal to Mnangagwa  tried to project unity.\n\nWe have a training centre here at Chiwetu; its going to train women and youths, Muswere said, carefully avoiding the succession debate.Mavetera, however, was more direct, declaring: We are also saying that our President should rule until 2030.\n\nManicaland Provincial Affairs Minister Misheck Mugadza also attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, urging women to participate in empowerment projects while announcing plans to build a rehabilitation centre in the province.\n\nBut behind the scenes, the Mutare conference is shaping up to be a test of loyalty  and a potential battleground between Mnangagwas loyalists and Chiwengas camp. Party insiders say a silent rebellion is brewing, with some provincial delegates threatening a walkout should the 2030 agenda be tabled formally for endorsement.\n\nIf the Chiwenga faction succeeds in mobilising enough resistance, Mnangagwa could face his most embarrassing moment since the 2017 military-assisted transition that propelled him to power  exposing just how fractured the ruling party has become under his leadership.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent-Vice President Constantino Chiwengas hopes of succeeding President Emmerson Mnangagwa have suffered a major blow after ZANU PF announced plans to use its forthcoming annual conference to endorse Mnangagwas continued rule until 2030  effectively sidelining his deputy and cementing the presidents dominance over the ruling party.\n\nThe endorsement, to be formalized at the Mutare conference next week, marks a turning point in ZANU PFs succession politics and reinforces Mnangagwas control following months of factional tensions. It also follows last years controversial resolution to extend his leadership beyond the traditional two-term framework  a move that widened divisions between Mnangagwa loyalists and the camp aligned to Chiwenga.\n\nParty sources say infighting has intensified in recent months, spilling into heated Politburo meetings. In one such meeting last month, Chiwenga reportedly presented a dossier accusing some of Mnangagwas inner circle of grand corruption  an act interpreted by many as an open challenge to the presidents authority.\n\nBut in what analysts view as a strategic counterattack, ZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa publicly reaffirmed the partys unwavering support for Mnangagwa, dismissing talk of factionalism and hinting that those harbouring presidential ambitions would be crushed by the collective will of the party.\n\nThe organs, the provinces and the party membership are quite happy with His Excellencys stewardship of the party and membership, Mutsvangwa toldThe Zimbabwe Independent.\n\nTheir dictum is: If it aint broke, why try to fix it? The delegates have expressly and vehemently resolved to continue with His Excellency till 2030. They have drowned out other noises of unbridled, undeserving and self-centred ambition.\n\nMutsvangwa said the Mutare conference would demonstrate party unity and silence critics, a statement interpreted as an indirect rebuke to Chiwengas faction.\n\nThe cacophony of social media trolling has no resonance in the closed membership of the organs, provinces and structures of ZANU PF, he added, describing dissenters as detractors, regime change practitioners and agents of political destabilisation.\n\nThe conference, to be held from next Friday to October 18 at the Mutare Polytechnic Pavilion Grounds, will bring together around 4,000 delegates under the themeAttainment of Vision 2030 Through Economic Empowerment and Value Addition.\n\nZANU PFs Director of Information and Publicity, Farai Marapira, also dismissed speculation about succession, emphasizing that the matter was not part of the conference agenda.\n\nSuccession is dealt with at congress, and we are not going to congress  we are going to a conference, Marapira said.\n\nThe issue of succession is not a concern within ZANU PF. We are simply going to check up on the mandate we received from the people in 2023.\n\nWhile Mnangagwas allies frame the 2030 agenda as a continuation of hisVision 2030economic blueprint, critics argue it is a calculated political manoeuvre to neutralize Chiwenga and tighten the presidents grip on power ahead of the 2027 elective congress.\n\nWith the Mutare conference expected to rubber-stamp the extension, Mnangagwa appears to have decisively outmanoeuvred his deputy  consolidating his hold on both the party and the state, and confirming that Chiwengas long-anticipated power bid has suffered a significant defeat.\n\n",

Yet some political analysts have voiced concern that such affiliates may be used to advance political agendas that stretch beyond constitutional limits.\n\nOne of the main issues with these 4ED affiliates is that they appear less about national development and more about cementing political loyalty, said an unnamed political observer. The timing and messaging clearly suggest an effort to shape public perception for extending Mnangagwas stay in power.\n\nAnother analyst added: Movements like Masowe 4ED are part of a broader strategy to manufacture grassroots legitimacy for a third-term agenda. Its political theatre dressed as citizen mobilisation.\n\nThe launch is expected to attract senior government officials, ruling party members, and religious leaders, underscoring ongoing efforts to consolidate support for Mnangagwas Vision 2030 across different sectors of society.\n\n",

It reminds us time and again that no leader, no matter how powerful, can rule over a population that does not want them. Leadership is not about coercion or control; it is about legitimacy, trust, and the consent of the governed.\n\nAcross generations and continents, the story has been the same. From monarchs who lost their thrones to presidents who fell from grace, the moment a leader loses the support of the people, their authority begins to crumble. You can silence voices, manipulate systems, and use force for a while  but you cannot extinguish the will of the masses forever.\n\nTrue leadership is earned, not imposed. It thrives on respect, service, and the ability to listen. When citizens begin to see leadership as self-serving, oppressive, or detached from their daily struggles, history starts counting down to an inevitable end.\n\nThose who ignore this lesson do so at their peril  because history will tell you, and tell the world, that you can never, and will never, lead a population that does not want you to rule.\n\nEngineer Jacob Kudzayi Mutisi\n\n +263 772 278 161\n\n",
