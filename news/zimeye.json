Come on, you know I never said that. I just said that man did a lot of good for this country, let us not mistreat him. Lets allow him to finish his race well. Say Hallelujah.

The way of peace.\n\nSay Hallelujah. There are some people described in thebookofRomans, they dont know the way of peace, they think everything must just be settled with destruction. somebody say hallelujah. One day I heard one man of God speaking to the comrades, and he said comrades, you have fought and you have put food before us, and food is not eaten with axes and spears. Hallelujah, you use peaceful instruments. It is time for peace in the nation of Zimbabwe, and comrade Geza, we bless you, we pray for you.

            "content": "ZimEye Editorial: The End of a Captured Revolution in Zimbabwe\n\nZimbabwes war veterans have finally come to a painful realization: their liberation project was capturedlong ago, and right under their noses.\n\nA monster grew out of what was meant to be a peoples revolution. That monster has destroyed not only the country and its institutions, but also the very political party that once united the two liberation armies.\n\nNow, something must be doneand urgently.\n\nAcross the border in South Africa, we are seeing the emergence of Jacob Zumas MK partya grassroots, black liberation movement. But in Zimbabwe, a similar formation is rising with far more momentum and urgency. Unlike South Africas MK, which may take years to enter government, Zimbabwes new movement could assume power in a matter of days.\n\nThis is all happening amid a growing body of evidence that Emmerson Mnangagwa was never a liberator. He was, and remains, an infiltratorclearly handled by the Rhodesian Special Branch to sabotage the liberation effort from within. By 1980, according to multiple official disclosures, Zimbabwes post-independence button is supposed to be reset. After the Lancaster House Agreement and the 1980 elections, the plan was to re-establish a law-and-order concern that can be spinned back to yesteryear with a single button.\n\nthe operator would be a criminal who by then is or was supposed to have eliminated true liberators like Herbert Chitepo, Josiah Tongogara, and even Robert Mugabe. The result is what we now see: Zimbabwe run as a Rhodesian-style Law and Order concern, under Mnangagwa.\n\nNext week, starting Monday, the regime is expected to block protests in urban areas. Mnangagwa will likely respond with threats and provocation. This could quickly spiral into violence, pushing the country toward a Rwanda-like scenario. Fear, hopelessness, and provocationnot just military forcecould catalyze the violence.\n\nIn such a volatile environment, communities may turn on one another. Revenge attacks may erupt within villages, locations, and townships. Government installations and police stations could face petrol bombings. A COVID-style lockdown may be imposed, but it will not stop the chaos.\n\nAs retaliation from Mnangagwas supporters intensifies, a cycle of violence will feed itself. The army may hesitate to actnot because it lacks capacity, but because ZIPRA elements now in command of the military fear being accused of launching a coup on behalf of ZAPU or ZANU. That political paralysis could cost Zimbabwe precious time and lives.\n\nBut eventually, the demand for decisive action will become overwhelming. Once the massesand liberation war veterans from both ZANLA and ZIPRAcall on the army to intervene, it will likely act in order to save lives and the state itself.\n\nAt that point, ZANU-PF may not survive. A new political configuration may emergeperhaps something akin to South Africas MK Party, built on a genuine ZIPRA-ZANLA coalition.\n\nThis moment could be Zimbabwes worst tragedyor its best opportunity. Out of the rubble, the country might finally begin to work again.- ZimEye\n\n",

            "content": "By Dorrothy Moyo | March 30, 2025\n\nHarare  Zimbabwean social media was set ablaze this morning after media personality Thomas Chizhanje dropped a cryptic post on Facebook, triggering a spiritual frenzy and a flood of wild interpretations, gospel allusions, and hilarity from his followers.\n\nIn the now-viral post, Chizhanje declared, Goliath akatanga achi saiza David. But kumagumo kune nyaya!! Loosely translated, he was referring to the biblical battle between David and Goliathsuggesting that initial appearances of strength may not determine the ultimate outcome. But to his followers, the post carried far more than spiritual reflectionit was prophecy.\n\nWithin minutes, the comment section turned into a firestorm of reactions. From one follower saying, Very true! to another humorously recounting a mishap involving anointing oil used to fry eggs, the responses ranged from the spiritual to the downright comedic.\n\nSome users speculated whether the post was veiled commentary on Zimbabwes political landscape. Others jokingly questioned who the modern-day David might be, with one follower cheekily warning, Tisataure mazita, (lets not mention names).\n\nA particularly viral comment read: Dorcas ndiye watiri kuda kumamisa matako ega ega iwayo, further confusing readers on whether this had morphed from biblical allegory into personal vendetta or satire.\n\nOne top fan even pleaded to upload an audio version of the phrase, requesting to sing the now-iconic line kumagumo kune nyaya, hinting at the phrases potential as the next gospel hit or political jingle.\n\nProphetic Shift or Classic Thomas?\n\nKnown for his sharp wit and cultural commentary, Thomas Chizhanje has often blurred the line between satire and spiritual depth. But todays post has followers wonderinghas he crossed over into the prophetic realm? Or is this just another masterpiece of digital theatre?\n\nAs comments like Pacharutswa paTaundi and Saka David ndiyani? continue pouring in, its clear: whatever his intention, Thomas has once again captured the national imagination.\n\nWhether prophet, preacher, or provocateurone thing is certain: kumagumo kune nyaya.\n\nStay tuned as ZimEye continues to follow this developing story.\n\nWould you like a graphic or meme to go with this for social media?\n\n",

This could be a seasonal trend, but we urge parents to remain vigilant and seek medical attention if their child exhibits severe symptoms such as high fever, sneezing, and coughing.\n\nNgwenya emphasized the importance of keeping severely ill children at home to prevent the spread of infection, particularly in school settings.\n\nLocal pharmacies have also reported a significant spike in demand for childrens flu medication over the past three weeks. A health expert noted, The rapid increase in parents seeking medication for their toddlers suggests the flu bug is spreading quickly. Unfortunately, weve temporarily sold out of childrens flu medication, but were working to restock as soon as possible.\n\n",
