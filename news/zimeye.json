            "content": "By Prosper Tiringindi\n\nIn my recent travels across East and West Africa, I delved into an issue that threatens the very essence of civil society across the continent: the rise of Government-Owned Non-Governmental Organizations (GONGOs). This phenomenon, though deeply entrenched in Southern Africa, is not confined to one region. It is an African problem, as governments increasingly seek to co-opt and control the work of non-profit organizations, undermining their independence and core mandate.\n\nWhile governments justify GONGOs as tools to streamline development or protect national interests, their true intent is often more sinister. GONGOs are being used to suppress dissent, erode the power of authentic civil society organizations, and push state propaganda disguised as humanitarian work.\n\nGONGOs: The African Experience\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the government has launched aggressive measures to control non-profit organizations under the guise of regulating their activities. The recently passed Private Voluntary Organizations (PVO) Bill is a classic example. It introduces stringent rules for NGOs, limits funding sources, and empowers the state to interfere in their governance. Genuine NGOs advocating for human rights, transparency, and accountability face intimidation, arrests, and raids, as witnessed in cases like Bikita Residents Association and Zimbabwe Young Sisters Empowerment.\n\nBut Zimbabwe is not alone in this struggle. During my visit to East Africa, I engaged with Maasai communities, a semi-nomadic ethnic group indigenous to Kenya and Tanzania. The Maasai have a rich cultural heritage and a deeply ingrained sense of autonomy. It was remarkable to hear their outright rejection of GONGOs, which they see as extensions of government control aimed at exploiting their lands and undermining their rights.\n\nThe Maasai expressed concerns that GONGOs were being used to displace them from their ancestral lands under the pretext of development and conservation. One elder I interviewed stated, We do not need the government to speak for us. We have lived with our own laws for generations, and we reject any organization that comes with the governments hand.\n\nThis sentiment echoes across Africa, where indigenous groups, community organizations, and genuine NGOs are pushing back against GONGOs. These state-controlled entities not only dilute the efforts of authentic non-profits but also redirect funding meant for grassroots development into the coffers of government-aligned groups.\n\nThe GONGO Problem in West Africa\n\nIn West Africa, the problem manifests differently but is no less troubling. Countries like Nigeria and Ghana have seen governments use GONGOs to counter criticism from human rights organizations and independent media. These GONGOs often present themselves as defenders of national pride, accusing legitimate NGOs of being agents of foreign influence.\n\nDuring my visit, I observed how GONGOs in West Africa are used as instruments of propaganda, mobilizing public opinion against international human rights standards and portraying genuine activists as enemies of progress. This deliberate erosion of trust in civil society weakens the very fabric of democratic governance.\n\nWhy GONGOs Are a Threat\n\nThe rise of GONGOs undermines the principles of transparency, accountability, and inclusivity that non-profits are meant to uphold. They:\n\nThe Maasai Model: A Beacon of Resistance\n\nThe Maasai peoples rejection of GONGOs offers a powerful lesson in resistance. Their steadfast commitment to their laws, culture, and autonomy highlights the importance of grassroots empowerment. The Maasais approach to governance is community-centered, with decisions made collectively rather than imposed by external entities.\n\nTheir resistance to GONGOs is a call to action for other African communities and civil society organizations. It underscores the need for solidarity in opposing state control and protecting the independence of non-profits.\n\nA Pan-African Call to Action\n\nAs I continue my work on this project, it is clear that the fight against GONGOs is not just a regional issue but a continental one. Governments across Africa must be held accountable for their attempts to control civil society. This requires:\n\nStrengthened Advocacy: Civil society organizations must collaborate across borders to expose and resist GONGOs.\n\nInternational Pressure: Donors and international bodies must ensure that their funding supports genuine non-profits, not state-controlled entities.\n\nGrassroots Mobilization: Communities like the Maasai must be empowered to defend their rights and autonomy against government interference.\n\nThe rise of GONGOs threatens to undo decades of progress made by civil society in Africa. But as the Maasai have shown, resistance is not only possible but necessary. Together, we can ensure that non-profits remain a force for good, independent from the grip of government control.\n\nProsper TiringindiHuman Rights Activist and Advocate for Civil Society Independence\n\n",
