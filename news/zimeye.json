            "content": "By A Correspondent| Philip Mataranyika, co-founder of Nyaradzo Group, has reportedly separated from his wife, Mavis, after years of marriage due to irreconcilable differences, sources close to the family have revealed.\n\nThe couple, once regarded as a model of success and stability, allegedly parted ways following claims of infidelity on Mataranyikas part. According to insiders, he was involved with female family friends, a discovery that ultimately led Mavis to end the marriage despite undergoing extensive counseling in an attempt to salvage their relationship.\n\nNyati had been unfaithful to Maiguru for several years, a family source disclosed. He even had affairs with well-known female business associates.\n\nSources indicate that Mataranyika has since relocated to the United Kingdom, where he is reportedly living with a woman of mixed race.\n\nHe is now in a relationship with a colored woman and has built Mavis a mansion in Goromonzi, where she is currently engaged in horticulture, said an anonymous insider.\n\nAlthough Mataranyika has largely maintained a low profile, his name was previously linked to socialite and former Nyaradzo international brand ambassador, Madame Boss. The connection was brought to light in controversial claims by whistleblower Tatelicious after Madame Bosss abrupt removal from the ambassadorial role.\n\nThe estranged couple shares three childrenNigel, Tapiwa, and Tendekaiwho have witnessed their parents rise from modest beginnings to the helm of a multimillion-dollar business empire.\n\nThe financial implications of the separation remain undisclosed, including the specifics of Maviss divorce settlement. The couples wealth spans across multiple ventures, including Calundike Exports and Eureka Finance, businesses reportedly built from Mataranyikas earnings during his decade-long tenure at Old Mutual.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions are said to be mounting within Nyaradzo Groups leadership. Co-founders Farai Rwodzi and his uncle, Timothy Chiganze, are allegedly unhappy with Mataranyikas unilateral decision-making, particularly regarding diaspora investments.\n\nAttempts to reach Mataranyika and Mavis for comment were unsuccessful, as both remained unreachable at the time of publication.\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri\n\nIn Zimbabwe, a nationwide stay away was staged by suffering residents who are increasingly frustrated by the countrys escalating crisis. The public demonstration of discontent was prompted by worsening economic conditions, corruption, and an ongoing political stalemate. However, despite the evident frustration among the citizens, Zanu PF Youth League Deputy Commissar Taurai Kandishaya insisted on Monday that it was business as usual in the capital city of Harare, describing the situation as calm and under control.\n\nKandishayas comments came in stark contrast to the images captured across the city that day. Photographs of the capitals streets show an alarming emptiness, with businesses shuttered, vehicles few and far between, and the usual bustle of city life absent. The contrast between the political narrative and the visual reality seemed to underscore the deepening divide between the governments perception and the lived experiences of many Zimbabweans.\n\nIts business as usual. Our people love peace. They dont want to be used by detractors. Those staying away are doing so for safety only, Kandishaya remarked during his statement. His attempt to downplay the growing dissatisfaction among the populace was seen by many as a reflection of the disconnection between government officials and the struggles facing ordinary citizens.\n\nThe mass stay away, which was organized to protest against the worsening economic conditions, power cuts, fuel shortages, and inflation, was also a show of solidarity with the opposition and prominent figures calling for change. One such figure gaining significant support is war veteran Blessed Geza, who has been outspoken in his demand for President Emmerson Mnangagwas resignation. Gezas call for Mnangagwa to step down is shared by a growing portion of Zimbabweans, particularly among those who feel that the current leadership has failed to address the countrys most pressing issues.\n\nKandishayas comments about safety and peace also appear to ignore the climate of fear and repression in which many Zimbabweans find themselves. Critics have pointed to heavy-handed tactics by security forces, often targeting opposition activists, protestors, and any public figures speaking out against the government. The governments narrative of peace and stability stands in contrast to the real experiences of citizens who fear arrest, harassment, and violence for voicing their dissent.\n\nAs the nation grapples with increasing social and economic pressures, the growing public unrest is unlikely to subside. The disparity between official statements and the lived reality of Zimbabweans may only intensify the calls for meaningful political change. Many now look to figures like Blessed Geza for leadership, as calls for President Mnangagwas resignation continue to gain momentum.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nOn Monday morning, a peaceful protest in Central Harare was abruptly interrupted when police dispersed demonstrators, despite claims of peaceful intent by the organizers. A group of Harare residents gathered briefly near the Central Business District (CBD) to voice their opposition to President Emmerson Mnangagwas third-term agenda, but their efforts were swiftly thwarted by law enforcement.\n\nThe protest, which was organized by war veteran Blessed Geza, was part of a growing movement calling for the government to address the countrys political and economic crisis. Geza, a prominent figure in the opposition, had urged citizens to take to the streets to oppose Mnangagwas bid for a third term, which he and others argue would further entrench the current regimes hold on power.\n\nIn a statement leading up to the protest, Geza explained that the demonstrations were intended to be peaceful and were meant to signal widespread dissatisfaction with the governments direction. We are protesting because we cannot allow a third term for Mnangagwa. The people are suffering, and this government is doing nothing to address our needs, Geza said.\n\nHowever, when the protesters assembled in Central Harare, their gathering was short-lived. Police, who had been heavily deployed in the area, moved quickly to disperse the crowd. Eyewitnesses reported that officers used force to scatter the protesters, creating a tense atmosphere in the heart of the city.\n\nOne protester, who asked to remain anonymous, shared their frustration: We just wanted to express ourselves, but the police came and chased us away. We are tired of this government. We have the right to protest, but they just want to silence us.\n\nAnother resident, who was caught up in the incident, voiced their concern over the heavy-handed tactics used by law enforcement: We were not violent; we just wanted to make our voices heard. But instead of listening, the police treated us like criminals. Its clear that the government doesnt care about its people.\n\nThe swift police action reflects ongoing concerns over the governments handling of public dissent. Critics argue that the use of force to suppress protests is a sign of growing authoritarianism under President Mnangagwas rule.\n\nDespite the disruption, the message behind the protest is resonating with many Harare residents. As the country faces worsening economic conditions, the call for political change continues to gain momentum. While the police may have succeeded in dispersing the crowd on Monday, the underlying dissatisfaction with Mnangagwas leadership remains palpable. As one protester put it, They can chase us away today, but we will keep fighting for our rights.\n\n",
