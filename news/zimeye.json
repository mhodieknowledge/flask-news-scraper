            "content": "By Health Reporter- The recent cuts to USAID funding for NGOs in Zimbabwe have severely impacted the countrys sex workers, particularly in Mutare, where access to vital HIV prevention medication has been disrupted.\n\nSex workers operating near the Forbes Border Postwho primarily serve truck drivers and other transient clientssay the withdrawal of USAID-supported organisations has left them without access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication that significantly reduces the risk of contracting HIV.\n\nPrEP, which involves a daily antiretroviral pill (typically a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine), has been proven to reduce HIV infection by up to 99% when taken consistently. It is specifically targeted at high-risk groups, including sex workers, injection drug users, and people in relationships with HIV-positive partners.\n\nWithout this critical support, sex workers in Mutare say they are now more vulnerablenot only to HIV but also to a host of social and economic hardships.\n\nIn response, the Senate Thematic Committee on HIV and AIDS has launched a nationwide consultation to assess access to HIV prevention and sexual and reproductive health services among sex workers. During a recent visit to a well-known hideout near Forbes Border Post, senators heard harrowing stories of survival, discrimination, and pleas for support.\n\nRophina, a sex worker who spoke during the visit, said the absence of PrEP is exposing them to serious risk.\n\nWe are seeing more clients refusing to use protection. Some truck drivers even abandon us on the road without paying. Business is down, and competition is stiff, especially with younger girls joining the trade, she said.\n\nRophina added that drug abuseoften facilitated by foreign truckersis becoming rampant among younger sex workers, leading some to default on their medication.\n\nThats why we are appealing for the government to make PrEP available at all times. Even with protection, condoms can burst. We also need help tackling drug abuse, which is worsening our situation, she said.\n\nA middle-aged sex worker, using the pseudonym Margarine, urged the government to provide vocational training and educational scholarships to help them exit the industry.\n\nMany of us passed O-Level and A-Level exams. We just need opportunitiesscholarships, training, or business supportto transition into decent work, she said.\n\nThe thematic committees chairperson, Senator Angeline Tongogara, said the visits are part of a fact-finding mission to evaluate the accessibility and effectiveness of HIV and reproductive health services for sex workers. The goal, she said, is to reduce HIV prevalence and improve the well-being of this marginalised group.\n\nWe are gathering insights to make recommendations that will enhance access to health services for sex workers, said Senator Tongogara.\n\nNational AIDS Council (NAC) Director of Monitoring and Evaluation, Mr. Amen Mpofu, confirmed that current PrEP supplies are now restricted to pregnant and breastfeeding women following new US Government funding policies.\n\nWe have sufficient antiretroviral drugs for treatment. The Global Fund is supporting 710,000 patients, and the US has ordered ARVs that will last until September 2025, said Mr. Mpofu.\n\nHe warned, however, that the biggest casualties of the aid cuts are PrEP and voluntary male circumcision programmes.\n\nTo cover the shortfall, NAC will procure PrEP through domestic resources, including the AIDS Levy, which is a critical home-grown solution, he added.\n\nMr. Mpofu urged government planning for a future without external support after 2026, calling for local funding strategies to sustain HIV prevention programmes.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nDespite growing concerns about shortage of essential drugs, government insists there is adequate supply of Anti- Retroviral drugs (ARVs) in Zimbabwe.\n\nBut questions remain as to whether the official narrative aligns with on-the-ground realities.\n\nAddressing the media on Friday, 16 May, Health and Child Care Minister Douglas Mombeshora dismissed reports of ARV shortages and promised accountability regarding troubling allegations of patient exploitation.\n\nThe Ministry takes these reports with the utmost seriousness, said Mombeshora.\n\nAs the custodians of public health, we are committed to addressing these concerns openly and truthfully, while ensuring that the rights and dignity of all people living with HIV are protected.\n\nMombeshora categorically denied claims that the country was running out of life-saving ARV medication, asserting that Zimbabwes stock levels remain stable.\n\nThere is no risk of stock-outs for all treatment regimens, he declared. According to the Minister, the country currently has eight months worth of adult first-line ARVs and four months of paediatric first-line ARVs in reserve.\n\nHe further detailed that the Ministry follows a minimum-maximum inventory system to monitor supply levels, with 14 months as the maximum and 8 months as the minimum threshold. Shipments of a new fixed-dose combination paediatric ARV are also expected to arrive in July, adding another five months coverage.\n\nHowever, his reassurances contrast with growing public outcry from areas like Chiredzi, where some patients report being forced to pay for ARVs or being denied access altogether. Social media has been awash with claims of healthcare workers selling drugs illegally and extorting vulnerable patients.\n\nMombeshora acknowledged these concerns, saying: Immediate investigations are underway, and any healthcare worker found guilty will face swift disciplinary action. No one entrusted with the duty of care should ever exploit the vulnerable.\n\nHe reiterated that ARVs are provided free of charge and urged patients who encounter demands for payment to report such cases directly to authorities. Contact the Provincial Medical Director, the District Medical Officer, the Zimbabwe Republic Police, or my office, he said.\n\nDelays in drug shipments earlier this yearcaused by a Stop Work Order from the U.S. Governmentalso fuelled fears of shortages. Mombeshora admitted the disruptions but said domestic intervention bridged the gap.\n\nOur ART medicine requirements for 2025 are fully funded. We mobilised domestic resources through the National AIDS Council to ensure uninterrupted supply, he said.\n\nStill, some observers remain sceptical, pointing out inconsistencies between government claims and patient experiences in clinics.\n\nAs public scrutiny intensifies, the Ministry has pledged to protect gains made toward the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets to end AIDS by 2030. Yet, the pressing question persists: if there is truly no shortage, why are patients in some areas still struggling to access free treatment?\n\nUntil investigations are concluded and accountability enforced, the governments claims may continue to be met with doubt from those on the ground.\n\n",

A political support letter he publicised dated 2011, hes used to encourage airport security violations, has no such wording, and ZimEye wrote to the embassy requesting the alleged disclosure. Chinono success in evading scrutiny last year alone encouraged at least two people to violate airport security, and a friend in Aug 2024 moved on to try to hack Gatwick Airport database to delete a fake name she used in the same notorious year, 2001, when Chinono rushed to also change his name. This is the same year, many identity scammers (including the 9/11 bombers ) committed injustices against the US and UK airport jurisdictions due to technological loopholes only closed up 14 years later.\n\nResponding to questions, the embassy publicised their response stating broadly, that it has never at any time issued a police clearance check. The British Embassy in Harare does not issue police clearances, the statement read. The embassy then afterwards directed Mr Chinono and anyone being potentially misled by his statements, saying You can apply for a basic disclosure here:\n\nChinono @daddyhope was reached for comment.\n\nThe public now expect Mr Chinono to disclose the UK company he says financed his first property in a 50,000 sportscar loan in 1996.

He recalled the events of 2017, when the military led by Chiwenga intervened to remove President Robert Mugabe, claiming he was surrounded by corrupt officials. The operation led by General Chiwengawe all know it, said Geza.\n\nHe stated that Chiwenga invoked the Constitution, saying the military had a duty to act when the Constitution was under threat. The man next to him was General SB Moyo. I remember his words: We are not entering to do anything else other than address the thieves surrounding the president.'\n\nGeza criticized President Emmerson Mnangagwa, saying, What shocks me is that the man who is ruling now had run away to South Africa.

Geza blamed the current crisis on the decision to reinstate Mnangagwa, saying, The problems we are now seeing in the country are because of that decision by the generals.\n\nHe called on Chiwenga to take responsibility and correct the mistake, saying, The ones who must fix this are the generalsGeneral Chiwenga. I said to Comrade Bombshell, and the people are saying: Please remove this person you imposed.'\n\nReferring to a liberation war anthem, Geza said, Chiwenga and the generals know a wartime song called Nzira dzemaSoja dzekuzvibatana nadzothe soldiers code of conduct.

            "content": "By A Correspondent- A Nelson Chamisa close senior member of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), Gift Gonese, who contested the 2023 general election under the party banner, has distanced himself from the faction led by Sengezo Tshabangu and registered to contest the upcoming Gutu East by-election as an independent candidate.\n\nGonese will face off against Zivanai Nzvenga of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA) and Zanu PFs Zvavaresha Masvingise in the by-election scheduled for June 14, 2025.\n\nThis latest development marks yet another high-profile defection from the Tshabangu-led CCC faction, amid growing divisions and contestations over leadership and candidate selection within the opposition movement.\n\nDespite Citizens Coalition for Change founder Nelson Chamisa currently on political sabbatical, sources indicate that Gonese still enjoys significant backing from Chamisas loyalists, who are rallying behind his independent candidacy.\n\nSpeaking toThe Masvingo Mirrorafter filing his nomination papers at the Masvingo Magistrates Court, Gonese alleged that the 2023 election was rigged in favour of Zanu PF. He said the people of Gutu East were fully aware of what he termed electoral manipulation and expressed confidence in his prospects.\n\nPeople in Gutu East are well aware that elections to Zanu PF are about rigging. They know that the ground is not even, and the path to the election is thorny. I am back in the ring at the invitation of the citizens. We have done a lot of groundwork, and we are confident of delivering victory, said Gonese.\n\nThe nomination process was conducted in Court 2 of the Masvingo Magistrates Court before a Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) nomination officer and two assessors.\n\nNCA candidate Zivanai Nzvenga acknowledged that his party is still small and was unable to field a candidate in 2023. However, he expressed optimism about his chances in the upcoming poll.\n\nZanu PFs candidate, Zvavaresha Masvingiseformer councillor for Ward 14 in Gutu Eastsaid he had done his homework. However, his candidacy is not without controversy. A faction within Zanu PF is reportedly unhappy with the outcome of the partys primary election process, alleging that the primaries were rigged in Masvingises favour and vowing to undermine his campaign.\n\nMasvingise is running under the Zanu PF banner following the expulsion of former MP Benjamin Ganyiwa, a move some believe was politically motivated due to Ganyiwas alleged links to Vice President Constantino Chiwengas faction.\n\n",
