            "content": "Upper Manyame Sub-Catchment Council\n\nBy A Correspondent | ZimEye |A resident has come forward with shocking allegations of corruption and unethical practices at the Upper Manyame Sub-Catchment Council after experiencing frustration while attempting to make a payment for a borehole permit. The incident, which occurred today, has sparked outrage over the alleged abuse of authority and lack of transparency in government-related institutions.\n\nAccording to the complainant, they were denied the ability to swipe their bank card to make the payment without producing a national IDa demand that many feel is excessive and unnecessary. What made the situation more questionable is that paying in USD cash was allowed without any such requirement.\n\nI was told I could only swipe if I produced my ID, yet paying in cash required no such proof, the complainant said. This inconsistency shows clear favoritism towards cash payments, which raises serious questions about financial integrity and transparency.\n\nConcerns Over Transparency\n\nThe complainant noted that a notice was posted at the cash office clearly outlining the ID requirement for swiping, further reinforcing suspicions about deliberate efforts to inconvenience card payments in favor of cash transactions. Why would they make it harder to pay digitally unless theres something fishy happening with cash payments? the complainant asked.\n\nWater Access Crisis\n\nThe allegations are made worse by frustrations over the councils poor service delivery. Despite charging fees for borehole drilling and water usage, the complainant reported that the council does not supply water to their area. Access to water is a basic human right. How can they charge us exorbitant fees and then make the process of paying unnecessarily difficult?\n\nThe situation has reignited anger over the state of water services in Zimbabwe, where residents often bear the cost of drilling their own boreholes while receiving little to no support from local authorities.\n\nCalls for Action\n\nThe complainant is calling on the Government of Zimbabwe and anti-corruption agencies to investigate the alleged misconduct and hold those responsible accountable. This is unacceptable. Financial intelligence authorities must step in, and those involved should face justice. Access to water is a right, not a privilege, they said.\n\nallegations.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\n",

His remains were later recovered from the crocodiles. This incident, along with another case of an 18-year-old boy drowning in prohibited waters at Matobo National Park, has sparked renewed calls for adherence to park rules and safety regulations.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) released a statement addressing the incidents. We wish to remind all visitors into Parks Estates of the importance of adhering to the rules and regulations established to preserve the safety of both individuals and wildlife within our estates, said Tinashe Farawo, ZimParks spokesperson.\n\nOffering condolences to the bereaved families, ZimParks stated, Our condolences to the bereaved families. May their souls rest in peace.

We urge members of the public to adhere to the strictly designated park visiting hours (6 AM  6 PM). Always follow the rules and regulations and familiarize yourself with the wildlife present in the area in order to understand the potential dangers they pose, the statement read.\n\nPublic Safety Warning\n\nThe incidents underscore the life-threatening risks of disregarding park regulations.

According to ZIMLIVE, the deal included booking 200 rooms for five days, catering to 200 couplesa move many view as prioritizing financial gain over public interest. Critics argue that this not only denies thousands of Zimbabweans their annual source of solace and celebration but also exposes the power dynamics at play in the country.\n\nPublic Outcry Over Financial Power Abuse\n\nWinky Ds fans, numbering in the thousands, have expressed their outrage over what they describe as a betrayal of public trust and cultural values. For many, his performances are more than just entertainmentthey are a source of comfort and empowerment for Zimbabwes economically and socially downtrodden. The sudden cancellation has left fans feeling robbed of their annual ritual of healing and celebration.\n\nThis is not just about a concert, said one fan. Its about the disregard for ordinary people in favor of financial muscle. Its a disturbing precedent where might trumps right.\n\nMoral Concerns Highlighted\n\nCritics of the saga argue that this incident reflects a broader issue of power imbalance in Zimbabwe. Questions are being raised about the ethical implications of allowing financial power to override principles and commitments. A widely shared concern is that such practices could spill over into other aspects of public life, from the justice system to business ethics, creating a dangerous culture of impunity.\n\nIf someone with money can disrupt this tradition, what stops them from undermining other systems meant to serve the public? a concerned citizen asked. Where do we draw the line?\n\nWinky Ds Silence\n\nWinky D himself has remained tight-lipped about the controversy, leaving his fans to speculate on the reasons behind his absence from this years event. While some are hopeful for a statement or a possible rescheduling of the event, others feel this is a wake-up call for a more equitable and transparent system that prioritizes public interest over private gain.\n\nA Call for Justice\n\nAs public outrage grows, many are calling for accountability from the parties involved. The hope is that this incident will spark a broader conversation about the need for fairness, transparency, and the protection of cultural spaces from undue influence.\n\nFor now, Winky Ds fans are left with disappointment and questions about whether their beloved artist will be allowed to continue providing the solace and inspiration they so desperately seek. The ball is now in the court of HICC, Tagwireyi, and Winky D to address the publics concerns and restore trust in a society where cultural heritage often feels under siege.\n\n",

Some of the allegations lack merit, while others have already been cleared. Its election season, so you can expect anything, Moyo commented.\n\nAmong the candidates vying for the ZIFA presidency are Marshal Gore of Team Zimbabwe UK, former Warriors captain Benjani Mwaruwari, and PSL Chairperson Farai Jere.\n\nAccording to Article 38, Paragraph 6 of the new ZIFA Statutes, all members of the Executive Committee must not have been previously convicted or sentenced for any offense.\n\nThe ZIFA Ethics Committee is currently reviewing the candidates eligibility and integrity, with an announcement of the approved candidates scheduled for December 23.

The preacher advised byhttps://t.co/uDQbeJ6Q95pic.twitter.com/UXfqzFzfCh\n\nIn his address, Wutaunashe joked with the audience, saying, Say Halleluyah! Praise God! I know all the Bishops love me, so I know that at Easter Camp next year, the Bishops will give me a car Just provoking you, but I really appreciate all Despite his light-hearted tone, the implicit demand has sparked outrage across social and religious circles.\n\nA Troubling Contradiction\n\nThis recent development stands in stark contrast to Wutaunashes claims in November 2021 when he lobbied the Archbishop of Canterbury to support the removal of Western sanctions against Zimbabwe. During his meeting with Justin Welby, Wutaunashe portrayed himself as a champion of the impoverished, blaming sanctions for crippling Zimbabwes economy and exacerbating poverty.\n\nWere actually troubled for the poor, Wutaunashe said at the time, suggesting that sanctions, rather than corruption and mismanagement, were responsible for Zimbabwes dire economic state. However, his demands in Gaborone paint a different picture, with critics accusing him of exploiting the very poor he once claimed to advocate for.\n\nArchbishops Warning Revisited\n\nArchbishop Welbys 2021 response to Wutaunashes plea now carries renewed significance. In his remarks, the Archbishop emphasized that sanctions relief should only benefit the truly disadvantaged and not those involved in corruption. Sanctions relief should be only for the poor who dont steal money that is not theirs, he stated.\n\nWutaunashes actions have reignited debate about the integrity of religious leaders who align themselves with political figures like Mnangagwa.\n\n",
