            "content": "Bulawayo  Six people were injured yesterday when a Toyota Hilux collided head-on with a bus along the Bulawayo-Beitbridge highway, near the Bulawayo Student Accommodation Complex. The accident occurred after the Toyota Hilux driver veered into the oncoming lane of the bus traveling from the Kensington, Sihlengeni area.\n\nThe victims included the drivers of both vehicles and four bus passengers, who sustained varying injuries. Bulawayos chief fire officer, Mr. Nhlanganiso Moyo, reported that the fire brigade received the emergency call at 4:30 PM and arrived at the scene within six minutes.\n\nThe Scene and Vehicle Conditions\n\nThe Toyota Hilux, as seen in the aftermath, suffered severe front-end damage. The impact left the vehicle almost unrecognizable, with the hood, bumper, and front-right wheel area completely crushed. The windshield was shattered, and the structural integrity of the front cabin was significantly compromised. The bus also sustained notable damage but remained intact enough to avoid passenger entrapment.\n\nEmergency services swiftly removed the injured individuals from the vehicles, transporting them to United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) for medical attention. Thankfully, there were no fatalities, and the fire brigade confirmed that none of the victims were trapped within the wreckage.\n\nEmergency Measures Taken\n\nThe fire brigade also decontaminated a 100-meter stretch of the highway that was heavily affected by oil spillage from the vehicles. This was done using a special detergent to ensure road safety and prevent further incidents.\n\nMr. Moyo commended the quick response of the emergency teams and urged drivers to avoid reckless overtaking and speeding, particularly in areas with blind spots.\n\nThis incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of responsible driving, especially on busy highways. Investigations into the cause of the crash are ongoing.\n\n",

The couple was arrested for remaining in the country illegally after entering through the Beitbridge border in 2019.\n\nThe Ibekwes had been operating a fast-food outlet in Gwerus city center, despite lacking legal immigration status. Authorities apprehended them recently, bringing their unauthorized stay to an end.\n\nFollowing their conviction, the court imposed a fine of USD 200. Failure to pay the fine would result in a two-month prison sentence, after which they would face deportation back to Nigeria.\n\nThis case highlights Zimbabwes ongoing efforts to enforce immigration laws and combat illegal residency within its borders.\n\n",

Initially set for January 17, 2025, the hearing was moved forward after their legal team informed Judge President Mary Dube of a crucial legal requirement.\n\nBail applications are required to be heard within 48 hours of filing, with appeals to be resolved within 96 hours. The hearing was originally postponed to December 27, 2024, but the prosecution, citing a lack of preparedness, requested a delay to January 3 to provide a comprehensive response. Both parties agreed to the extension.\n\nChimombe and Mpofu face charges of defrauding the Presidential Goat Pass-On Scheme of US$7.7 million. Earlier this month, their attempt to have the case referred to the Constitutional Court was dismissed by Justice Pisirayi Kwenda. The pair had argued that their arrest, detention, and pre-trial processes infringed upon their constitutional rights, warranting intervention from the Constitutional Court.\n\n",

With over two decades in the sport, Maphosa is confident that her background in officiating and leadership will enable her to contribute to the growth and development of Zimbabwean football.\n\nMaphosas journey in football began in 1986 when she started refereeing and progressed to the position of match commissioner. She is now a CAF-certified referees instructor, having gained invaluable knowledge and experience along the way. I have been involved in football for over 20 years and I believe I can offer a lot to the development of the game in Zimbabwe, she said.\n\nA key area Maphosa is passionate about is addressing the lack of Zimbabwean referees in international assignments. She believes this issue needs urgent attention, highlighting that poor officiating has negative effects on the sport, including disappointing sponsors and teams. We need officials who maintain high standards and uphold the rules of the game, free from external influences. The decisions of referees should be final, and good officiating can be achieved by focusing on qualified officials starting at grassroots levels, such as NAPH and NASH, she explained.\n\nThe ZIFA board will elect six members to help shape the future of Zimbabwean football, and Maphosa is eager to play her part in the nations football renaissance.\n\n",

Among the new taxes, a 1% Fast Foods Tax will be levied on the sales value of fast food items, such as pizzas, burgers, and French fries. The government claims this tax aims to promote healthier eating habits.\n\nIn addition, a 10% withholding tax on gross winnings from sports betting will be implemented starting in January. This move is expected to impact those involved in the growing sector of sports betting in Zimbabwe.\n\nEconomists have expressed concern over the potential negative effects of these new taxes, arguing that they may exacerbate the financial burden on citizens already struggling with inflation and high cost of living.\n\n",

In truth, he is an entrenched collaborator of Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwas regime, complicit in the plundering of Zimbabwes resources. The clandestine transportation of looted minerals across the Forbes border into Mozambique, facilitated by Hwendes trucks, constitutes a damning indictment of his culpability.\n\nThis duplicity is further underscored by Hwendes sanctimonious denounciations of the late Ian Smith, even as his ally, Mnangagwa, protects the interests of white farmers in the Midlands, thereby perpetuating the historical injustices inflicted upon Black Zimbabweans. Mnangagwas own tenure has been marred by horrifying corruption, including the expropriation of Precabe Farm from the CIO during his ministerial tenure, and the displacement of indigenous Zimbabweans in Chiredzi and Binga to benefit foreign white interests.\n\nHwendes involvement in the Gold Mafia, characterised by the sneaky smuggling of gold to Dubai and linked money laundering, serves as a stark illustration of his entrenched complicity in Zimbabwes corrupt nexus. The oppositions reliance on individuals of Hwendes ilk, who prioritise personal aggrandisement over the welfare of Zimbabweans, ensures that meaningful change will remain an ephemeral chimera.\n\nThe logical question persists: why does Hwende abstain from accountability for Mnangagwas transgressions? The response is straight forward: Hwende is tied under an obligation to the same corrupt infrastructure that sustains Mnangagwas regime. His links in gold mafia, his trucks contracted to ferry out our looted minerals to the Mozambican ports,surely Hwende sees ED as his Saviour the one that butters his bread at the expense of the masses of Zimbabweans.\n\nUltimately, Zimbabwes prospects for meaningful transformation are determined upon a paradigmatic shift in the oppositions leadership. Until Zimbabweans demand authentic, principled leadership, the nation will continue to languish under the weight of corruption and exploitation. Hwende and his cohorts must be held accountable for their actions, and a new era of transparency and accountability must be ushered in. Hwende you are the last sellout of our generation to even dare criticise those calling out Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa as  worst than Ian Douglas Smith. ED might be your Boss yet to Zimbabweans he is a villain who deserve to be hanged by the pee balls.#edmustgo #sayno2to2030#cdesistermwenewazvo#kerinamujati\n\n",
