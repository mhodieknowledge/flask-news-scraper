            "content": "Sports Correspondent\n\nAl Ahlys Official Statement:\n\nIn an emergency board meeting held on Tuesday morning, Al Ahly expressed deep concern over the ongoing instability within Egyptian football, particularly the lack of coordination between the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) and the Professional Clubs Association. The club voiced frustration over repeated administrative errors that have led to persistent crises in the sport.\n\nA key issue discussed was the decision to assign Egyptian referees to officiate the upcoming Cairo Derby against Zamalek. Al Ahly highlighted that they had formally requested foreign referees for the match, citing previous controversies surrounding local officiating that have affected match outcomes. Additionally, the club reiterated its previous calls for a complete overhaul of the refereeing system, including the appointment of a foreign expert to lead the refereeing committee.\n\nDespite multiple requests, Al Ahly claims their concerns have been ignored, further eroding trust in the current system. The statement stressed that the club cannot accept continued inconsistencies in officiating that could undermine the fairness of the competition.\n\nAs a result, Al Ahlys board has decided to:\n\nInsist on postponing the match until the EFA fulfills its commitment to appointing foreign referees as originally promised.\n\nWithdraw from the league if their demands are not met.\n\nRemain in continuous session to monitor developments and take further necessary actions.\n\n",

But the road is not a place for rash decisions or hasty actionsits a place where patience can literally save your life. If you refuse to exercise patience while riding or driving, you might find yourself in a far worse situation: as a patient in a hospital bed, a casualty in a morgue, or another statistic in a graveyard.\n\nThe roads are filled with vital signs and markings that serve a critical purpose. Road signs, signals, and lane markings arent just there for decorationthey are messages designed to guide and protect you. When you choose to ignore them, whether by speeding, overtaking dangerously, or neglecting to follow traffic rules, you put yourself and others at risk.\n\nPatience on the road means taking the time to properly assess your surroundings, respecting speed limits, yielding when necessary, and abiding by the rules set forth to ensure everyones safety. These guidelines are not meant to slow you down or ruin your day; they are meant to preserve your life. A single moment of impatience could lead to an irreversible consequence.\n\nFor example, ignoring a red light or failing to yield could lead to a tragic collision, leaving not only you but also others involved suffering the consequences. If youre driving too fast for road conditions or overtaking on blind corners, you might be tempting fate. That sudden moment of impatience can result in an accident that could change your life foreveror end it prematurely.\n\nThe road messages are clear. The speed limits are there to keep you safe. The warning signs are there to prepare you for potential hazards ahead. The lane markings are there to help you stay in your lane and avoid dangerous intersections. Respecting these messages is an act of self-preservation. Ignoring them could place you in a hospital bed, or worse, a morgue.\n\nSo, the next time you find yourself behind the wheel, take a deep breath and remind yourself of the consequences of impatience. Your life is worth more than reaching your destination a few minutes earlier. Be patient. Respect the road, its messages, and the safety of those around you. It could mean the difference between life and death.\n\nDrive safe. Be patient.

            "content": "By A Correspondent| National Social Security Authority (NSSA) board chairperson Emmanuel Fundira was interviewed by police yesterday in connection with an extortion case involving Paula January.\n\nAlthough January is the one under investigation for extortion, Fundira was questioned based on audio recordings and text messages in which she mentioned him while making extortion demands against Rainbow Tourism Group (RTG) executives.\n\nFundira, who is being represented by Makiya and Partners Legal Practitioners, has not been charged with any wrongdoing. However, his name surfaced in the ongoing probe linked to the targeting of RTG executives.\n\nThis comes amid concerns that RTG executives are being pursued as part of a broader scheme to weaken the tourism giants stock. NSSA, which holds a 91.6% stake in RTG, recently announced plans to dispose of 56% of its shares, prompting speculation about attempts to devalue the company for potential buyers.\n\nInvestigations into RTG executives for alleged financial misconductcovering salaries, gratuities, and allowanceswere dismissed by the tourism groups board as baseless. Minister of Public Service, Labour, and Social Welfare Edgar Moyo previously held a meeting between NSSA and RTG board members, where it was agreed that Fundira would engage the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) to address the allegations.\n\nRTG board chairperson Douglas Hoto confirmed that discussions were underway to resolve the matter, emphasizing that RTG remained committed to transparency and corporate governance.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tatenda Maposa, Human Rights Defender\n\nThe ultimatum issued by the Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Daniel Garwe, does not offer a solution to Zimbabwes ongoing economic challenges. With the countrys inflation rate standing at 57.5% according to the Consumer Price Index, and over 80% of the population engaged in informal economic activities, Garwes approach seems misinformed and ineffective.\n\nInstead of exploring innovative ways to address the informal sector, the minister has resorted to authoritarian tactics that fail to address the root causes of the issue.\n\nIt is critical for the minister to recognize that informal employment in Zimbabwe is linked to vulnerability, including heightened risks of food insecurity, limited employment rights, and inadequate social protection. Rather than resorting to heavy-handed measures, the government should consider solutions that take these challenges into account.\n\nWe call on Minister Garwe to reconsider his stance and work toward people-centered solutions that acknowledge the hardships citizens are currently enduring.\n\nReports from various towns have highlighted instances where local councils are seizing peoples belongings by force. This raises serious concerns about how such actions will be accounted for by the nation. The people feel that the minister has made decisions in isolation, without proper consultation with citizens. As a result, his actions are likely to deepen the suffering of already vulnerable populations, further exacerbating poverty.\n\nWe urge the government to establish designated, affordable spaces for informal vendors and to formalize the sector, which already plays a significant role in the countrys GDP. Rather than relying on harsh measures, it is essential to implement economic policies that create sustainable solutions, enabling the development of a world-class Zimbabwe with a thriving, viable economy.\n\n",
