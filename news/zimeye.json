At Overspill Clinic, 5 nurses and 4 primary counsellors have left while 1 nurse and 2 primary counsellors have left Epworth Mission Clinic.\n\nCurrently, skeletal staff at these health centres are overwhelmed with work and the District Medical Officer made a plea for the government to bring in LOCUM staff to fill the void.\n\nAs the Member of Parliament for Epworth North, I will engage various Government Ministries and Departments to ensure that LOCUM Staff is supplied at the these health centres in Epworth North.\n\nI have also taken it upon myself to engage various donor agencies and well-wishers to ensure adequate medication supplies at our health centres in Epworth North.\n\nOn behalf of the people of Epworth North, I do hereby make a passionate appeal to the United States government to review its stance on foreign aid and continue to save lives.\n\nPrior notice on cutting aid- at least 24 months- would have been appropriate, since the abrupt stall of aid does not only pose a risk to beneficiaries but is also a violation of legitimate expectation. The government of Zimbabwe passed its budget in December 2024.\n\nFunds to cover this gap may require a supplementary budget which may not be possible since the citizens are already overly taxed.\n\nAs the Member of Parliament for Epworth North, I would like to reiterate my commitment to ensuring residents receive quality health care.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent | ZimEye | Pretoria, SA  In a bold and unprecedented move, activist and political commentator Brett Muvhet has announced the formation of a new political party aimed at uniting Zimbabweans in exile and the diaspora. Speaking in a video message, Muvhet described the initiative as a necessary step in the fight against the ruling regime, which he claims has closed all political avenues for opposition within the country.\n\nFor years, I have firmly believed that a peoples revolution is the only way forward to remove the regime in Zimbabwe, Muvhet declared. However, he noted that influential figures, including business and political elites, have been reluctant to engage in revolutionary discourse, prompting the decision to establish a formal political structure.\n\nA Political Party with a Revolutionary Foundation\n\nUnlike traditional opposition movements within Zimbabwe, Muvhet envisions this party as a platform primarily for Zimbabweans in exile. Many of us cannot return to Zimbabwe without facing persecution, he explained. So, this party will be based in the diaspora, but with the goal of eventually playing a role in Zimbabwes future, whether through revolution or diplomatic means.\n\nMuvhet revealed that, despite discussions with members of various opposition parties, there appears to be little urgency for unification ahead of the 2028 elections. Instead, opposition groups remain focused on building their individual bases, leaving those who advocate for a more radical transformation excluded from key political discussions. The international community and regional bodies are engaging with these fragmented parties, but we are not invited. That is why we need our own political base.\n\nSelective Membership and Ideological Clarity\n\nEmphasizing quality over quantity, Muvhet stated that membership in the new party will not be open to everyone immediately. You will have to apply to be part of the leadership. This is not about numbersthis is about committed individuals who understand what we stand for, he said. While general supporters will be welcomed, formal membership will only be granted after the release of a book outlining the partys principles, policies, and vision for Zimbabwe.\n\nAmong the key issues to be addressed in this manifesto are land reform, border policies, taxation, and economic policies. Until that book is out, we wont take membership requests. You need to know exactly what youre supporting, he stated.\n\nFinancial Appeal for a Political Launch\n\nMuvhet has launched a financial appeal to fund the partys operations, requesting Zimbabweans to contribute $4.50 per month via a subscription model. He argued that financial support would accelerate their efforts, covering essential costs such as office space, research teams, and grassroots mobilization within Zimbabwe.\n\nI could continue doing this alone, but it will take much longer. If we get at least 900 to 1,000 Zimbabweans contributing, we can formally launch this party and push for real change, he said. He also acknowledged skepticism over fundraising efforts, citing past abuses of political donations, but reassured supporters that funds would not be used to enrich himself. I live an average life, drive average cars, and wear overalls to work. This money will go into the movement, not my personal lifestyle.\n\nA Response to Political Instability and the Looming Coup\n\nMuvhet warned of growing instability within Zimbabwes ruling elite, claiming that internal conflicts and economic collapse could lead to another coup. The regime has run out of things to steal. Now, they are turning on each other, he said, predicting imminent political shifts. However, he maintained that regardless of what happens, a movement built on strong principles will always be necessary in Zimbabwes political landscape.\n\nIn his closing remarks, he challenged Zimbabweans to take action. You can sit back and hope for a miracle, or you can invest in a real political movement. God helps those who help themselves, he urged.\n\nWith this announcement, Muvhet has positioned himself as a new political force in Zimbabwes opposition landscape, sparking debate over whether his movement will gain traction or face the same challenges that have plagued other opposition efforts. As the political climate in Zimbabwe remains volatile, the coming months will determine whether his vision for a peoples revolution can translate into tangible change.- ZimEye\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, President Donald J. Trump has issued an executive order targeting South Africa, imposing sanctions in response to what he describes as egregious actions by the South African government.\n\nThe order comes after South Africa enacted its controversial Expropriation Act 13 of 2024, which allows the government to seize agricultural property from ethnic minority Afrikaners without compensation.\n\nThe U.S. president condemned the act, stating that it represents shocking disregard of its citizens rights. Trump further criticized the governments broader actions, claiming they dismantle equal opportunities in areas such as employment, education, and business, while also fueling violence against minority landowners. He also pointed to South Africas foreign policy moves, including its stance on Israel and its growing ties with Iran.\n\nThe United States cannot support the government of South Africas commission of rights violations in its country or its undermining of U.S. foreign policy, Trump said in a statement. This poses national security threats to our Nation, our allies, our African partners, and our interests.\n\nAs part of the executive order, the U.S. will halt all foreign aid to South Africa. The United States shall not provide aid or assistance to South Africa, Trump declared, emphasizing that South Africas actions cannot be ignored without repercussions. The U.S. will also prioritize the resettlement of Afrikaners who are fleeing government-sponsored racial discrimination, including land confiscations. We are committed to promoting the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping these injustices, the order stated.\n\nAdditionally, the president confirmed that the United States would not attend the upcoming G20 summit in November. This move underscores the administrations stance on South Africas policies, signaling the growing tensions between the two nations.\n\nIn terms of refugee resettlement, the order directs the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to take steps to prioritize the admission and resettlement of Afrikaners affected by racial discrimination. The plan for this resettlement program is to be submitted to the President through the Homeland Security Advisor.\n\nThe executive order also mandates that U.S. agencies, including USAID and PEPFAR, cease providing financial aid to South Africa. As part of these sanctions, the U.S. will also block any future foreign assistance to the country, including the annual $440 million allocated for HIV/AIDS programs through PEPFAR.\n\nThe United States is taking this action to protect our values and interests. We stand against any government that undermines human rights and acts contrary to international standards, Trump added.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in U.S.-South Africa relations, with far-reaching consequences for the future of foreign aid, refugee resettlement, and international diplomacy.\n\n",

The decision emphasizes the resettlement of white Afrikaner refugees to the United States.\n\nTrumps move follows a series of social media posts in which he claimed that South Africa is engaged in a massive Human Rights VIOLATION. This declaration has sparked significant controversy, with critics arguing that it promotes conspiracy theories regarding the treatment of white South Africans.\n\nThe South African government is currently working on land reform policies designed to address historical injustices. These efforts involve redistributing land from white farmers to Black South Africans, in an attempt to rectify the legacy of apartheid-era land ownership disparities.\n\nThe suspension of aid has raised concerns about the future of US-South Africa relations and the potential impact on crucial programs, particularly those addressing HIV/AIDS. In 2023, South Africa received over $400 million in aid from the US, primarily allocated for HIV/AIDS initiatives. The halt in assistance could threaten these vital programs, worsening the countrys already strained fight against the disease.\n\nCritics of Trumps decision argue that it is based on faulty assumptions and a lack of understanding about South Africas land reform policies, which are designed to address inequality rather than target specific racial groups. Many view the suspension as an attempt to placate Trumps conservative base, rather than a genuine concern for human rights.\n\n",
