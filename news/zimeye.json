They focused on long-term plans, thinking 100 years ahead, while we tend to concentrate on immediate concerns like Christmas and elections.\n\nZivhu emphasized that the ruling party needs to shift its approach and adopt a more forward-thinking strategy, noting, We need to embrace a more futuristic mindset to bridge the gap.\n\nHis comments come amidst ongoing debates about whether Ian Smiths administration or the current leadership under President Emmerson Mnangagwa has been more effective. While many government officials and ZANU PF supporters have dismissed any comparison between Smith and Mnangagwa as an insult to Zimbabwes liberation struggle, Zivhus remarks suggest a different perspective on governance and planning.\n\n",

Mwaruwari, in particular, was disqualified due to not having the necessary five O Levels.\n\nHowever, it is now reported that Mwaruwari has formally appealed this disqualification to CAS, which could lead to the postponement of the elections until the legal process is resolved.

Critics argue that this high rank highlights the urgent need for comprehensive reforms to address corruption at the highest levels of government in Kenya.\n\n",

How you feel behind the wheel can significantly impact your safety and that of others on the road. Whether youre feeling relaxed, anxious, or hot-tempered, your emotions affect your judgment, reaction times, and overall driving behavior.\n\nIts essential to recognize the profound influence emotions have on your driving and actively work to control them.

Stress can cloud your focus, increasing the likelihood of mistakes.\n\nThe key to maintaining safety on the road lies in emotional regulation. Regardless of the emotional state youre in, never allow your feelings to dictate your actions behind the wheel. Losing control can lead to dangerous situations, not only putting yourself and your passengers at risk but also endangering other drivers and pedestrians.\n\nHere are a few strategies for managing emotions while driving:\n\nBy recognizing the link between emotions and driving behavior, and by taking steps to manage your stress, you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents.

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nA recent survey conducted by the Zanu PF Operation Restore Legacy Facebook page has highlighted the governments failure to address the concerns of war veterans, with the performance of War Veterans Minister Monica Mavhunga drawing particularly harsh criticism.\n\nThe survey, published on Wednesday, offers a detailed analysis of her ministrys performance, which has sparked growing dissatisfaction among former liberation fighters and their supporters.\n\nThe evaluation scores given to Minister Mavhungas handling of war veterans issues are alarming. According to the survey, her performance in key areas has been rated poorly, particularly in providing essential support and services to veterans of Zimbabwes liberation struggle. The surveys findings are as follows:\n\nSupport for Veterans: 2/10\n\nAccess to Healthcare for Veterans: 3/10\n\nPension & Financial Support: 2/10\n\nCommunity Reintegration Programs: 0/10\n\nCrisis Response: 1/10\n\nThis results in a dismal overall score of 1.6/10, further illustrating the extent to which war veterans feel neglected by the current administration. The surveys authors also included a direct question to followers: Do you agree???\n\nThis question echoes the frustration of many Zimbabweans who feel that the government has not honored its promises to those who fought for the countrys independence.\n\nThe poor ratings for Minister Mavhunga come amid mounting complaints from war veterans regarding unmet promises and deteriorating conditions. Issues such as lack of healthcare, delayed pension payments, and insufficient community reintegration programs have been persistent concerns for this group.\n\nMany war veterans, who are key supporters of President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his government, are now expressing growing discontent.\n\nThe negative assessment of Mavhungas performance underscores a broader perception that the Mnangagwa administration has failed to meet the expectations of the nations war veterans.\n\nDespite their role in Zimbabwes liberation struggle, veterans have complained about being sidelined in favor of other government priorities, leading some to question the governments commitment to the very people who helped establish the nations independence.\n\nThe surveys damning results reflect a growing rift between the government and war veterans, raising concerns about Mnangagwas leadership and his ability to address the grievances of one of the countrys most important constituencies.\n\nAs war veterans continue to voice their frustrations, the government may be forced to reassess its approach and find more effective ways to honor their sacrifices and support their welfare.\n\n",
