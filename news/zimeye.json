            "content": "ByBusinessReporter-TheReserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has raised alarm over millions of dollars lying idle in cash deposit boxes across the country, a growing trendthat isstarving the economy of much-needed liquidity.\n\nWhile the central bank did not mention names, its latest statement appears tobe aimedat controversial businessman and Zanu PF loyalist Wicknell Chivhayo, along with his associates like gold dealer Scott Sakupwanya, who frequently flaunt vast amounts of foreign currency on social media.\n\nChivayo, a self-styled tycoon with a well-documented history of fraud and shady dealings, has become infamous for his ostentatious displays of wealth.\n\nHe has splurged on an extravagant fleet of luxury vehiclesranging from Rolls Royces to Bentleys and Lamborghinissome of which he has gifted to musicians, socialites, and influencers in exchange for public endorsements of President Emmerson Mnangagwas Vision 2030 agenda.\n\nDespite his extravagant lifestyle, Chivhayo has never publicly declared his sources of income or provided proof of financial legitimacy, fueling widespread speculation about his dealings.\n\nHehas previouslybeenimplicatedin high-profile scandals, including a multi-million-dollar Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) tender fraud case in which hewas accusedof receiving $5 million for a power project that never materialized.\n\nAnnouncing his 2025 Monetary Policy Statement, RBZ Governor John Mushayavanhu cautioned against the growing trend of businesses and individuals hoarding large sums of cash outside the formal banking system.\n\nThere are manufacturers who are supplying goods to the informal market but are not banking their proceeds. They are keeping these monies in their cash boxes, which is not in line with the Anti-Money Laundering Act. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) will not just watch but will dismantle this practice, Mushayavanhu stated.\n\nThe central bank governor emphasized that stockpiling cash presents unnecessary risks, especially in light of recent increases in prepaid credit limits and attractive interest rates on savings accounts.\n\nThe issue here is that robbers have been targeting buses, especially cross-border traders, and stealing their cash. There is no need to keep large sums of money in cash when one can simply upload their funds onto a card, with limits now increased to US$1 million. We have also adjusted interest rates on savings accounts, which makes banking more attractive, he explained.\n\nToinstillconfidence in the local banking sector and encourage a culture of saving, the RBZ has implemented incremental increases in interest rates on deposits.\n\nHowever, whether the central bank will take concrete action against individuals like Chivayowho continue to operate outside the formal financial system while openly displaying unexplained wealthremains to be seen.\n\n",

            "content": "Will the Ragtag Pig Shed Built by ZANU Restore the ZiG Currency?\n\nA Temporary Fix for a Permanent Crisis?\n\nHarares Mbare Musika, once a thriving hub for informal traders, is now the site of a controversial reconstruction effort following the devastating fire that left thousands of vendors destitute. The ZANU PF government has quickly moved to erect a modern temporary market, but critics are questioning whether this hastily built structure is anything more than a cosmetic solution to a deeper economic crisis.\n\nAt the heart of the debate is the newly introduced Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency, which the government insists will stabilize the economy. But will a makeshift trading market, likened by some vendors to a ragtag pig shed, be enough to restore confidence in a currency that many Zimbabweans already view with skepticism?\n\nA Currency on Shaky Ground\n\nSince its launch last April, the ZiG has struggled to gain public trust. Market confidence is at an all-time low due to Zimbabwes turbulent monetary history, including the catastrophic hyperinflation of the 2000s and the more recent collapse of the RTGS dollar. Many traders at Mbare Musika, where transactions are often conducted in US dollars, have refused to fully adopt the ZiG, fearing it will follow the same disastrous path as its predecessors.\n\nThe government, however, has doubled down on enforcing the currency, with authorities targeting informal traders suspected of engaging in forex dealings. Leaked reports suggest that the fire that gutted Mbare Musika may have been a deliberate ploy to disrupt illegal currency trading and force vendors to accept the ZiG.\n\nSpace Barons and Corruption: Business as Usual?\n\nEven as officials tout the new market as a step toward formalization and economic stability, reports are emerging that space baronsconnected to ruling party elitesare already exploiting traders by demanding bribes of US$10 per person just to be considered for a stall. This raises serious concerns about the true beneficiaries of the reconstruction efforts.\n\nLocal Government Minister Daniel Garwe has assured traders that the allocation of stalls will be done fairly, but vendors on the ground remain skeptical. Many fear that politically connected individuals will seize the prime trading spots, leaving those most affected by the fire without a place to rebuild their businesses.\n\nA Broken Trust: Traders Speak Out\n\nMbare Musika traders are unconvinced that rebuilding the market will address the economic realities they face. A new structure will not bring back our lost goods, and it wont fix the economy, says one trader who lost over US$10,000 in the fire. People dont trust the ZiG, so they use US dollars. Unless the government stabilizes the economy, this is just another exercise in deception.\n\nThe mistrust is well-founded. Previous government initiatives, such as the 2019 reintroduction of the Zimbabwean dollar, ended in disaster as inflation spiraled out of control. Without addressing the root causes of Zimbabwes economic instabilityrampant corruption, excessive government borrowing, and a lack of investor confidenceno amount of infrastructure development will restore faith in the national currency.\n\nWill the Pig Shed Save the ZiG?\n\nThe rush to erect a temporary market in Mbare Musika may serve as a political gesture, but it does little to resolve the deeper financial turmoil gripping Zimbabwe. The governments alleged role in the market fire, combined with its failure to rein in corruption among space barons, has only fueled public distrust.\n\nFor the ZiG to gain legitimacy, the government needs more than new buildingsit needs policies that inspire economic confidence. Without concrete steps to curb inflation, protect traders from exploitation, and restore faith in monetary policies, the ZiG will be nothing more than another failed experiment in Zimbabwes long history of currency disasters.\n\nFor now, traders at Mbare Musika remain caught between a crumbling economy and a government that seems more interested in optics than solutions. Whether the makeshift market will become a beacon of economic revival or just another monument to Zimbabwes ongoing crisis remains to be seen.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a continued effort to address Zimbabwes ongoing economic challenges, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has announced plans to redesign the ZiG banknotes.\n\nThis move comes as the country grapples with severe economic instability, marked by inflation, currency devaluation, and a significant decline in domestic production.\n\nZimbabwes economic turmoil has left the nation with little room to sustain itself. The government has been scrambling to find solutions, but the countrys economy remains fragile, with production at a standstill.\n\nThis economic collapse is highlighted by the crumbling currency system, which is struggling to maintain its value amidst the uncertainty.\n\nRBZ Governor, Dr. John Mushayavanhu, explained that the redesigned ZiG notes aim to address two major concerns: combating counterfeiting and improving the durability of the current banknotes.\n\nThe redesign of the ZiG notes incorporates valuable feedback received from stakeholders during the 2025 Monetary Policy Statement and Reserve Bank 2025-2029 strategy formulation stakeholder consultations, Dr. Mushayavanhu told State media.\n\nThe current ZiG notes, introduced in April 2024, have been widely criticized for their poor durability. Consumers and businesses alike have pointed out that the notes quickly become worn and difficult to handle. Merchants and banks have also raised concerns about the usability of the notes as they easily fade and fray, making them hard to accept in daily transactions. Only the ZiG10 and ZiG20 notes have so far been released into circulation, adding to the uncertainty surrounding Zimbabwes currency.\n\nAccording to Dr. Mushayavanhu, the new designs will feature enhanced security features to prevent counterfeiting, a standard practice for central banks around the world. He emphasized, The redesign of ZiG notes does not signify redenomination or any form of currency reform. This initiative is solely focused on enhancing the quality of the notes.\n\nWhile the public might hope that this redesign could signal a much-needed currency overhaul, Dr. Mushayavanhu was quick to clarify that this is not the case. I must reiterate that the Reserve Bank is not going to issue a new currency, and in this regard, the public should not be apprehensive, he said. Instead, the Reserve Bank is merely redesigning the current banknotes to enhance quality, in line with international standards.\n\nThe Governor also assured the public that the redesigned notes would be issued in the same denominations as the original ZiG notes, which include ZiG1, ZiG2, ZiG5, ZiG10, ZiG20, ZiG50, ZiG100, and ZiG200. The new notes will be rolled out as the need arises in the market.\n\nDr. Mushayavanhu confirmed that the rollout of these enhanced notes would be communicated to the public in due course. However, higher-denomination notes will only be introduced if there is a clear demand for them in the economy. The focus, for now, remains on making the current banknotes more durable and secure as Zimbabwe continues to battle its ongoing economic crisis.\n\nAs the country struggles with inflation and the lack of domestic production, the redesigned ZiG notes serve as a temporary measure in the face of a much deeper economic crisis that is unlikely to improve without fundamental reforms.\n\n",
