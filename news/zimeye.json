            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda- Acting President Constantino Chiwenga has launched a scathing attack on President Emmerson Mnangagwas loyalists, including politically connected businessmen accused of exploiting their ties to the presidency to amass wealth at the expense of the nation.\n\nSpeaking at the burial of Justin Mupamhanga at the National Heroes Acre on Monday, a visibly enraged Chiwenga lambasted what he called zvigananda (leeches)  individuals who have become synonymous with corruption and greed.\n\nHis fiery remarks were widely interpreted without naming names as a veiled swipe at flamboyant businessman Wicknell Chivhayo, whose controversial government contracts and ostentatious lifestyle have long sparked public outrage.\n\nWe all swore to a shared future where everyone has a seat at the table, a culture of equal opportunity where every Zimbabwean serves equally, Chiwenga declared. But this culture of selfishness, greed, and corruption, where a few get rich through ill-gotten wealth, must end. Vision 2030 is for all Zimbabweans, not just for these so-called mbingas  those we used to call zvigananda during the war.\n\nThe term mbingas has come to symbolize individuals who flaunt wealth acquired through questionable means, often leveraging political connections.\n\nChivhayo, infamous for failed multi-million-dollar energy projects and his penchant for gifting luxury cars to politicians and celebrities, has become a poster child for this phenomenon.\n\nHis extravagant loyalty to Mnangagwa has only fueled speculation about the growing factionalism within Zanu PF.\n\nChiwengas denunciation of these figures marks a clear rebuke of the culture of patronage and excess that has deepened inequality in Zimbabwe.\n\nHis comments come amid whispers of intensifying rivalry between Mnangagwa and Chiwengas factions as Zanu PF manoeuvres for control ahead of the 2028 elections.\n\nCritics suggest that Chiwengas remarks are not only a critique of corruption but also a strategic move to assert his authority as internal power struggles escalate.\n\n",

We had a slogan which said Pasi nezvigananda! literally translated to down with bourgeoisies. We also maintained a code never to praise or worship a commander or leader through slogans like pamberi nanhingi. We were steadily prosecuting the war of liberation under the command of the military committee of ZIPA, a unified force of ZANLA and ZIPRA.\n\nWhen the nationalists came and hijacked the liberation struggle in 1977, they banned the slogan Pasi nezvigananda, introduced the praise slogan Pamberi na Cde Robert Mugabe, and they trashed Nzira dzemasoja. The nationalists disbanded the unified force of ZIPRA and ZANLA and caused division between ZANU and ZAPU.\n\nThat was the beginning of a neocolonial puppet regime transformation disguised as independence, led by nationalists who had been turned by the Rhodesian Special Branch and the British MI6.\n\nThey arrested the members of the military committee and intended to assassinate them all, save for Samora Machel, who told them that no cdes would be killed on his territory for disagreeing with each other. These commanders were incarcerated until 1980. They wanted to execute them like Tongogara and others had done to the Nhari and Badza group!- ZimEye\n\n",

It has never been established what Flowers motive for the transfer was.\n\nThis is where rumors of secret meetings with officers from Ken Flowers Special Branch emanate from.\n\nIn 1972, Mnangagwa is transfered back to Salisbury where he hooks up with Mugabe, Tekere and others. Mugabe entices him to enrol for an LlB Degree with the University of London so they could study together. They did their essays together for the law degree, and Mnangagwa was released in November 1974 alongside Mugabe and Tekere but had to wait until late December for his deportation to Zambia since his lawyers were claiming he was Zambian to minimise chances of being re-arrested.\n\nSithole too was released in 1974 November, but Mugabe claimed he had sold out to Ken Flower and Ian Smith so his three friends in jail had ousted him and chosen Mugabe instead.\n\nChitepo argued three people were not a Congress so that wasnt binding.\n\nMnangagwa frequented Josiah Tongogaras house in Zambia but never visited Chitepo.\n\nMugabe then visited Mnangagwa in Mumbwa in Zambia in January 1975.\n\nMnangagwa by that time was completing his LLB with the Unoversity of Zambia .\n\nA meeting between Mnangagwa, Mugabe and Tongogara happened but no details of the meeting were made public.\n\nMnangagwa then developed a romantic relationship with Tongogaras sister Jayne, whom he then went on to marry.\n\nOn March 18 in 1975, Herbert Chitepo was assassinated through a bomb planted in his car, barely 3 months after his encounter with Mugabe.\n\nZambian police responded by rounding up Zanu leaders and Keneth Kaunda in particular fingered Tingogara.\n\nZanu then left Zambia to go and fight from newly independent Mozambique, and Kaunda told Samora Machel the guys were a bunch of murderers and should not be trusted. It took very long for Samora to trust Tongogara and Robert Mugabe.\n\nZanu claimed Kaunda had sold out through Detente with Vorster so they had to leave Zambia.\n\nIn April 1975, Robert Mugabe and Tekere fled to Mozambique and Mugabe was then made caretaker First Secretray.\n\nMnangagwa started working as a lawyer in 1975. He was persuaded to pay Tongogara a family visit in Maputo in 1976. He did come on holiday with his family, then Mugabe and Tongogara persuaded him to leave his job and join them. He went back to Zambia, and returned in 1977 to become Robert Mugabes personal assistant.\n\nRumors of him being a spy were spread, and the conspiracies pointing to Mugabe, Mnangagwa and Tongo as the people behind Chitepos assassination swelled.\n\nRW\n\n",

            "content": "By Farai D Hove | ZimEye | Harare, Zimbabwe  Leaked minutes from a recent Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC) meeting have revealed that President Emmerson Mnangagwas initiative to issue title deeds to beneficiaries of the land reform programme may have a deeper political agenda. While publicly presented as an economic empowerment programme, the leaked documents suggest that the move could be aimed at consolidating political power and advancing the ruling partys interests ahead of the 2025 elections.\n\nThe state media recently reported that 2,500 title deeds will be issued by March 2025 as part of the governments efforts to streamline land ownership and improve access to capital. However, the leaked minutes raise questions about the motivations behind this initiative, as they outline a strategy that intertwines economic reforms with political objectives.\n\nLeaked Details\n\nKey points from the leaked PCC minutes include:1. Issuance of Title Deeds Nationwide: The minutes highlight plans for President Mnangagwa to extend the issuance of title deeds to both agricultural and urban land, with landowners required to pay between 2 and 8 cents per square meter. The payments would be spread over 20 years at an interest rate of 7.5%, raising concerns over the financial burden this could place on beneficiaries.2. Focus on Underperforming Districts: Makonde district was flagged in the minutes for having the lowest registration figures in the province, with only 69,000 names submitted on cell registers, compared to over 100,000 in other districts. This has led to directives to improve registration efforts in areas deemed underperforming.3. Party Discipline and Loyalty: The minutes emphasize the need for ZANU-PF members to remain disciplined and avoid engaging in anti-leadership discourse, particularly on social media, signaling a crackdown on internal dissent.4. Presidential Term Extension: Perhaps the most controversial point in the minutes is the resolution to push for the extension of Mnangagwas presidential term to 2030. The document indicates that legal processes are being prepared to facilitate this extension, which would effectively delay leadership change for another five years.\n\nConcerns Over Political Motives\n\nThe issuance of title deeds has been framed as a measure to secure property rights and enable beneficiaries to access financing for agricultural activities. However, the timing and structure of the programme have raised suspicions that it is designed to secure political loyalty by tying landowners to the government through long-term financial obligations.\n\nThe term extension resolution adds further weight to these concerns, with critics questioning whether the programme is being used to manipulate beneficiaries into supporting Mnangagwas continued leadership.\n\nImplications for Zimbabwe\n\nWhile the issuance of title deeds could address longstanding issues in land tenure and improve economic opportunities, the revelations in the leaked minutes suggest that the initiative may be serving dual purposes: addressing economic challenges while simultaneously advancing the political goals of the ruling party.\n\nThe government has not yet responded to the leaked minutes, but the revelations are likely to spark debate over the role of land reform in Zimbabwes political landscape. As the country approaches the 2025 elections, the intersection of land ownership and political power is once again under scrutiny, with significant implications for the nations future.-ZimEye\n\n",

This was supposed to be Tshabangus first provincial rally after he allegedly took over the CCC party with the help of Zanu PF.\n\nThe rally, which was meant to galvanize support in Masvingo, a region considered to be a stronghold of CCC leader Nelson Chamisa, was left in disarray after Tshabangus sudden change of plans. Masvingo is highly disappointed by Tshabangus failure to attend the provincial rally, a local observer commented. He knew that Masvingo is Chamisas stronghold but cancelled his visit at the last minute. I am angry.\n\nThe event, described as poorly organized, saw a mere 10 members of parliament and senators in attendance. Key figures included Chief Whip Nonhlanhla Mlotshwa, Chief Whip of the National Assembly Charles Moyo, Senators Linda Sibanda, Bvumo, Phulu, and Maxwell Mdluri. However, the absence of Masvingos councillors, mayors, MPs, senators, and provincial council members was a stark sign of discontent within the party.\n\nThe lack of support from prominent local officials and the absence of Tshabangu himself has sent a clear message of dissatisfaction among CCC members in the province.\n\n",
