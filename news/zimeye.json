            "content": "By A Correspondent  Controversial preacher Prophet Walter Magaya, founder of the Prophetic Healing and Deliverance (PHD) Ministries, has lost control of his multimillion-dollar hotel and stadium complex in Harare after the High Court issued a writ of execution.\n\nAccording to court records (Case Number SH3294/25), Chinese national Li Xiu Yun successfully obtained the order for the sale in execution of Magayas rights and title to Stand 168 of Prospect, a 3.84-hectare property situated along Smuts Road in Waterfalls, Harare.\n\nThe property, once touted as a flagship investment by Magayas ministry, houses a four-star-standard hotel, several cluster houses and lodges, and a modern football stadium. The facilities turned the Prospect area into a hub of activity, hosting football matches, church events, and attracting local and international visitors.\n\nThe impending auction marks one of the biggest financial and legal blows to Magayas empire, which has grown over the past decade through a combination of religious influence, business ventures, and real estate acquisitions.\n\nSince founding PHD Ministries in 2012, Magaya aggressively expanded into property and hospitality. His hotel in Waterfalls was marketed as a premium accommodation centre, catering not only to church pilgrims but also to business travellers and sports tourists.\n\nThe stadiumone of the largest privately built sports facilities in Hararewas particularly significant. It became a venue for football and community events, often doubling as a stage for his mega-church gatherings that drew tens of thousands of congregants.\n\nMagaya also invested in residential estates, commercial centres, and health facilities, framing his ventures as part of a broader vision to empower communities through employment creation and infrastructure development.\n\nHowever, many of these projects were marred by controversy. Some collapsed midway due to financial difficulties, while others were tied to lawsuits involving unpaid contractors, disgruntled investors, and foreign partners who accused Magaya of breach of contract.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa personally commissioned Magayas Yadah Stadium in Waterfalls, hailing it as a model of private investment that could complement government efforts to revive Zimbabwes ailing infrastructure. The event symbolised the close ties Magaya had cultivated with the political establishment, projecting him not only as a spiritual leader but also as an influential player in the countrys economic landscape.\n\nAt the commissioning, Mnangagwa praised Magayas vision and urged other church leaders and businesspeople to emulate him in supporting national development. The endorsement cemented Magayas reputation as a politically connected clergyman whose projects carried the weight of state approval.\n\nYet, despite such high-profile backing, cracks soon appeared in his empire. Allegations of financial mismanagement, debts owed to foreign investors, and legal disputes increasingly dogged his ventures.\n\nThe latest High Court ruling is tied to Magayas dispute with Li Xiu Yun, a Chinese investor who is owed substantial sums. The writ of execution authorises the sale of PHD Ministries rights and title to the hotel, stadium, and associated properties to recover the debt.\n\nFor the thousands of PHD congregants who regarded the Waterfalls complex as the heart of their ministry, the looming auction represents not only the loss of a spiritual home but also the collapse of one of Zimbabwes most ambitious religious property projects.\n\nFor Magaya himself, the ruling is a humiliating reversal from the days when he shared a stage with the President to celebrate his business vision.\n\n",

Yadah FC were slapped with a US$5 000 fine for failing to control their official, with just 15 days to settle the penalty.\n\nIn a stern warning, the PSL reminded clubs of their responsibility to safeguard the spirit of the game: The League remains committed to upholding discipline, protecting the integrity of the game and promoting a safe environment for all participants.\n\nFor a team that prides itself on its spiritual branding, the scandal is a heavy blow.

            "content": "By A Correspondent The simmering power struggles between President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, have now spilled into open confrontation, with their feud escalating dramatically ahead of Zanu PFs 22nd Annual Peoples Conference in Mutare. What began as whispers of factional manoeuvres has turned into an ugly public fight, shaking the ruling partys top ranks and exposing the fragile balance of power within its leadership.\n\nThe latest flashpoint came at Mondays Policy and Coordinating Meeting, chaired by newly appointed Secretary General Jacob Mudenda. While the party issued a bland statement that only spoke of internal administrative issues and preparations for the conference, insiders dismissed the communique as camouflage for a calculated attempt by Mnangagwa to sideline Chiwenga.\n\nEveryone knows Mudenda is a pawn. He has no power of his own, said one official aligned to the military faction. This is about clipping Chiwengas wings before Mutare. But they cant erase his influence.\n\nMudenda, who replaced Obert Mpofu, is widely regarded as a weak link, imposed to rubber-stamp Mnangagwas agenda. Chiwengas loyalists argue that the secretary-generals office has been reduced to a weapon in the succession struggle, with Mnangagwa propping up figures like Mudenda and the so-calledZvigananda wealthy businessmen accused of bankrolling his presidency.\n\nThe tensions boiled over in dramatic fashion last week when Mnangagwa and Chiwenga clashed at State House, an altercation that nearly turned physical. For a military man like Chiwenga, openly confronting his commander-in-chief was no minor act  it was a calculated political strike.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute lies a dossier Chiwenga presented, accusing Mnangagwas allies  including Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Wicknell Chivayo, Pedzisayi Scott Sakupwanya, and Delish Nguwaya  of industrial-scale looting. His warning was blunt: When Chivayo gives you ten million dollars, he has already taken ninety million. The attack was not just on corruption but on the financial networks that sustain Mnangagwas hold on power.\n\nMnangagwa responded with fury, defending his allies and even calling Nguwaya my friend, before storming out and moving swiftly to consolidate control. Within days, he reshuffled the politburo, elevating loyalists and tightening his grip on party structures.\n\nThe propaganda machine was also unleashed. Presidential adviser Christopher Mutsvangwa dismissed Chiwengas allegations as jealousy, declaring: He is not the only one who fought in the liberation war. But Chiwenga doubled down, invoking the spectre of the 1974 Nhari Rebellion to warn that unchecked factionalism could destroy the party from within.\n\nThe symbolism of the showdown is stark. For the first time since they ousted Robert Mugabe in 2017, Mnangagwa and Chiwenga are no longer allies but adversaries. The stakes are existential  not only for the two men but for Zanu PF itself.\n\nAs one politburo insider put it: It feels like 2017 all over again. Only this time, the generals are turning against each other.\n\nAll eyes now turn to Mutare. If last weeks near-brawl was the dress rehearsal, Octobers conference could be the stage for the main act in Mnangagwa and Chiwengas increasingly ugly fight for supremacy.\n\n",

The key highlights were internal administrative issues discussions and deliberations on the state of preparedness on the upcoming 22nd Annual Peoples Conference in Mutare.\n\nBut the official statement was immediately undermined by sharp criticism from Chiwenga loyalists. Mudenda is not running the party. He is simply a figure in the chair, put there to undermine the Vice President. Everyone in Zanu PF knows this, said one senior official aligned to the military faction.\n\nMudenda replaced Obert Mpofu in what insiders describe as a direct move by Mnangagwa and his allies, including Zvigananda, to chip away at Chiwengas influence. The Secretary Generals post has been turned into a weapon of factional politics. Mudenda is a token, not a leader. Chiwengas influence cannot be erased by reshuffling offices, fumed another official.\n\nAnalysts warn the strategy could boomerang. You cannot erase the man who fronted the 2017 military intervention that brought this regime to power. Mudenda has no grassroots support, and his role is merely symbolic. This exposes the fractures in Zanu PFs leadership, one commentator observed.\n\nAs preparations continue for the partys 22nd Annual Peoples Conference in Mutare, Zanu PF faces growing disunity. Mnangagwas attempts to clip Chiwengas wings through Mudendas appointment may instead deepen the fault lines threatening to tear the party apart from within.\n\n",
