            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda- A prophecies of an impending coup continue to surface,adding fuel tothe growing tensions within ZANU-PF.\n\nA viral video circulating on social media features an unnamed prophet predicting abloody military takeover, warning that the internal power struggles within the ruling party could soon erupt into full-scale violence.\n\nIn the video, the prophet declares:\n\nThe Lord has spoken, and I must pray for Zimbabwe. I saw another coupone that will bring chaos and bloodshed.Thiswill not be like before; this time, there will be much suffering, and many lives will be lost.\n\nI saw the current governmentbeing overthrown, and in its place, violence and turmoil will arise. The Bible commands us to pray for those in authority, andnowmore than ever, Zimbabwe needs our prayers.\n\nThe Lord revealedto methata deal was made, but it did not go well. One side agreed to step down and hand over power, but now, they refuse to let go. Because of this, a coup is brewinga dangerous storm is on the horizon.\n\nWe must stand together in prayer and call upon the hand of God to intervene. Let us lift our voices and declare: In the name of Jesus, we pray for Zimbabwe! May peace reign, and may Gods will be done. Amen!\n\nThis prophecy comes in the wake ofBlessing Geza, a war veteran and senior ZANU-PF Central Committee member, issuing a directthreat against President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nGeza has publicly stated that he will soon revealthe steps war veterans will take to remove Mnangagwa, further escalating tensions within the ruling party.\n\nGeza, known for his close ties to powerful factions within the military, recently gaveMnangagwa an ultimatum to resign, warning that failure to do so would lead to drastic action.\n\nHis statements have added weight to the growing belief that Mnangagwa is losing control over the security forces that helped him seize power in 2017.\n\nAdding to the anxiety,another prominent prophet, Ian Ndlovu, has also issued a chilling prophecy of a coup, cautioning that Zimbabwes deepening power struggle could soon spiral out of control.\n\nWe must continue to pray for our nation Two trains are set to collide. I personally pray for peace for all ordinary Zimbabweans, but change must not be stopped, in whatever form it needs to come,Ndlovu warned in a now-viral video.\n\nReports indicate thata group of high-ranking military officials and war veterans recently held a secret meeting to discuss ways toblock Mnangagwas attempts to extend his rule beyond his current termunder the controversial#ED2030 agenda.\n\nA powerfulmilitary faction loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwengais said to be behind the plot.\n\nSources close to the discussions reveal that many within the security forces and war veteran community believeMnangagwa has betrayed the 2017 coup pact, which allegedly included an agreementfor himtoserve only one term before handing over power to Chiwenga.\n\nAsecret meeting reportedlytook placein Mashonaland Central, a province historically known as a hub for political coups. The province has long been a stronghold for anti-Mnangagwa elements withinZANU-PF and the military, particularly those loyal to Chiwenga.\n\nA source close to the faction stated:\n\nYou hear what credible war veterans like Blessing Geza are saying. He is not hallucinating; he is communicating a message from the script, and you must listen to him carefully.\n\nThisis not the first time that power struggles within Zimbabwes ruling elite have led topolitical upheaval and bloodshed.\n\nThe lateAir Force Commander Perrence Shiriwho played a crucial role inthe 2017 coup against Robert Mugabewas known for holdingsecret meetingswith allies such asParadzai Zimondi and Bindura South MPRemigiousMatangiraat theBindura Arcadia Dam.\n\nBothShiri and Zimondi died under mysterious circumstancesduring theCOVID-19 pandemic, with speculation suggesting thatMnangagwa may have orchestrated their deathsto weaken potential challengers.\n\nDespite Mnangagwaspurge of senior military officers linked to Chiwenga, tensionscontinue to simmer within the security forces, with many stillloyal to Chiwengaand deeplyresentful of Mnangagwas growing authoritarianism.\n\nUnlike in 2017, Mnangagwa hasstrengthened his grip over Zimbabwes intelligence agenciesand placedloyalists in key military positions. However, history has shown that Zimbabwespolitical landscape is unpredictable, andeven a heavily fortified president can be overthrownif military discontent reaches a breaking point.\n\nThe rift betweenMnangagwa and Chiwenga has widenedover the years, with the Vice President increasinglysidelined from key government and party structures.\n\n.pic.twitter.com/Oh5tlc73sg\n\n",
