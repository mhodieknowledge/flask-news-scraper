            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nBulawayo Mayor David Coltart has strongly criticized President Emmerson Mnangagwas proposal to extend his term beyond 2028, labeling the move as unconstitutional and undemocratic. Coltart emphasized that the electorate voted for their representatives in 2023 for a fixed 5-year term, with no expectation of an extension .\n\nAccording to Coltart, there is no mandate for any political party or politician to extend their term arbitrarily. He stressed that such a move would be a clear violation of the principles of representative democracy.\n\nThis criticism comes after government spokesperson Nick Mangwana claimed that the opposition party, CCC, was in agreement with the ruling Zanu PF partys resolution to postpone the next harmonized elections from 2028 to 2030.\n\nColtarts stance on this issue is not surprising, given his history of advocating for democracy and human rights in Zimbabwe. As a former Education minister and a prominent figure in the opposition, Coltart has consistently spoken out against authoritarianism and the erosion of democratic values .\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) is facing an intense internal power struggle, with Welshman Ncubes faction claiming legitimacy and authority to make binding decisions. This move has sparked disputes with two other factions: one led by Tshabangu, the interim secretary-general, and another loyal to former party leader Nelson Chamisa, led by Jameson Timba, the Chief Administrator.\n\nThe Ncube-led faction has made a bold move by suspending Tshabangu, just hours after the High Court ruled that Tshabangu had no authority to make changes in Parliament. This ruling was based on Tshabangus alleged violation of a previous High Court order, which barred him from making recalls pending the resolution of ongoing cases .\n\nTimba has accused Ncube of exploiting the partys ongoing legal battles against Tshabangu, arguing that Ncubes reliance on cases initiated by his faction proves they are the only legitimate authority for CCC MPs and councillors. However, Ncubes spokesperson, Willias Madzimure, has dismissed Timbas claims, asserting that Ncubes faction is the genuine CCC.\n\nMadzimure emphasized that Nelson Chamisa resigned as president of the CCC party over twelve months ago and was replaced by acting president Welshman Ncube, whose position has been confirmed by the latest High Court ruling. The High Court decision has ultimately confirmed that there is only one CCC, led by acting president Professor Welshman Ncube.\n\nThis internal conflict has exposed deep divisions within the CCC, leaving many to wonder if the party can recover from this infighting. As the situation unfolds, its clear that Mnangagwas opposition rivals are in disarray, which may ultimately work in his favor.\n\n",

            "content": "Big rigs and other large vehicles have much larger blind-spot areas than traditional passenger vehicles:\n\nAlways avoid driving in a trucks blind spot. Move ahead of the truck or slow down so the driver can see you in the side mirrors.\n\nCommercial trucks have larger mirrors than passenger vehicles which can be affected by bright headlights. When you drive behind a truck, dim your lights to a standard low-beam setting as you approach to avoid blinding the driver through his or her mirrors.\n\nIt is always wise to pass another vehicle safely. However, careful passing is even more important near a commercial truck, because the large, heavy vehicle cannot stop as quickly as a passenger vehicle. Truck drivers need time to react and adjust their speed and brake accordingly.\n\nWhen passing a large truck, always approach from the left side, because it is easier for the driver to see you. Keep a consistent speed while passing and always signal clearly and in advance. Before you merge back into the lane in front of the truck, make sure you can see it in your rearview mirror to ensure a safe distance.\n\nWhen a truck passes you, slow down to allow plenty of space in front of you for the driver to maneuver safely and efficiently.\n\nWhen you change lanes or turn near a commercial truck, activate your signal earlier to give the driver more time to respond to your intended maneuver and slow down if needed.\n\nWhen merging, avoid moving into the lane in front of a large truck if upcoming traffic could slow down or stop abruptly. Trucks take longer to slow down, and a sudden lane change may not give the driver enough time to avoid crashing into your bumper.\n\nAlways keep a driving distance of at least four seconds between your vehicle and a commercial truck. If you are tailgating a big rig, the driver cannot see you. If you cannot stop in time or are rear-ended while traveling closely behind a large truck, your car may be pushed underneath the trailer  a type of collision that tends to be catastrophic.\n\nKeeping a safe distance will also give you more time to react to tire blowouts and rollovers caused by high winds. If you are in stopped traffic behind a truck, leave space between your vehicle and the truck, in case the truck begins to roll backward.\n\nSemi-trailer trucks take more room than passenger cars to make turns, and the cab and trailer both follow a different path. A truck may need to swing left to gain room for a right turn or may start a turn from the middle lane of traffic.\n\nDo not attempt to pass a truck that has a turn signal on, and do not drive between the truck and the curb. When at a stop at an intersection, make sure your vehicle is safely behind the line because trucks need that space to make turns.\n\nBe patient when sharing the road with semi-trailer trucks. Truck drivers have strict operating rules to follow and often use regulating devices, such as a speed limiter which restricts vehicle speed. Honking, aggressive driving, or maneuvering through traffic will not encourage a commercial driver to speed up. Instead, it could put you in danger of causing an accident.\n\nNot only is wearing your seat belt the law in California, but it can also keep you safer should you be involved in an accident. Always buckle kids in the back seat, in approved car seats if applicable.\n\nDistracted drivers put everyone in danger. Avoid using GPS systems, cell phones, and other devices while driving. Do not eat, adjust the radio or perform other actions that will take your eyes and concentration off the road.\n\nBy staying focused on driving, you will be better able to estimate the speed of trucks around you as they merge, turn, or change lanes, allowing you to respond appropriately.\n\nDriving while drowsy and fatigued is dangerous. If you are tired, get off the road and rest. When on long trips, allow time for rest breaks or have another driver who can relieve you when you become tired.\n\nAlcohol and drugs impair your reaction time and judgment  a deadly combination when driving. Even over-the-counter or prescription medications can cause side effects that make driving dangerous. Never drive under the influence of these substances.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",
