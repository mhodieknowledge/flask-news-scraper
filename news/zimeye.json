            "content": "Sports Correspondent  Caps United legend Brenna Msiska has sparked amusement after claiming that Scottland FC owner Scott Sakupwanya once had the talent to play for major English clubsclaims many have dismissed as too far-fetched and overly flattering toward the controversial businessman, who maintains close ties to President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nSpeaking during Scottland FCs victory parade on Wednesday, Msiskaaffectionately known as Baba Gariwas asked whether Sakupwanya had ever seriously played football. He responded with bold praise.\n\nSakupwanya was a good goalkeeper and, had he pursued the career, he could have played for Liverpool or Chelsea, Msiska claimed.\n\nHe added that although Sakupwanya did not follow a professional football path, what he is doing now is very respectable, referring to his ownership of Scottland FC. Even though he didnt follow a playing career, what he is doing now (owning a club) is highly commendable.\n\nScottland FC held a triumphant parade across Harare to celebrate clinching the 2025 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title. The team, also known as Mabviravira, made history by winning the championship in their debut top-flight season, shattering a forty-year record.\n\nScott Sakupwanya\n\n",

In her ruling, Magistrate Kufa stated that the State had successfully established a prima facie case against Maponga.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, led by Mr Blessed Songozo, the incident occurred on September 17 at Makoni Village under Chief Nyamweda. The mother-in-law was in her bedroom with her 94-year-old mother when Maponga allegedly forced his way into the room.\n\nUpon entering, he reportedly assaulted her, accusing her of taking his wife. During the attack, the mother-in-law fell onto her back, and Maponga sat on top of her before raping her.\n\nThe victim was eventually rescued by local residents, Messrs Godfrey Makoni and Cleopas Nziramasanga, who apprehended Maponga at the scene.\n\n",

We are asking learners to build a future with empty hands. The Constitution guarantees every child the right to education. Attendance alone does not fulfill the right to education. Rights are hollow when stripped of quality. The issue of textbooks must be addressed urgently.\n\nMurombedzis comments come as the government, under President Emmerson Mnangagwa, announced an ambitious initiative to distribute laptops and tablets to learners nationwide. While the program aims to modernize education, critics like Murombedzi argue that basic resources such as textbooks remain critical and must not be overlooked in the push for digital learning.\n\nHon Mutsa Murombedzi\n\n",

In carrying out these grassroots feedback engagement programmes, let us always unite the party and consolidate our revolutionary ideals. Let us never put ourselves or individual members above the party, he added, emphasizing the subordination of individual voices to the ruling party.\n\nMnangagwa also took credit for the years successes, insisting that Zanu PFs unity allowed the party and government to prevail over many challenges while consolidating power at both grassroots and national levels. It is pleasing that our party structures throughout the provinces remain accountable to the grassroots membership base. Musangano wakasimba kuma cells and villages, he said, glossing over widespread reports of coercion, intimidation, and manipulation of local structures.\n\nObservers warn that Mnangagwas rhetoric, framed as a celebration of revolutionary ideals, continues to entrench Zanu PFs dominance while silencing critics and undermining genuine democratic engagement.\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Wednesday hailed what he called the remarkable success of the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), but for millions of Zimbabweans grappling with skyrocketing prices, chronic unemployment, and failing public services, his claims are far removed from reality. While the government boasts of economic growth and national milestones, ordinary citizens continue to struggle to make ends meet, highlighting a stark gap between official rhetoric and lived experience.\n\nAddressing the 389th Politburo session in Harare  the final ZANU PF Party meeting of 2025  Mnangagwa praised national unity as a key driver of progress, insisting it had enabled significant milestones across the economy and society. He also hailed the completion of NDS1 and the launch of NDS2 as people-driven achievements. Yet for most Zimbabweans, there is little evidence of these so-called successes in their daily lives.\n\nMnangagwa paid tribute to Archbishop Paul Mwazha of the African Apostolic Church, recently declared a National Hero, describing him as a pillar of unity and spiritual guidance. While the gesture commands respect, it does nothing to address the dire economic conditions most citizens endure.\n\nThe President boasted that the 22nd National Peoples Conference had strengthened Party unity and shaped the 2026 National Budget. He called for Party mobilisation and communication strategies aligned with NDS2 to drive economic growth and improve citizens quality of life. Critics argue, however, that the governments priorities remain inward-looking and disconnected from the hardships confronting ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nMnangagwa claimed economic growth had been driven by agriculture, mining, manufacturing, tourism, infrastructure, and diaspora remittances. The latter has become particularly critical to the regime, which relies heavily on funds sent by Zimbabweans abroad  even as the state continues to brand many diaspora members as unpatriotic. This contradiction underscores the governments dependence on citizens it simultaneously vilifies.\n\nThe President also praised engagements with regional neighbours such as Zambia and Mozambique under Bi-National Commissions, calling them instruments of cooperation, integration, and prosperity. He warned against counter revolutionaries, a term frequently deployed to suppress dissenting voices.\n\nWhile Mnangagwa celebrates NDS1 as a triumph, the reality for most Zimbabweans remains starkly different. Citizens still confront economic hardship, erratic public services, and dwindling opportunities. The governments self-congratulatory rhetoric, particularly its reliance on diaspora remittances to prop up the economy, highlights a leadership more focused on appearances and party unity than addressing the urgent needs of its people.\n\nFor millions navigating daily struggles, the Mnangagwa regimes triumphs exist only on paper, while the nations lifeblood  including crucial support from the diaspora  is treated as both indispensable and a source of suspicion.\n\nEmmerson Mnangagwa\n\n",

We cant use this water for domestic purposes, and even our livestock are suffering because the river is no longer safe for drinking.\n\nAccording to locals, the miners operations have devastated riverbanks, caused uncontrolled digging and polluted water used by households and animals. Villagers have repeatedly appealed for intervention, but accuse the authorities of turning a blind eye to the crisis.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, ADM said the Government must take immediate corrective action. The Government cannot sit back while our rivers are being destroyed. We challenge the authorities to act now and stop these unregulated activities by Chinese miners before Mazowe River is completely lost, read part of the statement.\n\nADM described the situation as a reflection of poor environmental governance and disregard for the welfare of rural communities. People in Mazowe depend on this river. When it is destroyed, their whole way of life is threatened, the movement said.\n\nThe organisation is calling for a full investigation, the suspension of illegal operations and the restoration of the river ecosystem before more irreversible damage occurs.\n\nADM says it will continue pressuring the Government until meaningful action is taken to protect Zimbabwes natural resources and the communities that rely on them.\n\n",
