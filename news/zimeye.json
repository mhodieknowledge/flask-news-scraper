            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a heartbreaking incident that highlights the perilous state of the countrys roads, ICT Minister Tatenda Mavetera tragically lost three relatives in a horrific car accident last week.\n\nIn a statement, Mavetera shared the devastating news, expressing the immense pain her family has endured:\n\nThis past week, our family was walking through an unimaginable storm. We lost our beloved son-in-law, Edward Tatenda Mubaiwa, in a tragic car accident. Tatenda was a loving husband, a devoted father, and a man of great kindness. His sudden departure has left us shattered.\n\nAdding to the grief, Mavetera revealed that their daughter, Chido, is currently hospitalized, fighting for her life after the crash. The couples 2-month-old baby, Treasure Mutsawashe, now faces a future without the father who adored her.\n\nTo make matters even more painful, our daughter Chido is currently hospitalised, fighting for her health. They have a precious 2-month-old baby, Treasure Mutsawashe, who now needs all the love and prayers we can gather.\n\nMavetera expressed her deep sorrow, calling for prayers for her daughters recovery, the strength to endure the tragedy, and the well-being of little Treasure, who will grow up knowing how deeply her father loved her.\n\nAt this dark hour, we humbly ask for your prayers for Chidos healing, for strength to endure this pain, and for little Treasure, who will grow up knowing how much her father loved her.\n\nTatendas memory, Mavetera stated, will forever remain in their hearts, and the family is relying on faith to help them through the unbearable loss.\n\nHis memory will forever remain in our hearts. We trust God to carry us through this unbearable loss. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. Psalm 34:18.\n\nThe tragic accident also highlighted the worsening condition of the countrys roads, which have become increasingly hazardous. A light gone too soon, Mavetera reflected as she announced the burial of her son-in-law in Macheke last Friday.\n\nThis loss is a glaring reminder of the dangers we face every day on our roads, which have unfortunately become a death trap.\n\n",

The Ministry commits to pay $5 million per month over 12 months  totaling $60 million, three times the actual loan amount.\n\nBREAKING: Guvamatanga Exposed in $60 Million Scandal  Leaked Letter Shows Finance Secretary Compromised Treasury to Guarantee Shady Private LoanHarare, 17 April 2025  Zimbabwes Permanent Secretary for Finance, George Guvamatanga, has been exposed in a potentially explosivepic.twitter.com/o04eTgojJ1\n\n..\n\nIn the letter, Guvamatanga writes:\n\nMOF do hereby irrevocably guarantee and bind ourselves to the said Bank as sureties and co-principal debtors for the repayment on demand of all such sum or sums of money as Valley Seeds (Private) Limited hereafter will owe under the above mentioned facility\n\nThe Ministry goes even further, promising:\n\nMOF irrevocably undertakes to expunge the above Legacy Debt at a rate of USD 5,000,000.00 (Five Million United States Dollars) monthly\n\nEven more shockingly, Guvamatanga authorizes Ecobank to directly debit government funds if Valley Seeds defaults:\n\nMOF hereby grants Ecobank the right to directly debit an amount of up to USD5,000,000.00 from the MOF if there are any delays in receipt of the Legacy Debt payments\n\nThis Is Stinking Corruption\n\nProminent activist Jealousy Mawarire condemned the deal, declaring:\n\nThis is stinking corruption Why is the Ministry of Finance paying $60 million for a $20 million loan? Does it therefore imply that Ecobank is making a profit of $40 million from a structure where they outlaid $20 million?\n\nHe also questioned why such a deal was signed outside the Public Debt Management Act, without Parliaments approval:\n\nAll Gvt Loans and guarantees should be subject to the Public Debt Management Act and Parliament should be informed at all times.\n\nWhy Is Guvamatanga the Sole Executor?\n\nGuvamatangas name is the only one on the letter. He signs off the deal alone, stating that he has been authorized to:\n\nrepresent the Ministry and sign this document and give effect to the above said arrangement until the facility has been paid in full.\n\n@mawarirej Mawarire blasted this setup, asking:\n\nWhy would the Ministry appoint Guvamatanga to be the principal executor in a private transaction? If everything is transparent, why cant future Finance Permanent Secretaries uphold the same deal?\n\nSerious Red Flags\n\nThis arrangement has triggered widespread alarm for several reasons:Public funds are backing a private entity with no clarity on ownership or public benefit.The Ministry promises immunity from future policy changes, shielding the deal from incoming administrations.There is no evidence Parliament approved this guarantee, as required by law.The deal commits taxpayers to pay triple the loan value, without explanation.\n\nThe letter states that all facility fees will be borne by Valley Seeds, but with the Ministry essentially covering the entire $60 million, this clause appears meaningless.\n\nWho Is Valley Seeds?\n\nDespite being listed in Treasury books as holding over $191 million in legacy debt, Valley Seeds remains an opaque, private firm with no known public profile. Its strategic importance remains unexplained.\n\nWith Zimbabweans reeling from inflation, unemployment, and public sector collapse, the revelation that the Treasury is secretly backing a private firms debts with $60 million in taxpayer money has triggered urgent calls for investigation.\n\nMore to follow as we trace the money and the people behind Valley Seeds.\n\n",

The impact of the crash was so severe that the smaller vehicle was mangled beyond recognition, with its entire front section completely torn apart.\n\nEyewitnesses at the scene described the aftermath as horrifying, with debris scattered across the roadside and emergency services struggling to retrieve bodies from the wreckage. It was a terrible sight. You couldnt even tell how many people were in the car initially, said one bystander who arrived shortly after the crash.\n\nPreliminary reports suggest that excessive speed or a possible misjudgment during overtaking may have contributed to the collision, although official investigations are still underway.\n\nPolice and emergency responders arrived at the scene quickly, but sadly, six people were confirmed dead on the spot. The identities of the deceased have not yet been released as authorities work to notify the next of kin.\n\nThe Chinhoyi-Karoi highway has seen a worrying rise in fatal accidents in recent years, raising concerns over road safety enforcement and driver behavior on this major route linking key towns in Mashonaland West.\n\nAuthorities are urging motorists to exercise extreme caution, particularly on highways where traffic volumes and speeds are high. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has launched a full investigation into the incident.\n\nFurther details will be provided as they become available.\n\n",

            "content": "USD 90 Million for a Muddy Footpath? Zimbabwes Trabablas Interchange is a National Embarrassment\n\nNext month, Zimbabweans are expected to start using the so-called Trabablas Interchangea project hyped for years as a flagship of progress, a modern marvel poised to transform Harares traffic landscape. What has been delivered, however, is a deeply underwhelming mess: a USD 90 million pile of red earth, half-baked curves, and what appears to be a glorified footpath draped over bare embankments.\n\nThe latest photos from the construction site, proudly shared by Road Watch Zimbabwe, do not inspire national pridethey provoke justified outrage. A handful of tarred segments snake through mounds of exposed soil, flanked by scattered workers and construction vehicles. Theres no coherent structure in sight, no sign of the multilayered, efficient traffic artery that was promised. The illusion of progress is created with drone angles and Photoshop-ready lighting, but the reality on the ground is crude, unsealed, and nowhere near operational standard.\n\nWhere Did the Money Go?\n\nLets be clear: USD 90 million is no small sum. Its enough to construct several fully functional interchanges in countries with honest procurement practices and competent project management. Instead, Zimbabwe has ended up with something that, at best, resembles a Google Earth sketch of what a road might become. This begs the urgent question: where did the money go?\n\nTheres no plausible justification for this cost overrun unless one includes the typical ingredients of Zimbabwean statecraftcorruption, cronyism, and cover-ups. The opacity of the tender process, the absence of an independently audited breakdown of costs, and the usual chorus of official spin all point to the same pattern weve seen time and again: infrastructure as a conduit for looting.\n\nTrabablas DownloadingBut Whos Paying?\n\nThe galling part is that officials and online propagandists have the audacity to brand this debacle with pop-culture flairTrabablas downloading, they say, as if the public should laugh off the waste. Whats really downloading is another generational debt burden for the youth of this country, another chance for elites to siphon public funds while ordinary Zimbabweans dodge potholes and walk long distances due to a broken public transport system.\n\nThis interchange, in its current state, is not an achievement. It is a monument to mediocrity. A tragic reminder that in Zimbabwe, the bar is set so low that a road with visible mud and missing safety features can be celebrated as a national milestone.\n\nWe Deserve Better\n\nThe people of Zimbabwe are not asking for miraclesthey are asking for accountability. If USD 90 million was truly spent, there should be roads fit for purpose, lanes ready for traffic, signage installed, and drainage secured. What we see instead is something that looks more like a road-making rehearsal than a finished interchange.\n\nUntil the government begins to treat infrastructure with the seriousness it deservesthrough transparency, competence, and zero tolerance for corruptionTrabablas will remain an apt metaphor. A project caught in perpetual buffering mode, downloading forever, but never truly delivered.\n\n",

The protest comes amid mounting frustration over what many are calling a lack of urgency from the South African Police Service.\n\nThe protest was confirmed by activist and Greathope Funeral Director Moreboys Munetsi during a Facebook LIVE broadcast on April 17. Munetsi stated that the community had followed the legal process to secure permission for the demonstration.\n\nAs a community, we dont want to be violent, Munetsi said. We went to the police and were given permission for a demonstration. We want to do things legally. There is already interaction between the Zimbabwean and Ugandan communities. But justice must be served.\n\nMahambas death, captured in a disturbing viral video, shows him being run over while seated on the ground. The vehicle used, a Ford Ranger, has since been impounded, but the suspect remains unaccounted for.\n\nContrary to early reports, Munetsi clarified that the suspect is a Ghanaian national, not Ugandan, and is the partner of a Zimbabwean woman named Ntombi, who was briefly in a relationship with Mahamba. The couple share three children, the youngest being only four months old.\n\nThe affair between Ntombi and Emmanuel began in January. At the time, her youngest child with the Ghanaian suspect was only one month old, said Munetsi. After the murder, Ntombi and the man fled their home, and the children were sent to Zimbabwe.\n\nMunetsi, who is working closely with both the Mahamba family and police, revealed that Ntombi reached out to him to clear her name and share her side of the story.\n\nShe came to me asking to speak. She said she needed to tell the truth because people were attacking her, he said. She confirmed the relationship with Emmanuel, but she has also tried to convince the suspect to hand himself in.\n\nDespite efforts to track him, the suspect continues to evade authorities. Munetsi claims the mans phone remains active and that he is still running his business, making financial transactions that could help pinpoint his location.\n\nThis suspect is a businessman processing transactions right now. Why cant he be tracked through his phone or bank records? Munetsi asked. I asked the investigating officer why Section 205 of the law hasnt been used to compel mobile and financial service providers to assist in locating him.\n\nFrustration has grown over how law enforcement has managed the case. The Mahamba family was reportedly given the wrong case number at one point, leading to suspicions of deliberate obstruction.\n\nThe family is calm, not violent. But theyre hurt. They feel ignored, said Munetsi. This case is now viral. It is damaging the image of the Sandton Police Station. Something must be done.\n\nMunetsi also confirmed that he met with the Sandton detective team and provided them with voice recordings of the suspect speaking with associates. He criticized the slow pace of the investigation and warned that public anger could escalate if authorities continue to delay action.\n\nThe approved protest, led by Zimbabwean nationals and supported by South African citizens and diaspora groups, aims to pressure police into acting decisively. Organizers are calling for transparency in the investigation and protection for key witnesses like Ntombi.\n\nWe dont want violence. But the pain people are feeling is real, said Munetsi. The only way to ease that pain is through accountability. If the suspect is innocent, he should come forward and apply for bail. But he cannot remain free while a family is grieving and a community is in shock.\n\nAn anonymous tipster has reportedly shared the suspects possible location with Munetsis team. As the search continues, pressure is mounting for justice to be served in the name of Emmanuel Mahamba.\n\nStory developing\n\n",
