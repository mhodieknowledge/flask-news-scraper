            "content": "By Farai D Hove | Fresh details have emerged in the case of the disturbing child-abuse video that shocked the nation this week, after a leaked WhatsApp chat circulating online revealed that the woman seen violently assaulting the tied-up child is allegedly the stepmother  not the biological mother.\n\nAccording to the leaked messages, said to originate from community members in Bocha, under Chief Muchisi, the woman was reportedly arrested after neighbours identified her. The circulating message claims the child had taken a piece of bread from a neighbour, prompting the brutal beating captured in the video.\n\nThe chat further alleges that the biological mother is no longer living with the child, and that the stepmother was left in charge. One message reads in part:\n\nPaBocha mubhuku ra Muchisi watosungwa mai awa mwana atora chingwa cheumwe akudya. Hawasi mai wake, ndimai inini mai wake vakaenda. Ngatidzidzei kunzwira vana tsitsi.\n\nTranslated, it states: This happened in Bocha, under Chief Muchisi. The woman has been arrested. The child had taken someones bread. She is not the childs real mother  the real mother is no longer there. Let us learn to have compassion for children.\n\nThe message also reflects deep community anger, with residents calling the assault heartbreaking and urging adults to protect children, even in cases of marital conflict or separation.\n\nPolice Investigations Continue\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) earlier confirmed that investigations are underway to identify all individuals involved and ensure the child receives protection and medical attention.\n\nAuthorities have not yet confirmed the leaked WhatsApp details, but police sources indicate that the information is being reviewed as part of the ongoing investigation.\n\nSocial welfare officials are also expected to intervene as more information emerges about the childs living arrangements and safety.\n\nThis is a developing story, and ZimEye will provide further verified updates as they come.\n\n",

            "content": "Masvingo  The shocking disappearance of a four-month-old baby after a stranger posing as an employer vanished with the child has raised new urgency for communities to learn the early warning signs of child-snatching trickery now spreading across Zimbabwe.\n\nNineteen-year-old Letwin Ngandini had been offered what appeared to be a simple cleaning job. Instead, the encounter ended with her child being taken by the same woman who claimed she needed help at her unfinished house.\n\nPolice say the incident happened on November 13 along Sweetview Road, and they are now treating the case as kidnapping.\n\nBut beyond the investigation lies a pressing community question:How can ordinary people spot these dangers before they happen?\n\nHow the Kidnapper Struck  And the Warning Signs Many Missed\n\nAccording to police reports, the suspect approached Ngandini with a friendly demeanour and a believable story: the house was under construction, she needed help cleaning, and she would pay for the work.\n\nThe two walked nearly 500 metres to a half-built structure  a location isolated enough to give the kidnapper control.\n\nOnce there, the suspect instructed Ngandini to fetch a shovel.And when she returned 30 minutes later, both her baby and the woman had vanished.\n\nThis case demonstrates key danger signals that communities must learn to recognise  signals that are often ignored because the encounter feels normal or friendly.\n\nTo assist families, child-protection advocates and police recommend a simple checklist called the Early Warning Signs of a Kidnap Setup.\n\n EARLY WARNING SIGNS OF A CHILD-SNATCHING SETUP\n\nBelow are the danger signs that Ngandinis case reveals  signs that could protect another family tomorrow.\n\n1. A stranger offering work immediately, with urgency\n\nKidnappers often push victims to act fast so they do not have time to think or consult anyone.\n\n2. A request to go to a remote or half-built location\n\nUnfinished houses, bushy areas and construction sites are now commonly used because no one else is around.\n\n3. The suspect insists on going now, without allowing the victim to bring someone\n\nA real employer will never object to an escort, especially for casual labour.\n\n4. The stranger tries to create a false sense of comfort\n\nConversations, jokes, friendliness or offering money for snacks are manipulation tools used to lower defence.\n\n5. The suspect asks the parent to leave the child behind just for a minute\n\nThis is the moment the kidnapping usually happens.\n\n6. No identifiable employer details\n\nNo phone number, no ID, no location written down, no other workers on site  nothing that links the employer to a real address.\n\n7. A shift in the suspects behaviour when you ask questions\n\nEvading questions, insisting on silence, or brushing off safety concerns is a red flag.\n\nPolice Urge Communities to Self-Protect\n\nMasvingo Provincial Police Spokesperson Inspector Kudakwashe Dhewa urged residents:\n\nAnyone with information leading to the suspects identification should contact any nearest police station or ZRP Masvingo Province WhatsApp: 0775 996 945.\n\nHe added that communities should educate job seekers and parents on these early warning signs, as economic hardship is increasingly being exploited by predators.\n\nA Pattern of Manipulation\n\nThis is not the first such incident.\n\nIn September 2024, a Chiredzi woman temporarily left her baby with a stranger who had befriended her outside a hospital. The woman disappeared  using nearly identical tactics: friendliness, money, and sudden trust.\n\nThat child was later found. The Masvingo baby is still missing.\n\nCommunity Responsibility Is Now Key\n\nThe Masvingo case proves one painful truth:Kidnappers no longer snatch children by force  they do it by pretending to be helpers.\n\nAs economic challenges deepen, more people may fall victim to such predators unless communities:share this information widelywarn young mothersaccompany job seekersquestion suspicious job offersreport suspicious movements immediately\n\nBecause in moments like these, awareness is the strongest defence families have left.\n\n",

This has raised concerns about safety standards, economic viability, and whether the launch was prematurely celebrated without meeting the basic thresholds of a commercial passenger operation.\n\nThe plane in the picture is almost certainly a Cessna 404 Titan, an American-made twin-engine, unpressurised light transport aircraft.Key identifying features visible in your image: Long nose Twin piston engines mounted under the wings Rectangular cabin windows (usually 67) High-set horizontal stabiliser Squared-off tail with a dark stripe\n\nThese match the Cessna 404 Titan very closely.\n\n How old is it?\n\nThe Cessna 404 was produced between 1976 and 1982.That means any surviving aircraft today is:\n\n43  49 years old.\n\n Passenger Capacity\n\nThe Cessna 404 was designed as a commuter and cargo aircraft.Its typical seating: Pilot(s): 1 or 2 Passengers: up to 10 (but often 68 depending on configuration)\n\nSome versions are used purely for cargo.\n\n Safety Record\n\nOverall, the Cessna 404 has a moderate safety record for a light twin-engine piston aircraft. Factors affecting incidents include: Engine failures (common in older piston twins) Pilot error Overloading (frequent in commercial operations in Africa and Latin America) Poor maintenance on older airframes Weather-related crashes (IFR capability is limited)\n\nIt is not considered unsafe, but safety depends heavily on:1. The operator,2. The engines condition, and3. Maintenance quality.\n\nWell-maintained examples fly safely worldwide.\n\n Range Before Refuelling\n\nThe Cessna 404 Titan has: Maximum range: ~1,3501,600 km (730860 nautical miles) Typical safe operational range: 9001,200 km\n\nThis varies depending on: Weight Weather/winds Fuel tank configuration Power settings\n\n Summary\n\nFeature DetailAircraft type Cessna 404 TitanYears produced 19761982Age today 4349 yearsPassenger capacity Up to 10 (usually 68)Range 1,3501,600 kmSafety record Moderate; highly dependent on maintenance & operator\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent  The Ministry of Health and Child Care has launched investigations into a fake nursing recruitment website and a rising number of social media scams targeting aspiring nursing applicants.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the ministrys spokesperson, Mr Donald Mujiri, said fraudsters were exploiting WhatsApp groups, social media platforms and private cellphone numbers to deceive desperate applicants into believing they could secure nursing school placements through unofficial channels.\n\nHe emphasised that legitimate recruitment isonlyannounced through the countrys mainstream print media and the ministrys verified social media pages. Mr Mujiri warned that anything outside these platforms is fake, illegal and aimed at stealing money from the public.\n\nWe are working with law enforcement to track, arrest and prosecute all individuals involved in these scams, he said. Corruption, bribery and backdoor recruitment will not be tolerated. The public is advised not to pay anyone, join unofficial groups, or respond to private phone numbers claiming to assist with nursing entry or job placement.\n\nNurse training in Zimbabwe remains one of the most competitive programmes, attracting thousands of applicants for limited training places each year.\n\nTo improve fairness and transparency, the ministry recently decentralised the recruitment process, allowing local applicants to benefit directly. However, the high number of applicants has also created opportunities for manipulation and corruption by scammers.\n\n",
