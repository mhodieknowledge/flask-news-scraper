Even if one holds a diploma or a PhD, an O Level certificate is still required, Justice Chitapi stated in his judgment. The applicant was coy in disclosing information regarding his qualifications, and the challenge cannot succeed.\n\nMagayas failure to provide evidence of his qualifications in his affidavit further weakened his case, with the court emphasising that submitting an O Level certificate would have resolved the issue easily.\n\nThe ruling clears the path for the ZIFA elections to proceed on Saturday, where six candidates are vying for the presidency.The contenders include President Mnangagwa associate Nqobile Magwizi, former PSL chairperson Twine Phiri, UK-based football administrator Marshall Gore, former ZIFA board member Philemon Machana, Northern Region Division One league chairperson Martin Kweza, and ex-Dynamos forward Makwinje Phiri.\n\nMagayas defeat follows a string of controversies, including rape, fraud and corruption.\n\nAnother disqualified aspirant, Temba Mliswa, recently withdrew his legal challenge, while former Warriors captain Benjamin Mwaruwari and administrator Gift Banda are pursuing their cases at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\n",

            "content": "The Praisedium: A Nations Trap in the Belly-on-Air LeadershipOnce upon a time in the fictional land of Zimbala, the people found themselves at a crossroads. The nation was blessed with resources, brilliant minds, and the potential to rise as a global player. However, instead of inviting transformative leaders and visionaries to the helm, the country found itself dominated by a peculiar group of leaders referred to as The Praisedium.\n\nThis Praisedium, as the satirical cartoon depicted, was composed of individuals who seemed more invested in personal comfort than in the welfare of the people. Draped in symbolic regalia, they gathered on plush couches, their bellies full and their minds seemingly preoccupied with their own applause rather than governance. The citizens nicknamed their leader Belly-on-Air, a man whose commanding presence was matched only by his ability to promise greatness while delivering little but speeches and laughter.\n\nThe Missed OpportunityAt the same time, in neighboring regions and faraway lands, billionaires and visionary investors like Strive Masiyiwa were calling attention to the wonders of AI and technology, offering opportunities for nations to leap into the future. Masiyiwa and others like him were championing the transformation of economies through innovation, entrepreneurship, and empowerment. They highlighted the promise of Africas human capital, its untapped resources, and the boundless creativity of its people.\n\nYet Zimbalas Praisedium seemed oblivious. When approached by such investors, they were more concerned with securing their own seats of power than creating space for new ideas. The leaders scoffed at concepts like quantum computing, brushing it off as irrelevant to the common man, despite knowing the world was advancing rapidly. They dismissed technology pioneers as distractions while reinforcing their own narrative of loyalty, self-praise, and short-term populism.\n\nThe Trap TightensAs other countries invited billionaires, researchers, and global leaders to innovate within their borders, Zimbala sank further into its trap of complacency. The Praisedium doubled down on their image, ensuring the nations focus remained on shallow victories and hollow promises. Infrastructure crumbled, industries lagged, and the youth, eager for better prospects, left in droves.\n\nThe belly-on-air philosophy of leadership bred a culture of mediocrity. The leaders ensured their own comfort and symbols of power were untouched while ignoring the cries of farmers, entrepreneurs, and students who begged for modern tools and investments.\n\nA Glimpse of HopeIn the midst of this stagnation, whispers of change began circulating. Those who had fled Zimbala took inspiration from visionaries like James Manyika and Strive Masiyiwa. They built their own networks abroad, sharing knowledge and seeking to educate others on the importance of aligning leadership with progress.\n\nThough the Praisedium remained intact, cracks began to form. The people grew weary of empty promises and started demanding tangible outcomes. Some proposed turning to leaders who could genuinely create pathways for progress, even if it meant challenging the status quo.\n\nA New Path Forward?The Praisediums trap was not absolute. As neighboring nations thrived and welcomed investors and innovators, Zimbala had a choice to make: continue down the path of belly-on-air politics or embrace a new era of leadership that prioritizes economic growth, education, and technological advancement.\n\nThe moral of the story was clear: a nations future depends not on those who sit comfortably in power, but on those who can rise and create opportunities for generations to come. Will Zimbala break free from its self-imposed trap? Only timeand the resolve of its peoplewill tell.\n\n",

            "content": "By Showbiz Reporter | ZimEye| Malotti, a former gang member who recently made waves with her candid interview with Dr. Ollah, has opened up about her tumultuous journey through the dangerous world of gangsterism. Her story, which she detailed with startling honesty, has sparked widespread discussions about the hidden lives of young women caught up in criminal networks.\n\nA Childhood Marked by Uncertainty\n\nMalotti described herself as a person who always gravitated toward older peers and riskier social circles. Growing up in an environment that normalized violence and crime, she found herself befriending a girl whose family was deeply embedded in organized crime.\n\nHer relatives were gang leaders, connected to groups like the 28s from South Africa, Malotti revealed. They liked me because I was intelligent, and they saw potential in me for their operations.\n\nBy Grade 9, or Form 2, Malotti had become involved in small but significant roles within the gang. As a young girl, she was often underestimated, which made her a useful asset for distraction tactics during their operations.\n\nThe Cult-Like Nature of Gangsterism\n\nMalotti compared her experiences in the gang to being part of a cult. Its like a church, she said. Once youre in, its hard to get out. There are strict rules, and betrayal is not tolerated. Youre expected to stay loyal, no matter what.\n\nThis loyalty often came at a cost. Malotti shared how she was drawn deeper into the criminal lifestyle, taking on more dangerous roles as her involvement grew. Though she avoided participating in the most violent aspects, she became an integral part of the gangs planning and execution of their schemes.\n\nMoney, Fear, and Survival\n\nOne of the key drivers of Malottis involvement in the gang was financial survival. We made money through well-planned operations, targeting places like clubs and businesses, she said. Everyone had a role, and we all depended on each other to get the job done.\n\nDespite the allure of quick money, the dangers of the lifestyle weighed heavily on her. Malotti admitted that she often feared for her life, especially during high-profile operations. I didnt want to stay, but leaving wasnt an option. The gang doesnt take kindly to people walking away, she explained.\n\nBreaking Stereotypes About Women in Gangs\n\nMalotti also addressed common misconceptions about women in gangsterism. She rejected the stereotype of women being merely gangster wives or accessories to their male counterparts. I wasnt just someones girlfriend. I was a gangster myself, she asserted. Its about mindsetyou choose this life, and you live by its rules.\n\nHer words challenged the notion that women in gangs are passive participants. Instead, she highlighted the active and often leadership roles they play within these networks, managing operations and contributing to the gangs success.\n\nThe Road to Redemption\n\nAfter years of living on the edge, Malotti decided to leave the criminal world behind. It wasnt easy, she admitted. The gang treats leaving like betrayal, and there are consequences. But I wanted to change my life, so I took the risk.\n\nHer journey out of gangsterism was slow and difficult, but she credits her faith and determination for helping her escape. Today, Malotti speaks openly about her past in the hope of inspiring others to make better choices and avoid the life she once lived.\n\nA Cautionary Tale\n\nMalottis story serves as a powerful reminder of the realities of gangsterism and its impact on young people. Her bravery in sharing her experiences with Dr. Ollah has shed light on the hidden dynamics of criminal networks and the challenges of breaking free from their grasp.\n\nAs she continues to rebuild her life, Malotti remains committed to using her story to educate and empower others. If my journey can help just one person avoid the mistakes I made, then its worth it, she said.\n\nMalottis confession has not only sparked discussions but also calls for more attention to be given to addressing the root causes of gangsterism. Her story is one of pain, survival, and ultimately, hope.\n\nThis follow-up highlights the key points of Malottis story and her efforts to inspire change through her experiences. Let me know if youd like any further details or modifications!\n\n",

            "content": "Ziyambis Double Reversal: Mnangagwas Role in 2030 Term Extension Sparks Controversy\n\nBy Dorrothy Moyo | ZimEye | ZANU PF Politburo member and Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi has found himself at the center of controversy, this time doubling back on his own admission that President Emmerson Mnangagwa is orchestrating efforts to extend his presidential term to 2030. This follows a leaked video in which Ziyambi revealed a deliberate strategy to frame the term-extension proposal as a grassroots initiative, while simultaneously denying Mnangagwas involvement in the programa claim many view as contradictory and deceptive.\n\nThe Mnangagwa-controlled state publication,The Herald,recently reported that the term-extension push was entirely driven by the general membership of ZANU PF and was neither initiated nor influenced by the President. The report cited Ziyambi as saying that Mnangagwa had no hand in the motion, labeling any suggestion to the contrary as preposterous.\n\nHowever, insiders and critics have pointed out glaring inconsistencies in Ziyambis claims. The program to extend Mnangagwas term was reportedly launched at Mnangagwas own rural farm last weekend, where the President himself presided over the announcement. This directly contradicts Ziyambis assertions that Mnangagwa was uninvolved in the matter and paints a picture of carefully crafted political theater designed to shield the President from allegations of constitutional manipulation.\n\nThe Double Reversal\n\nIn his statements, Ziyambi insisted that the extension push was purely the will of ZANU PF members, stating:\n\nAt no time did President Mnangagwa say he wants this or that, about the issue of 2030. It is us as the people and general membership of ZANU PF who expressed our desire about what we want him to do.\n\nYet, Ziyambis earlier remarks in a leaked ZBC clip paint a different picture. In that footage, he openly admitted that the narrative being pushed is deliberately constructed to give the impression that Mnangagwa is uninvolved:\n\nWhen you are asked, you must say we are the ones who came up with the call to lengthen President Mnangagwas term even myself when I shall meet him, I shall sound like he has no clue about it.\n\nThis statement now serves as a stark contradiction to his latest public stance. Critics accuse Ziyambi of engaging in deliberate misinformation to manipulate party structures and public perception.\n\nGrassroots Resistance and Constitutional Concerns\n\nWhile Ziyambi attempts to portray the term-extension drive as a product of grassroots demand, dissenting voices within ZANU PF have challenged this narrative. A group of party members recently released a statement condemning the push, questioning when and where party structures allegedly agreed to such a resolution.\n\nWhere did we agree as ZANU PF people from the grassroots structures on coming up with this term extension resolution? Dont lie to us. It never happened,read part of the statement.\n\nThe critics argue that the term-extension proposal violates Zimbabwes constitution, which limits presidential terms to two five-year terms. Mnangagwa, who secured a contested victory in the 2023 elections, is currently set to leave office in 2028. Extending his term would require an amendment to the constitution, which many view as an affront to democratic principles.\n\nEmmerson Mnangagwas @CNN promise to step down in 2028, even if the people would love me to the heel, I will still go away | 2025 STATUS @ZANUPF_Official  @nickmangwana   @amanpourpic.twitter.com/BCXaeeXlQc\n\nA Manufactured Crisis?\n\nThe unfolding drama has cast doubt on the integrity of ZANU PFs internal processes and the authenticity of the term-extension campaign. Observers note that the initiatives launch at Mnangagwas rural farm undermines claims that it is a grassroots movement. Instead, they argue it reflects a top-down approach meant to consolidate Mnangagwas grip on power while maintaining a faade of constitutionalism.\n\nThe timing of Ziyambis conflicting statements further adds to the confusion, with critics accusing him of attempting to manage public backlash while toeing the party line.\n\nWhats Next for ZANU PF?\n\nThe controversy highlights deep divisions within ZANU PF and mounting resistance to Mnangagwas leadership. As the battle over the proposed term extension unfolds, the ruling party faces growing scrutiny over its adherence to constitutional principles and its ability to maintain unity in the face of internal dissent.\n\nFor now, Ziyambis double reversal has only fueled speculation about Mnangagwas true intentions and the lengths his administration is willing to go to secure a prolonged stay in power.

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a controversial move, the Zimbabwean government has ramped up its efforts to target sellers of second-hand clothes and goods imported from neighboring countries, as part of its broader economic strategy.\n\nSeven individuals suspected of smuggling second-hand clothes have been arrested, and a significant amount of goods were seized during a police roadblock in Gweru. The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has declared a zero-tolerance policy toward smuggling, with heightened scrutiny on goods entering the country through unofficial channels.\n\nThe crackdown, led by ZRPs Gweru urban district, has uncovered a network of smugglers who have been disguising second-hand clothes in unmarked boxes and bags to avoid detection by authorities. These goods, mainly clothing, were being smuggled into Zimbabwe from neighboring Mozambique, with the intended destination being Bulawayo.\n\nWe are leaving no room for such illegal activities to thrive, said Chief Superintendent Dr. Leon Marongedza, the ZRP Officer Commanding for Gweru Urban District. Smuggling not only damages the economy but also robs the country of revenue that could have been collected through legal channels. We are committed to prosecuting all those involved and ensuring they face the full force of the law.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government had initially banned the importation of second-hand clothes in 2015, aiming to safeguard the local textile industry and encourage domestic manufacturing. However, in 2017, the ban was relaxed, allowing for limited imports under strict regulations, including the requirement of import licenses and proof of duty payment.\n\nDespite this relaxation, the government has struggled to regulate the flow of second-hand goods, which continue to flood local markets, often bypassing customs and duties. Economists argue that while the governments enforcement measures may have some short-term benefits, the persistent practice of catch-and-release tactics will not address the underlying structural issues plaguing the local economy.\n\nExperts warn that the smuggling problem cannot be solved solely by arresting small-time offenders, as the root cause lies in the lack of viable economic alternatives for local businesses and the difficulty of sustaining a competitive manufacturing sector amidst rising costs.\n\nAs long as the local industry remains uncompetitive, people will continue to rely on second-hand goods as an affordable option, said one economist. The governments approach of cracking down on sellers without addressing these deeper economic issues is unlikely to lead to long-term solutions.\n\n",

            "content": "By Shelton Muchena | HARARE- The Zimbabwe State media has once again been caught in the ZANU PF succession race by deliberately blacking out the Acting President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThis comes after the acting President was glaringly absent from the front pages of state-run media, following his poignant address at the Heroes Acre commemorations yesterday.\n\nAnd this is not the first time that the former Army boss has face media black out from the state run papers.\n\nThis omission, perceived as a direct affront to his authority and stature, is raising eyebrows amidst the already volatile political landscape.\n\nDelivering a solemn tribute as he paid respects to three national heroes, General Chiwengas speech underscored the themes of unity and national pride. Yet, despite the significance of the occasion, the decision by the state media not to highlight his address raises serious questions about respect and recognition for the countrys leadership. Observers assert that this snubbing points to deeper issues within the ruling party, particularly the ongoing struggle for influence among top officials.\n\nInsiders reveal that the instruction to downgrade Chiwengas coverage came directly from former Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa, who seemingly holds sway over editorial decisions within the state media. This is an insult not only to the Vice President but to all those who stand for the principles of our national heritage, said a senior party member who wished to remain anonymous. It sends a clear message: there are factions within ZANU-PF that refuse to respect the chain of command.\n\nCritics argue that such blatant disregard for the Vice President is symptomatic of a larger context of political maneuvering and rivalry within the government. General Chiwenga has long been a pivotal figure in Zimbabwes political theater, particularly known for his role in the military intervention that led to the ousting of former President Robert Mugabe. Yet, the ongoing downplay of his role and status provokes serious concern about unity and loyalty within the party ranks.\n\nEditors of state media face mounting criticism as they are seen as complicit in this orchestrated marginalization of Chiwenga. Many believe that their failure to feature the Vice President prominently reflects an alarming trend of undermining authority, further complicating the already precarious balance of power in Zimbabwe.\n\nPolitical analysts warn that the ramifications of such actions could be profound. Failing to present strong editorial support for the Vice President sends a damaging message both domestically and internationally, said renowned political analyst Dr. Tinashe Chikova. It inadvertently fuels perceptions of instability and factionalism, which could weaken the partys standing going into upcoming elections.\n\nAs Zimbabwe grapples with challenges ranging from economic turmoil to calls for greater political accountability, the need for cohesive leadership is paramount. Highlights from Chiwengas speech must not be overshadowed by media intricacies that threaten to erode public confidence in the government.\n\nThe urgent call now is for unity and respect within the corridors of powera rallying cry that the Vice President himself emphasized during his address. As the nation reflects on the sacrifices of its heroes, it must not lose sight of the importance of strong, respectful leadership in navigating its future.\n\nThe spotlight now turns back to state media and its editors; will they continue to undermine the Vice President, or will they choose to uphold the dignity of leadership during these critical times? The answer could well shape Zimbabwes political horizon in the days to come.- ZimEye\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has expressed interest in acquiring a fake news monitoring tool, similar to the one recently purchased by Malawi for $1.5 million. Nick Mangwana, Zimbabwes government spokesperson, invited public opinion on the matter, asking citizens to consider the principle of using technology to combat fake news, regardless of the cost.\n\nMalawis media regulatory body, equivalent to Zimbabwes Media Commission (ZMC), acquired the tool to identify and counter fake news and harmful content. This move is seen as a proactive measure to protect the public from misinformation, which can spread rapidly through social media platforms.\n\nThe idea has sparked debate in Zimbabwe, with some expressing concerns that such a tool could be used to stifle free speech or silence critical voices. Others argue that it could help address the growing problem of misinformation, which can undermine democracy and social stability.\n\nCritics warn that the implementation of such a tool could be contentious if not properly regulated, potentially leading to political control and censorship. The discussion around fake news monitoring is part of a broader global conversation on balancing the need to protect the public from harmful misinformation while preserving the fundamental right to freedom of expression.\n\nAs the debate continues, Zimbabwes media regulators will likely face increasing pressure to clarify how such a tool would be used and to ensure transparency and fairness in its application. The consideration of Malawis move signals an ongoing conversation about the role of technology in regulating the flow of information in the digital age.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nActing President Constantino Chiwenga sparked controversy on Wednesday when he praised three late Zanu PF heroes as righteous during their burial at the National Heroes Acre in Harare. The heroes, Major General (Retired) Solomon Siziba, Chen Chimutengwende, and Ambassador John Shumba Mvudura, were honored for their contributions to Zimbabwes liberation and development.\n\nChiwengas remarks, which included calling the heroes saints in the world beyond, drew criticism from church leaders who felt that such declarations were overly sanctimonious and not in line with religious teachings. Despite the backlash, Chiwenga emphasized the importance of national unity and integrity, citing President Emmerson Mnangagwas mantra, Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo (The country is built by its own people).\n\nThe Acting President also urged citizens to remain vigilant against corruption, declaring that it is up to each generation to uphold a wholesome legacy. Chiwengas words called for unity, emphasizing that as Zimbabwe strives for its Vision 2030 goals, the nation must move away from actions that harm its collective progress, such as corruption and misconduct .\n\n",
