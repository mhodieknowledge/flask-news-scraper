            "content": "Socialite in Court for Alleged Witchcraft\n\nBy A Correspondent | ZimEye | Personal stylist and social media influencer Melody Natasha Mhandu (34) appeared before a Mbare magistrate on Thursday, accused of casting a spell on her former friend, Tatenda Butau.\n\nMhandu was charged with engaging in practices associated with witchcraft under Section 98(i) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23]. She was released unconditionally after a brief court appearance.\n\nProsecutors allege that on August 4, at Churu Farm, Mhandu performed a ritual involving Butaus name, a red cloth, a knife, and snuff powder, which she allegedly buried under a muhacha tree with the help of a traditional healer, Christine Matashu, also known as Manjenje.\n\nThe case was reported after Mhandus former maid, Elizabeth Mhahire, claimed she had accompanied her to visit Manjenje. Mhahire told the court she later found snuff powder in Mhandus room and bathroom. When she confronted Mhandu, the two argued, and the maid quit.\n\nMhahire later informed Butau about the alleged spell. Butau, accompanied by her boyfriend and the maid, went to the site and dug up the knife and cloth before confronting Mhandu. A police report was then made.\n\nMhandu, however, denies all allegations.\n\nShe will deny having wrapped any red cloth with a dagger and snuff powder and burying it underground as alleged, or at all.\n\nShe will deny having any intention to harm or realising the real risk or possibility of harming any person as alleged, or at all. She will tell the court that she does not know any ritualist by whatever name. She never visited any, either alone or with any other person, as alleged or at all. She did not cast any spell on anyone as alleged or at all, said her lawyers.\n\nShe also dismissed the charges as a malicious fabrication of a vindictive former maid who is manipulating the current bad blood between the accused and the complainant.\n\nMhandu further argued the case is a smear campaign. She will also state that the allegations against her do not amount to any practice associated with witchcraft They are only meant as a public show for the purposes of causing embarrassment and humiliation, said her lawyers.\n\n",

This highlights the importance of early detection and proper hygiene.\n\n Diagnosis\n\nThough often diagnosed based on appearance, confirmation methods include:\n\nSkin scraping and microscopy (KOH preparation to see fungal hyphae)\n\nFungal culture\n\nWoods lamp test (note: not reliable for T. verrucosum)\n\n Treatment Options\n\nWhile Dermatophytosis often self-cures, treatment is recommended to prevent spread:\n\nIdeal for mild or localized cases:\n\nLime sulfur (1:16) or Enilconazole (1:100) rinse\n\nTwice-a-week applications\n\nOther options: Miconazole, Iodine, or Chlorhexidine washes\n\nRemove crusts with a brush and discard the brush and burn the infective material, advises veterinary guidelines.\n\nFor severe or outbreak scenarios:\n\nGriseofulvin (restricted in food animals in some regions)\n\nIvermectin (some antifungal effect but not first-line)\n\nClean and disinfect barns, feeding troughs, and grooming tools\n\nUse antifungal disinfectants such as bleach (1:10 solution)  though some vets caution that bleach can be irritating and hazardous to humans\n\n Recovery & Immunity\n\nLesions can take weeks to fully heal\n\nImmunity generally develops after infection, making reinfection rare in older animals\n\nEmail:[emailprotected]\n\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/share/18x439qwXt/\n\nWhatsApp Channel:\n\nInstagram: @lasmuzagro1LinkedIn: Lasmuz Agro\n\n",

She is a Member of Parliament and Chairperson of a parliamentary committee. You dont need to like her as a person to understand this context as a basis for her presence.\n\nPolitical analyst Freddy Michael Masarirevhu also weighed in, saying the outrage lacked political understanding.\n\nThe political mindset of some Zimbabweans is astonishing, he posted on X. @JoanaMamombe chairs the Committee on Environment, Wildlife, Climate & Tourism. She has an obligation to attend events related to her committee and engage various stakeholders. The President was part of the event and so was his Minister. How does her shaking hands with the President become an issue?\n\nHe added, You wanted her to ignore the Head of State and the Minister? How will that enable her to perform her duties as the Chair of the Committee? Beyond anger and personal frustrations, politics also requires reasoning, logic and common sense.\n\nResponding to the uproar, Mamombe issued a statement on X to clarify her position.\n\nAs Chair, I led the Parliamentary Committee on Tourism & Hospitality to the launch of Zimbabwes new Tourism Policy, she said. Our role is oversight and accountability to ensure policies serve the people. We ought to interrogate, monitor and guide implementation of the policy.\n\nDespite the storm of criticism, a number of Zimbabweans continue to defend Mamombes actions, saying the reaction is more emotional than rational  and fails to appreciate the distinction between politics and parliamentary responsibility.\n\n",

Dressing like a prophet wont cleanse the economy, said one Facebook user.\n\nAdding to the political flavour of the event, Archbishop Dr. Andby Makururu, founder of the Johane the 5th of Africa International Church, also showered praise on the Second Republic, crediting President Emmerson Mnangagwas government for creating a conducive environment for apostolic sects to grow.\n\nWe are grateful to the Second Republic for empowering freedom of religion.

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nHARARE  The Zimbabwean government has come under fire after launching a controversial cybersecurity programme that critics say is designed to spy on citizens, suppress dissent, and militarise the internet  with heavy involvement from Russian entities.\n\nThe programme, officially known as the National Cybersecurity Training Programme, was unveiled in Harare by ICT Minister Tatenda Mavetera, who claimed it would train over 10,000 youths in areas such as ethical hacking, cyberattack simulations, and digital monitoring.\n\nBut while authorities say the initiative is aimed at bolstering Zimbabwes digital infrastructure, rights groups, opposition figures, and tech experts see a more sinister motive  the creation of a state-sponsored cyber surveillance force.\n\nWe are happy to say we have come up with a cybersecurity strategy that outlines how we will deploy cybersecurity across the country, said Minister Mavetera at the launch. This is underpinned by infrastructure, digital skills, and ensuring safety in cyberspace and data protection.\n\nHowever, the programmes details  including the establishment of a national cybersecurity monitoring centre  have sparked alarm, particularly given the governments increasingly hostile stance towards online criticism and independent digital platforms.\n\nThis isnt about security. Its about surveillance, said a Harare-based digital rights advocate. Theyre training young people to become cyber spooks  to monitor what we say, what we post, and how we communicate.\n\nAdding to the alarm is the governments partnership with Russian cybersecurity firms, including CYBERUS, KOMIB, and InnoStage  all of which have ties to the Kremlins broader strategy of exporting cyber control tools to allied regimes.\n\nMavetera openly praised the 2023 Bilateral Cybersecurity Agreement signed between Zimbabwe and Russia, saying:\n\nThis partnership proposes three key domains: building national cyber security capacity; establishing a cyber-resilience verification framework; and creating a national cyber security monitoring centre.\n\nAnalysts say the partnership effectively gives Russia a foothold in Zimbabwes digital ecosystem, raising serious concerns over data privacy, sovereignty, and the militarisation of cyberspace.\n\nThis is a dangerous entanglement, said one analyst. Russia is known for its authoritarian use of cyber tools. Now Zimbabwe is importing that model.\n\nRussian officials present at the launch, including Sergey Kuzin from the Russian Embassy and Dmitry Grigoriev from KOMIB, framed the project as a way to foster global cooperation. But their comments only deepened suspicions.\n\nNo nation is immune to cyber intruders, Grigoriev said. We must invest in education, performance and innovative technologies to combat cybercrime effectively.\n\nYet critics argue the real threat isnt hackers  its a regime obsessed with control.\n\nThis is digital repression wearing a graduation cap, said opposition MP Tapiwa Nyambirai. Theyre calling it education, but its indoctrination.\n\nWhile the programme promises scholarships and job placements for top-performing recruits, civil society groups say its a smokescreen  an attempt to sanitise what is essentially a government-run programme to spy on its own people.\n\nThey want to turn tech-savvy youth into cyber vigilantes for the regime, one university student told reporters. Its not empowerment  its entrapment.\n\nThe involvement of Russian-linked organisations in managing the learning platform and selecting trainees has also triggered concern over foreign influence in domestic surveillance.\n\nThe internet was one of the last free spaces in Zimbabwe, said a digital journalist. Now its being brought under state control  with help from Moscow.\n\nAs the Mnangagwa administration faces growing criticism over shrinking civic space, this latest move suggests a new front has opened  one that may not be fought in the streets, but in chat groups, inboxes, and browsers.\n\n",
