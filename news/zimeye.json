            "content": "Gweru, Zimbabwe  Tuesday 13 May 2025\n\nBy Dorrothy Moyo | ZimEye | Two police officers were injured after a Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) Mahindra vehicle was struck by a moving train at a rail-level crossing near the Vehicle Inspection Department (VID) depot in Gweru.\n\nAccording to a report by The Sunday Mail, the crash occurred after the police driver allegedly failed to give way to the oncoming train. Emergency responders rushed to the scene in the early evening, as eyewitnesses reported the vehicle had been dragged some distance by the locomotive upon impact.\n\nWhile the full extent of the officers injuries remains unclear, officials confirmed both were inside the vehicle at the time of the crash. They were taken to a local hospital for urgent medical attention.\n\nThe incident has sparked a flurry of outrage on social media, with users questioning the professionalism and training of the officers involved. One commenter, Khumbulani Moyo, posted: So who is to follow the rules while the enforcement agents are failing? Another, Gladmore Mpofu, demanded an investigation: They must be investigated how did they got the job because they dont look professional and [fit] for their positions.\n\nOthers mocked the situation, suggesting possible corruption or recklessness. Dickson Man Dee Manyawu quipped: Maybe they tried to block the train for a bribe since it was overspeeding.\n\nThe crash raises serious concerns about the conduct and preparedness of law enforcement officers on duty, especially in high-risk traffic zones. The Zimbabwe Republic Police has not yet issued an official statement on the accident.\n\nAuthorities are expected to launch a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash, including whether safety protocols at the rail crossing were observed and whether the officers exercised due diligence.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\n",

            "content": "By Parliament Reporter-Finance SecretaryGeorge Guvamatanga,often dubbedMnangagwas bankerfor his powerful grip on Zimbabwes Treasury, has again dodged parliamentary scrutiny over a string of controversial multi-million-dollar payments, including irregular tenders linked to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) and politically connected businessmanWicknell Chivayo.\n\nGuvamatanga on Monday failed, for thesecond consecutive time, to appear before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), a no-show that has angered lawmakers and prompted threats of legal summons.\n\nThe PAC, chaired byKuwadzana MP Charlton Hwende, is probingUS$400 million in direct paymentsmade by Treasury to various companies without routing through the appropriate line ministries  a blatant violation of thePublic Finance Management Act.\n\nAmong the biggest beneficiaries isRen-Form CC, a South African company controversially handpicked to print election materials for ZEC. Financial records in South Africa show Ren-Form received overR1.2 billion (approx. US$65 million)in public funds from Zimbabwes Treasury. Alarmingly,R800 millionof that amount is suspected to have been redirected to accounts linked toWicknell Chivayo, a flamboyant businessman with well-documented ties to the ruling elite.\n\nZEC, chaired byJustice Priscilla Chigumba, has come under fire for bypassing normal procurement regulations. Despite repeated denials, insiders allege the contracts wererubber-stamped by Guvamatanga, who approved payments outside official procurement channels.\n\nHwende told journalists that Guvamatanga has been given afinal ultimatumto appear before Parliamentthis Friday, failing which the committee will issuesummons through the Clerk of Parliament.\n\nThis is the last opportunity. If he doesnt appear on Friday, summons will be issued immediately. There must be accountability, Hwende said.\n\nThe PAC also wantsFinance Minister Mthuli Ncubeto testify, particularly on whether Treasurys payment methods have become a tool for patronage and corruption.\n\nIn addition to Ren-Form, the committee has demanded documents on direct Treasury disbursements to:\n\nThese irregularities suggest a deliberate centralization of financial power under Guvamatanga, allowing him toprioritize contracts without cabinet oversight, thus opening doors to political abuse.\n\nGuvamatangas refusal to appear before Parliament has renewed scrutiny over hisaccumulated wealth, much of which remains unexplained. Investigations show that heowns multiple luxury properties in South Africa, including anR18 million mansion in Sandton, Johannesburgs wealthiest suburb.\n\nHe has also been linked to the purchase oftop-of-the-range vehicles for alleged girlfriends, includinga Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG and a Porsche Cayenne, both registered in the names of proxies. Social media videos and court documents have occasionally surfaced linking him tolavish birthday parties, designer watches, and private jets, all while Zimbabwes economy struggles under inflation and widespread poverty.\n\nDespite public outrage, Guvamatanga appears to enjoypolitical protectionfrom PresidentEmmerson Mnangagwa, under whose administration he has consolidated power over Treasury disbursements. Sources in the rulingZanu PFparty suggest he is considered untouchable because he is part of acore group managing presidential election logisticsandstrategic campaign financing.\n\nIronically, while Guvamatanga dodges Parliament, civil servants are crying over delayed salaries, unpaid pensions, and poor working conditions.\n\n",

HMMAS alleged it made these payments, with US$700,000 paid through a now-defunct bank and the remainder through the conveyancers, Muza & Nyapadi.\n\nThe court was told that on March 21, 2022, Kereke allegedly colluded with Rukasha, who signed an acknowledgment of debt for US$400,000 on behalf of HMMAS.\n\nThe society claimed this was an abuse of office, as it had already fully paid for the hospital. Rukasha was dismissed following disciplinary proceedings related to this act.\n\nIt said Kereke, relying on the acknowledgment of debt, coerced HMMAS into signing a new agreement on August 31, 2023, which stated a purchase price of US$1,138,900, claiming US$866,900 had already been paid, leaving a balance of US$272,000.\n\nHMMAS contended it had made US$138,000 in payments under what it termed an unlawful agreement. The reconstituted Board, led by Zacharia Murerwa, stated the agreement was induced by fraud or duress.\n\nHMMAS sought confirmation of its ownership and full payment for Fortress Hospital, demanding the refund of the US$138,000.\n\nKereke countered the claim arguing that the payment of US$650,000 towards the hospitals assets was never received among other things.\n\nFurthermore, Kereke criticized the plaintiffs pleadings as inelegant and called the legal narrative presented by both parties a complete bog.\n\nUltimately, the High Court found no merit in HMMASs claims, concluding that Kereke successfully defended himself against the allegations.\n\nThe plaintiff has failed to prove any aspect of its case.\n\nThe first defendant destroyed the plaintiffs case completely. The plaintiff has no case. This suit is manifestly opportunistic. The defendants are entitled to judgment, said Mafusire.\n\n",
