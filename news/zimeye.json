            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nHARARE Tensions are expected to flare at the upcoming ZANU PF Politburo meeting scheduled for Wednesday, as internal rifts within the ruling party widen, particularly between Vice President Constantino Chiwenga and influential businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei.\n\nZANU PF said in a statement that the meeting will take place at the partys headquarters on 30 July 2025 at 10:00am. The Secretary General of ZANU PF, Cde. Dr. O. M. Mpofu advises members of a Politiburo meeting to be held this Wednesday, 30 July 2025 at 1000hrs.\n\nThe meeting shall be held at ZANU PF HEADQUARTERS. All members should be seated by 0945 Hours sharp, the party said.\n\nThe meeting comes against a backdrop of escalating internal contestation, with sources pointing to a deepening power struggle between Chiwenga and Tagwirei. The businessman, who enjoys significant political and economic influence, is reportedly at odds with Chiwenga over key issues related to party strategy, appointments, and long-term leadership dynamics.\n\nParty insiders say the rivalry between the two has spilled into different structures of the party, creating two distinct power centres ahead of the crucial meeting.\n\nAlthough ZANU PF continues to insist it remains united, this weeks Politburo gathering is expected to lay bare some of the unresolved tensions that have been building behind the scenes.\n\nWith the spotlight firmly on Wednesdays deliberations, all eyes will be on how the party leadership handles the simmering discord between two of its most powerful figures.\n\n",

            "content": "By Crime and Courts Reporter  Police in Beitbridge have dismantled a 12-member cattle rustling syndicate that had been terrorising local farmers for over a year.\n\nTwelve suspects have been arrested in connection with the syndicate, including six alleged cattle rustlers, five meat buyers from Beitbridge town, and a transporter.\n\nThe gang is believed to have slaughtered dozens of cattle during their crime spree. So far, detectives have linked them to the theft and illegal slaughter of 41 cattle.\n\nActing police officer commanding Beitbridge district, Superintendent Philisani Ndebele, said the breakthrough came after a tip-off from the public.\n\nWe reacted to information from members of the public and arrested meat vendors. They led us to five suspects who were in the habit of stealing cattle and supplying them. During further investigations, we arrested another suspect and their transporter, said Supt Ndebele.\n\nHe said fresh carcasses and skulls were recovered from various bushy sites around Beitbridge town.\n\nIn total, we have recovered carcasses, skulls, and meat from 41 cattle. Some have been positively identified by their owners. We urge anyone with missing or stolen livestock to come forward to the main police station for identification, he added.\n\nInvestigations are ongoing to determine whether the syndicate is linked to other reported stock theft cases.\n\nSupt Ndebele appealed to the public to report all cases of stock theft and share any information that could help police track down criminals.\n\nSeparately, four suspects were arrested in connection with the theft of 47 goats in the Shashe area, with 24 goats recovered in the Tshituripasi area.\n\nWe are working with other stakeholders to dismantle these syndicates. At the same time, we urge people to stop buying meat from unlicensed vendors, as this fuels the crime, said Supt Ndebele.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi has sparked outrage after declaring that the Zimbabwean government will not extend healthcare or medical coverage to citizens living in the diaspora, including those in neighbouring South Africa.\n\nResponding to a question in Parliament from Mbizo MP Corban Madzivanyika (CCC), Ziyambi said the governments strained budget makes it impossible to fund the medical needs of Zimbabweans abroad, especially when it cannot meet the needs of those at home. He noted that the priority is to implement a National Health Insurance Scheme for citizens residing within the country.\n\nZiyambis comments come at a time when Zimbabwean migrants, many of them undocumented, are increasingly being denied access to public healthcare in South Africa. Anti-immigrant groups like Operation Dudula have been at the forefront of pushing for the exclusion of foreign nationals, arguing that locals should be prioritized in the face of collapsing public services.\n\nBut the Ministers comments have angered many Zimbabweans who feel abandoned by a government that has driven them into exile in the first place.\n\nSince the turn of the millennium, Zimbabwes economy has been gutted by ZANU PFs authoritarian rule, rampant corruption, violent land seizures, and economic mismanagement. Hyperinflation, massive unemployment, and political repression have pushed millions of Zimbabweans across borders in search of survival.\n\nFrom qualified professionals to informal workers, Zimbabweans have become economic refugees in countries such as South Africa, Botswana, the UK, and Australia. Many now face xenophobic hostility in their host nations, yet continue to support families back home through remittances that the same government relies on to keep the economy afloat.\n\nCritics say it is hypocritical for the ZANU PF regime to benefit from diaspora remittances  which surpassed US$1.7 billion in 2023  while refusing to extend even basic social protection to those contributing to the economy from abroad.\n\nZiyambi added that just as South Africa does not pay for the healthcare of its citizens living in Zimbabwe, the same principle should apply in reverse. But observers note that unlike South Africa, Zimbabwes mass exodus is not by choice but by economic necessity  the result of decades of failed leadership and state capture by ZANU PF elites.\n\n",

Acting on a tip-off, detectives from the CID Drugs and Narcotics Unit stationed at the airport intercepted the pair shortly after they disembarked from an Ethiopian Airlines flight.\n\nThe suspects were identified at the arrivals terminal as they collected four large suitcases from the luggage carousel. They were immediately taken to the airports search bay, where officers conducted a detailed inspection of their bags.\n\nThe search led to the discovery of 124 packs of compressed dagga concealed inside the suitcases. The drugs weighed approximately 66.9 kilogrammes and had an estimated street value of US$669,000.\n\nFollowing their arrest, the suspects were issued with a Zimbabwe Revenue Authority exhibit seizure confirmation receipt and taken into police custody.\n\nMagistrate Gofa emphasized the seriousness of drug trafficking and noted that the sentence should serve as a deterrent to others.\n\n",

They then collected seven sets of 15KVA solar systems valued at US$41,172 from Caplaw Enterprises, claiming they were destined for the Energy Park Mbare site.\n\nThe scam unraveled on May 27 when Caplaw Enterprises representatives visited Energy Park Service Station to verify the installation of the solar systems.\n\nThey discovered that Energy Park had not ordered any solar equipment and that the purchase order used was fake.\n\nA review of the companys CCTV footage revealed Sabawu, his Mazda Demio vehicle, and his accomplices conducting the fraudulent transactions.\n\nFollowing a police report and subsequent investigations, Sabawu, Muyandi, and Mashamhanda were arrested.\n\nDuring the arrests, two solar panels were recovered from Muyandi, but the majority of the stolen equipment remains missing.\n\nCaplaw Enterprises suffered a financial loss of US$41 172, with only US$200 worth of stolen property recovered to date.\n\n",

As my superior, he offered me mentorship and started flirting with me. He told me he was single and not in any relationship. I believed him, said the 22-year-old whistleblower.\n\nThe relationship allegedly became physical and went on for several months until a weekend visit to Mureverwis Westgate residence turned everything upside down.\n\nThats when I saw the truth. He left his phone unlocked. I saw family pictures, messages from his wife, and videos of his kids  who are nearly my age. Thats when I realized Id been lied to.\n\nBut that was not the end of her shock.\n\nAs I kept working at Chicken Inn, I began to notice a pattern. Other girls were also seeing him. Some would even boast about being called to his office late in the evening or getting picked up in his car. It was like an open secret.\n\nThe woman alleges that Mureverwi had multiple romantic entanglements with junior female staff, especially those working in Chicken Inn outlets around the country.\n\nHe knows theyre young, desperate for jobs, and looking for someone to lift them up. He uses that to his advantage. Its disgusting.\n\nSimbisa Brands Silent\n\nEfforts to get a comment from Simbisa Brands Limited were unsuccessful at the time of going to print.\n\nRepeated calls and messages to Mr. Mureverwis known contacts also went unanswered.\n\nA senior employee at one of Simbisas Harare offices, speaking off record, confirmed having heard rumors of inappropriate relationships involving executives and junior staff, but said no formal complaints had ever been made.\n\nThis revelation has sparked outrage among young female fast-food workers who say they are often vulnerable to manipulation by senior male managers.\n\nSome are now calling for Simbisa Brands to launch an internal probe into Mureverwis conduct and put mechanisms in place to protect junior staff from exploitation.\n\n",

That truth lives in me and every former player who wore the blue jersey with pride, in every fan who bled for the badge, and in every founder who built this iconic club from nothing but passion, unity, and community.\n\nI represent everything original about Dynamos  the founding fathers, their families, the true former players, the loyal supporters, the culture, the love, and the brotherhood. Dynamos thrived on that spirit. It was never about one man. Decisions were collective. When non-former players were appointed as coaches, those decisions were made by executives that included former players  not dictated by one power-hungry individual.\n\nBut today, one man  Marriot  has taken a hammer to that legacy. Ten years ago, Kalisto Pasuwa delivered four league titles in a row. Instead of honouring him, Marriot told him in 2015 to reapply  a blatant insult rooted in hatred for former Dynamos players.\n\nNow in 2025, the same Marriot still reigns, and hes completely erased former players from coaching opportunities. Its not just disrespect. Its betrayal. Its a cold-blooded assassination of the Dynamos spirit.\n\nLet me be clear: Dynamos was never meant to be a one-man empire. It was a club born from struggle, built by its people, and uplifted by those who gave everything on and off the pitch. Former players are now treated like outsiders in the very home they built with blood, sweat, and glory.\n\nIf you support Marriots tyranny, you are complicit in destroying this clubs soul. You are placing personal interest over the legacy of greatness forged by legends. Dynamos is not a dictatorship. It is a movement. A community. A shared dream.\n\nI wont stop speaking the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it is. Dynamos belongs to its founders, its legends, its fans  not to one mans ego.\n\nWe must return Dynamos to its rightful owners: the people. Only then will the nation truly celebrate again.\n\nNyika yese ndipo paichafara ipapo\n\n",

            "content": "Livingston, Scotland  28 July 2025\n\nBy Simba Chikanza | ZimEye\n\nWalter Masocha, a self-styled archbishop and former University of Stirling professor, has been sentenced to 14 years in prison, with 10 years effective, by the High Court in Livingston, Scotland. The 61-year-old was found guilty of a series of sexual offences, including child rape, attempted rape, and indecent assault committed against female members of his church between 2006 and 2012.\n\n14 year sentence..  Walter Masocha\n\nJudge Susan Craig, delivering the sentence on Monday, described Masochas actions as appalling and imposed non-harassment orders banning him from contacting the two women at the centre of the current case. The judge also confirmed that Masocha will remain on the sex offenders register for life.\n\nMasocha operated under the support of one of his mentees, the activist, Todd Farai Maforimbo who heavily criticised complainants and journalists covering their stories since 2011.\n\nA Predator Who Hid Behind the Pulpit\n\nDuring the trial, the court heard how Masocha sexually assaulted one victim at his Stirling home under the pretence of removing demons from her body. The married woman testified that Masocha groped her and ordered her to kiss his holy lips, while claiming he was a gift from God.\n\nMASOCHA OBTAINING OBEYANCE FROM CHURCH WOMEN\n\nAnother victim, who was 20 at the time of the abuse, described how Masocha repeatedly assaulted her while she stayed with his family. She told the court he once attempted to rape her in his bedroom but she managed to escape.\n\nCrown prosecutor Michael McIntosh described Masocha as a predator who thought his power and position rendered him immune from suspicion.\n\nFounding of Agape Church and Previous Convictions\n\nMasocha, originally from Zimbabwe, founded the Agape for All Nations Ministries International in 2007, soon after migrating to Scotland. The church grew to over 2,000 members globally, many of whom referred to him as Dad or Daddy.\n\nIn 2015, Masocha was previously convicted of sexually assaulting a church deaconess and putting his hands down the trousers of a schoolgirl. He claimed at the time he was performing deliverance to remove demons. Those convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in Edinburgh on grounds of a miscarriage of justice, just after another Daddy character, the journast Hopewell Chinono, allegedly disrupted the key complainant, by falsely claiming he would conduct a news interview when he was after a relationship; However, new charges were brought forward following fresh police statements from two additional victims.\n\nCommunity Reaction: Justice After 13 Years\n\nOutside court, the mother of one of the minors Masocha was convicted of abusing welcomed the verdict:\n\nIts been 13 years weve waited for this day. Hes finally where he belongs.\n\nHer daughter, known publicly as Princess, had gone public with her story on BBC News, becoming one of the key witnesses in the case.\n\nHe was never a man of God, her mother added. People thought I was cruel for exposing him. But I was protecting my child.\n\nThe family confirmed they intend to pursue civil action, and advocates say the case may open the door for compensation claims against both Masocha and possibly the Scottish government, which is accused of failing to protect victims.\n\nMore Victims Must Come Forward\n\nCommunity campaigner and religious news analyst, Howard Nyoni, who has followed the case since 2014, said:\n\nThere are over 10 other victims whove been silent. If they unite, the government itself may be held accountable for allowing this abuse to continue for so long.\n\nHe likened Masochas tactics to those of other disgraced African pastors including the late Gilbert Deya, who was convicted of child trafficking, and controversial preacher Hubert Angel, who has faced multiple allegations in the UK and Zimbabwe.\n\nA Call to the Church: Do Not Fear a Pastor\n\nThis case has triggered renewed debate in the Zimbabwean diaspora and across faith communities about blind loyalty to religious leaders.\n\nPastors are supposed to be a blessing, not a curse, said one advocate. Whenever a woman or child says theyve been abused by a pastor, believe them.\n\nSupporters are now calling for further investigations into those who allegedly enabled Masocha, including witnesses who lied under oath and individuals who harassed victims online.\n\nA Familys Stand\n\nPrincesss mother closed her remarks to ZimEye with a message to other families still in silence:\n\nI didnt do this for revenge or money. I did this to protect my child. And I will keep fighting until everyone who protected Masocha is held to account.\n\nIf you are a survivor of abuse related to this case or others involving religious leaders, confidential support is available.
