            "content": "WE ARE BEING ABUSED AND SILENCED  ELDERLY RESIDENTS EXPOSE FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT AND INTIMIDATION AT FAIRWAYS OLD AGE HOME\n\nBy A Correspondent | ZimEye |Harare | 5 May 2025\n\nDisturbing allegations have surfaced from Fairways Homes for the Aged Persons Trust in Eastlea, Harare, where elderly residents say they are victims of systemic financial abuse, coercion, and neglect.\n\nAccording to Harry van Biljon, a 67-year-old resident and whistleblower, the institution is being run in defiance of the Older Persons Act and the Trusts own constitution, with no proper oversight or accountability. Van Biljon accuses General Manager Denis Choto and Administrator Wendy Chimbare of extorting elderly residents and withholding funds owed to them from the sale of property rights known as Life Rights.\n\nThey are robbing the elderly under the cover of a Trust, van Biljon told this reporter. No receipts unless you beg, no AGMs, no financial recordsjust threats and intimidation when you ask questions.\n\nThe Case of Zerina Bhika\n\nOne case has galvanized concern across the community: that of 78-year-old resident Mrs. Zerina Bhika, who sold her cottage (Unit 6) for US$30,000 in January 2025. Under Fairways policy, she was due a 20% refundUS$6,000but received only US$300 after months of pressure.\n\nWhen Bhika demanded the remainder, she was told the money had already been used. Distraught and in need of medication, she filed a police report on 28 April at Highlands Police Station, assisted by van Biljon.\n\nShe was told bluntly by Mr. Choto, If you want your money, withdraw the police case, van Biljon said.\n\nFollowing her report, Bhika was allegedly summoned to the General Managers office and pressured into signing two documents she had not written herself:1. A letter falsely acknowledging receipt of US$2,740,2. A formal withdrawal of criminal charges.\n\nAccording to van Biljon, She was coerced. She signed just to get medication and pay her carer. She only got $300 in hand. The rest was a lie.\n\nIn audio recordings reviewed by this reporter, Bhika is heard saying:\n\nI am distressed. I thought they would protect us here, not take advantage. I signed the paper because I had no choice.\n\nRitual Intimidation\n\nAfter being questioned by police, Mr. Choto returned to Fairways accompanied by a man performing what residents described as spiritual rituals.\n\nHe walked behind Choto throwing water and stones, said one resident. It was frightening. They use fear to silence us.\n\nResidents also allege harassment by individuals introduced as CIO agents whenever complaints are raised about management or finances.\n\nConstitutional Breaches and Lost Oversight\n\nThe Trusts management committeeChairman Andrew West, Vice Chairman David Covell, and member Absalom Muchandionahas allegedly overstayed its term and failed to convene a legitimate Annual General Meeting since 2020.\n\nIn the last AGM, when we raised constitutional reforms, Mr. West shouted I now close the meeting! and stormed out, van Biljon recalled. Weve been in a vacuum of law and leadership ever since.\n\nThe Fairways Trust reportedly lost its registration with the Private Voluntary Organisations (PVO) Board and the Social Welfare Office due to noncompliance, but continued operations without legal standing.\n\nDespite submitting a signed petition to the Director of Social Welfare on 14 April 2025, residents say no action has been taken.\n\nA Broken Institution\n\nVan Biljon accuses the Trust of running an unaccountable cash-based scheme, accepting large USD payments from incoming residents without bank transfers, electronic tracking, or official receipts.\n\nThis is criminal. Its theft from the elderly. Its abuse. No person who treats vulnerable people this way should be allowed to run any institutionever.\n\nResidents Demand Action\n\nThe residents are calling for: An independent forensic audit of the Fairways Trust finances; Suspension and prosecution of Denis Choto and Wendy Chimbare; Immediate reconstitution of the management committee; Restoration of legal compliance with the Older Persons Act and PVO regulations.\n\nVan Biljon closed his letter with a stark warning:\n\nIf no one helps us now, what happens to those who cannot speak for themselves?\n\nDO YOU KNOW MORE?If you or someone you know has experienced elder abuse at Fairways or another care facility in Zimbabwe, contact us confidentially at ZimEye\n\n..\n\nInterview between Simba Chikanza and Denis Choto  Allegations at Fairways Homes for the Aged Persons Trust\n\nSimba Chikanza (SC):\n\nGood morning, sir.\n\nDenis Choto (DC):\n\nGood morning, sir. How are you?\n\nSC:\n\nIm well, thank you. Youre speaking to Simba Chikanza from ZimEye.\n\nDC:\n\nYes, sir.\n\nSC:\n\nThis is a quick call regarding a matter that has landed on my desk. I believe its something you may be able to address. It concerns allegations of you borrowing money from elderly residents at Fairways for your personal use. For example:\n\nThese claims suggest you visited the premises after dark to ask elderly residents for money. I wanted to hear your side before publishing anything.\n\nDC:\n\nThank you for that opportunity. Of all the issues raised, only two are relevant and have already been addressed. The matter with Colleen Beatty was settled privately. The issue with Mrs. Sampson was also a private arrangement. These were personal transactions and not threats or coercion.\n\nHowever, I believe some of these reports are coming from individuals with hidden agendas. The people raising these issues are not always acting in good faith or as responsible parties. They may be trying to tarnish my image or discredit me for personal reasons.\n\nSC:\n\nLets be cleardo you acknowledge that the concerns are valid, regardless of their source? These are elderly, vulnerable individuals. One day you and I might find ourselves in the same situation, in a care facility. How would we feel if someone in an official role came to our rooms at night asking for money?\n\nDC:\n\nYoure right. These matters should be addressed properly and respectfully. I agree its important to respect every individual. I have nothing to hide and am happy to meet in person to provide full context. But I must emphasize that some of this is being amplified to damage my professional standing.\n\nSC:\n\nSpecifically regarding Louise Smithdid you borrow money from her?\n\nDC:\n\nNo. I never borrowed from Louise Smith. Her children are alive and have raised no such issues. There was no agreement or complaint from her estate.\n\nSC:\n\nLets discuss Mrs. Bucha. Why did she receive only $300 when she was allegedly entitled to $6,000? She claims she was told the rest had been used already.\n\nDC:\n\nThere was an agreement that she would receive 20% of what was recovered. The $300 was an interim payment while waiting for further funds. She will receive the rest once funding is available. These issues are being exaggerated for effect.\n\nSC:\n\nWas a police report filed about this?\n\nDC:\n\nYes. A case was opened. I attended the police station, as well as meetings with the Department of Social Services and even the Presidents Office.\n\nSC:\n\nThe Presidents Office? That sounds extreme for a civil matter.\n\nDC:\n\nYes, they visited on July 1, 2022, during an investigation. We were surprised by the visit. It turns out it was connected to broader concerns about foreign funding and destabilization. We keep records of that visit.\n\nSC:\n\nDo you have documentationemails, minutes, or lettersto support that claim?\n\nDC:\n\nYes, and I can share names of those involved in the investigations.\n\nSC:\n\nAnother serious claim: Did you coerce Mrs. Bucha to withdraw her police case? The police were told $2,700 was paid when only $300 was handed over. Can you account for the remaining amount?\n\nDC:\n\nThere are records showing the full transaction. I can provide that documentation.\n\nSC:\n\nWhat about the man who allegedly came to Fairways and performed spiritual rituals? Who was he and who authorized his presence?\n\nDC:\n\nThats an unfolding issue. I can provide more detail later.\n\nSC:\n\nDo you have qualifications to be General Manager under the Older Persons Act?\n\nDC:\n\nYes. I hold a diploma from Awesome Training Institution, a diploma in Designatory Management from Trust Academy, and certification in Project Management from an Australian institute. I am also certified by the Zimbabwe Institute of Control Personnel.\n\nSC:\n\nWho should people complain to if they feel youve failed in your duties? Youve emphasized that people should respect youbut do you respect the vulnerability of the residents?\n\nDC:\n\nI do. There is a grievance procedure outlined in our institutions documentation. Normally, complaints should go to the Chairman of the Board of Trustees. Unfortunately, the current complainant bypassed this and went straight to government. His actions suggest hes trying to take over the institution. He never followed protocol.\n\nSC:\n\nThats a serious accusation. Can you send me evidence supporting your claim that the complainant is trying to take over Fairways?\n\nDC:\n\nYes, I can send you documentation and recordings to support this.\n\nSC:\n\nPlease also send me contact information for the Chairman of the Board, and a recorded audio of your final remarks on this matter so I can assess whether the issue has been addressed.\n\n",

Minister of Health office he knows, Secretary for Health office he knows; tinoti imhepo inongodarika (we just say its wind that passes), Kandishaya wrote, implying that the criticism was either insincere or being used for political grandstanding.\n\nKandishayas remarks suggest a growing discomfort within the party over internal criticism being aired publicly, particularly at a time when the government is already under pressure to address service delivery failures.\n\nMachakaires statement, meanwhile, resonated with many Zimbabweans who have long complained about collapsing hospitals, shortages of medical staff, and lack of basic supplies. Some have applauded him for speaking truth to power, while others view it as a political move aimed at distancing himself from responsibility.\n\nThe exchange between the two ZANU PF figures highlights growing divisions within the ruling party, especially among its younger leaders, over how to address Zimbabwes ongoing socio-economic challenges.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nBULAWAYO  Tensions have flared between central government and local leadership after Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Daniel Garwe, publicly attacked Bulawayo Mayor David Coltart for hosting self-proclaimed Ndebele King Bulelani Khumalo.\n\nGarwe demanded an explanation from Mayor Coltart regarding the citys official welcome of King Bulelani, whom the minister dismissed as an imposter and a foreign national.\n\nHis comments have sparked outrage from political and cultural groups in Matabeleland, who view the remarks as disrespectful to Ndebele heritage.\n\nIn a strong rebuttal, opposition party ZAPU threw its weight behind Coltart, accusing Garwe of political intimidation. ZAPU president Sibangilizwe Nkomo defended the mayor, warning that his party would not tolerate what he described as a targeted campaign.\n\nWe know that there are people with a hidden agenda of trying to get rid of our Bulawayo mayor because they do not like him, Nkomo said. We love our mayor, and we will defend him. We will not be intimidated by Minister Garwes bullying tactics.\n\nNkomo also condemned the ministers remarks as culturally insensitive, saying they undermined efforts to reconcile historical wounds, particularly around the unresolved legacy of the Gukurahundi massacres.\n\nGarwe is ignoring and insulting our traditions and our pain. This kind of rhetoric is dangerous and shows a lack of commitment to genuine national healing, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Bornwell Khumalo, spokesperson for King Bulelani, dismissed Garwes criticism as uninformed and inflammatory. He cannot say our king is a fraud or defunct. That is an insult, said Khumalo. If we are practising our culture, which he does not understand, where does he come in? We are practising our culture, not politics.\n\nKing Bulelani Khumalo claims lineage from King Lobengula, the last officially recognised Ndebele monarch, who succeeded his father King Mzilikazi in the 19th century. While Zimbabwes government has never formally recognised Bulelani as king, his coronation in recent years has been symbolically important for many Ndebele people seeking cultural restoration.\n\nThe incident has once again exposed deep-rooted tensions between national authorities and Matabeleland communities over historical recognition, cultural identity, and political representation.\n\n",

These insects are everywhere  in our beds, sofas, and even in public transport. We cant sleep anymore, said Margaret Dube, a resident of Mbizo 11.

The city is working on containment strategies, but the spread is worrying.\n\nThe outbreak mirrors a similar crisis in Harares Mbare suburb, where health authorities have struggled to eliminate the persistent pests amid limited resources and poor waste management.\n\nWere trying our best, but fumigation efforts require more chemicals and coordinated action. Community cooperation will also be critical, the council source added.\n\nLocal health experts warn that the outbreak, if left unchecked, could spread to surrounding areas, urging swift intervention from both the municipality and national government.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZimbabweans should brace for intensified electricity outages, the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) has warned, citing fresh breakdowns at Hwange Thermal Power Station and a fire at a critical substation in Harare.\n\nIn a statement issued Monday, the state-owned power utility announced that it is currently struggling to maintain consistent power supply due to technical challenges at Hwangeone of the countrys main sources of electricity generation.\n\nDue to a fault that occurred at Hwange Power Station, generation capacity has been significantly reduced, resulting in increased load-shedding across the country, ZESA said.\n\nThe situation was made worse after a major substation supplying Harares southwestern suburbs reportedly caught fire on Sunday night. One of our key substations was severely damaged by fire, affecting power supply in parts of the capital, a ZESA official revealed under condition of anonymity.\n\nEnergy analysts, however, argue the problem goes far deeper than technical glitches. They point to the aging infrastructure at Hwange and the wider economic crisis that has hindered long-overdue maintenance and investment in the energy sector.\n\nWeve warned for years that Hwanges machinery is outdated and operating on borrowed time. This isnt a new problemits a ticking time bomb, said an independent energy consultant based in Harare.\n\nDespite ZESAs efforts to downplay the long-term implications, many Zimbabweans are already feeling the pinch, with rolling blackouts lasting up to 12 hours in some areas.\n\n",
