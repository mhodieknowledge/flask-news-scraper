            "content": "The Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) and the South African Communist Party (SACP) have urged President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the explosive allegations made by KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, while also expressing safety concerns for whistleblowers.\n\nFedusa said this inquiry must have a clearly defined mandate, timelines and the power to compel evidence, which it said was the only mechanism that could provide the public with clear answers and restore confidence in the leadership of the countrys law enforcement agencies.\n\nDuring a media briefing over the weekend, Mkhwanazi made allegations of corruption, political interference, and malfeasance, specifically accusing Police Minister Senzo Mchunu of unilaterally disbanding the Political Killings Task Team and redirecting 121 active investigation dockets to the office of National Deputy Commissioner Lieutenant General Shadrack Sibiya, where they had allegedly been neutralised.\n\nFedusa said the allegations could be treated as ordinary administrative concerns.\n\nLieutenant General Nhlanhla Lucky Mkhwanazi is a South African law enforcement official who is serving the KwaZulu Natal Province of South Africa as the Provincial Police Commissioner. Gen Mkhwanazi was born on February 5, 1973, in KwaZuluNatal, South AfricaA former South African Police Service (SAPS) Divisional Commissioner for Specialized Operational Response Services, former Head of Component and Commander of the elite police tactical unit of the South African Police Service, Special Task Force (STF) colloquially known as the Taakies having qualified previously for the world renowned difficult selection and training process with the high attrition rate of 85% or more in some recruitment cycles. He served in the elite unit as a police special task force operator. A public figure known for his leadership roles in the South African Police Service (SAPS) gained national recognition for serving as the Acting National Police Commissioner.EFF President, Julius Malema has also called for mass action if Mkhwanazi is politically attacked.\n\nMeanwhile, OSullivan demands removal of KZN police commissioner Mkhwanazi amid explosive allegations\n\nRenowned forensic consultant Paul OSullivan has called for the immediate removal of KwaZulu-Natal Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, accusing him of undermining the stability of South Africas police leadership.\n\nSpeaking during a live interview on Newzroom Afrika on Sunday, 6 July, OSullivan did not hold back, saying, I want to see that man fall, the sooner the better.\n\nHis comments come just hours after Mkhwanazi made explosive claims at a media briefing, accusing senior government officials of interfering with investigations into political killings.\n\nMkhwanazi alleged that Police Minister Senzo Mchunu and Deputy National Commissioner Shadrack Sibiya were among those who disrupted the work of the Political Killings Task Team.\n\nAccording to the commissioner, more than 120 case dockets were removed earlier this year, compromising investigations into politically linked murders in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. He claimed that high-profile suspects were being shielded from justice, suggesting that there was a coordinated effort to collapse the task teams work.\n\nOSullivan, known for his anti-corruption advocacy, questioned Mkhwanazis motives and criticised the manner in which he went public with his claims. He described the commissioners briefing in which Mkhwanazi wore Special Task Force fatigues and was flanked by armed officers as an alarming display, suggesting it could be interpreted as a threat to constitutional order.\n\nWhile some viewers interpreted OSullivans remarks as accusing Mkhwanazi of plotting a coup, he did not directly make such a claim. However, he warned that the optics of the briefing raised red flags and warranted serious scrutiny.\n\nThe dramatic standoff between the two high-profile figures has added to growing public concern over instability within the SAPS.\n\nMinister Mchunu has since dismissed the allegations as baseless and irresponsible, while President Cyril Ramaphosas office has acknowledged the matter as one of grave national security concern.\n\n",

            "content": "Ugandas long-serving president, Yoweri Museveni, 80, has been declared the governing partys candidate in next years presidential election, opening the way for him to seek to extend his nearly 40 years in power.In his acceptance speech, Museveni said that he had responded to the call and, if elected, would press ahead with his mission to turn Uganda into a high middle income country.Musevenis critics say he has ruled with an iron hand since he seized power as a rebel leader in 1986.He has won every election held since then, and the constitution has been amended twice to remove age and term limits to allow him remain in office.Pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine is expected to be Musevenis main challenger in the election scheduled for next January.In April Wine said that he would run against Museveni if he was nominated by his party, the National Unity Platform, but it was getting tougher to be in opposition because of growing state repression.Being in the opposition in Uganda means being labelled a terrorist, he said.Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, lost the last election in 2021 to Museveni by 35% to 59% in a poll marred by allegations of rigging and a crackdown on the opposition.Another prominent opposition politician, Kizza Besigye, has been in detention since November after being accused of treason. He denies the allegation, saying his arrest is political.In his acceptance speech at the National Resistance Movement (NRM) conference on Saturday, Museveni said that he had brought about stability and progress in Uganda.He said it was crucial that Uganda did not miss the bus of history as happened in the past when Europe transformed and Africa stagnated and was enslaved.Museveni added that he wanted Uganda to take a qualitative leap, and become a high upper middle income country.Other countries in Asia with less natural resources, did it. We can do it, he added.\n\nMeanwhie, in Zimbabwe, President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa is busy hatching plans to amend the constitution in a bid to extend his stay in power.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent| As a crucial by-election looms in Ward 6 of Epworth North, Zanu PF has come under fire for what critics are calling blatant vote buying tacticsthrough hastily launched roadworks and promises of donations by controversial businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei.\n\nOver the weekend, road construction vehicles rolled into the community, marking the sudden commencement of long-neglected infrastructure works. The move sparked celebration among some residents, who were seen singing political slogans in praise of President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his Vision 2030, chantingVision 2030 ndeya Emmerson, varegerei vapedza basa ravo.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced.\n\nObservers and opposition voices have described the developments as a thinly veiled attempt to sway voters ahead of the by-election, which is expected to be fiercely contested. Critics argue that the ruling partys newfound interest in Epworths longstanding problems is disingenuous, pointing out that the areas poor roads and underdevelopment have been ignored for yearsuntil now.\n\nThis sudden rush to construct roads and hand out goodies is nothing short of electoral manipulation, said a resident who asked to remain anonymous. Where was the government all these years when we were crying out for basic services?\n\nThe situation escalated over the weekend when business tycoon Kudakwashe Tagwirei, known for his close ties to the ruling party, toured the area and reportedly promised a slew of donations. His presence, so close to the by-election, has fueled suspicions of coordinated efforts to buy political loyalty using state and private resources.\n\nTagwireis involvement in Zanu PF campaigns has been widely criticized in the past, with allegations of money politics undermining fair electoral processes. His promises in Epworth have raised fresh questions about the use of wealth and influence to secure political outcomes.\n\nBefore the by-election was even declared, Epworths chronic challengesfrom poor roads to water shortages and unemploymentwere common knowledge. The timing of the current interventions has only deepened public skepticism.\n\nThis is not development. Its desperation dressed as compassion, said an opposition councillor. Zanu PF wants to retain the seat at all costs, and theyre using taxpayers money and private influence to create the illusion of action.\n\nAs the campaign period intensifies, the spotlight remains firmly on Epworth, with voters and watchdogs watching closely to see whether development will persist beyond the ballotor disappear just as quickly as it came.\n\n",
