            "content": "(transcript by ZimEye)\n\nGuest Introduction:\n\nOn CNN Fim de Tarde, Venncio Mondelano, a candidate for the presidency of Mozambique, discusses a new phase of protests starting soon. This phase is tied to the upcoming transition of power, with the president and new legislature set to take office by January 15-17. The protests aim to express rejection of the disputed electoral results, which Mondelano claims are deeply flawed, as noted by Mozambiques Attorney General, legal experts, and international observers.\n\nOn Allegations of Violence and Protests:\n\nMondelano denies advocating for arming the population but highlights state violence against protesters, calling it a massacre. He mentions instances of police brutality and killings during peaceful demonstrations, including the use of live ammunition against unarmed citizens. He points out that various trained groups in Mozambique, including some within the official armed forces, are ready to defend the people exercising their constitutional right to protest.\n\nPossible Civil War:\n\nMondelano acknowledges the risk of civil war due to escalating tensions but emphasizes his efforts to prevent violence. He describes his approach as one of containment, introducing peaceful protest measures to avoid widespread unrest. He blames the government and police for initiating violence.\n\nInternational Support:\n\nMondelano has engaged with the European Parliament and international bodies, highlighting irregularities in Mozambiques elections. He notes significant solidarity from Portuguese citizens and intellectuals, though he criticizes the Portuguese governments response as uninformed. He hopes Portugal will play a key role in Mozambiques integration into Europe and support its democratic aspirations.\n\nTransition of Power:\n\nMondelano rejects the legitimacy of the upcoming inauguration of Daniel Chapo from the ruling FRELIMO party. He plans to establish a Peoples Constitutional Court to validate his claim to the presidency, emphasizing legal and peaceful means to challenge the results.\n\nProposed Dialogue and Mediation:\n\nDespite the governments alleged use of violence, Mondelano remains open to dialogue. He calls for international mediation, involving the United Nations, international human rights organizations, the International Criminal Court, and key actors like Portugal, the European Union, the U.S., South Africa, and the Vatican.\n\nClosing Remarks:\n\nMondelano reiterates his commitment to peaceful solutions and thanks CNN for the opportunity to discuss Mozambiques political crisis.\n\nThe following is the interviews text translated word for word into clear English:\n\nHost Introduction:\n\nOur guest on CNN Fim de Tarde is Venncio Mondelano, candidate for the presidency of Mozambique. Good afternoon, welcome to CNN Fim de Tarde. Recently, youve been speaking about a new phase of protests, the details of which will be revealed next Monday. What is this phase, and what scenario should the country expect?\n\nVenncio Mondelano:\n\nThank you very much to CNN Portugal for this opportunity. This phase, lets say, is the phase that precedes the final stage of the electoral calendar. As you know, strictly speaking, by January 15, 16, and 17, the President of the Republic and the new legislature of the Assembly of the Republic must take office. In this final phase, we will have a set of measures for protests and demonstrations of rejection, which will be entirely different from the approximately four phases before that began on October 21 and ran, lets say, until last Friday. Certainly, I wont give details about this, for obvious reasons, but its nothing more or less than the continuation of protestsa continuation of the demonstration of rejection of this agreement, which is more than proven. The agreement by the Constitutional Council had more than enough grounds not to have been validated.\n\nThe Attorney Generals Office, which is a competent and qualified institution for this purpose, stated that the electionsthe provisional results of the National Electoral Commissionwere unfounded, contradictory, and riddled with irregularities, making them unfit for validation. Furthermore, the legal opinion of the Bar Association highlighted the gross irregularities in the electoral process, and the European Union observation mission also pointed out irregularities that, under normal circumstances, should have prevented the Constitutional Council from even considering validating these results.\n\nHost:\n\nYouve been accused of threatening to arm the Mozambican population protesting the election results. Will this new phase include that step? What needs to happen for you to take such a step, and what is your objective in considering it?\n\nVenncio Mondelano:\n\nNo, I did not suggest arming the population. From the beginning, weve always identified ourselves as a purely civil movement. What I said was that whats happening is a massacre in Mozambique against protesters. The official numbers released are the ones that are convenient to the government. For instance, following a staged prison escape at Mozambiques largest prison, there are over 100 bodies in the morgue at the Central Hospital labeled as unidentified. This indicates far more unidentified victims of the massacre.\n\nWhat Im saying is that there is, in fact, an armed government that is disproportionately suppressing the constitutional right to protest. It is killing citizens indiscriminately. What I mentioned was that there are various groups in Mozambique, including within the official armed forces, and other militarily trained forces, that are now offering to defend the population when they exercise their constitutional right to protest. We now feel compelled to accept the help of these forces that see the need to protect the population during what I would describe as a genocide taking place in Mozambique.\n\nHost:\n\nWith the intensification of protests in this new phase, could Mozambique be on the path to a civil war? Do you admit this possibility?\n\nVenncio Mondelano:\n\nYes, let me say this. I once spoke to the President of the Republic and told him that, strictly speaking, the Mozambican government, the FRELIMO party, and the president himself should feel gratitude toward me. From the start, since October, the general sentiment of the Mozambican population has been one of deep and burning revolt. People wanted to resort to extreme violence immediately.\n\nThe steps Ive introduced, with their somewhat suggestive names, are precisely to contain the population and prevent an escalation of extreme violence. Thats why the measures I announce are, in truth, ways to contain the burning desire of the people to resort to violence.\n\nHost:\n\nSo, youre saying that the violence comes from the other sidethe authorities?\n\nVenncio Mondelano:\n\nNaturally. Let me give you a simple example. When we began the first protests on October 21the reference date for all processesI called for a national strike to paralyze all work in Mozambique. Two days earlier, on October 19, my personal lawyer and national representative were murdered with 25 bullets from a military weapon. I invited the population to simply show rejection of this barbaric assassination of my lawyer.\n\nWhen the national strike happened, all activity ceased. I personally, in front of international journalists and some Portuguese media outlets, was attacked by the police while giving an interview. From the outset, the police intended to create situations to justify extreme violence and kill people. On October 21, I was personally hit by a tear gas canister during the protests.\n\nEven during our second phase of protests, which included symbolic, peaceful measures such as stopping the country at noon and singing the national anthem, police shot people kneeling while singing. The goal of the National Police has always been to assassinate citizens and use extreme violence, which continues today.\n\nHost:\n\nWhat kind of contact have you had with the international community, and have you received any support for your cause?\n\nVenncio Mondelano:\n\nWe dont have anything definitive yet, but weve made preliminary contacts. I had a high-level opportunity to speak with the European Parliament and its member parties, thanks in part to Portuguese MPs from initiatives like the Liberal Initiative. I explained Mozambiques situation to the European Parliament.\n\nI believe that the Portuguese people, based on my observations and conversations, are very supportive of Mozambique. However, the Portuguese government and the EU should treat Mozambiques crisis with the same urgency given to Venezuela or Georgia. The recent EU observation mission concluded that the elections in Mozambique were neither free, fair, nor transparent and were marred by severe irregularities that should have prevented their validation.\n\n",

            "content": "Seatbelts are one of the most vital safety features in any vehicle, designed to protect drivers and passengers in the event of an accident. Much like airbags, seatbelts serve as a life-saving measure, reducing the risk of injury or death during a collision.\n\nDespite the proven effectiveness of seatbelts in preventing serious injuries, many people still choose not to wear them while driving or riding in a vehicle. This reckless behavior significantly increases the risk of harm in the event of an accident.\n\nWhen a person fails to wear a seatbelt, they are at a much higher risk of being ejected from the vehicle during a crash, which can be fatal. Even at low speeds, the force of a collision can cause severe injuries to unrestrained individuals. Seatbelts keep occupants securely in their seats, preventing them from being thrown around inside the vehicle or from being ejected through the windshield.\n\nThe benefits of seatbelt use are undeniable. Studies consistently show that seatbelts reduce the risk of fatal injury by 45% for drivers and 60% for passengers.\n\nFor children, the risk is even more significant, as seatbelts, when used correctly, can prevent serious injury or death.\n\nWhile seatbelts are an essential safety feature, their effectiveness depends on consistent and correct usage.\n\nSimply having a seatbelt in the car is not enough; everyone in the vehicle, regardless of age or seat position, should always buckle up. It is crucial for drivers to set an example and encourage all passengers to wear their seatbelts.\n\nIn conclusion, the importance of seatbelts cannot be overstated. They are a simple yet effective tool that saves lives and prevents serious injuries. Those who choose not to wear them are putting themselves in great danger. Buckling up should always be a top priority for anyone behind the wheel or riding as a passenger.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

Annual costs for dialysis and chemotherapy are ZWG11.18 million and ZWG3.03 million, respectively,\n\nNguluvhe disclosed that the allocated ZWG121.84 million healthcare budget for 2025 is a mere 40% of the ZWG312.83 million required.\n\nThis shortfallis expectedto leave veterans without vital healthcare servicesby May 2025.\n\nThe education ofveteranschildren is similarly underfunded, with ZWG137.22 million allocated for 2025, far below the ideal ZWG315.25 million.\n\nMuch of this allocation will cover 2024 arrears, leaving only ZWG26.26 million for the new yearinsufficient to cover even a single school term.\n\nThe Ministry needs an additional ZWG218.78 million to adequately support 6,395 students. Current funding levels only worsen the crisis,Nguluvhe added.\n\nThe gap between rhetoric and reality has sparked outrage among war veterans.\n\nPetros Sibanda, Secretary General of the ZPRA Veterans Association, decried the neglect, callingonthe Treasury to reprioritise its expenditures.\n\nMany veterans remain unpaid, including those vetted as far back as 2022. The government must address this injustice urgently,Sibanda said.\n\nThe neglect of war veterans underscores a glaring contradiction in ZanuPFsstrategy.\n\nFor decades,veterans have been instrumental in thepartyselection tactics, often deployed to intimidate opposition supporters and consolidate rural votes.\n\nHowever, their growing discontent now threatens to fracture this alliance.\n\nVeterans sacrificed their youth forZimbabwesliberation. It is a travesty that they are now treated with such disregard,Sibanda concluded.\n\n",
