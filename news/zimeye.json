            "content": "By Dr Trywell Muzerengi\n\nFowl Pox is a highly contagious viral disease in poultry that causes painful, disfiguring sores on a chickens skin and, in severe cases, lesions in the mouth and respiratory tract. Also known as Avian Pox, Sorehead, Avian Diphtheria, and Chicken Pox (unrelated to the human illness), the disease poses a serious threat to backyard and commercial flocks alike.\n\nThere is no known cure for Fowl Pox, but it can be prevented and managed through proper care and vaccination.\n\nFowl Pox occurs in two forms:\n\nDry Pox: Affects non-feathered areas like the comb, wattles, face, and eyelids, forming visible lesions.\n\nWet Pox: A more severe form that targets the upper respiratory system, eyes, mouth, and throat, and can be life-threatening.\n\nThe virus is primarily spread by biting insects, especially mosquitoes, and can also be transmitted from bird to bird through contact with infected feathers, skin debris, scabs, secretions, and bloodcollectively called hot debris.\n\nThe virus survives for long periods in this debris, making coop hygiene critical. Birds become infected when this hot debris is inhaled, ingested, or comes into contact with wounds or mucous membranes.\n\nCommon signs of Fowl Pox include:\n\nAsh-colored raised lesions or blisters on the face, comb, or wattles (Dry Pox)\n\nYellowish bumps evolving into dark wart-like scabs\n\nLesions inside the mouth and throat (Wet Pox)\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nWeight loss\n\nReduced egg production\n\nSymptoms typically last weeks in an individual bird and can persist for months within a flock. While some birds may develop immunity, others may experience recurrences during times of stress.\n\nWhile there is no cure, the following supportive care steps are effective in managing the disease:\n\nControl secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics like Terramycin in drinking water for 3 days, followed by vitamin supplements.\n\nTreat scabs with dilute iodine solution.\n\nApply a soothing ointment to affected areas:(Mix 2 tablespoons of sulfur powder with  cup Vaseline and apply daily.)\n\nVaccinate unaffected birds during outbreaks.\n\nClean and disinfect coops and runs thoroughly to eliminate infectious debris.\n\nPrevention is key to controlling Fowl Pox. Measures include:\n\nBiosecurity: Avoid bringing in contaminated clothing, tools, or shoes from infected areas.\n\nQuarantine new birds before introducing them to the flock.\n\nControl mosquitoes and other biting insects.\n\nVaccinate day-old chicks and healthy adult birds. The eye-drop vaccine is easy and affordable, offering permanent immunity.\n\nDuring outbreaks, clean and sanitize water containers daily, and after the outbreak, sanitize the coop weekly for at least a month.\n\nConclusion:Fowl Pox can cause serious distress in flocks, impacting bird health and productivity. While the virus cannot be cured, early detection, proper hygiene, and routine vaccination can significantly reduce its impact. Poultry farmers must remain vigilant, especially during the warm, wet months when mosquito populations are high.\n\nEmail:[emailprotected]\n\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/share/18x439qwXt/\n\nWhatsApp Channel:\n\nInstagram: @lasmuzagro1LinkedIn: Lasmuz Agro\n\n",

Apart from an upgraded public transport system, a functioning road accident fund, emergency services which include vehicle and helicopter ambulances, and other heavy machinery/equipment must be in place.emphasised Busha.\n\nBusha criticized the current governments approach, stating that it prioritizes consumption over capital expenditure.\n\nGovernment is not focused on capex but consumption. Zimbabwe is a consumption economy because it enriches the political government and business elite. Thats the problem. he said.\n\nHe proposed a comprehensive approach, including transport and medical insurance, to address the crisis.\n\n",

Speaking during the handover, Chibaya said the gesture was inspired by the important role pastors play in peoples lives.\n\nI have donated this cement in support of the RCZ Churchs vision for the construction of the pastors house, said Chibaya.

Forward ever, backwards never, he said.\n\nTshabangus comments quickly sparked backlash, with critics accusing him of making reckless and poorly informed statements on a sensitive economic issue.\n\nFormer CCC youth assembly spokesperson Stephen Sarkozy Chuma slammed the remarks as wishful, ill-advised and baseless.\n\nTshabangu must understand that currency issues are deeply rooted in confidence and stability, not slogans, Chuma said.\n\nHis statement also drew sharp criticism on social media, where many users blasted the senator for what they described as a dangerous and populist stance at a time when trust in local currency remains fragile.\n\nThis is how economies collapsethrough careless political posturing, one user posted on X (formerly Twitter), while another commented, ZiG cant buy bread, and Tshabangu wants us to ditch the dollar?\n\nThe ZiG, introduced by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe in April 2024 to replace the inflation-wracked Zimbabwe dollar, has so far struggled to gain traction in everyday transactions, with most Zimbabweans preferring the US dollar due to stability and broader acceptance.\n\nDespite Tshabangus bold call, analysts say full de-dollarisation will require more than patriotic rhetoricit needs sound economic fundamentals, trust, and real value backing the local currency.\n\n",

Another Fortuner was given to Madzibaba Boniface Muteze of Domboshava.\n\nChivayo directed the leaders to collect their fully paid 2025 Toyota Fortuner 2.8 GD6 SUVs, all white in colour, from Exquisite Car Dealership.\n\nThe spree didnt end there.\n\nChivayo also said seven Toyota Hilux single cab vehicles were ready for collection at Faramatsi Motors.

With a commanding 85% of the votes cast, ZANU PF has reaffirmed its stature as the only political formation in which citizens continue to place their hopes, she said.\n\nZANU PF clinched three of the key wards with wide margins. In Chikomba Ward 10, candidate Tafadzwa Mukandi polled 477 votes against the oppositions 290. In Chiredzi Ward 4, Austin Phikelele dominated with 1,577 votes, while the opposition lagged far behind with just 265.\n\nThe most dramatic result came from Marondera Ward 6, where ZANU PFs Fiona Tongawashe won an overwhelming 928 votes, while the opposition managed only 22 votes.\n\nThese statistics speak volumes, not only about the peoples loyalty to ZANU PF but also about their growing disillusionment with alternative political actors, Watungwa added.\n\nThe outcome has further emboldened ruling party supporters online, many of whom took to social media platforms to celebrate what they see as a reaffirmation of the partys political dominance. Using hashtags like #Chakabatwa, ZANU PF sympathisers declared the opposition defeated and irrelevant.\n\nWhile the by-elections were held in wards traditionally viewed as strongholds for ZANU PF, the scale of the victories is being touted by party loyalists as a broader reflection of national sentiment.\n\nOpposition figures are yet to issue a formal response to the results.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent | ZimEye | Herefordshire, UK  29 July 2025 | Zimfest 2025, the flagship Zimbabwean cultural festival held in Herefordshire last Saturday, is facing a wave of criticism after attendees alleged disturbing public behaviour including urination in open spaces and outdoor sex acts. While the event organisers have publicly denied any wrongdoing or official fines, social media platforms have been flooded with complaints, raising questions about safety and event management.\n\nThe backlash was triggered after festivalgoer Janet Manuel C, a self-described Top Fan, posted a string of viral Facebook comments slamming attendee conduct and festival oversight.\n\nIts a family event, munhu know your body. Some were dressed like going to touchline, she wrote.\n\nMatoilets aipepo wani, why kuitira panze?\n\nHakuna makids akadaro, she added, highlighting how unsuitable the environment was for children.\n\nMost shockingly, she alleged: Nekutoiita sex panze, used condoms were found outside.\n\nThe allegations sparked alarm across the diaspora community, with many calling for accountability and stricter controls at future editions of the festival.\n\n Organisers Respond: No Fine Was Issued\n\nIn response to the mounting criticism, the official Zimfest Live Facebook page issued a statement Monday evening:\n\nJust to clarify; no fine was issued to the organisers and were proud of how well everyone represented the community. Were listening to your feedback as we work to improve and grow.\n\nThe post thanked attendees for making the event unforgettable and encouraged positive vibes only with hashtags like #Zimfest2025, #ZimfestFamily, and #SeeYouIn2026.\n\n Legal Context and Potential Risks\n\nWhile Zimfest organisers have denied being fined, the described behaviourparticularly public sex and urinationcould constitute violations under UK law, including:\n\nThere is no evidence yet that Herefordshire Council has launched a formal investigation, but the presence of children and the scale of the allegations could prompt future licensing scrutiny.\n\n Community Divided\n\nWhile some applauded Zimfests cultural unity and musical talent, others are calling for reforms.\n\nWe cant ignore this. It was advertised as family-friendly but some of what happened was disgraceful, said one parent who attended with her children.\n\nOthers defended the event and blamed a small number of individuals for spoiling an otherwise well-organised celebration.\n\n Whats Next?\n\nAs Zimfest begins planning for its 2026 edition, organisers now face pressure to enhance crowd management, increase security presence, and enforce decency standards. Meanwhile, critics continue to question whether enough has been done to protect public safety.\n\nFor now, the organisers maintain their position: no fine, no failurejust lessons to grow from.\n\nBACKGROUND.\n\nIn the UK, there are no specific fines that attach to function hosts solely because an attendee urinates in an open space. However, individuals caught urinating in public can face legal consequences, and event organisers may face penalties or enforcement action in certain circumstances. Heres a breakdown:\n\n For the Individual:\n\nPublic urination is typically treated as a summary offence under local bylaws or public order laws:\n\n For the Host or Event Organiser:\n\nIf you are hosting a private event (e.g. a wedding, house party, or festival), you arent automatically fined if someone urinates in public. However:\n\n Summary:\n\nIf youre hosting a large event in the UK, its best practice to:\n\n",
