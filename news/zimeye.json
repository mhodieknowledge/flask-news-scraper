We trusted him as a pastor and a writer, and he got close to our leader. Little did we know he is a snake.

The entire performancecaptured on national broadcaster ZBCoffers a revealing window into the frosty, yet performative, relationship between Mnangagwa and his deputy, General Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nStanding stiffly in full military regalia, Chiwenga offers ED a formal salute followed by a conspicuously animated double-handed handshake. While speaking in Shona, Chiwenga asks:\n\nRevisiting ED's Departure For Luanda, Angola  A Closer Scrutiny!Act 1 Scene 1 @ Harare International AirportFrom audio. Chiwenga to ED in Shona:\"Zvakanaka. Mofamba mushe. EU muri kunotora nguva yakadini?\"[All is well. Have a safe journey. How long are you going to behttps://t.co/k1hdq4RCKG\n\nZvakanaka. Mofamba mushe. EU muri kunotora nguva yakadini?\n\n(All is well. Have a safe journey. How long will you be away at the EU Summit?)\n\nMnangagwa, noticeably restrained, does not return the exuberance. Instead of locking eyes and replying directly, he mumbles something unintelligible while deliberately turning his head awayfacing the direction he had just walked from. This is at the precise moment when protocol and natural etiquette would demand a firm verbal response to the Acting Presidents question.\n\nTHE DELIBERATE DEFLECTION?\n\nTheres no visible external stimulus or distraction in that direction to warrant the diversion of EDs attention. This body language, when viewed in context, appears to be more than coincidence: it resembles a subtle but calculated act of dismissal.\n\nWhen he eventually turns back to resume his walk, his hand slips free of Chiwengas. The handshake is over. The interaction is awkward, forcedand very telling.\n\nA SPECTACLE FOR THE CAMERAS?\n\nLegal and political analyst Brighton Mutebuka offers a sharp take:\n\nChiwenga may have been straining for small talkwhile performing an appropriate degree of spectacle to convince the audience and TV cameras of his aura around ED.\n\nIndeed, Chiwengas body language is unlike that of the other officials. Others merely offer quick, respectful handshakesbarely performing for the cameras. Chiwengas handshake, however, is theatrical. His exaggerated physical energy contrasts sharply with EDs closed, reserved posture.\n\nIts a duet where only one partner is dancing.\n\nWHATS MISSING FROM THE SCRIPT?\n\nMost tellingly, Chiwengas question  asking about EDs travel itinerary  raises serious protocol concerns. As Acting President, he should have been briefed long before EDs departure. That he felt compelled to ask at the airport either reveals:\n\nWhatever the case, it signals ongoing power dysfunction at the highest levels.\n\nCONTEXT: A FAULTLINE CALLED AGENDA 2030\n\nThis performance occurs amid rising tensions over Mnangagwas suspected push for a third term under Agenda 2030. The militaryespecially Chiwengas factionhas shown increasing discomfort. The handshake, then, is not just a farewell; it is a coded message.\n\nTHE FINAL TURN: EDS SMILEBUT NOT FOR CHIWENGA\n\nAs ED continues down the line, he finally breaks into a smilebut not with Chiwenga. Its only while greeting other officials that he seems relaxed, jovial, his body language easing into natural comfort.\n\nBehind the handshake lies a cold war. A handshake that was meant to say we are united instead screams distance, mistrust, and staged diplomacy. The handshake is not a greeting; its a performance. And the audienceboth national and globalhas now seen the cracks.\n\nFade out. End of Scene.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent The family of the late African Apostolic Church founder, Archbishop Paul Mwazha, has confirmed that his burial will be conducted under strict religious protocols, in accordance with church doctrine and long-standing family traditions.\n\nArchbishop Mwazha, who died on 20 November 2025 at the age of 107, will be laid to rest in Chirasauta, Chikomba District, Mashonaland East Province.\n\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage said the burial will be strictly overseen by close family members and the church, following a formal request by the Mwazha family.\n\nAccording to the programme, Mwazhas remains will be collected from Nyaradzo Funeral Parlour and taken to the family home in Hatfield, where they will lie in state on Friday, 28 November 2025. A church service will be held from 7 pm to 10 pm.\n\nOn Saturday, 29 November, the body will be airlifted to Guvambwa for an all-night body viewing from 4 pm until 6 am. On Sunday, 30 November, it will be flown to Chirasauta Business Centre for final burial rites, scheduled between 9 am and midday.\n\nThe Ministry urged congregants and the general public to respect the strict religious guidelines governing the proceedings.\n\nThousands of followers are expected to gather in Chirasauta on Sunday for the burial, which comes after the family firmly rejected government plans to inter the revered cleric at the National Heroes Acre.\n\nThe decision has stirred national debate, particularly because the ZANU PF-led government had moved swiftly to take charge of the funeral after President Emmerson Mnangagwa conferred national hero status on Mwazha. For decades, the ruling party has used state-assisted burials at the national shrine to assert political authority and symbolically claim influential national figures.\n\nMwazhas family instead insisted on a private, church-centred burial  a rare but decisive departure that interrupts ZANU PFs long-standing practice of leveraging high-profile funerals for political gain. State funerals have often been used to consolidate loyalty, rehabilitate political narratives, or commandeer the legacy of prominent public figures.\n\nIn the months leading up to his death, the political courting of Mwazha had intensified. Senior ZANU PF officials frequently visited him ahead of key political events, and he recently received a luxury vehicle and cash gifts from businessman and convicted fraudster Wicknell Chivayo  one of the ruling partys most visible benefactors. The gestures fuelled public speculation that Mwazhas vast spiritual following was being targeted for political mobilisation.\n\nFamily spokesperson Dr Masimba Mwazha reiterated that the burial would proceed strictly in line with church and family protocols.\n\nThe body of the national hero will leave Harare on Saturday for Chikomba District, where everyone will be gathered. The body will depart for Chirasauta on Sunday for burial at a private function, he said.\n\nArchbishop Mwazha was immediately declared a national hero following his death, with Mnangagwa praising his spiritual leadership and contribution to the growth of African Independent Churches. ZANU PF National Chairperson Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri, accompanied by CIO Minister Lovemore Matuke, visited the family home in Hatfield to deliver the Presidents condolence message.\n\nBorn on 25 October 1918 at Holy Cross Mission in Chirumanzu, Mwazha became one of the most influential leaders in African Independent Churches, grounded in accounts of divine encounters and a lifelong commitment to spiritual renewal.\n\nHis burial outside Heroes Acre stands as a firm assertion of family and church autonomy  a quiet but unmistakable rebuke of efforts to turn his passing into a political spectacle.\n\n",

The military faction later appeared on state television to announce that they were suspending the electoral process as the nation awaited results from Sundays presidential election.\n\nThe officers claimed they had intervened to thwart what they described as a plot by unnamed politicians supported by a well-known drug baron to destabilise the country. They declared the closure of national borders and imposed a night-time curfew.\n\nGuinea-Bissau, precariously wedged between Senegal and Guinea, has long been a coup-prone West African state and a key transit hub for the international drug trade. Since independence from Portugal in 1974, its military has consistently wielded outsized political influence.\n\nResults from the contentious presidential election were expected on Thursday, with both Embal and his main rival Fernando Dias having prematurely declared victory. Dias is backed by former Prime Minister Domingos Simes Pereira, who was controversially barred from running.\n\nLate Wednesday, Embal told France 24 in a phone interview: I have been deposed.\n\nGovernment sources later informed the BBC that Dias, Pereira and Interior Minister Botch Cand had also been taken into custody. The junta is reported to have detained the armys top brass, including Chief of Defence Staff General Biague Na Ntan and his deputy, General Mamadou Tour.\n\nThe situation remains fluid, and the international community is monitoring developments closely as Guinea-Bissau teeters once again on the brink of political upheaval.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent  The government has extended state state-assisted funeral to Supreme Court Judge Feliciah Chatukuta.\n\nJustice Chatukuta passed away in Harare on Saturday, 22 November 2025, reportedly following a cardiac arrest.\n\nShe was 63.\n\nIn a statement, Mnangagwa said:\n\nI learnt with profound sadness of the passing on of Supreme Court Judge, Justice Felicia Chatukuta, a distinguished daughter of the nation and stalwart of the Zimbabwean judiciary. Justice Chatukuta died on the 22nd of November 2025 due to cardiac arrest. She was 63.Justice Chatukuta, whose career in the legal fraternity spanned four decades, exemplified an unquestionable dedication to upholding the rule of law. Her unwavering commitment to the justice delivery system has left an indelible mark on our great nation.\n\nFrom her early days as a young legal practitioner soon after earning her Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree from the University of Zimbabwe in 1985, Justice Chatukuta demonstrated her dedication to the learned profession through working as a Public Prosecutor and later as a part-time lecturer at her alma mater, the University of Zimbabwe. She also served as a director at the Legal Aid Directorate and continued on the legal path with dedication, honesty and commitment. These qualities saw her being elevated to the bench on the 29th of August 2005, when she was appointed a judge of the High Court of Zimbabwe.\n\nJustice Chatukuta served as a High Court judge for 16 years, distinguishing herself through hard work and utmost integrity until her elevation to the Supreme Court bench on the 3d of June2021. The appointment was in recognition of her high professional and ethical standards of conduct, legal expertise and invaluable contribution to the justice delivery system in Zimbabwe.Despite the lofty appointments, Justice Chatukuta served with humility and a demonstrated thoroughness in the execution of her duties, traits that are worth emulating not only by those serving in the legal fraternity, but by all Zimbabweans. Her passing on is a significant loss to the Zimbabwean judiciary and her legacy will serve as an inspiration for future generations.In recognition of her significant contribution to the Nation, I have directed that she be accorded a State Assisted funeral. May I, on behalf of the ruling Party ZANU (PF), the Government of Zimbabwe, my family and indeed on my own behalf, express my deepest condolences to the Chatukuta family over this painful loss. May the family take comfort in the knowledge that the entire nation of Zimbabwe joins them in mourning the late Justice Chatukuta.May her dear soul rest in eternal peace.\n\nE.D MnangagwaPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe\n\n",

The man in the wheelchair is no ordinary citizenhe is a living sacrifice, a soldier-turned-ghost of Zimbabwes liberation war, now maimed and discarded. His hand is outstretched, not in desperation, but in guidance. He points aheadnot toward comfort or riches, but toward dignity, sacrifice, and the true legacy of Zimbabwes soldiers.\n\nHe pleads:\n\nToda nzira dzemaSoldier kwete zvaWicknell.\n\n(We want the soldiers path, not Wicknells deception.)\n\nBefore them, in polished boots and blinding medals, stand two uniformed officersdecked in honor, but bloated with vanity.

ZANU PF National Chairperson Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri, accompanied by CIO Minister Lovemore Matuke, visited the family home in Hatfield to deliver the Presidents condolence message.\n\nArchbishop Mwazha played an important role during the liberation struggle and post-independence in promoting peace and Christianity, Muchinguri-Kashiri said.\n\nBorn on 25 October 1918 at Holy Cross Mission in Chirumanzu, Mwazha became one of the most influential leaders in African Independent Churches, his ministry shaped by accounts of divine encounters and a lifelong commitment to spiritual renewal.\n\nHis burial outside the National Heroes Acre marks a powerful assertion of family and church autonomy  a quiet but resolute pushback against the ruling partys attempt to turn the passing of a religious icon into a political spectacle.\n\n",
