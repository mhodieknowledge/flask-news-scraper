            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda- Zimbabwe is grappling with a severe shortage of Early Childhood Development (ECD) teachers, as well as science and mathematics educators, exacerbating the ongoing crisis in the education sector.\n\nThe dire situation has forced the government to authorize parents, through School Development Committees (SDCs), to employ temporary relief teachers in an effort to fill the gap.\n\nThe Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education has set a target to recruit 8,000 teachers this year to mitigate the critical teacher deficit in schools.\n\nHowever, this measure alone is unlikely to resolve the crisis, given the worsening attrition of qualified educators due to poor salaries and deteriorating working conditions.\n\nFor years, Zimbabwean teachers have decried poor remuneration, with many earning salaries far below the poverty datum line.\n\nQualified educators, particularly those in specialized subjects such as science, mathematics, and ECD, have been leaving the profession in droves, either seeking better-paying opportunities abroad or transitioning to other industries.\n\nDespite periodic salary increments, teachers continue to face economic hardships, struggling to afford basic necessities, transport costs, and housing.\n\nIn some cases, teachers resort to informal side jobs, including vending and tutoring, just to make ends meet.\n\nThe mass exodus of trained professionals has left schoolsespecially those in rural areaswithout adequate teaching staff, leading to overcrowded classrooms and compromised education quality.\n\nResponding to questions from legislators during a recent Question and Answer session in Parliament, Deputy Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Angeline Gata acknowledged the crisis, particularly in ECD and STEM subjects.\n\nShe confirmed that SDCs have been permitted to engage temporary relief teachers where funding allows.\n\nAs a ministry, we have gone public on the shortage of teachers in ECD and other critical learning areas, she said. We have even extended that to other levels or grades experiencing similar shortages. We are grateful that our request for additional teachers is receiving attention from the employer, the Public Service Commission (PSC).\n\nGata explained that, in previous years, the ministry had relied on para-professional teachersunqualified or underqualified individuals engaged by SDCs to address the staffing gaps.\n\nWhile this arrangement is a temporary solution, it highlights the gravity of the crisis and the governments struggle to provide fully qualified educators.\n\nThese para-professionals were contracted by schools, with agreements made between parents and teachers. Their employment was conditional on the availability of funds to pay them, as the government does not interfere with these contracts, Gata said.\n\nThe reliance on temporary and unqualified relief teachers underscores the deepening crisis in Zimbabwes education sector.\n\nWithout urgent government interventionthrough competitive salaries, improved working conditions, and a comprehensive strategy to retain trained professionalsECD and other critical subjects will continue to suffer.\n\n",

The duo was each fined USD $120 for their unlawful actions.\n\nThe bribery incident occurred on December 11, 2024, at a roadblock near Mutare Teachers College. Pemba, who was driving a commuter omnibus, and Tavashe, serving as the conductor, were stopped by Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) officer Peace Runyararo Muchenje.\n\nIn an attempt to avoid penalties for traffic violations, Tavashe handed Muchenje USD $3.00 as a bribe. However, the exchange did not go unnoticed. Officers from the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) were conducting surveillance in the area and witnessed the bribery.\n\nFollowing the incident, Officer Muchenje was arrested for accepting the bribe. A subsequent manhunt led to the capture of Pemba and Tavashe, culminating in their conviction and sentencing.\n\nThe case highlights the Zimbabwean governments ongoing crackdown on corruption, with authorities urging citizens to uphold integrity and transparency. The strong stance against bribery was reinforced by the Ministry of Justice, which emphasized the need for law enforcement and public cooperation in curbing corruption.\n\nThe conviction serves as a stern reminder that corruption, regardless of scale, will not be tolerated. The public is encouraged to report any instances of bribery and corruption to the relevant authorities as the nation pushes forward with its #NoToBribery campaign.\n\nStay tuned for more updates on this developing story.\n\n",

Tore, who is accused of committing a brutal triple homicide, attempted to take his own life as he realized there was no escape.\n\nThe intense search began when police investigations led them to a house in Chikangwe Township, Karoi. However, Tore managed to slip through their grasp, retreating to his rural home. Determined to bring him to justice, villagers and law enforcement scoured the area relentlessly.\n\nOn February 23, at approximately 5:45 p.m., sharp-eyed villagers spotted Tore concealed in dense brush just a kilometer from his homestead. As the net closed in, Tore inflicted multiple wounds on himself using an okapi knife, stabbing his chest four times and his neck twice in a desperate suicide attempt.\n\nVillagers swiftly apprehended the suspect and handed him over to the authorities. Tore received initial medical attention at Chitindiva Clinic before being transferred to Karoi District Hospital, where he remains under armed police guard.\n\nThe shocking turn of events has left the Karoi community reeling, with residents lauding the collaboration between police and civilians that ultimately led to Tores capture. As investigations continue, authorities are working to ensure justice is served for the tragic triple murder that has shaken the region.\n\n",

This interim measure aims to fill the gap while awaiting the recruitment of 8,000 permanent educators by the Public Service Commission (PSC) this year.\n\nThe Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, which has been vocal about the teacher deficit in schools, has prioritized ECD, science, and mathematics as the most affected areas. According to Deputy Minister Angeline Gata, School Development Committees (SDCs) have been authorized to engage relief teachers where financial resources permit.\n\nAs a ministry, we have gone public on the shortage of teachers at ECD and other science learning areas. We have even extended that to other levels and grades experiencing critical shortages, Deputy Minister Gata stated during a parliamentary Question and Answer session.\n\nThe initiative allows SDCs to employ what are referred to as para-professional teachers on a temporary basis. These relief educators will serve until the PSC completes its deployment of qualified teachers to the affected schools. Deputy Minister Gata emphasized that the Government would not interfere with the contractual agreements between schools and the temporary educators.\n\nThe contracts of these para-professionals are between the schools and the individuals concerned, and they are only engaged subject to the availability of funds for their remuneration, she added.\n\nThis development is expected to bring much-needed relief to schools struggling with high student-to-teacher ratios, particularly in foundational and technical subjects. The move also highlights the Governments commitment to ensuring uninterrupted learning for students across the country.\n\nAs the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education continues to push for long-term solutions, the temporary measure will empower communities to take proactive steps in maintaining educational standards.\n\nStay tuned for more updates on this developing story.\n\n",

The 88-year-old pontiff continues to fight pneumonia in both lungs.\n\nThe Vatican confirmed that, although the pope was hospitalized over a week ago, he has not experienced further respiratory issues since the previous evening. Some of his blood tests show early, mild kidney failure, but the situation is under control. The pope is also said to be vigilant and well-oriented.\n\nFrancis is still receiving oxygen, but he participated in the Holy Mass on Sunday morning from a special apartment on the 10th floor of Gemelli Hospital, where he has been receiving care. The medical staff attending to him also joined in the Mass.\n\nDue to the complexity of his condition and the wait for the effects of ongoing treatments, the Vatican has stated that the prognosis remains uncertain.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Vatican revealed that the pope had received a high flow of oxygen after experiencing a respiratory crisis but had a restful night in the hospital. He was unable to lead the weekly Angelus prayer for the third time in his nearly 12-year papacy.\n\nIn his sermon, which was distributed to the press, Pope Francis expressed his gratitude to the medical team for their dedication as he continues his treatment.\n\nAdmitted to a Rome clinic on February 14 for tests related to a respiratory tract infection, the pope was later diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs after a CT scan.\n\nDr. Jamin Brahmbhatt, a urologist from Orlando Health Medical Group, commented on the popes kidney condition, telling CNN that the update shouldnt cause alarm. Its not necessarily anything significant, but we can tell his condition remains critical, Brahmbhatt said. The kidneys are delicate but resilient organs.\n\nHe explained that infections, particularly in older adults, can quickly escalate, leading to sepsis, which may damage multiple organs, including the kidneys. In Pope Francis case, this has resulted in mild renal failure, which can either improve with treatment or potentially cause permanent damage, he added.\n\n",

With the country grappling with high inflation, unemployment, and widespread poverty, the opposition leader warned that the government is increasingly relying on false narratives to maintain its hold on power.\n\nDespite the governments rhetoric, Chamisa urged citizens to stay true to their values and not succumb to manipulation.\n\nKeep strong.

While it is important to express differing viewpoints, I believe it is equally crucial to engage in constructive dialogue rather than resorting to disrespectful insults.\n\nChinamasa, who has played a central role in Zimbabwean politics for decades, has been at the center of the criticism. As a former Finance Minister, his leadership during difficult economic periods has been both praised and criticized. Nkatha defended Chinamasas track record, noting that his contributions to Zimbabwes political and economic landscape should not be undermined by personal attacks.\n\nPatrick Chinamasa, with his decades of experience in Zimbabwean politics, has contributed significantly to our nations journey, Nkatha asserted. As a former Finance Minister, he played a pivotal role during challenging economic times, navigating complexities that required considerable expertise. His efforts to stabilize our economy, particularly during turbulent periods, should not be overshadowed by personal attacks or attempts to tarnish his reputation.\n\nNkatha emphasized that criticism aimed at leadership, especially from within, could have long-lasting and detrimental effects. Criticism aimed at leadership, especially from within, can have far-reaching consequences. It can undermine the very foundations of unity and progress we strive to build, he warned.\n\nThe tension stems from ongoing debates within the political sphere regarding the Vision 2030 initiative, which seeks to transform Zimbabwes economy and improve the quality of life for all citizens. Nkatha stressed that the Vision 2030 initiative represents hope for many Zimbabweans and that it should be supported with collaborative effort and constructive engagement.\n\nOur focus should be on fostering collaboration, respecting diverse opinions, and coming together to support the Vision 2030 agenda, Nkatha urged. Discrediting individuals, particularly those who have dedicated their lives to public service, detracts from the collective effort required to realize our goals.\n\nWith divisions becoming more apparent, Nkatha called for an approach rooted in respect and unity, highlighting the necessity for dialogue in resolving differences and working toward a common purpose.\n\nLet us remember that the strength of our leadership lies in its ability to embrace dialogue, listen to different perspectives, and work towards a common purpose, he concluded. I urge everyone to reflect on the impact of our words and actions, and to strive for a more respectful and unified approach as we move forward.\n\nAs Zimbabwe inches closer to 2030, the future of the Vision 2030 initiative appears to hinge not only on economic strategies but on the ability of leaders and citizens alike to engage in meaningful, respectful discussions for the betterment of the nation.\n\n",
