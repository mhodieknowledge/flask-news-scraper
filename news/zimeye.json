            "content": "Dear Editor.Have you noticed that the G40 faction is in sixes and sevens over the recent political move by ZANU PF President. In yet another master stroke of strategic planning and deployment President ED Mnangagwa has left the G40 in a serious panic.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the retirement of the Commissioner General of Police, the G40-aligned COZWA fabricated a narrative claiming that the former Commissioner had openly defied President Emmerson Mnangagwa by refusing to be retired. This prompted an official police statement aimed at quelling the falsehoods stirred by G40 aligned COZWA.\n\nCOZWA was not alone in trying to sow confusion and discord over the appointments. Walter Mzembi, a prominent G40 kingpin, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to express his views on the newly appointed officials, particularly Dr. Fulton Upenyu Magwanya, who has been described as a career intelligence officer. Mzembis post reads: Career Intelligence Officers will be pleased with the appointment of Dr. Fulton Upenyu Magwanya, a sober and disciplined Civil Servant. Looking forward to more professional reporting not concocted reports targeting personalities and creating non-existent enemies of the State. Fulton brought much-needed sanity in Parks & Wildlife. Well done @edmnangagwa.\n\nWhile Mzembis approval of Magwanya marks an apparent endorsement of the new direction under the President, it raises eyebrows given his history of swiftly reversing support. Mzembi, whose stateless predicament has him floating between various countries, is known for praising appointees only to later attack them when it suits his agenda. Notably, he previously lauded John Mushayavanhus appointment as Governor of the Reserve Bank before launching into personal jabs against Mushayavanhu.\n\nAdding to the tumult, Saviour Kasukuwere, self-proclaimed President of the G40, opted for sarcasm in response to the reshuffles. He posted an image of a luxurious bottle of Macallan whisky accompanied by the caption, This is the most expensive whisky and has a key role in the governance of countries. Some get fired or promoted at elite drinking binges in the farms around our good country. Good day MaCitizens. His mocking tone underscores the displeasure and the displeasure of G40 over the appointments.\n\nAs members of the G40 grapple with the implications of these appointments, it is clear that this upheaval means any influence of the G40 within the government will never return. Observers note that the mounting criticisms and backdoor scheming by G40 are symptomatic of a dead faction scrambling to retain its relevance amid a changing political environment.\n\n-Mazowe Agenda For Development\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe government has enforced a ban on fishing at Lake Chivero until comprehensive investigations by the Ministry of Health and Child Care are concluded. The ban follows a significant environmental disaster, with reports of water contamination leading to the loss of wildlife and aquatic life in the area.\n\nAt a media briefing held at Munhumutapa Building in Harare on Thursday, Dr. Sithembiso Nyoni, the Minister of Environment, Climate, and Wildlife, spoke candidly about the crisis. She labeled the situation at Lake Chivero as critical and emphasized the need for an integrated approach to address the severe pollution and ecological disruptions affecting the lake.\n\nGoing forward, we will rope in the Ministry of Health to do the finding because we want to save lives. The ban cannot be lifted now and a whole of government and stakeholders approach is required to reverse the situation at Chivero, stated Minister Nyoni.\n\nThe fishing ban comes after alarming reports of poisoning in the water, which has caused widespread damage to both animal and aquatic populations. While the Ministry of Environment has been at the forefront of managing the crisis, questions are being raised about the adequacy of government actions.\n\nCritics argue that the governments shifting of responsibility onto the Ministry of Health highlights a failure to address the root causes of the disaster effectively. Many believe that the continued environmental degradation at Lake Chivero could have been prevented with earlier and more decisive action. The shifting of blame has left some questioning the governments ability to handle such a major environmental catastrophe.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nControversial Zanu PF businessman Wicknell Chivayo has made headlines again, this time by giving away USD 5000 to a woman who was left out after he distributed money to airport staff during a recent visit to Victoria Falls. The incident, which caused an online stir, has sparked both criticism and a surprising act of generosity from Chivayo.\n\nChivayo explained the situation in a statement, acknowledging the misunderstanding that led to the womans embarrassment. From VICTIM to VICTORY he began, addressing the unfortunate criticism directed at the woman in the viral video. My attention has been drawn to the unfortunate criticism directed at the woman in the video circulating on social media, who did not receive USD 100 like other airport staff during my recent visit to Victoria Falls.\n\nThe businessman explained that during his trip, he had decided to show gratitude to the airport staff who were on duty during the Christmas holiday. As I prepared to board my private jet back to Harare in the company of my beautiful and beloved partner, I felt deeply moved by the airport staff who were on duty, sacrificing time with their families during Christmas time. Out of gratitude and compassion, I decided to bless the staff wearing green reflective vests with USD 100 each as a small token of appreciation.\n\nHowever, things took a turn when other people, including the woman, mistakenly approached Chivayo for money. Unfortunately, this kind gesture was misunderstood, and other non-staff members, including the woman in question, began to join in, leading to the regrettable incident, he explained.\n\nIn the video that went viral, the woman in a pink top and blue jeans was seen trying to get her share, but after Chivayo realized that she wasnt part of the airport staff, he stopped giving out money. The woman was left out, which led to her making frantic requests to receive USD 100. When I stopped giving out the money, the woman in the pink top and blue jeans was unfortunately left out, despite making frantic requests to also get the USD.\n\nChivayo expressed regret over the situation, which led to the woman facing online ridicule. This incident has regrettably subjected her to online ridicule and derogatory comments. I personally dont know this woman, but I wish to extend my heartfelt apology for the public embarrassment she has endured, as well as to her family and husband, if she is married, he said.\n\nHe acknowledged the womans actions, stating that he understood why she approached him. I understand her actions. I would have done exactly the same thing if I saw a millionaire giving money in that context. This woman simply decided to seize the opportunity out of hope and necessity.\n\nIn a gesture to make amends, Chivayo offered a significant amount of money. As a small gesture of my goodwill and token of apology for the unfortunate incident, please urgently contact my lawyer, Mr. Sikhumbuzo Mpofu of Munangate & Associates and collect USD 5000 cash for the reputational damage this incident has caused, Chivayo announced. I wish you and your family a prosperous 2025!\n\nThis move from Chivayo, who is known for his controversial public image, marks an unexpected resolution to a situation that sparked both public derision and a surprising act of kindness.\n\nFrom VICTIM to VICTORYMy attention has been drawn to the UNFORTUNATE CRITICISM directed at the woman in the video circulating on social media, who did not receive USD100 like other airport staff during my recent visit to VICTORIA FALLS.

It is vital to walk in groups of at least two or more individuals and to stay on the main roads, avoiding pathways through the bush, particularly at night, Ottman advised in an interview with NewsDay.\n\nKariba, situated within a wildlife area teeming with lions and other predators, poses unique risks for both residents and visitors. Ottman emphasized the importance of vigilance and added that anyone who spots a lion should report it promptly. \n\nReporting sightings helps us monitor their movements and ensures the safety of the community, she said.\n\nWith the presence of wildlife in the area, Ottmans advice serves as a crucial reminder for everyone to stay alert and prioritize safety when moving around at night.\n\n",
