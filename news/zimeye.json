Tickets were priced atUS$10, but the turnout fell drastically short of expectations.\n\nObservers attributed the poor attendance tolow publicity, poor timing, and fan fatigue, with some suggesting that Tockys musical relevance has waned compared to his peak years.\n\nTocky Vibes rose to fame in2014with hit songs such asAmai,Mhai,Usandicheme, andToti Toti, which established him as one of the most lyrically gifted and socially conscious artists in the Zimdancehall genre. His poetic storytelling and clean lyrical content set him apart from his contemporaries, earning him several local music awards and widespread respect from critics.\n\nHowever, in recent years, Tocky has struggled to maintain his earlier dominance in a competitive industry increasingly driven by new trends and youthful acts such asEnzo Ishall, Nutty O, and Freeman. His experimentation with Afro-fusion and gospel-infused sounds also divided his fanbase, with some long-time followers accusing him of abandoning his Zimdancehall roots.\n\nFriday nights poor turnout has reignited debates about thedisconnect between social media popularity and real-world support. While Tocky Vibes remains one of Zimbabwes most followed musicians online, the empty venue reflected a growing gap between virtual fame and tangible fan engagement.\n\nMusic analysts have urged the artist torethink his marketing strategy and reconnect with grassroots audienceswho once propelled him to stardom.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent  Outspoken former legislator Temba Mliswa has launched yet another explosive claim, this time alleging that fuel mogul and ZANU PF Central Committee member Kudakwashe Tagwirei has captured Zimbabwes military and is being prepared to succeed President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nThe claims surfaced in a leaked audio of a private conversation between Mliswa and businessman Agrippa Bopela Masiyakurima, released on Thursday.\n\nThe leak comes just days after Mliswas rural home in Shurugwi was torched by unknown assailants in what police confirmed as a suspected arson attack. Mliswa described it as an assassination attempt linked to his persistent calls for accountability in government.\n\nIn the recording, Mliswa alleges that Mnangagwa has secured the loyalty of the armed forces through Tagwireis financial muscle. He claims that the hundreds of vehicles delivered to the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) last week were not government-funded, as Mnangagwa announced, but were supplied by Tagwirei.\n\nMnangagwa will leave someone he trusts to look after his interests, and thats Kuda, Mliswa is heard saying.\n\nThere is no coup that will ever happen in Zimbabwe. Just check, military bosses were given 100 cars. Those are Kudas cars.\n\nMliswa further alleges that ZDF Commander General Philip Valerio Sibanda salutes Tagwirei when he passes by. He claims at least 500 vehicles will be distributed not only to top brass but also to colonels, captains, and majors  a strategy he described as good politics since mid-ranking officers are the backbone of the military.\n\nMliswa also revealed that he has been touring the country distributing bicycles donated by Tagwirei to village heads.\n\nMasiyakurima said he recorded the conversation after rejecting what he described as Mliswas offer to join a campaign backing Tagwirei. He alleged that Mliswa dangled promises of cash, vehicles, and business support in exchange for loyalty.\n\nWhen I realised the money was coming with conditions, I refused. My morals and principles would not allow me to be a sell-out, Masiyakurima said.\n\nI just wanted to show Zimbabweans that Temba goes to the highest bidder. He has been recruited by Tagwirei to do smear campaigns against VP Chiwenga.\n\nIn response, Mliswa accused Masiyakurima of betrayal. Writing on X, he said Masiyakurima had violated the sanctity of a private discussion:\n\nAs for you Bopela, I considered you a brother and friend and tried to help. We ate and took children to school together. Unfortunately, you had other ideas to please who I dont know. Next time, leak the whole conversation, not what you think are favourable portions.\n\nThe fallout adds fuel to tensions already swirling around Vice President Constantino Chiwengas bitter standoff with controversial businessman Wicknell Chivayo.\n\nMliswa has accused Chiwenga of using anti-corruption rhetoric selectively, claiming it stems from Chivayos alleged failure to fully bankroll Chiwengas 2022 wedding to Colonel Miniyothabo Baloyi. According to Mliswa, Chivayo lavished millions in cash, cars, and properties on the wedding but fell short by US$150,000  sparking Chiwengas vendetta.\n\nHe has also criticised Chiwenga for openly challenging Mnangagwa in Politburo meetings, warning that such disputes risk destabilising the party.\n\nMliswas latest claims follow weeks of political turbulence. Earlier, his vehicle was vandalised in what he linked to his attacks on Chiwenga. The arson attack on his Shurugwi homestead marked a sharp escalation.\n\nPolice confirmed the incident on Friday, saying investigations were underway:\n\nThe ZRP confirms that investigations are currently underway in connection with the malicious damage to property incident at Temba Mliswas homestead in Shurugwi on 02/10/25. More details will be released in due course.\n\nMliswa, a former ZANU PF Mashonaland West chairman, has a long history of clashes with party elites. Expelled in 2014 for allegedly undermining leadership, he reinvented himself as an independent legislator but remained deeply involved in factional politics.\n\nDespite repeated setbacks, Mliswa has carved a reputation as a political maverick who exposes corruption and power struggles inside ZANU PF. Following the Shurugwi attack, he reportedly left for Johannesburg, South Africa, raising speculation over whether he is seeking refuge or preparing for another round of political confrontation.\n\n",

However, recent evidence suggests that instead of addressing the abuses, the company rebranded under new names to continue operating unnoticed.\n\nThe China Global South Project publication had also previously documented claims of violent assaults, poor wages, and attempts by management to silence injured workers with hush money as little as US$10.\n\nZimEye is in possession of visual evidence confirming that trucks previously registered under Ming Chang Sino Africa are now bearing the label Shuntai Investments (Pvt) Ltd.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, company representatives were unavailable at the time of publication.\n\nDeveloping story\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Ministry of Local Government and Public Works is facing mounting criticism over the continued invasion of wetlands in Harare, as unauthorized and irregular construction projects increase across the city.\n\nDuring a workshop on the Construction Contractors Bill 2025 held on Thursday, Mrs Maria Mutandwa, senior communications and information management officer for the International Labour Organisation (ILO), appealed directly to Minister Daniel Garwe to take urgent action. She delivered her remarks on behalf of the ILO director for Zimbabwe and Namibia, Mrs Philile Masuka.\n\nI am now speaking as a Zimbabwean to our Honourable Minister. Minister, we have received numerous reports of construction taking place on wetlands, Mrs Mutandwa said. Your office has been open to suggestions and accommodating citizens who have approached you about this troubling matter. As a citizen, I implore you to intervene in areas with irregular construction and multiple violations of city by-laws regarding wetlands and undesignated land. I sincerely appeal to you to take action, Minister.\n\nIn response, Minister Garwe acknowledged the concerns but appeared to downplay the urgency, stating, I hope we can sit down and discuss how to address the wetland issues. Construction on wetlands reflects unbecoming behaviour.\n\nMrs Mutandwa further stressed the importance of strong regulations and professional standards in the construction sector. The construction sector is more than just bricks and mortar. It is the foundation of our economies and a major source of jobs and livelihoods. It builds the roads that drive economic growth, the schools where our children learn, the hospitals where we seek medical care, and the homes where we build our lives. For this sector to thrive, it must rest on strong legal frameworks, professionalism, and decent working environments that produce mutually beneficial outcomes for all, she said.\n\nThe ILO warned that without decisive enforcement and regulatory oversight, the continued invasion of wetlands could damage fragile ecosystems, increase flooding risks, and undermine sustainable urban development in Harare, raising questions about whether Minister Garwe is effectively addressing the crisis.\n\n",
