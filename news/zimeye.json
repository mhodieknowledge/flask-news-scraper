Below is what Prof Mugano wrote:\n\nThis budget is about revenue collection, and there is nothing in this budget that is pushing for investment promotion and economic development, which is part of the mandate of the Ministry.\n\nSpecifically, the following observations qualify this budget as the worst in history:\n\n1. Cash withdrawal levy is an effective instrument of anti-banking. Hakuna munhu akapusa anoisa mari mu bank kuti azotorerwa nehurumende oburisa mari yake.\n\n2. Increasing gold royalties to 10% (the highest in the world) on sales is punitive & will cause smuggling of gold.\n\n3. Increasing VAT to 15.5% will fuel inflation & make the lives of people miserable.\n\n4. Keeping the 2% tax is unfortunate as it sustains informality, continues to push up the cost of doing business and fuels USD inflation, which is sitting at 13.1%.\n\n5. GoZ has reported a staggering US$1.7 billion of unverified outstanding payments for the period 20222024  this is a sign of poor governance & mismanagement of the national purse. Ironically, it didnt tell us verified outstanding payments for the same period as well as for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\n6. Between JulySeptember 2025, domestic debt increased by US$900 million, that is, from US$8.9 billion to US$9.8 billion. Chii chakwidza debt ne US$900 million in a space of 3 months isu tichiti zvakarongeka?\n\n7. As part of the domestic debt, @ZimTreasury revealed that it owes US$1.280 billion to service providers, which basically cripples the private sector or threatens their survival.\n\n8. Strikingly, in a fashion that showcases the ugly head of corruption, @ZimTreasury reveals that as part of outstanding payments which are still to be verified, a staggering US$700 million has been spent on dams. Where are the dams which took all this money? One of the magnificent dams built inland by the first dispensation is Tokwe Mukasi, and it cost around US$260 million. If at least US$700 million, which is claimed as unverified, was spent on dams over and above verified & approved payments, are we saying this country has completed at least 4 dams of the Tokwe Mukosi type? Where are the dams?\n\n9. With regard to the proposed payment mechanism for the US$1.7 billion, @ZimTreasury proposes to undertake a verification process and issue non-negotiable instruments which will be paid between now and 2030  it basically means that at the very least outstanding payments for BEAM (US$98 million), Dam construction (US$700 million), Road construction (US$220.20 million), input support scheme (US$380 million), ZIMSEC (US$50 million), statutory payments to NSSA, PSMAS & pension fund (US$122 million), etc. will have to wait for more than 8 years without payment, that is, from 20222030. This is as good as a death sentence to schools & the affected businesses/organisations.\n\n10. The budget continues to show a sustained trend of overutilization of funds by some ministries. For example, by 30 September 2025, the Ministry of Transport (267%), OPC (124%), National Housing (161%), etc. However, critical ministries, such as Industry and Commerce, and Foreign Affairs & Int Trade, received a mere 23% of their vote by 30 September  ideally, these ministries should have used 75% of their votes by 30 September since this is the 3rd quarter of the year. This makes the budget and budgeting process ceremonial.\n\n11. The 2026 budget is silent about workers welfare.\n\n12. Introduction of tax on emerging digital services is counterproductive. Ideally, @ZimTreasury should offer tax incentives to promote this emerging sector as opposed to punishing it. I can go on and on.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent Delegates are arriving for the burial of the Founder of the African Apostolic Church (VaApostora veAfrica), Pau Mwazha, who died on 20 November at the age of 107, due this afternoon in Chirasauta, Chikomba District.\n\nThe Mwazha family requested a strictly private burial in accordance with their traditional churchs protocols.\n\nYesterday, thousands of congregants and several government officials gathered at the Guvambwa Tabernacle, one of the churchs principal shrines, where the clerics body was flown in for viewing. Heavy rains swept across the shrine, drenching mourners but failing to deter the multitudes who travelled from across Zimbabwe to honour the revered centenarian.\n\nAfter the service, the body was transported to Chirasauta, where the family will carry out a quiet, religious ceremony. His death has drawn an unusually heavy state presence, with senior officials praising his contribution during the liberation struggle and the post-independence era.\n\nMashonaland East Provincial Affairs Minister Itayi Ndudzo told mourners that government regarded Mwazha as a son of Zimbabwe, adding that his impact on national life justified the conferment of national hero status. Church leaders also paid tribute, describing Mwazha as a humble teacher committed to truth and spiritual discipline.\n\nYet behind the official praise lies an unmistakable political undertone that has overshadowed the funeral. Mwazhas family rejected government plans to inter him at the National Heroes Acre, insisting on a burial consistent with church tradition. The refusal has been widely interpreted as a quiet but powerful rejection of ZANU PFs longstanding practice of using high-profile funerals for political messaging.\n\nThousands are expected in Chikomba for todays burial  not at the national shrine where the government had hoped to lay him to rest. Although President Emmerson Mnangagwa quickly declared him a national hero, the family made it clear that their father would not be used as a political symbol. The Ministry of Home Affairs later confirmed that the funeral would be led entirely by close relatives and the church.\n\nThe familys firm stance represents a rare rebuff of ZANU PFs efforts to associate itself with influential religious figures. In recent months, senior party officials had openly courted Mwazha. He was recently gifted a luxury vehicle and large sums of money by businessman and convicted fraudster Wicknell Chivayo  a well-known ZANU PF benefactor whose donations to church leaders have often been viewed as political overtures. This heightened speculation that the ruling party hoped to tap into Mwazhas vast spiritual following ahead of future political mobilisation.\n\nAccording to the funeral programme, Mwazhas remains were collected from Nyaradzo Funeral Parlour and taken to the family home in Hatfield for an evening service. His body was then airlifted to Guvambwa for an overnight viewing before being taken early this morning to Chirasauta for burial. The Ministry has emphasised that all proceedings will strictly follow church customs, with no political speeches permitted at the graveside.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa and ZANU PF Chairperson Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri have issued condolence messages, praising Mwazha for promoting peace within African Independent Churches. But his burial outside the National Heroes Acre stands as a clear assertion of family and church autonomy  and a quiet reminder that not every national figure wishes to be appropriated into the ruling partys political theatre.\n\nBorn on 25 October 1918 at Holy Cross Mission in Chirumanzu, Mwazha rose to become one of the most influential African Independent Church leaders of the modern era, revered for his spiritual teachings, visions of divine encounters, and commitment to peace.\n\nTodays private burial brings to a close the life of a leader who touched millions  and a funeral that, despite significant government involvement, has remained firmly in the hands of the family and the church he built.\n\n",

            "content": "By Showbiz Reporter-Tinashe Mutarisis much-anticipated Saintfloew show suffered a major blow on Saturday night, drawing only a handful of fans as the majority flocked to Jah Prayzahs packed HICC concert.\n\nFor months, Saintfloews team had been building momentum around the event, hoping to replicate the energy of his October 2023 album launchan unforgettable spectacle where the rapper emerged from a coffin, sparking countrywide debate and propelling his name deeper into the mainstream.\n\nBut this time, the magic simply did not materialise.\n\nBy 9:30 PM, the City Sports Centre told a different story: rows of empty chairs, a cavernous hall, and a silence that echoed louder than the music. Photos circulating online captured the disappointment, prompting an immediate wave of commentary. What was expected to be a night of celebration for a fast-rising artist instead became a talking point about the state of Zimbabwes live music scene.\n\nFans and commentators pointed to several reasons for the flop. Foremost was the unfortunate timing. Saintfloew found himself in direct competition with Jah Prayzaharguably Zimbabwes biggest contemporary musician, known for drawing thousands to his shows. With JP performing at the HICC on the same night, many fans simply chose the more established crowd-puller. Jah Prayzahs loyal, cross-generational following, built over years of polished performances, military-precision choreography and chart-topping albums, left little room for a parallel event to thrive.\n\nEconomic pressures also played a role. Zimbabweans online noted that the timingjust before schools reopenleft many households prioritising fees over entertainment. Others criticised the show for inadequate promotion, saying the advertising lacked the energy and reach needed to pull fans to a major venue.\n\nThe flop also came on the heels of another disappointing turnout, this time for Tocky Vibes, a once-dominant urban grooves star whose audience has dwindled in recent years as new sounds and younger artists reshape the landscape. This back-to-back pattern sparked debate about whether fans are becoming more selective, whether economic hardship is shrinking audiences, or whether only heavyweight acts like Jah Prayzah can still reliably fill venues.\n\nFor Saintfloew, whose rise to fame has been buoyed by a loyal youth following and support from business mogul Tinashe Mutarisi, the night was a sobering reminder of how unpredictable the music industry can be. While his artistry and previous buzz remain intact, Saturdays show will likely become a cautionary tale about timing, competition, and the realities of performing in a harsh economy.\n\nAs one social media page summed it up under a photo of the empty venue: Sad scenes at Saintfloews album launch. This comes soon after Tocky Vibes also had a poor launch. Only a few fans showed up.\n\n",

The footbridge that once stood proud was washed away years ago and never replaced. So the journey to school becomes a daily test of courage for these tiny warriors in worn uniforms and plastic sandals.\n\nWatch them in the misty dawn light.\n\nA Grade 3 girl in a faded turquoise dress clutches her elder brothers hand as they step onto the slippery black rocks. The water rushes brown and angry around their ankles, then their knees. She is terrified  you can see it in her wide eyes  but she does not cry. Behind her, a line of classmates waits their turn, schoolbags held high above their heads like little flags of hope.\n\nOlder boys and a few brave teachers form a human chain across the deepest part. They lock arms, plant their feet against the current, and pass the smallest ones along like precious parcels. One by one, the children are lifted, swung, and steadied until they reach the other side  soaked, shivering, but safe. A little boy in a red jersey slips and goes under for a heart-stopping second. Strong hands yank him up, coughing and gasping, and someone wraps him in a chitenge until he stops shaking.\n\nWhen the last child scrambles up the far bank, the group erupts in tired laughter and relieved cheers. Wet uniforms stick to thin bodies, books are damp at the edges, but not a single learner turns back. They wring out their socks, sling their bags over their shoulders, and march the remaining dusty kilometres to school  because missing a day of lessons is not an option when education is the only ladder out of this hardship.\n\nThis is their normal. This is their every morning.\n\nAnd still, they smile. Still, they hold each others hands a little tighter. Still, they sing as they walk, because tomorrow the river will rise again and they will cross it again, together.\n\nThese are not just children going to school.These are the bravest little heroes you will never hear about on the news, writing the quietest, most powerful success story in rural Zimbabwe  one terrifying river crossing at a time.\n\n",

Spirits had reportedly been high as the group travelled back to Bulawayountil disaster struck.\n\nThe educators were travelling in a kombi registered under the Umguza District chapter of the Better Schools Programme of Zimbabwe when the vehicle veered off the road and collided with a stump. Although the police are yet to issue an official statement, early indications point to a sudden loss of control moments before the impact.\n\nThe name of the deceased headmaster is being withheld pending notification of his relatives. He is understood to have been the leader of a primary school in the Nyamandlovu area. News of his death spread rapidly among the teaching community, with many colleagues expressing shock at the sudden loss.\n\nMatabeleland North Provincial Education Officer, Mr Jabulani Mpofu, confirmed receiving the devastating news as he was travelling from Victoria Falls to Bulawayo.\n\nI am on my way to Bulawayo from Victoria Falls and just getting the terrible news, Mr Mpofu said, his voice reflecting the disbelief and grief now gripping the education fraternity.\n\nAs rescue teams worked to ferry the injured to nearby hospitals, educators across the province struggled to process the tragedy. What should have been a routine journey home after a productive professional gathering has instead plunged Umguzas teaching community into mourning.\n\nFurther details are expected once police complete notifying affected families and issue a full statement on the crash.\n\n",
