Remittances now account for16.1 percent of total foreign currency inflows, making the Zimbabwean Diaspora the countrys second-largest source of hard currency after mineral exports.\n\nThis sharp rise in remittances, despite worsening economic conditions at home, highlights the resilience and commitment of Zimbabweans abroad who continue to support their families and communities amid a collapsed local economy.\n\nHowever, while Zimbabweans in the Diaspora sacrifice to keep their families afloat, the Mnangagwa government continues tomismanage public funds,loot national resources, anddivert foreign inflowsto enrich a politically connected elite.\n\nBillions in mineral revenues, particularly from gold, lithium, and platinum, have reportedly disappeared under Mnangagwas watch withno transparent accounting systems in place.\n\nInstead of fixing the broken governance and accountability systems, the regime blames economic hardships on sanctionsa narrative increasingly rejected by economists and civil society who point togrand corruption, policy inconsistency, and crony capitalismas the real culprits.\n\nWith remittances rising and public service delivery collapsing, critics say the Mnangagwa government isrelying on Diaspora money as a lifeline while offering no structural reforms or transparency in return.\n\nThe situation has sparked renewed calls for anational audit of foreign inflows, a crackdown on illicit financial flows, andconstitutional reformsto curb executive abuse of power in managing public funds.\n\nAs long as remittances prop up a corrupt and unaccountable system, analysts warn thatZimbabweans abroad may unwittingly be funding the very regime responsible for their families suffering at home.\n\n",

            "content": "Sports Correspondent\n\nParis Saint-Germain head coach Luis Enrique has admitted he regrets his involvement in a heated post-match scuffle with Chelsea forward Joao Pedro following a dramatic 3-0 defeat in the Club World Cup final.\n\nChelsea stunned European champions PSG at the MetLife Stadium with a dominant performance led by Cole Palmer, who scored twice and assisted the third goal, becoming only the second Blues player since 2013-14 to directly contribute to three goals in a major final. He now joins the ranks of Eden Hazard (2019 Europa League final) and Didier Drogba (2007 EFL Cup final) as the only Chelsea players to score twice in a major final this century.\n\nThe game, however, ended in chaos. Tensions flared at the final whistle as PSG stars Gianluigi Donnarumma and Achraf Hakimi got into a heated exchange with Chelsea duo Joao Pedro and Andrey Santos. The confrontation escalated when Luis Enrique stepped in and was seen raising his hands to Joao Pedros face, prompting the Brazilian to drop to the ground.\n\nSpeaking at the post-match press conference, Enrique expressed regret over the incident, calling it unnecessary and avoidable.\n\nAt the end of the match, there was a situation that I believe could have been avoided by everyone, he said. My objective and my intention, as always, is to try to win over the players so that there are no more problems. Internally, there is a lot of tension, a lot of pressure.\n\nAnd from there, there is a series of shoves from a lot of people, which I think we should all avoid and which should not happen again.\n\nThe match itself was a showcase of Chelseas rising talent. Palmers brace came within an eight-minute spell in the first half, and he capped his performance with a slick assist for Joao Pedros goal just before halftimesealing Chelseas unexpected but emphatic triumph over the French giants.\n\n",

While it does not fully replicate the complex immunity profile of natural colostrum from the mother, it provides vital proteins, fats, and nutrients to help the newborn build strength in the critical first hours of life.\n\nNote: It is always best to use natural colostrum when available, as it contains species-specific antibodies necessary for early immunity.\n\nHowever, this homemade recipe is a practical and accessible option for small-scale farmers in resource-limited settings.\n\nInstagram: lasmuzagro1\n\nLinkedIn: Lasmuz Agro\n\nlasmuzagrosolutions@gmail.com\n\n",
