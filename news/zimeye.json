            "content": "I do not see Geza's project I see an escalation, says@ZondoNZto@Pachisolife@HotseatEmpirehttps://t.co/wD3jTdNajd\n\nI have come to speak about General Chiwenga, says @BlessedGeza\n\nHe continues saying:We all know what happened in 2017, when President Robert Mugabe when he had become surrounded by thieves. The operation ran by Gen Chiwenga we all know it. If I remember well, Gen Chiwenga placated the constitution and said when the military find the constitution hlis under attack they have powers to enter in and fix things. The person aside him is Gen SB Moyo. I remember the words of Gen SB Moyo said we are not entering to do anything else other than addressing thieves surrounding the president. What shocks me is that this one whos ruling now who had ran away to SA. We remember very well the words of President Mugabe who said Chiwenga I decided to handover to you. This person you want to take over youll cry over him one day. Gen Chiwenga did not listen. Gen Chiwenga brought back Emmerson Mnangagwa so the problems we are now seeing in the country are because of the decision by the generals led by Chiwenga. So for that reason we say the persons to fix this are the Generals and General Chiwenga. I said Cde Bombshell and the people are saying please remove this person you imposed.Chiwenga and the generals know a war time song called Nzira dzemaSoja dzekuzvibatana nadzo. This song is the guiding light out contract with the masses, so the things in this song are the manual. When we when to the way we found Chiwenga teaching us this song. We say Gen Chiwenga the povo needs you to lead us. We are seeing that in the case of Zvigananda they took army companies without paying penny. They took command agriculture money they did not repay. He seized the national pipeline and did not pay a penny. This isnt the way of the soldiers we will be seeing this happening. When we see the issue of prisoners they need to be handled well. We have people like Sikhala the Ngarivhumes, Blessed Mhlangas; the protesters arrested for demonstrating deserve their rights. We have boys whore rotting in jail whats their crime? But we hear their crime they were together because the money went into Emmersons bank account. So why are you oppressing these boys? Why are you denying them bag them bail. This needs fixing. We are seeing that these things happening in Chiwengas eyes in Gen Sanyatwes eyes the povo has cried, please redeem us, we beg you. The problem of Emmerson and his Zviganandas, we see that he is now an invalid- theres what we call state capture. If we see in SAthis is what messed Comrade Jacob Zuma.\n\nWe see that with Mugabe the allegation was state power was sexually transmitted. This time its no longer an allegation. Its a fact.\n\nGenerals you have let us down Why is it that Gen Chiwenga youre failing to give orders to Mutamba to arrest Zviganandas? We are here stuck in the Bush and yet no one seems to care.\n\n",

            "content": "By Political Reporter-The Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) has launched a renewed campaign targeting social media influencers, musicians, celebrities, and politicians flaunting extravagant lifestyles.\n\nZIMRA insiders revealed that the tax authority is actively monitoring individuals who live lavishly to assess whether their declared income matches their visible wealth. The move comes amid growing public outcry over unchecked corruption and ostentatious displays of wealth by politically connected elites.\n\nChivayo, a controversial businessman with deep ties to the ruling ZANU PF party, was recently flagged by South African financial authorities for suspicious transactions involving millions of dollars. Despite a criminal conviction for fraud and years of public backlash over questionable government contracts, Chivayo continues to flaunt wealth on social mediaoften posing with luxury cars, designer clothes, and large cash payments.\n\nAnalysts said ZIMRAs credibility hinges on whether its lifestyle audits will go beyond low-hanging targets like musicians and YouTubers, and instead tackle politically shielded figures such as Chivayo.\n\nSources within ZIMRA said the authority is relying on open-source intelligence, including social media posts and appearances at high-profile events, to build profiles and trigger tax compliance checks.\n\nWe are not just watching celebrities; anyone whose lifestyle appears out of sync with their declared income is of interest, a senior ZIMRA source said.\n\nZIMRAs marketing and corporate affairs executive, Gladman Njanji, confirmed the lifestyle audit blitz, describing it as part of the authoritys long-standing mandate.\n\nZIMRA, as part of its established procedures, regularly conducts lifestyle auditsa practice that is not new, Njanji said.\n\nAdditionally, ZIMRA utilises various social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, as well as traditional media like newspapers, to gather information that is essential for fulfilling its mandate in revenue collection and tax administration.\n\nCritics remain sceptical, warning that the audits risk becoming selective and performative if politically exposed persons are not held to the same standards as ordinary citizens.\n\nTargeting musicians while turning a blind eye to people like Chivayo would only confirm what many Zimbabweans already believethat the law does not apply equally, said one observer.\n\nAs Zimbabwe reels from economic hardship and a widening wealth gap, many are watching closely to see if ZIMRAs latest campaign will finally pierce the veil of political protection shielding the countrys untouchables.\n\n",

            "content": "Mhangura, Zimbabwe  16 May 2025\n\nA major infrastructure crisis has hit Mhangura Hospital after violent underground blasting carried out by suspected Chinese mining contractors late last night caused widespread structural damage to the facility. The powerful explosions, reportedly executed in the mountains adjacent to the hospital compound, resulted in deep cracks throughout the hospital wards  sparking fears that the entire building may now be on the verge of collapse.\n\nImages taken from inside the hospital show alarming scenes of large vertical and horizontal cracks snaking through ward walls, support pillars, ceilings, and entrances. Sections of the brick structure have visibly dislodged, with some parts of the ceiling beginning to separate from the walls. In one image, a hospital visitor can be seen pointing to a gaping crack threatening a critical beam.\n\nAccording to eyewitness reports, residents felt tremors late in the night as blasting shook the ground beneath the town. Within hours, damage to the hospital infrastructure became evident.\n\nThe whole hospital trembled. Patients panicked, and cracks appeared almost instantly. Some rooms are no longer safe, said one community member present at the scene.\n\nA local councillor told ZimEye, the miner has been doing open shaft mining which is illegal.\n\nA local WhatsApp group captured the unfolding concern. Messages from users including Gen Ghoghie confirmed that a team, including local councillors, visited the site early in the morning to assess the extent of the damage. The group confirmed that residents were demanding an immediate stop to the mining activity, citing safety concerns.\n\nLegal voices in the chat pointed to Statutory Instrument 109 of 1990, which explicitly prohibits mining operations within a 500-meter radius of public infrastructure such as hospitals and schools. This blasting is not just irresponsible  its illegal, one message stated. Concerns were also raised over the lack of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), further suggesting that the operation may have proceeded without proper regulatory approval.\n\nThis is a health facility, not a war zone, another resident exclaimed during a community meeting. Theyre trading lives for minerals.\n\nAuthorities are now under mounting pressure to immediately halt all blasting operations and declare the hospital building a protected zone. Calls have also been made for the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development to launch an investigation, and for the police to issue a temporary work stoppage while assessments are carried out.\n\nThere is no word yet from the Ministry of Health on whether the hospital will be evacuated or if emergency renovations will be funded. However, activists are demanding urgent intervention to prevent what they describe as an avoidable disaster in the making.\n\nZimEye will continue to monitor this developing story.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Mnangagwa administration has come under renewed scrutiny following the release of a damning report by the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP), which highlights the ruling Zanu PF and state security agencies as leading perpetrators of human rights abuses in April 2025.\n\nAccording to the ZPPs latest data, Zanu PF is responsible for 34.1% of all recorded human rights violations, making the party the biggest offender last month. The abuses include harassment, political intimidation, and violence, particularly targeting perceived opposition supporters.\n\nAnalysis of the data indicates that individuals affiliated with the ruling party, Zanu PF, were responsible for 34.1% of the reported violations, the report states.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) followed closely, allegedly committing 24.1% of the violations, while local authorities accounted for 15.64%. The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) and government officials were also implicated, responsible for 6.41% and 4.62% of reported abuses respectively.\n\nThese figures expose a systemic pattern of repression carried out by both political and state actors, a ZPP spokesperson said. Its a coordinated assault on civil liberties, especially in provinces considered hostile to the ruling elite.\n\nMasvingo Province recorded the highest number of violations with 20 cases, trailed by Harare with 14, indicating a troubling consistency with Marchs trends.\n\nThe findings directly challenge the governments ongoing narrative of democratic progress and rights reform. While President Mnangagwas administration often touts itself as a reformist regime, human rights defenders say the evidence paints a starkly different reality.\n\nThis report is not just a statistical snapshot; its a national alarm bell, said one rights advocate.\n\nThere can be no meaningful reform while abuses like these go unpunished.\n\nWith the country inching closer to more by-elections and a politically sensitive season ahead, the report underscores the urgent need for independent oversight and accountability mechanisms.\n\nThe international community cannot afford to look away, the advocate added.\n\nThe people of Zimbabwe deserve protectionnot persecution.\n\n",
