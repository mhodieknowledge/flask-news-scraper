            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZimbabwes national football team, the Warriors, are gearing up to face Benin in a crucial 2026 World Cup Qualifiers Group C encounter this evening. Despite a slow start to the campaign, coach Michael Nees remains confident that his side can secure a positive result.\n\nThe match is set to take place at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, South Africa, with kick-off scheduled for 6 pm CAT. Zimbabwe currently sits at the bottom of Group C, having picked up just two points in their first four games.\n\nHowever, Nees believes that his team has the potential to turn their fortunes around. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, he expressed his optimism, stating, I think we can be confident and positive going into this match without being overconfident, with focus and concentration.\n\nNees emphasized the importance of executing a solid game plan, saying, If we bring our best into the match, we can be successful. Its very simple. We have to throw in the best possible plan to get a win and reduce the gap.\n\nA win would be crucial for the Warriors, as a draw would do little to improve their current standing.\n\nBenin currently tops Group C with seven points after four games, making this evenings match a must-win for Zimbabwe.\n\n",

            "content": "Speeding is more than just a violation of traffic laws; it is a deadly risk that can change lives in an instant.\n\nEach time you choose to drive above the speed limit, you are not only endangering yourself but also putting others at risk. Speeding kills, disables, and causes heartache, leaving behind broken families and shattered lives. Its essential to understand the profound impact of your actions on the road and the ripple effect they can have on others.\n\nOne of the most tragic consequences of speeding is the loss of life. Car accidents are a leading cause of death worldwide, and speed is often a contributing factor. When drivers exceed the speed limit, they decrease their ability to react to sudden changes in road conditions, such as pedestrians crossing, animals running into the road, or other vehicles making unexpected movements. At higher speeds, the impact of a collision is much more severe, increasing the chances of fatalities or life-altering injuries.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the driver. A fatal or serious crash caused by speeding can leave children without parents, spouses without partners, and entire families grieving. Imagine the pain and suffering that your loved ones would endure if you were taken from them because of your reckless decision behind the wheel. Your family loves you and wants you to come home safely at the end of each day. They depend on you, and speeding compromises that promise.\n\nMoreover, speeding can lead to long-term disabilities for both drivers and other road users. Survivors of high-speed crashes often face permanent injuries, which can affect their ability to work, care for their families, or live independently. These injuries are not just physical; they can also have a psychological toll, leading to trauma, depression, and a diminished quality of life. The emotional and financial burden of recovery falls not only on the individual but also on their family and community.\n\nRespecting road laws and driving responsibly isnt just about following rules; its about ensuring the safety of everyone on the road. There are countless other drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists sharing the same roads as you, and their lives are just as important. Your behavior behind the wheel affects them directly. Driving carefully and within speed limits is a basic way of showing respect for the lives and safety of others. By choosing to drive responsibly, youre helping to create a safer, more considerate driving environment for everyone.\n\nWe all have a responsibility to ensure that our actions on the road do not harm others. Every life is precious, and the impact of speeding is far-reaching. It can change your life forever and leave scars on those around you. So, before you accelerate, take a moment to think about the consequences. Your loved ones, the people around you, and even strangers on the road depend on you making the right choice. Drive safely, follow the speed limits, and remember that speeding kills. Its not just a statistic  its a reality we can all prevent.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe administration of President Emmerson Mnangagwa is facing increasing pressure as it struggles to settle outstanding payments owed to pensioners.\n\nThis issue was brought to the forefront by Mbizo Constituency Member of Parliament, Honourable Corban Madzivanyika, who criticized the governments failure to meet its financial obligations to retirees.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hon. Madzivanyika highlighted the severity of the situation, calling it a serious eyesore for the country. In a statement, he called on both the Ministry of Finance and the Insurance and Pensions Commission (IPEC) to take urgent action. He said:\n\nThe plight of our pensioners is a serious eyesore! The Ministry of Finance and IPEC must urgently expedite this process instead of dodging questions. Our old men and women deserve adequate compensation that corresponds to the blameworthiness of the government and pension companies to enjoy it while the sun still shines, according to the Justice Smith Commission report of 2015.\n\nHon. Madzivanyikas comments reflect the frustrations of pensioners who have long been waiting for compensation that reflects the value of their contributions over the years. Despite repeated calls for action, both pensioners and concerned citizens continue to face delays, leaving many elderly Zimbabweans in financial distress.\n\nThe Justice Smith Commission report of 2015 recommended measures to address the pensioners issues, yet little progress has been made since its release. The MPs appeal to expedite the compensation process emphasizes the urgency of resolving the situation before it worsens.\n\nPensioners, many of whom rely on these funds for their daily survival, are left in a state of uncertainty as the government struggles with financial constraints. The failure to address this issue is exacerbating the sense of neglect felt by Zimbabwes retired citizens.\n\nAs the pressure mounts on the Mnangagwa administration, the need for swift action on pension payments becomes more critical. Without prompt intervention, pensioners are left to face a grim reality of inadequate financial support in their twilight years.\n\n",

            "content": "President Emmerson Mnangagwas $150,000 winning bonus for the Zimbabwe Warriors ahead of their FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Benin and Nigeria has sparked debate. On one hand, the generous offer is a testament to the governments commitment to national football and the teams aspirations for World Cup qualification . The bonus, which will be awarded to the players, technical team, and support staff for each victory, serves as a morale booster for the team.\n\nHowever, some might argue that this donation could be a curse in disguise. With the teams current ranking at sixth in Group C, the pressure to secure victories in both matches and claim the full $300,000 bonus might be overwhelming. This added pressure could potentially negatively impact the teams performance.\n\nAdditionally, the timing of the donation raises questions. Is this a genuine attempt to support the team, or a political move to gain popularity? The fact that this amount is in addition to the $1 million already set aside by the government for the CAF Africa Cup of Nations Finals adds to the skepticism.\n\nUltimately, only time will tell if Mnangagwas cash donation will prove to be a blessing or a curse for the Warriors.\n\n",

The artists revelations paint a picture of significant disillusionment with Angel, who he once admired.\n\nI was first inspired to pray by Uebert Angel. I used to watch his sermons. But for him to turn into someone who asks me to find slay queens was the worst thing ever, Holy Ten shared during the podcast. The rapper revealed his shock and disappointment, stating that what was once an inspiration had now turned into a source of distress.\n\nHoly Ten also recalled a disturbing incident during a visit to Angels church, where he alleges that Mudiwa Hood showed him a gun and then revealed a stash of condoms from his bag. I swear I will never go back to that church again. You can even ask my crew. Those people are not who they claim to be, he declared, expressing his deep frustration and disillusionment with the churchs leaders.\n\nThese allegations come two years after Uebert Angel was implicated in the Al Jazeera Gold Mafia documentary, which exposed illegal gold smuggling and money laundering schemes operating in Southern Africa. In the documentary, Angel was secretly recorded bragging about his ability to launder over US$1 billion, exploiting his diplomatic immunity.\n\nNeither Uebert Angel nor Mudiwa Hood has publicly responded to Holy Tens accusations, leaving the allegations to circulate without comment from the accused. Nonetheless, the artists claims have sparked a significant public debate, with many calling for further investigations into Angels activities, both within his church and in relation to the allegations of financial misconduct.\n\n",

The company also indicated that it would now be utilizing the Victoria Falls border as an alternative route.\n\nThe statement, directed at all cross-border clients, read:\n\nATT: All CROSS BORDER CLIENTSBe informed that all Likili Motors Buses from Johannesburg entry to Zambia will be using Vic Falls Border, we will avoid Chirundu Border until further notice.\n\nThe bus company further clarified that the decision was motivated by concerns over road safety. The statement highlighted that poor road conditions on the Zimbabwean side of the border posed risks to both the companys vehicles and passengers, prompting the management to find a safer route.\n\nThis is due to some bad roads on the Zimbabwean side and in order to protect property and safety of our passengers, the company added in the notice.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Likili Motors has taken proactive measures to ensure uninterrupted service for its clients while prioritizing the safety and well-being of passengers. While the company has not yet provided a timeline for the resumption of services via the Chirundu border, the current focus remains on safer alternatives for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe decision by Likili Motors underscores the growing concerns about the state of infrastructure in Zimbabwe, which has been under scrutiny for some time.\n\nRoad conditions in the country have long been a source of frustration for both local and international travelers, with poor maintenance and the wear and tear of major roads contributing to numerous accidents and delays.\n\nLikili Motors move to bypass one of Zimbabwes key borders reflects a broader issue facing the countrys transportation sector, which has been struggling to maintain the infrastructure necessary to support a growing demand for road travel.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues to grapple with these infrastructure challenges, the governments response and potential solutions remain a critical aspect of the countrys ability to retain and attract cross-border businesses like Likili Bus Company.\n\n",
