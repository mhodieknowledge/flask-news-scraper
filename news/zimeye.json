            "content": "By A Correspondent | ZimEye | Court hears Mpofu and Chimombe only supplied 3 000 goats instead of 600 000, their price for each goat ranged between US$175 and US$250\n\nFormer Agriculture ministry Permanent Secretary John Basera, Thursday took it to the stand to testify against businessmen Mike Chimombe and Moses Mpofu.\n\nThe two are accused of swindling government of US$7,9 million thriugh their companh Blackdeck after they secured a tender to supply 600 000 goats under the Presidential Goat Scheme.\n\nThe state alleges that the company was nonexistent and Basera said they were not aware that forged documents had been used.\n\nBasera told High Court judge Justice Pisirayi Kwenda that the two only managed to supply less than 3 000 goats adding that initially the price for each goat was between US$175 and US$250.\n\nAs the accounting officer going with principle of value for money I realised that US$7 million for 600 000 goats was exorbitant. Together with multiple team we discussed that even if the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe ( Praz) had made these recommendations it was not okay.\n\nI suggested that we had a meeting g to discuss the price of each goatbecause their price range was ranging between US$175 and US$250.\n\nWe engaged the supplier and reduced the prices to US$75 and US$95 per goat depending on the breed and we agreed to proceed with the deal.\n\nBasera also told court that Praz had approved Blackdeck in the bidding process.\n\nHe said all official documents were signed by Mpofu while Tinashe Chimombe witnessed.\n\nHe said Mike Chimombe did not sign any official documents.\n\nWe got a no objection letter from Praz and we signed a contract with the lowest bidder, Blackdeck.\n\nThe tender evaluation committee also stated that the company had met all the requirements, he added.\n\nBlackdeck was then given ZW$1, 9 billion which was equivalent to US$7,9 million.\n\nAfter a while they then said they had managed to secure 32 000 goats which they kept in holding pens.\n\nAccording to Basera, when officials from the Ministry went to confirm, they were shocked to find less than 3 000 goats in the holding pens.\n\nConflict then arose with the Ministry demanding restitution or going for guarantee if the company failed to supply 600 000 goats as signed for.\n\nBasera will be cross examined this Friday and more wit esses are lined up to testify.\n\n",

The impact was terrible, said Mr Emmerson Chitehwe, who witnessed the accident.\n\nThe exact number of injured individuals remains unconfirmed, and authorities have yet to release an official statement.\n\n",

My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families during this difficult time, and I wish them a swift and full recovery.\n\nThis heinous act is not an isolated incident but rather a deeply concerning symptom of a disturbing surge in criminal activities plaguing our beloved Emakhandeni-Luveve Constituency. The confidence of these gangs is increasing with each attack. This is synonymous with repeat offenders who successfully evade the arm of the law.\n\nResidents are increasingly living in fear as the safety and security of our community are being severely compromised. We have witnessed a worrying rise in violent crimes in the past months, including house break ins, theft of motor vehicles, robberies and assaults, which threaten the peace and stability that we all strive for.\n\nSuch acts of violence have no place in our society. They undermine the fabric of our community and instill a pervasive sense of insecurity. It is imperative that we address this escalating crisis with urgency and resolve.\n\nI therefore call upon the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) to significantly improve their visibility and presence within the Emakhandeni-Luveve Constituency. Increased patrols, proactive community engagement, and swift responses to reported incidents are crucial steps to deter criminals and restore public confidence. Our citizens deserve to feel safe in their homes and on our streets.\n\nI further urge all residents to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activities to the police immediately. Community cooperation has proven to be vital in our collective efforts to combat crime and ensure the safety of our neighborhoods.\n\nAs your elected representative, I am committed to working closely with law enforcement agencies, neighborhood watch committees, community leaders, and residents to develop sustainable solutions to this pressing issue. To that end, I will be convening an all stakeholders conference on crime in the next few weeks. We must collectively ensure that Emakhandeni-Luveve remains a safe and prosperous community for all.\n\n",

            "content": "Sports Correspondent\n\nHarare, Zimbabwe  Zimbabwean football giants Dynamos have been hit with a major setback after FIFA imposed a ban preventing the club from registering new players.\n\nThe sanction comes as a result of the clubs failure to settle outstanding debts owed to two former players, Ghanaian duo Emmanuel Paga and Fredrick Ansa-Botchway.\n\nAccording to sources close to the situation, Paga is owed US$8,500 while Ansa-Botchway is due US$10,000, bringing the total debt to US$18,500. FIFAs ruling now puts the Harare-based club in a difficult position, particularly as they attempt to rebuild during the mid-season window.\n\nThe ban will remain in place until Dynamos have fully paid both players. FIFAs disciplinary action underscores the governing bodys firm stance on financial accountability and player welfare.\n\nDynamos, once a dominant force in Zimbabwean football, have struggled in recent seasons both on and off the pitch. This latest development further dampens the clubs hopes of reclaiming former glory, as they will be unable to bolster their squad ahead of the crucial second half of the season.\n\nHowever, insiders suggest that the club is working to resolve the issue as swiftly as possible to avoid long-term repercussions.\n\nFIFA has increasingly taken a tough approach with clubs that default on player payments, with several teams across Africa facing similar sanctions in recent years.\n\nFans and football analysts alike will be watching closely to see how the Glamour Boys respond to this latest crisis and whether they can navigate the remainder of the season with their current squad.\n\n",

Mdlalose, the council informed the business located at 4 Sandalwood Crescent, Baobab Hill, that payment was required in accordance with Hwange Local Board by-laws and the Urban Councils Act (Chapter 29:15), specifically Sections 269 to 272.\n\nWe wish to inform you that an annual tariff of USD 80.50, inclusive of Value Added Tax, is due for the operation of a snooker table at your premises, reads the letter.\n\nFailure to comply by the set deadline of May 30, 2025, would result in immediate enforcement action.\n\nPlease be advised that failure to make this payment by Monday, 30 May 2025, will leave Council with no option but to prohibit the continued operation of the snooker table(s).\n\nThe move has stirred outrage among small business operators, who say the council is targeting harmless entertainment amenities to raise revenue in a crumbling economy.\n\nThis is getting ridiculous, said one Hwange entrepreneur who runs a bottle store and spoke on condition of anonymity. We pay for licenses, we pay ZIMRA, we pay EMA, and now we have to pay to let someone play a game of snooker? Whats next, a dartboard tax?\n\nAnother small business owner expressed frustration over what they described as a punitive system.\n\nThey should be encouraging small businesses, not bleeding us dry. A snooker table doesnt make that kind of money, he said. This is just another way of milking struggling operators.\n\nSocial commentators say the move reflects a broader national trend, where local authorities are introducing unconventional fees in an attempt to stay afloat.\n\nZimbabwe is slowly becoming a tax country, said one observer.\n\nThe tax regime has reached alarming levels, and its now encroaching into leisure and low-income entertainment.\n\nLocal authorities have been increasingly criticized for targeting informal and micro-level operators rather than addressing corporate compliance or service delivery gaps.\n\nAs the deadline looms, it remains to be seen whether operators will comply or push back against what many now call the snooker tax.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nOpposition leader Advocate Nelson Chamisa has fiercely criticised President Emmerson Mnangagwas newly launched media policy, dismissing it as ineffective and misleading. Speaking in a statement released on Thursday, Chamisa described the policy unveiled in Harare the previous day as a damp squib.\n\nThe recently launched media policy by the Zanu PF administration is yet another hollow gesture, Chamisa said. Lets be clear: the real crisis in Zimbabwes media sector is not a lack of policy, but the continued criminalisation of journalism. No amount of lipstick will beautify a frog.\n\nAccording to Chamisa, instead of creating space for innovation and media freedom, the policy serves to consolidate government control. True reform would have meant breaking the monopoly, not entrenching it; promoting local investment, not stifling it, he said.\n\nHe further argued that a genuine media policy would focus on empowering journalists and ensuring their protection. A real media policy would empower journalists, not threaten them with deregistration under vague rules and standards designed to muzzle dissent, Chamisa stated. It would promote self-regulation, as we see in other respected professions.\n\nChamisa also took aim at the state-run broadcasters, ZBC and Zimpapers, saying they remain mouthpieces of propaganda rather than platforms for public service. It would transform ZBC and Zimpapers into genuine public service platforms, not echo chambers of outdated propaganda.\n\nThe opposition leader was equally critical of the proposed Media Fund, warning it could further strain an already struggling media industry. The so-called proposed Media Fund will burden struggling media houses even further, he said. Our journalists, including those in public media, are earning peanuts, not because of poor work ethic, but because of collapsing revenues aided by a hostile environment.\n\nChamisa accused the government of offering cosmetic changes that fail to address deeper issues. This policy offers no meaningful support for retooling in the digital age. Its not a new dispensation, its a new deception.\n\nCalling for sweeping reforms, Chamisa concluded: We need a complete overhaul. It is time to decriminalise journalism, dismantle media capture, and enable Zimbabwes media to thrive as a job-creating, economy-boosting industry. For the people. For the country. For God. Forever and always.\n\n",
