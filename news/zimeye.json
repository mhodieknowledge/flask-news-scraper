            "content": "By Business Reporter-In a move that reflects both desperation and determination, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has announced plans to introduce a new series of higher-quality ZiG (Zimbabwe Gold) banknotes in denominations of ZiG10, ZiG20, ZiG50, ZiG100, and ZiG200.\n\nRBZ Governor Dr. John Mushayavanhu said the rollout will be gradual and based on market demand.\n\nThe process of procuring and producing banknotes, however, can be lengthy, and the Reserve Bank will keep the public updated on the progress, Mushayavanhu said during a press briefing.\n\nThis latest development comes just months after the RBZ introduced the ZiG in April 2024, a gold-backed currency meant to replace the much-maligned Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL) and restore stability in a country plagued by over two decades of currency and economic turmoil.\n\nZimbabwes currency instability is deeply rooted in a history of poor economic management, political interference in monetary policy, and a chronic lack of confidence in the financial system.\n\nThe first major crack appeared in the early 2000s following the controversial fast-track land reform programme, which triggered capital flight, agricultural collapse, and a sharp decline in foreign currency inflows.\n\nHyperinflation spiraled out of control in the years that followed, culminating in the 2008 economic meltdown, where inflation reached an astronomical 89.7 sextillion percent.\n\nThe Zimbabwean dollar became worthless, forcing the government to abandon it in 2009 and adopt a multi-currency system dominated by the US dollar.\n\nDespite the relative stability the multi-currency regime brought, government insistence on reviving a local currency saw the reintroduction of the Zimbabwean dollar in 2019  a move that was met with deep skepticism.\n\nSince then, the country has experienced multiple currency iterations: bond notes, RTGS dollars, and now the ZiG  all of which have struggled to gain public trust.\n\nCurrently, only ZiG10 and ZiG20 notes are in circulation, but they are in short supply and rapidly deteriorating due to poor quality.\n\nThe RBZs decision to issue more durable notes in higher denominations is a recognition of the shortcomings of the initial rollout.\n\nIt also reveals a tacit acknowledgment that deeper systemic issues remain unresolved.\n\nIn addition to printing new notes, the government is pursuing measures to boost ZiG usage, particularly in the informal sector.\n\nThese include mandating point-of-sale (POS) machines for all businesses and requiring a portion of tax payments to be made in local currency.\n\nWhile such measures may increase transactional demand for ZiG, economists argue that they amount to coercion rather than confidence-building. Without addressing underlying issues  such as fiscal indiscipline, corruption, and lack of production  these interventions are unlikely to yield sustainable results.\n\nHistory has shown that no currency  regardless of how it is backed or branded  can succeed in the absence of robust economic fundamentals. What Zimbabwe needs is not just new notes, but a comprehensive policy framework that fosters investor confidence, ensures monetary independence, promotes industrial productivity, and respects property rights.\n\nEconomic stability is not achieved through currency rebranding but through credible leadership, policy consistency, and institutional reform. Until these fundamentals are addressed, the new ZiG notes may simply follow the fate of their predecessors: born with fanfare, and buried by inflation.\n\n",

It was their second appearance in the final since 2001, while Pyramids celebrated their first-ever CAF Champions League triumph.\n\nSpeaking on SABC3, Khumalo stressed the importance of unity and discouraged the blame game, choosing instead to commend Sundowns for their effort and fighting spirit.\n\nI dont think its right to point fingers, Khumalo said. We win together, we lose together. Credit must go to Sundownsthey showed great character in the final 30 minutes. Had they started the game that way, it might have been a different story.\n\nHe also highlighted the impact of the substitutes, noting how they injected energy and shifted the momentum, even as questions lingered about key players like Themba Zwane.\n\nYes, I understand people were hoping for Mshishi [Zwane], but he hasnt played in a while. Still, Sundowns stuck to their identitycombinational play, possession-based football. They created several chances and gave it everything.\n\nKhumalo concluded by expressing pride in the entire Sundowns team, saying they carried the South African flag with honor.\n\nThey gave their all, from the players on the pitch to those on the bench and in the traveling squad. Sundowns represented South African football with pride.\n\n",

Dynamos responded with a sixth-minute header from Frank Agyemang, but the effort lacked power and was comfortably dealt with by Highlanders goalkeeper Raphael Pitisi.\n\nDespite their early dominance, Highlanders couldnt break through Dynamos defense, with goalkeeper Prince Tafiremutsa making a string of crucial saves to keep the hosts in the game. Dynamos looked dangerous on the counter but lacked composure in the final third.\n\nThe second half followed a similar pattern, with Highlanders applying consistent pressure but failing to convert chances.\n\nThe match ended 0-0, leaving Dynamos stuck in 16th place in the relegation zone, while Highlanders edged up to ninth on the table.\n\n",

We celebrate every inch towards the development of Zimbabwe. This will go a long way in reducing traffic congestion to road users.\n\nHis remarks have drawn criticism from both opposition supporters and civil society groups, who argue that the celebration of such a project glosses over serious allegations of mismanagement and financial abuse. Investigations and media reports have pointed to the looting of millions of dollars during the construction process, with procurement irregularities and questionable contracts at the center of the controversy.\n\nTshabangu, however, appeared unfazed by the corruption claims. The politics of bitterness does not build roads, he reportedly said in a follow-up conversation with local journalists. Lets be constructive in our criticism. If something is working, we must acknowledge it.\n\nThis stance has added to Tshabangus reputation as a divisive figure within the CCC, with some accusing him of aligning too closely with the ruling ZANU-PF agenda. Critics say his praise for the interchange, in light of its tainted financial record, undermines the role of the opposition in holding the government accountable.\n\nThe Mbudzi Interchangerenamed the Trabablas Interchange was touted as a flagship infrastructure project aimed at easing chronic congestion in southern Harare.\n\nHowever, its development has been overshadowed by allegations of inflated pricing, lack of transparency, and elite enrichment.\n\nDespite these concerns, Tshabangu insists the end result merits recognition. This is not about politics. Its about progress. Lets appreciate development when we see it, he said.\n\nWhether his message resonates with the wider publicor further isolates him within his partyremains to be seen.\n\n",

His comments, while sometimes dismissed by party loyalists, often reflect public sentiment.\n\nAs the government seeks to plug fiscal deficits, citizens have been hit with an increasing number of levies, many of which have not translated into meaningful public service improvements.

Its time, as the legislature, that we pass breed-specific legislation which restricts and bans certain dog breeds.\n\nMamombe described the fatal attack as both tragic and avoidable, calling it a wake-up call for lawmakers and enforcement agencies alike.

Despite repeated complaints from residents, no preventive action was taken.\n\nLocal watchdog Crime Watch Zimbabwe confirmed the mans body remained near the scene of the attack for several hours, highlighting the severity and suddenness of the incident.\n\nThe dog was seen roaming the street without any restraint, the watchdog said.\n\nResidents in Bluffhill say their warnings were ignored.

The Chitando family has shown what it means to give back meaningfully. I encourage more families and individuals to invest in their communities this way.\n\nThe church complex has already sparked conversation locally, with many praising the initiative as a positive contribution to the communitys spiritual and social development. However, some have raised questions about whether such projects, especially by political figures, are purely philanthropic or strategically aimed at solidifying political influence ahead of future elections.\n\nStill, for the Gonye congregation, the church is a welcome gift. This is a blessing for us, said one elder from the church. Weve prayed for this kind of infrastructure for years, and now its here. We are grateful.\n\nWhat do you think about the project?

            "content": "By Tinashe Sambiri\n\nHARARE  Opposition leader Advocate Nelson Chamisa has raised alarm over Zimbabwes worsening education crisis, expressing deep concern over the sharp rise in school dropouts and declining learning standards across the country.\n\nIn a passionate statement released Monday, Chamisa said he was heartbroken by the number of Zimbabwean families struggling to keep their children in school. According to official statistics, nearly 50,000 students dropped out of school in 2024 alone.\n\nPeople of Zimbabwe, my heart is burdened when I hear many of you tell me that you can no longer afford to send your children to school, Chamisa said. The latest statistics show a shockingly high number of 49,555 school dropouts in 2024.\n\nDespite the government allocating 17.7% of the national budget to education for the 202425 fiscal year, Chamisa argued that it still falls short of international benchmarks and fails to address the urgent needs of the sector.\n\nOur education needs urgent attention. Its such a pain point, he stated. Despite allocating 17.7% of the national budget to education in the 202425 budget, funding remains below the 20% benchmark agreed upon under the Dakar Framework for Action.\n\nChamisa, who has consistently positioned education as a central pillar of his political vision, promised sweeping reforms under what he termed The New Plan, aimed at transforming Zimbabwe into a global leader in education.\n\nWe will build a great education nation, he said. A time is coming when education will no longer be only for those who can pay for it. A time is coming when Zimbabwe will be renowned as an education nationwe will educate the world.\n\nHe also painted a hopeful picture for Zimbabwes future, emphasizing that young people from all walks of life must be empowered to dream and achieve.\n\nA time is coming when our children from all backgrounds, and every corner of Zimbabwe, will be filled with hope again. A time is coming when our young people will dream dreams and be empowered to live out those dreams in their lifetimes, Chamisa said. Education, and not corruption, will produce admirable and honourable role models worth emulating.\n\nUsing the hashtags #TimeIsComing, #TheNewPlan, and #ImaginationMonday, Chamisas message struck a chord online, reigniting debate about government priorities and the long-term future of Zimbabwes education system.\n\nThe Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education has yet to respond to the opposition leaders remarks.
