The fiscal, monetary, regulatory, and statutory frameworks have created an uneven playing field. While formal businesses crumble, the informal sector thrives unchecked, eroding market share.\n\nCZR has called on President Emmerson Mnangagwa to address these challenges and stabilize the sector urgently.\n\nThe closures evoke memories of the 2008 hyperinflation crisis when businesses shut down en masse due to the collapse of the Zimbabwean dollar.\n\nWith skyrocketing operational costs and dwindling consumer purchasing power, Zimbabwe risks repeating history if urgent measuresare not takento protect the formal economy.\n\nNRichardsdecision to close two outlets adds to a growing list of casualties in thecountrysretail sector, reflecting the worsening state of the economy and raising questions about the future of formal businessesin the country.\n\n",

I challenge you to a clash anytime, anywhere. If youre afraid of a clash, we can do a show with different sets and let the audience decide. If you win, Ill know youre still Bigman, as you were before. The proceeds should go to charityhelping the less fortunate, including the blind, the disabled, street kids, and all those suffering.\n\nRemember back when Daddy D, Badman, and Sniper gave you your first clashes? You were just starting out, but now its your time. Lets face off on stage and let the people decide.\n\nWinky D has been avoiding diss tracks for years, but at least Mambo gave him a chance to respond quickly. Now lets throw another track into the speakers and see what happens!\n\nTo Mbare, the bands, and the people of Zimbabwethank you for showing the world that were not violent. Some tried to paint us as troublemakers, but Mbare proved that we are free and peaceful. And to those who have been critical, including those who have been handed cars by Sir Wicknell, its all rooted in jealousy and bad mind. If it were Mapfumo, I would understand, but Sir Wicknell? Keep doing your thing!\n\nAs for the complaints about being sabotaged or excluded from showslet me remind you. For 12 years, Ive been blocked from over 50 shows, and thats just the beginning of the story. Yet, we keep pushing through. You all talk about how we should behave, but who are you to decide whats good for us?\n\nThe SWAN show was proof that we are not trying to tear anyone down. If Winky D is on the poster, theyll remove me, and thats how toxic things have become. Its clear that there are forces at play that want to stop us from succeeding.\n\nBut the truth is, even the organizers of Swan Showwho came to introduce Fodya at Mbare, our home groundfelt threatened. They were afraid to face the reality of the situation, but thats the nature of business. People with money dont have the time to listen to their fans and supporters. Its a harsh world.\n\nThank you for reading, Bhangwela Famous Paragraph!!! Yes, youve read it all .\n\nFor all the real entertainment and Dancehall music lovers!!!\n\n",

This comes after a group of church leaders released a joint statement urging President Mnangagwa to respect the countrys constitution and refrain from extending his rule beyond 2028.\n\nKandishayas response, posted on Facebook, cautioned church leaders not to interfere, stating that they must understand their boundaries. His message was widely interpreted as a direct threat to those opposing the Presidents third-term bid.\n\nThis warning has sparked significant controversy, with critics arguing that it reflects the increasing political pressure on religious organizations in Zimbabwe. The churchs involvement in politics has long been a sensitive issue, with many fearing government intimidation to silence opposition.\n\nAs the debate surrounding Mnangagwas future grows, Kandishayas statement signals escalating tensions between the ruling party and those holding it accountable to the constitution.\n\n",
