            "content": "$88 Million Bait-and-Switch: What Would You Ask Obey Chimuka About the Trabablas Interchange?\n\nBy Farai D Hove | ZimEye | | Harare | 30 May 2025\n\nMr. Chimuka, where did the dream go?Thats the first question many Zimbabweans would fire at Obey Chimuka  the man behind the now-controversial Trabablas Interchange  as the nation finally comes face-to-face with what was promised in 2021, and what was actually delivered in 2025.\n\nThe billboard vision shared in public presentations and glossy architectural renders painted a picture of Zimbabwes entry into first-world infrastructure: a grand, multi-tiered, landscaped marvel of civil engineering, with seamless traffic flow, lush greenery, and global-standard signage. What has emerged instead is a dry, brittle, underconnected structure marred by patchy work, unmarked roads, wooden signage poles, and not even a single sign pointing toward Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport, the countrys most critical economic hub.\n\nThe Man at the Centre: Obey Chimuka\n\nObey Chimuka, a politically connected businessman and frontman for Fossil Contracting, part of the TEFOMA consortium awarded the $88 million tender without public bidding, is now at the center of growing public outrage. With images now circulating comparing his 2021 digital proposal to the visibly incomplete 2025 reality, the social media verdict is swift: Chimuka over-promised and massively under-delivered.\n\nFrom bold promises of a cutting-edge interchange to a visibly basic, unfinished slab of cement  the dissonance could not be more stark. Citizens are asking whether this was an intentional bait-and-switch or a catastrophic example of inflated costs and zero accountability.\n\nPublic Reaction: Mockery and Anger\n\nOn Friday morning, Twitter erupted with memes and outrage. One widely shared image captioned, PROMISED THIS (2021)  DELIVERED THIS (2025) showed Chimuka beaming beside the artists impression of the interchange, juxtaposed with the current state  a scattered, disjointed road system that lacks proper markings, signage, drainage, or even landscaping.\n\nIts not even half of what was advertised, said a civil engineer on condition of anonymity. This is not an engineering masterpiece; its a rushed, compromised structure. At best, its serviceable. At worst, its an $88 million case study in political fraud.\n\nAccountability or Impunity?\n\nThe most haunting element in the publics mind is that no official audit has yet been published, and no performance penalty appears to exist for failing to meet such a clearly advertised standard.\n\nIn Parliament last week, Senator Sengezo Tshabangu put it bluntly:\n\nWhat makes our road construction so expensive in the region, yet we use the same material?\n\nMinister of Transport Felix Mhona gave no technical defense, instead pointing to sanctions  a response many lawmakers called evasive and irrelevant.\n\nThe Bigger Picture: Public Trust Eroding\n\nThe Trabablas Interchange fiasco is not merely about aesthetics  its about a national breach of trust. Where are the promised quality checks? Where is the landscaping that was part of the original model? Why are international best practices being ignored in favor of speed and political optics? Who benefited from the $88 million?\n\nThe Question That Wont Go Away\n\nSo if you were face-to-face with Obey Chimuka today, what would you say?\n\nPerhaps the most fitting question is this:\n\nSir, if this is what $88 million looks like under your watch  how much would a proper interchange actually cost?\n\nAnd more critically:\n\nWhat does this say about Zimbabwes future when the present is built on such deception?\n\nAs the ribbon is cut and officials celebrate, the nation remains unconvinced. The people are not asking for miracles  just delivery that matches the promise. For now, the Trabablas Interchange stands as a concrete monument to what Zimbabwe could have been, but never quite becomes.- ZimEye\n\n",

            "content": "By Parliamentary Reporter A Member of Parliament was shot with a pellet gun and brutally assaulted last week in the car park of a Harare hotel after being accused of having an affair with a married woman.\n\nThe dramatic incident unfolded when Wilson Makondesa (38), a manager at a local panel-beating company, confronted the legislator while he was speaking to Rejoice Govera (37), Makondesas estranged wife.\n\nThe name of the legislator has not been released. Sources say the attack was sparked by suspicions that he was romantically involved with Govera, who separated from Makondesa in February 2024.\n\nAccording to Govera, Makondesa has been stalking her ever since she left their matrimonial home, using a vehicle tracking device to monitor her movements. She claims he has been living with another woman since their separation, yet continues to harass her, violating a peace order that was granted by the courts.\n\nWilson has never accepted our separation, said Govera. He tracks my car, follows me, and assumes every man I speak to is my lover. Ive had to move houses multiple times to escape his abuse.\n\nShe recounted the events of the hotel incident: Last week, he followed me to a hotel after tracking my vehicle. I was talking to the MP in the car park when he arrived, pulled out a pellet gun, fired at him, and then physically assaulted him. He didnt even stop to ask what was going on.\n\nGovera described her marriage to Makondesa as rushed and regrettable.\n\nI lost peace the day I married him, she said. After the end of my first marriage, I was vulnerable. Wilson had also divorced and quickly paid lobola within two weeks of dating me. I now believe it was a cover-up for his abusive behaviour. This marriage has been a nightmare.\n\nMakondesa admitted to confronting and assaulting the MP.\n\nI tracked the car and went to the hotel, he said. Security told me she had left the vehicle with someone, and when they returned, I approached. I didnt find them in a compromising position, but I was jealous and suspected the worst. I got closer intending to record them, but Rejoice spotted me. I blocked their car and physically confronted the man. I wont lie  I beat him up zvakasimba (severely).\n\nHe added: Rejoice and I are legally married, even though we no longer live together. Weve had differences that led her to move out, but I still consider her my wife.\n\nThe incident has since sparked concern over the safety and privacy of public officials and raised fresh questions about intimate partner violence and stalking.\n\nPolice are yet to confirm whether formal charges have been laid.\n\n",

A towering figure in both education and traditional leadership, Chief Nemashakwe passed away at Mvuma Hospital in Mashonaland Central on May 14, 2025, and was laid to rest at Chirikure Village in Nemashakwe on May 18.\n\nChirikures death was confirmed by his eldest son, Chirikure Chirikure, a prominent author and poet, who said the late chief had lived a life of service, commitment, and humility. Chief Nemashakwe is survived by his wife Swodesai Chinikure, 7 children (4 boys and 3 girls), 22 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.\n\nBorn in Mushayavanhu in Gutu, Chirikure came from humble beginnings. After losing his father at an early age, he worked as a herd boy to raise money for his school fees. He began his education at Silveria Mission and completed Standard 6 in 1944. He later enrolled at Gokomere Government School in 1947 and qualified as a teacher at Waddilove in 1951.\n\nChirikure began his teaching career in 1945 and served in various schools including Chitsa Primary and Chamburuka before being transferred to Domborembizi in 1974 and later to Vhunjere. His commitment to education saw him rise through the ranks until he retired in 1992.\n\nAt independence, Chirikure played a significant role in the local education sector by helping to found Vhunjere Primary and Nemashakwe Secondary School. He was installed as Chief Nemashakwe in 2009 and became substantive chief in 2022. He was of the Gumbo totem.\n\nA devout family man and firm believer in education, Chief Nemashakwe married in 1960. He raised his family while working to uplift his community through both education and traditional leadership. Known for his wisdom, humility, and discipline, he looked after 23 children including his seven biological children.\n\nChief Nemashakwes legacy is one of resilience, sacrifice, and community development. He is fondly remembered for shaping the futures of many young people in Gutu and beyond through his long and impactful career in education.\n\n",

Were currently expanding to high schools so that learners can easily access educational content and online resources.\n\nAccording to Gonese, the response has been overwhelming, especially from high school and tertiary students who are now flocking to these areas to take advantage of the free connection.\n\nStudents are walking long distancesfrom places like Rineshangajust to get online and work on school projects. This shows how badly this kind of support was needed, he noted.\n\nHe added that university and college students on holiday are among the biggest beneficiaries, with many using the service to conduct academic research and work on dissertations.\n\nBut the impact goes beyond the classroom. Civil servants, including nurses and teachers, now enjoy steady access to internet services without having to spend on mobile data bundles.\n\nWeve had feedback from health workers at Chimombe Hospital and officers at Basera Police Station who say the Wi-Fi has helped improve communication and access to critical information, Gonese said. This isnt just about schoolchildren. Its about empowering the whole community.\n\nThe initiative is being hailed as a game-changer in rural digital transformation, with Gonese emphasizing that universal connectivity is essential for development.\n\nThis is about giving people the tools to thrive in a modern economy, he explained. Access to the internet shouldnt be a luxuryit should be a right.\n\nAs the June 14 2025 by-election approaches, Goneses tech-driven campaign is setting a new tone in rural constituencies, where digital infrastructure is often overlooked.\n\n",
