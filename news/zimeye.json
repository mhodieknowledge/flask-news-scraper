Their contributions solidified their place as one of the most influential musical groups of that era.\n\nBefore his rise to stardom, Allan began his career by working as a bouncer at his brother Simons shows, often serving as the doorman.\n\nThis role, he recalls, played a significant part in his development: That experience helped me a lot. I even earned a black belt in karate!\n\nAllans musical journey took a turn when he was eventually invited to join the band, where his skills as a lead and rhythm guitarist quickly became evident.\n\nHis guitar work became a defining feature of their sound, with hits like Usaende pa Barika, Ndaremerwa, Newspaper, Pane Asipo, Window, and Tenda highlighting his talent.\n\nFollowing the untimely death of his brother Simon, Allan assumed leadership of the Dendera Kings band.\n\nFor a time, he successfully led the group, but tensions arose when an altercation occurred between him and Suluman Chimbetu, Simons son. As a result, Allan was ousted from the band.\n\nUndeterred, Allan decided to forge his own path and formed his own band, Orchestra Dendera Kings Central Committee. He continued to release music, with notable albums such as Sony, Professor, and Simukai.\n\nAs he prepares to debut his new project in 2025, Allan Chimbetu is determined to leave a lasting impact with his message of unity and support.\n\n",

The diseases appear to be less severe and spread on a smaller scale than last year.\n\nWhat is HMPV?\n\nHuman metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a respiratory infection that resembles the symptoms of a cold or flu. While most cases are mild, the virus can lead to serious complications like pneumonia, especially in young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.\n\n",
