Mliswa, who was recently disqualified from the ZIFA presidential elections, claimed that powerful cartels are using the ZIFA elections as a platform to advance their own interests.\n\nMliswa stated, Its unfortunate that the ZIFA elections have become an arena for cartels to flex their power and influence, redirecting the course of Zimbabwean football for their own benefit.\n\nWhile acknowledging Tagwireis success as a businessman and his potential to be a great sponsor for local teams, Mliswa accused him of misusing his power to manipulate the football sector.\n\nKuda has been an astute businessman and could be a great sponsor, funding and supporting local teams, Mliswa continued. However, he has abused that power to try and influence the entire football sector, using proxies like Magwizi and his company, Sakunda.\n\nMliswa warned that this kind of influence sets a dangerous precedent that could harm the long-term development of Zimbabwean football. He pointed out that while Delta has been involved in local football for years, they have never tried to manipulate the sport for their own private interests or supported specific candidates for office.\n\nKuda Tagwirei is my mzukuru and I will always speak frankly with him, Mliswa added.\n\nThis approach is wrong. It would be more prudent and beneficial if he focused on sponsoring the sport. However, this sudden involvement in corporate social work appears to be aimed at supporting a specific candidate.\n\n",

            "content": "Driving requires more than just the physical ability to operate a vehicle; it demands total concentration and a sense of calm. How you feel behind the wheel can significantly impact your safety and that of others on the road. Whether youre feeling relaxed, anxious, or hot-tempered, your emotions affect your judgment, reaction times, and overall driving behavior.\n\nIts essential to recognize the profound influence emotions have on your driving and actively work to control them. Emotional reactions can alter your decision-making process, leading to dangerous maneuvers or poor judgment. For example, anxiety might cause you to overreact or hesitate, while anger could lead to aggressive driving and reckless behavior. Stress can cloud your focus, increasing the likelihood of mistakes.\n\nThe key to maintaining safety on the road lies in emotional regulation. Regardless of the emotional state youre in, never allow your feelings to dictate your actions behind the wheel. Losing control can lead to dangerous situations, not only putting yourself and your passengers at risk but also endangering other drivers and pedestrians.\n\nHere are a few strategies for managing emotions while driving:\n\nBy recognizing the link between emotions and driving behavior, and by taking steps to manage your stress, you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents. Remember, driving is a responsibility that requires a clear mind and a calm demeanor. Never let emotions take the wheel.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

Hunger is a pressing issue, but they remain hopeful that a full Mupfure flood will bring better catches.\n\nUnfortunately, it was a no-catch day for me, but it is through conversations like these, hearing their stories of resilience, that I find inspiration and a deeper understanding of their daily struggles.\n\n",
