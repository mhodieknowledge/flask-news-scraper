According to Musk, this is the real reason why the documents have not been fully released to the public.\n\nTime to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT! Musk posted on X. He followed up with, Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.\n\nThese statements came shortly after reports surfaced that President Trump allegedly threatened to cancel Elon Musks U.S. government contracts, escalating what had previously been a simmering feud into a full-blown public and political confrontation.\n\nIn a highlighted repost from political commentator Ian Miles Cheong, Musk responded with a blunt Yes when Cheong posed the question of who would win in a clash between the President and the billionaire. The thread went even further, with Cheong suggesting Trump should be impeached and replaced by Senator JD Vance  a sentiment Musk did not oppose.\n\nMusks comments are gaining massive traction online, with millions of views and tens of thousands of interactions within hours. If verified, the claim about Trump being named in the Epstein documents could have profound implications for the presidency and ongoing investigations into Epsteins extensive web of influence.\n\nAt the time of reporting, neither the White House nor Donald Trump has issued an official response to Musks accusations.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\n",

            "content": "South AfricaPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa could be the biggest loser following the deathin South Africaof Zambias former President Edgar Chagwa Lungu.\n\nLungu, a close ally of Mnangagwas ruling Zanu PF party and a prominent figure in the network of former liberation movements in Southern Africa, early Thursday, at the age of 68.\n\nHis party, the Patriotic Front (PF), confirmed a statement released late Thursday saying Lungu had been receiving specialized treatment in South Africa for an undisclosed illness. The party mourned the passing of a manitdescribed as a statesman, patriotandservant of the people.\n\nLungu served as Zambias sixth president from 2015 to 2021, after assuming office following the death of Michael Sata.\n\nHe presided over a turbulent period marked by rising debt, an economic downturn, and growing authoritarian tendencies, including a crackdown on dissent and independent media.\n\nDespite these challenges, he remainedareveredfigureamong fellow regional leaders, especially those within the former liberation movements.\n\nHis close relationship with Zimbabwes President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the broader Zanu PF elite was no secret.\n\nHe often expressed admiration for Zimbabwes revolutionary resilienceand maintainedwarm ties with the Southern African Development Community (SADC)s regional bloc of former liberation movements  including South Africas ANC, Mozambiques Frelimo, and Namibias Swapo.\n\nDuring his presidency, Lunguwas a consistent voice in support ofMnangagwa, both during and after the 2017 coup that ousted long-time Zimbabwean ruler Robert Mugabe.\n\nLungu was one of the first leaders to endorse Mnangagwas legitimacy and was seen as a regional bulwark against Western criticism of Zanu PFs human rights abuses and disputed electoral processes.\n\nButLungus own rule was marred by accusations of authoritarianism.\n\nHe oversaw the arrest of opposition figures, the militarization of state institutions, and controversial constitutional amendments aimed at extending his grip on power.\n\nHis 2021 re-election bid was marked by growing public dissatisfaction, culminating in a decisive loss to opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema.\n\nOn the eve of the 2021 election results announcement, Lungu infamously shut down the internet  a move widely condemned by rights groups.\n\nHis final public call as president, was on 13 August 2021,  in a conversation withZimEyewhich urged him to avoid plunging the country into post-election violence.\n\nAfter conceding defeat, Lungu briefly stepped back from politics but re-emerged in late 2023 with subtle hints of a political comeback  sparking tensions within the PF and fears of renewed political instability.\n\nThough controversial at home, Lungu continued to enjoy a degree of respect among former liberation movement leaders.\n\nHis passing is felt deeply within that political fraternity, particularly in Harare, where Mnangagwa regarded him asbotha comrade and regional ally.\n\nLungu is survived by his wife Esther and their children. Details of his funeral arrangements are yet to be announced.\n\n",

He is a science lecturer and teacher with refugee status and leave to remain in the UK.\n\nHe is a prominent political opponent of the rulingZANU-PF regime, drawing attention to human rights abuses and corruption within the Zimbabwean government.He is a family man of good character and has lived and workedin the UK peacefully.\n\nHis daughter suffers from a mental health illness that requires 24-hour support, and the stress of Williams legal battle has taken a severe toll on his family for over four years.\n\nEarlier this week, Chinyanga, a Zimbabwean national based in the United Kingdom, wrote a letter raising alarm that he is not safe if deported from the UK.\n\nHe was convicted on false charges of inciting terrorism after his solicitor, Madeleine Corrwho was slammed by a judge for riding two horsesblocked his key witnesses and followed the opinion of name-change scammer Hopewell Chinono. Chinono also compromised the career of Williams cousin, Hon. Job Sikhala.\n\nBelow is his address to Zimbabweans and the world, issued on03 June 2025:\n\nFull Text:\n\nDear Zimbabweans,\n\nMy life is in danger. Please help me.\n\nI have been denied release from prisonon the grounds thatI am still a danger to ZANU-PF.\n\n(i) The reason I appealed against the conviction: In the background, I lost my appeal because the prison security and police withheld my appeal documentsincluding witness statementsthat had beenrequested by the appeal judge.Without these, the judge made a decision.\n\nIt was my democratic right to appeal; it is not a crime. The system wanted to blackmail me into admitting I am a terrorist, which I am not.\n\n(ii) The prison enrolled me in a programming course about extremism called ERG, in the form of HII, which I completed 90%. I fell into depression during the process when the police and prison security confiscated my letters to the lawyer and the Home Officeletters that explained why I should not be deported.\n\n(To me, deportation means execution by the ZANU-PF government.)\n\nBecause of this, the plan by the police and prison security worked, and now they say I will not be released because I did not complete HII. (Despite the fact thatI was actively participating until the same people disrupted me, giving them a reason to justify keeping me in prison.)\n\nACTION REQUESTED:\n\ni)I want you tofind a criminal lawyer to sue the prison security on my behalf.\n\nii)I want you toapproach the Prime Minister as a delegation to stop my deportation and challenge the illegal imprisonment I am being subjected to.\n\nNote:ZANU-PF isoperatingin the background with the UK government on lithium and diamond deals.Mnangagwa now has free access to Britain, despite the human rights abuses he has committed in Zimbabwe.\n\nChinyanga\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/stop-illegal-deportation-of-william-chinyanga-to-zimbabwe\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/stop-illegal-deportation-of-william-chinyanga-to-zimbabwe\n\n",

At the time, Ossie Shone, a supervisor at Miniyothabos shop, had just finished his shift and departed without securing the premises properly, taking the keys with him.\n\nThat same afternoon, Mukaro broke through the front glass display, creating a hole large enough for him to enter the shop. Once inside, he stole cellphones worth US$16,915 before making his escape.\n\nOn June 3, 2023, police detectives received a tip-off regarding stolen cellphones being sold at Ximex Mall. They were able to recover some of the stolen phones from an individual named Blesses Luciano, who revealed that he had purchased the devices from Isaac Craig Chaza on June 1.\n\nDetectives successfully retrieved additional stolen cellphones from Chaza by posing as potential buyers. Chaza and an accomplice, Steve Makangira, then led the detectives to Mukaro, who was arrested alongside his brother Jason Moyo. Mukaro was found in possession of more stolen cellphones.\n\nFurther investigations at Mukaros residence in Domboshawa yielded more stolen property, and his fingerprints were found to match those collected at the crime scene.-ZimEye\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has projected that annual ZiG inflation will decline to below 30% by December 2025, despite current year-on-year figures showing a sharp rise. The central bank remains confident that tight monetary policies and economic reforms will stabilize prices and strengthen the local currency.\n\nIn a press statement issued on 4 June 2025, the RBZ attributed the current spike in annual inflationwhich rose to 92.1% in May, up from 85.7% in Aprilto what it described as a once-off base effect resulting from a price shock that occurred between September and October 2024, when month-on-month inflation soared from 5.8% to 37.2%.\n\nThe sharp rise in year-on-year ZiG inflation to 92.1% in May 2025 is due to a once-off base effect caused by a SeptemberOctober 2024 price shock, the RBZ said in its statement.\n\nDespite this alarming annual figure, the RBZ highlighted that month-on-month inflation has remained below 1% for the past three months, indicating relative price stability.\n\nLow month-on-month inflation continues, signaling minimal recent inflationary pressure, the central bank noted.\n\nLooking ahead, the RBZ said it expects inflation to stabilize from October and fall below 30% by December 2025, with a broader goal of achieving single-digit inflation in the long term.\n\nZiG inflation is projected to stabilize from October 2025 and fall below 30% by year-end, the statement read.\n\nThe central bank also urged economic stakeholders to focus more on month-on-month inflation data, which it said offers a more accurate picture of current economic conditions, rather than annual inflation, which remains distorted due to the transition from the Zimbabwe dollar (ZW$) to the ZiG currency in 20232024.\n\nWe urge economic agents to monitor month-on-month inflation instead of annual figures, which are distorted by historical statistical gaps, the RBZ emphasized.\n\nIn support of this outlook, the RBZ pledged to maintain a tight monetary policy stance, saying it will continue to prioritize inflation control, exchange rate stability, and overall economic growth.\n\nThe Bank remains committed to preserving purchasing power and value stability. The current rise in annual inflation will not affect real consumer value due to its historical nature, it said.\n\nThis latest statement comes amid public concern over the value of the ZiG, which has faced scrutiny since its introduction last year. However, the RBZ insists that current indicators show a strengthening trend and that the economy is moving toward stabilization.\n\nWith inflation management remaining a key focus, the next few months will be crucial for the RBZ to prove that its projections holdand that Zimbabwes newest currency can earn the confidence of the public.\n\n",

She attributes her situation to a failed system that has left graduates like herself resorting to street vending and begging to pursue their dreams.\n\nRatidzai, who sells jewellery on the streets of Mutare, shared her aspirations of expanding her business and someday sourcing products from China, just as many other Zimbabwean entrepreneurs do.\n\nShe humbly requested assistance with capital, shelter, and transport, while stressing that she is not a celebrity or public figurejust an ordinary citizen trying to make a living.\n\nBelow is her full unedited letter to Chivayo:\n\nMakadii munhu waMwari Sir Wicknell vakachenesa chitendero cheMapostori, Madzibaba Chivayo.
