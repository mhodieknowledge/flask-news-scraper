Gonese, who was convicted after pleading guilty to theft, will serve an effective 10-month prison term.\n\nAccording to court records, Gonese stole the money during a single night shift, hoping to win enough through online betting on a platform called Aviator to repay the money and impress his new wife. However, his plan backfired, and he lost the entire amount.\n\nGonese was entrusted with a float of US$3,420 to serve customers at a Bakers Inn outlet on Chinhoyi Street in Harare. However, by the next day, he called the Simbisa Bakers Inn Audit Manager, Yusuf Bruce, and confessed to losing US$470 in cash and US$2,950 in InnBucks deposits through online betting.\n\nA reconciliation at the shop confirmed that the full amount of US$3,420 had been misappropriated. Gonese was initially sentenced to 30 months imprisonment, but 12 months were suspended on condition of good behavior, and another 10 months were suspended on condition that he repay the stolen money to his employer.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dorrothy Moyo | Harare  The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has accused schools of mishandling cash in the style of the infamous conduct of businessman Wicknell Chivayo, who has come to symbolize the misuse of large sums of unaccounted money.\n\nChivayo, whose name has become synonymous with failed accountability after receiving $5 million for the countrys non-existent Gwanda Solar Plant, has not delivered a single solar panel in nearly a decade. Instead of cautioning Chivayo for wasting millions on luxury cars while schools remain in darkness, the police have turned their attention to schools, accusing them of piling stashes of cash on their premises.\n\nPolice Accusations Against Schools\n\nNational police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi has issued a strong warning to schools to stop holding large amounts of money on-site. Speaking as schools prepare to reopen next week, Nyathi urged authorities to deposit funds into banks and enhance security measures to avoid armed robberies, which have become increasingly common.\n\nSchool authorities should employ guards from reputable security service providers and install CCTV at entry points and administration offices. Above all, they must stop keeping cash on-site, Nyathi said.\n\nThe remarks, however, have ignited a firestorm of criticism, with many accusing the police of unfairly targeting schools while allowing Chivayos financial mismanagement to go unchecked.\n\nSchools Are Being Made Scapegoats\n\nCritics argue that the polices focus on schools is misplaced and hypocritical. Schools have been left to manage their finances in difficult circumstances, often without reliable electricityan issue directly tied to Chivayos failure to deliver solar power infrastructure.\n\nHow can the police accuse schools of mishandling cash when the biggest offender, Wicknell Chivayo, is walking free after wasting millions that could have revolutionized energy access for these very institutions? asked the frustrated education advocate, Wesley Banda.\n\nChivayo famously spent part of the $5 million payment meant for the Gwanda Solar Plant on a fleet of luxury cars and personal expenses. Activists have called for him to sell these assets to fund solar panels for schools, but no action has been taken against him.\n\nRising Robberies Amid Systemic Failures\n\nThe ZRPs warning comes amid an increase in armed robberies targeting schools, especially during fee collection periods. Criminals have used guns, machetes, and iron bars to steal cash and valuables from institutions that store money on-site due to limited banking access or infrastructure.\n\nNotable incidents include: Bulawayo: $17,280 stolen from a cash box. Masvingo: $22,800 stolen by a lone armed robber posing as a parent. Ruwa and Gweru: More than $17,500 stolen from two private schools by armed gangs.\n\nWhile the police have urged schools to adopt electronic payment systems, critics point out that such measures do not address the deeper issue of resource scarcity and unreliable electricitya gap Chivayos solar plant was supposed to fill.\n\nParallels Between Schools and Chivayo\n\nThe comparison between schools and Wicknell Chivayo has sparked outrage. Public commentators have noted that schools, unlike Chivayo, are victims of a broken system, forced to store cash due to a lack of viable alternatives. Chivayo, on the other hand, has become a symbol of squandered opportunity and unaccountable wealth.\n\nInstead of accusing schools of copying Chivayos behavior, the police should be holding him accountable for failing to deliver the solar power that could have prevented these robberies in the first place, said a parent from Harare.\n\nPublic Calls for Accountability\n\nThe polices accusations have drawn criticism from educators, parents, and civil society groups, who are demanding that law enforcement shift its focus back to Chivayo. Many are calling for investigations into how Chivayo was able to misappropriate public funds without facing significant consequences, leaving schools and other public institutions to deal with the fallout.\n\nFor nearly a decade, Chivayo has failed to deliver what he was paid for. If the police want to caution anyone about money management, they should start with him, not schools trying to survive in the system he helped cripple, said a teacher from Gwanda.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs schools prepare to reopen amid rising crime and mounting financial pressures, the polices accusations have only added to the frustration of communities struggling to ensure safety and continuity in education. The enduring presence of Chivayos unaccountable wealth serves as a stark reminder of systemic failures that leave schools and citizens vulnerable.\n\nFor now, the question remains: will the police redirect their focus to the root causes of these issues, or will schools continue to bear the brunt of the blame?\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe water levels at Lake Kariba have been steadily rising following consistent rainfall in both the reservoir and its immediate catchment area, reaching 475.87 meters (2.61% usable storage) by January 6, 2025. This marks an improvement compared to the 477.28 meters (12.32% usable storage) recorded on the same date last year.\n\nZambia and Zimbabwe, both reliant on Kariba Dam for power generation, have faced significant power shortages due to historically low water levels, leading to increased load shedding in recent months. The situation has been exacerbated by the below-normal rainfall during the 2023/24 season, causing a continued decline in water levels.\n\nAccording to the Zambezi River Authority, the usable live storage for power generation as of June 5, 2024, was 477.34 meters, compared to 479.67 meters during the same period in 2023. The Kariba Dam was designed to operate within water levels of 475.50 meters and 488.50 meters to generate hydropower for both Zimbabwe and Zambia.\n\nAs the region continues to navigate these challenges, the rising water levels bring some hope, but the struggle to meet power demand remains ongoing.\n\n",
