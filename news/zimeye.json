            "content": "discriminatory law struck down\n\nJohannesburg  11 September 2025. By Dorrothy Moyo | South Africas Constitutional Court has handed down a landmark gender-equality ruling, declaring parts of the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1992 unconstitutional and confirming that men may lawfully assume their wives surnames after marriage.\n\nIn a judgment delivered this morning, the apex court found that provisions governing surname changes after marriage unfairly discriminated on the basis of gender, because they enabled women to adopt a husbands surname automatically while denying husbands the mirror right. The Court declared the impugned portions of the Act and related regulations invalid, removing the barrier that had prevented husbands from adopting, hyphenating, or otherwise aligning their surnames with their spouses.\n\nHow we got here\n\nThe case reached the Constitutional Court after two couples challenged section 26(1)(a)(c) of the Act, arguing that it entrenched a patriarchal norm with no legitimate purpose. The Free State High Court had already ruled in their favour in 2024, striking down the same provisions and sending the matter to the ConCourt for confirmation. The couples included Henry van der Merwe and Jana Jordaan, and Andreas Bornman and Jess Donnelly-Bornman, who were blocked by Home Affairs when the husbands sought to assume or hyphenate with their wives surnames.\n\nWhat todays ruling means\n\nWhat to watch next\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs will now need to update its systems and forms so that couples can process surname choices without extra hurdles. In the earlier High Court order, the declaration of invalidity was to be operationalised while Parliament worked on amendments; todays confirmation by the ConCourt cements that trajectory and removes any legal ambiguity over men taking their wives surnames.\n\nBottom line: South Africas highest court has ended a long-standing legal asymmetry in marital surname rules. Couples can now decide  on equal terms  what their family name will be.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent  Motorists and transport operators across Zimbabwe have welcomed governments decision to slash parking fees and related transport charges, a move expected to ease financial pressure and stimulate economic activity.\n\nParking fees, including clamping and towing penalties, have been reduced by 50 percent in all towns and cities nationwide. The development comes as part of a broader government review of licences, permits, levies and fees in the transport sector, which authorities say is aimed at lowering the cost of doing business and improving competitiveness.\n\nIn a major relief for vehicle owners, the cost of car number plates has also been drastically cut fromUS$500 to US$50following a shift to local production. Officials said the new fee remains profitable for manufacturers while reducing the burden on ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nThe wide-ranging reforms follow an earlier Cabinet decision to implement business-friendly measures across 12 sectors of the economy. Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister,Dr Jenfan Muswere, told journalists after Tuesdays Cabinet meeting that government was determined to streamline regulations, eliminate unnecessary levies and ensure the transport sector operates more efficiently.\n\nThe review process is aimed at reducing the cost of doing business, increasing competitiveness and enhancing the growth of the Zimbabwean economy, said Dr Muswere. Cabinet has directed that unjustifiably high fees be lowered across various transport sub-sectors, including passenger transport, haulage and cargo, taxi services, tobacco transportation and boating services.\n\nAmong other key decisions, Cabinet scrapped theUS$23 000 duty on transit fuelpreviously payable to ZIMRA, with the levy set to be repealed through a Statutory Instrument. Authorities believe the move will cut operational costs for transporters and make it easier to route fuel tankers through Zimbabwe.\n\nFinance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister,Professor Mthuli Ncube, said several other excessive charges were also addressed. Theelectronic cargo system feeof US$30 has been eliminated to align Zimbabwe with regional standards, while parking fees outside the Forbes Border Post in Mutare have been removed entirely.\n\nProf Ncube added that government was also reviewing the recently introduced presumptive tax on the transport sector.The impact of reducing and cutting these fees and levies will be instant, he said. We are in a cutting mode. By reducing costs, we expect enterprises to become more profitable, which will in turn spur economic growth. The slashing of parking fees and number plate charges is just the beginning.\n\nThe sweeping reforms have been met with widespreadjoy among motorists and transport operators, who say the reductions will ease financial strain at a time when the economy is under pressure. For many ordinary Zimbabweans, the halving of parking fees is more than just a technical adjustment  it is a welcome reprieve that makes daily life in towns and cities more affordable.\n\n",

In Bulawayo, that nightmare has become a chilling reality after city health officials uncovered a shocking scandal: tonnes of rice, originally designated as animal feed, had allegedly been repackaged and sold for human consumption.\n\nBulawayo  A Bulawayo-based company is under investigation after allegedly repackaging water-damaged rice originally intended for animal feed and distributing it for human consumption.\n\nAccording to the latest Bulawayo City Council (BCC) health report, Flynote Investments (Pvt) Ltd, trading under the Evergold brand and operating from Thorngrove, had 322 tonnes of rice confiscated and sent to the Government Analyst Laboratory for urgent testing.\n\nCity health officials say the rice  initially designated as stock feed  was repackaged for human markets inside a facility designed for animal feed production.\n\nWater-damaged bulk rice for stock feed was being packaged and sold for human consumption. The rice was being packaged in a stock feed factory with extremely poor hygienic conditions, reads the BCC report.\n\nOfficials raised alarm over the potential presence of mould, bacteria and chemical residues, which can cause serious illnesses if consumed.\n\nNo immediate comment was obtained from Flynote Investments yesterday.\n\nMultiple Complaints in One Month\n\nThe rice scandal emerged as part of a wider set of community health complaints during the same reporting period. These included: Human waste at Burombo Beer Garden in Mzilikazi, allegedly caused by illegal occupants. A pig-rearing operation at 25 Marimba Road, Matsheumhlope, generating noise and foul smells. Overcrowding at 6 Msigwana Road, Harrisvale, where 15 people are reportedly sharing one four-bedroom house without proper ablution facilities.\n\nPush for Stray Cat and Vicious Dog Policies\n\nBulawayo councillors also debated a new policy to manage the citys growing stray cat population following a recent 10-day tie-up order on stray dogs.\n\nOver a period of five years, the population of these cats would have multiplied significantly, said Councillor Felix Madzana.\n\nHealth director Dr Edwin Mzingwane confirmed a policy on vicious dog breeds is being drafted in consultation with the SPCA, ZRP and Veterinary Services. He warned, however, that reducing cat numbers too drastically could spark rat infestations, citing a case in Johannesburgs Alexandra township.\n\nPublic Health Alarm\n\nThe rice scandal has triggered widespread concern in Bulawayo, where food security and safety are already under strain. Analysts warn that repackaging feed-grade products for human use can expose consumers to carcinogens, harmful microbes, and dangerous toxins.\n\nConsumer watchdogs are calling for stronger inspections of food-processing plants and harsher penalties for firms caught mislabelling or repurposing non-food products.\n\nAuthorities have yet to confirm the laboratory results from the seized rice consignment, but say legal action will follow if the findings support the allegations.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jacob Kudzayi Mutisi | Zimbabweans are being urged to exercise extreme caution as one of the most sophisticated scams in recent history spreads rapidly across social media platforms. Fraudsters are impersonating controversial businessman Sir Wicknell Chivhayo on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, X (formerly Twitter) and even TikTok, luring unsuspecting victims into a trap powered by artificial intelligence.The scheme usually begins when a person receives a friend request or follow notification from what appears to be Sir Wicknells verified account. The fake profiles are carefully designed, showcasing luxury cars, money and flashy lifestyles copied directly from the real businessmans pages. Once the victim accepts the request, they are approached with promises of an exclusive investment opportunity that will supposedly deliver massive returns.\n\nTo seal the deception, scammers then send a call request on Messenger, WhatsApp or even Telegram. Using AI voice-cloning technology, they reproduce Sir Wicknells distinctive voice, confidently explaining the investment deal. In some cases, deepfake video calls are deployed, making the illusion even harder to detect. Convinced that they are speaking to the flamboyant businessman, victims are persuaded to transfer large sums of money into fraudulent accounts. By the time the truth emerges, it is already too late.\n\nThis scam represents a new, dangerous chapter in online fraud. Unlike older schemes that relied on poorly written messages or stolen photos, todays criminals are harnessing artificial intelligence to create near-perfect imitations of public figures. What we are seeing is a high-tech trap, one cybersecurity analyst explained. It exploits peoples admiration of celebrities and their desperation for quick money.\n\nZRP have constantly recieved reports, but tracing the culprits has proven difficult, hiding behind encrypted networks. Sir Wicknell himself has publicly denied running any investment initiatives on social media, stressing that he never solicits money online.\n\nThe public is being advised to remain vigilant. No genuine investment opportunity will arrive via a random direct message and promises of extraordinary returns are almost always fraudulent.As scams like these continue to evolve, Zimbabweans are reminded of one timeless truth, in matters of money, if it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is.\n\nEngineer Jacob Kudzayi Mutisi+263772278161\n\n",

The case, which has already led to arrests, once again exposes the deep rot of corruption within Zimbabwes ruling party.\n\nAccording to reports, Spencer Mabheka, a provincial member, and Lilian Chitanga, the Zone 3 District Coordinating Committee Womens League secretary, allegedly conned the army officers by fraudulently selling them three residential stands valued at US$70,000 each. The two were arrested by the CID Police Anti-Corruption Unit (PACU) and spent the night in police cells at Mabelreign Police Station.\n\nThe scandal escalated when Masimirembwa allegedly tried to intimidate the officer-in-charge handling the case to protect his colleagues. His efforts collapsed once it was confirmed that the victims were senior army officers, whose influence ensured the matter could not be quietly buried. Police have not yet issued an official statement.\n\nThe episode highlights the entrenched culture of corruption and impunity within Zanu PF. From the Willowgate scandal of the late 1980s, where ministers profiteered from vehicle imports, to the Marange diamond looting that saw billions vanish, the ruling party has been repeatedly associated with abuse of office and the protection of corrupt elites.\n\nMasimirembwa himself is no stranger to controversy; as former chair of the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation, he was accused of demanding bribes from diamond investors, yet was later rewarded with a senior party post.\n\nAnalysts suggest the arrests of Mabheka and Chitanga may be linked to deepening factional battles within Zanu PF, where corruption cases are often weaponised in internal power struggles rather than pursued to uphold the rule of law.\n\nFor ordinary Zimbabweans, however, the scandal sends a familiar message: corruption in Zanu PF is systemic, and justice only surfaces when powerful interestsin this case, senior army officersare directly affected.\n\n",
