Despite having to leave early due to a packed schedule, the Mayor praised the organisers for their warm hospitality and the events electrifying atmosphere.\n\nShe also extended special thanks to Jan Paul and the ZIMFEST team for their invitation and hospitality, describing the experience as beyond words.\n\nDuring the visit, the Mayor met with officials from the Zimbabwe High Commission UK and held meaningful conversations with Zimbabwean leaders living in the UK. He also commended King Alfred, a Zimbabwean community organiser in Dunstable, who coordinated stage performances and helped keep the event running smoothly.\n\nEvents like Zimfest are not just about music and foodthey are bridges between cultures, the Mayor said. They provide valuable insight into how communities can learn from and support each other.\n\nThe events organisers have also released a statement thanking attendees for their support and clarifying that no fines were issued against the festival, contrary to social media rumours.\n\nZIMFEST continues to grow in prominence as a cornerstone event for the Zimbabwean diaspora in the UK, with plans already underway for an even bigger 2026 edition.\n\n#ZimFest2025 #DunstableMayor #CommunityUnity #CulturalCelebration #ZimbabweDiaspora\n\n",

            "content": "By Sports Correspondent\n\nFading Harare giants Dynamos FC have significantly increased player bonuses in a desperate bid to escape relegation, ahead of a crucial Castle Lager Premier Soccer League clash against MWOS at Rufaro Stadium tomorrow.\n\nThe Glamour Boys are deep in crisis, languishing near the foot of the table with just 16 points from 23 games. With only 11 matches remaining, they trail the safety zone by eight points.\n\nIn response, the clubs leadership, under growing pressure, has hiked player winning bonuses by over 300 percent to boost morale and spark a turnaround.\n\nWe have increased the players winning bonuses starting this week. The players know this already and they are excited. They want to deliver and save the team, said club executive chairman Moses Maunganidze.\n\nSources close to the club revealed that the revised bonuses range between US$350 and US$400 per win, with potential for more under special match incentives. The new financial injection has come via unnamed partners working with Dynamos sponsors Sakunda Holdings.\n\nBeyond financial incentives, the club has also engaged a team of psychologists to address players mental fatigue and low confidence. They started working with the players last week and the attitude is now better. We will move along with the team of those psychologists until the end of the season, Maunganidze confirmed.\n\nThe game against MWOS will mark the official start of Kelvin Kaindus reign as head coach. The former Highlanders boss replaces the suspended Saul Chaminuka and becomes the third coach to lead Dynamos this season, after Lloyd Chigowes brief stint and Chaminukas troubled spell.\n\nKaindu is expected to receive his work permit today, just in time for tomorrows must-win match. What is almost certain is that Kaindu will start his tenure this weekend, said club spokesperson David Chikomo.\n\nKaindu will be assisted by former Yadah Stars coach Thomas Ruzive, who joined the team at training to familiarise himself with the squad. The rest of the technical bench, including assistant Takesure Chinyama, remains unchanged.\n\nDynamos on-field woes have been glaring. The team has only managed two wins all season and scored a mere six goals in 23 outings. Alarmingly, they have not found the net in their last seven matches.\n\nIn a further bid to bolster their survival hopes, the club has confirmed six new mid-season signings. These include the return of midfielder Denver Mukamba, Ghanaian duo\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent| The Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC) is on autopilot after failing to pay employee with inside sources blaming the current top management of failing to impliment sound policies to drive the diamond miner.\n\nWith many workers having lost their jobs while remuneration of those still on the job remains unclear, a critical conversation about the companys management practices and future strategy is necessary.\n\nInstead of attributing the failure to pay salaries on time solely to fluctuating international market prices, ZCDC management must take a hard look at its internal operations, according to industry captains.\n\nIn a confidential email seen written by ZCDC Chief Executive Office Douglas Zimbango to staff on the July salaries update, he casted the blame on the current diamonds sales joint venture between ZCDC and its Dubai based partner.\n\nAs you may be aware, the JV sales arrangement was up for review on 15 June 2025. As management, we were of the view that most of the conditions precedent were not reasonable met and the average price per carat was at its lowest for May production at $17.17 per carat against total operating costs of $30.71 per carat and production costs of $23.79. We could not accept that price and so referred the matter to both Mutapa and our board.\n\nThe board and Mutapa were of the view that we should suspend the JV while our legal teams reviewed the arrangement but to keep the business running, we then offered the May and June production to the JV Partner on a without Prejudice on consignment with a reduced commission and overall oversight by ZCDC. The JV partner on 30th July 2025 then rejected this outright and so tomorrow we are meeting with the board for guidance, Zimbango said.\n\nGiven this scenario, we are unable to pay salaries and fund production unless drastic decisions are made for which we hope will be done at tomorrows board meeting., he added.\n\nAccording to sources at ZCDC, the decision to cut jobs, particularly affecting local miners, seems to sidestep the real issues plaguing the company. A serious restructuring plan is essential, focusing on enhancing operational efficiency rather than reducing the workforce.\n\nAccording to the sources who requested anonymity for fear or reprisal noted that ZCDC should consider optimizing its mining operations by investing in modern mining services. This could include adopting new technologies and training for the workforce to improve productivity and reduce costs.\n\nGoing foward, Streamlining the procurement process is another area where ZCDC could significantly enhance efficiency. By negotiating better contracts and sourcing materials locally, the company can reduce expenses and support the local economy.\n\nUpgrading the processing plant is crucial. Implementing advanced processing techniques can improve yield and reduce waste, directly impacting profitability, a senior management source at ZCDC said.\n\nThe recent surge in stolen stones, particularly from ZCDC operations in Mutare, highlights the urgent need for improved security measures. Investing in state-of-the-art security systems and protocols could help safeguard assets and prevent further losses.\n\nDespite the negative results, the question remains: why has the top management remained untouched?\n\nThe recent appointment of Mutapa as Chairman of ZCDC, replacing Mr. Munashe Shava, raises questions about the ultimate plan of the Mutapa Fund for the company.\n\nZCDC therefore stands at a crossroads.\n\nSenior Industry captains further opined that Instead of retrenching local miners, management should prioritize a comprehensive restructuring plan that focuses on optimizing operations and improving security.\n\n The future of ZCDC depends on its ability to adapt to market challenges while supporting its workforce and community.\n\nThe management must act decisively on these critical points to ensure the long-term sustainability of the company and the livelihoods of those who depend on it. The time for change is now, a senior industry captains further opined said.\n\nAnother senior industry player added that the JV has been instrumental in supporting ZCDC financially.\n\nAs far as we know the JV has been supporting financially ZCDC as a Trading House that was purchasing and paying the stones to ZCDC even when the market was low and the stones were kept in the vaults in Dubai waiting for better times for selling them, the industry player added.\n\nGoing foward there are a lot of questions which require answers as the struggles of the diamond miner persist.\n\nWhat is the real role of the Dubai JV? where someonetimes it is painted as the solution of everything while when it is convenient for ZCDC too management, the JV is blamed for being the cause of the companya struggles.\n\nThere are also questions being asked if the Dubai JV sets up the sale prices or it is just a broker of some sort?\n\nThe sale prices being under the production cost are set by the JV or it is the current situation in the international markets? These are some of the questions which require answers.\n\nZCDC management have the duty to answer.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has certified 27 officers as drone pilots in a move officials say is part of a broader strategy to modernise policing and embrace digital tools in crime prevention.\n\nThe graduation ceremony, held at the ZRP Sports Club on Wednesday, was highlighted by the force as a step forward in deploying technology-driven solutions under the Electronic Traffic Management System (ETMS).\n\nAs the ZRP continues to embrace technology in policing, 27 police officers graduated with drone pilot certificates at ZRP Sports Club this afternoon, the organisation said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nHowever, the initiative has triggered public debate, with critics questioning whether such efforts are addressing the real and immediate challenges faced by citizens on the ground. Many pointed to the forces continued struggles with basic service delivery, such as the lack of digital payment systems at roadblocks and the inconsistent issuance of traffic tickets.\n\nDigitisation Digitise this whole entity. We are 20+ years behind other nations. Come on people!! commented @Lovely Ndai on social media.\n\nAnother user, Isibaya Esikhulu, added: What technology when the department doesnt even have ticket books at roadblocks?\n\nThe department doesnt take ZiG and you can only pay cash USD. There isnt even a POS machine at a single station across the country.\n\nThe ETMS is intended to modernise traffic enforcement, reduce corruption, and enhance transparency by using automated systems to detect violations. These include the use of speed sensors, cameras, and number plate recognition to log offences and issue fines without direct police interaction.\n\nDespite these advancements, citizens remain skeptical about the broader impact of such programs in the face of persistent operational gaps. Concerns over accountability, consistency in enforcement, and access to payment systems continue to dominate public discussion.\n\nWhile the ZRPs move toward drone technology signals a commitment to innovation, the force is under growing pressure to ensure that basic policing infrastructure is not left behind.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe long-running legal dispute over the estate of the late former President Robert Gabriel Mugabe has taken another dramatic turn, with the High Court throwing out an application by a man claiming to be Mugabes son.\n\nTonderayi Gabriel Mugabe approached the court seeking to reopen the estate (Estate DR 2703/19), arguing that he had been unjustly excluded from the distribution of Mugabes assets.\n\nRepresented by lawyer Muchivete Hungwe, Tonderayi requested permission to challenge the Master of the High Courts decision to finalise and close the estate in December 2020.\n\nHowever, High Court judge Justice Fatima Maxwell dismissed the application, citing an inordinate delay and lack of credible evidence.\n\nThe delay is inordinate, and the explanation given for it is not satisfactory, Justice Maxwell said in her ruling. The court noted that the application had been filed in February 2025, more than four years after the estate was closed.\n\nTonderayi claimed he was born in 1977 in Mozambique to Hilda Maeka and was the biological son of the late president.\n\nHe submitted DNA test results, a revised birth certificate, and affidavits from relatives in an effort to support his case. But the court was not convinced.\n\nNone of the annexures take the applicants case anywhere, Justice Maxwell stated. The inclusion of the fathers details on a birth certificate is proof of acknowledgement of paternity. The exclusion, therefore, when the birth certificate was obtained during the lifetime of the alleged father, is a clear indication that paternity was not acknowledged.\n\nA DNA report submitted by Tonderayi suggested a sibling relationship with an individual named Lawrencia Mugabe. However, the judge said this fell short of establishing a direct biological link to the late president.\n\nWhat it shows is that he might have been sired by one of the males related to the person who was tested, the court noted.\n\nThe judge also dismissed the 2022 re-registration of Tonderayis birth certificate, which changed his surname to Mugabe, as insufficient to prove paternity.\n\nThe law does not allow a near relative to come forward and acknowledge paternity on behalf of a father in circumstances such as this, Justice Maxwell said.\n\nThe court further criticised Tonderayi for failing to take timely action or provide a coherent timeline of events. Erroneous proceedings are not an excuse that prevents the running of the time within which the application for review is to be filed, she added.\n\nThe ruling also pointed to the potential prejudice to beneficiaries of the estate, who had relied on the closure of the matter over four years ago.\n\nThe balance of convenience favours the dismissal of this application, Justice Maxwell concluded, ordering that the case be dismissed with costs.\n\nThe ruling solidifies the legal finality of Mugabes estate, now administered by his daughter, Bona Nyepudzayi Mugabe, who was represented by lawyer Addington Chinake of Kantor & Immerman.\n\n",

We want to ensure that small businesses are not burdened but supported to grow while contributing meaningfully to national development, he added.\n\nThe announcement comes as Treasury has already spent 35% of the approved 2025 national budget  approximately US$3.3 billion  with limited room to increase spending. Ncube emphasized that the government would maintain a strict fiscal discipline and ruled out any budget extensions. There is no intention to increase the budget. The remaining 65% is sufficient to take us to the end of the year, he said.\n\nAlthough the government has set an ambitious economic growth target of 6% for 2025, Ncube admitted that GDP growth for 2024 has been revised downward to just 1.7%. Meanwhile, he pointed to a 30.2% rise in foreign currency inflows during the first half of the year, claiming it reflected improved confidence in the economy.\n\nNcube also highlighted structural changes in the economy, noting that manufacturing now contributes 15.3% of GDP  surpassing agriculture. However, agriculture is expected to rebound strongly in 2025 with projected growth of 21.1%, supported by ongoing investments and regulatory reforms.\n\nThe Finance Minister said government would continue reviewing business licences, fees, and regulatory frameworks, particularly in the agricultural sector. Within two weeks, we expect to complete the review of agricultural regulations and fees to remove bottlenecks affecting productivity, he said.\n\nDespite Ncubes reassurances, the proposed taxation of the informal sector has already raised concerns among traders and small business operators, many of whom feel overburdened by existing costs and levies. Critics argue that the move is a sign of desperation by a government that has run out of new revenue streams.\n\nWith public debt now standing at 46.5% of GDP (in US dollar terms), the pressure on Treasury to find additional funds is mounting  and for many, the informal sector is the easiest target.\n\n",
