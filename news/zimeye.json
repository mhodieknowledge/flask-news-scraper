            "content": "By A Correspondent-Vice President Constantino Chiwengas hopes of succeeding President Emmerson Mnangagwa have suffered a major blow after ZANU PF announced plans to use its forthcoming annual conference to endorse Mnangagwas continued rule until 2030  effectively sidelining his deputy and cementing the presidents dominance over the ruling party.\n\nThe endorsement, to be formalized at the Mutare conference next week, marks a turning point in ZANU PFs succession politics and reinforces Mnangagwas control following months of factional tensions. It also follows last years controversial resolution to extend his leadership beyond the traditional two-term framework  a move that widened divisions between Mnangagwa loyalists and the camp aligned to Chiwenga.\n\nParty sources say infighting has intensified in recent months, spilling into heated Politburo meetings. In one such meeting last month, Chiwenga reportedly presented a dossier accusing some of Mnangagwas inner circle of grand corruption  an act interpreted by many as an open challenge to the presidents authority.\n\nBut in what analysts view as a strategic counterattack, ZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa publicly reaffirmed the partys unwavering support for Mnangagwa, dismissing talk of factionalism and hinting that those harbouring presidential ambitions would be crushed by the collective will of the party.\n\nThe organs, the provinces and the party membership are quite happy with His Excellencys stewardship of the party and membership, Mutsvangwa toldThe Zimbabwe Independent.\n\nTheir dictum is: If it aint broke, why try to fix it? The delegates have expressly and vehemently resolved to continue with His Excellency till 2030. They have drowned out other noises of unbridled, undeserving and self-centred ambition.\n\nMutsvangwa said the Mutare conference would demonstrate party unity and silence critics, a statement interpreted as an indirect rebuke to Chiwengas faction.\n\nThe cacophony of social media trolling has no resonance in the closed membership of the organs, provinces and structures of ZANU PF, he added, describing dissenters as detractors, regime change practitioners and agents of political destabilisation.\n\nThe conference, to be held from next Friday to October 18 at the Mutare Polytechnic Pavilion Grounds, will bring together around 4,000 delegates under the themeAttainment of Vision 2030 Through Economic Empowerment and Value Addition.\n\nZANU PFs Director of Information and Publicity, Farai Marapira, also dismissed speculation about succession, emphasizing that the matter was not part of the conference agenda.\n\nSuccession is dealt with at congress, and we are not going to congress  we are going to a conference, Marapira said.\n\nThe issue of succession is not a concern within ZANU PF. We are simply going to check up on the mandate we received from the people in 2023.\n\nWhile Mnangagwas allies frame the 2030 agenda as a continuation of hisVision 2030economic blueprint, critics argue it is a calculated political manoeuvre to neutralize Chiwenga and tighten the presidents grip on power ahead of the 2027 elective congress.\n\nWith the Mutare conference expected to rubber-stamp the extension, Mnangagwa appears to have decisively outmanoeuvred his deputy  consolidating his hold on both the party and the state, and confirming that Chiwengas long-anticipated power bid has suffered a significant defeat.\n\n",

I dont deserve any warrant. This is a sniff campaign, he said.\n\nThe courts had ordered Mwonzora in February 2024 to pay US$500 monthly maintenance for his 10-year-old son with Getrude Chuma, in addition to covering school fees. The current warrant reportedly covers unpaid maintenance from March to July this year.\n\nThe total arrears have reportedly risen to US$3,500, as Mwonzora has also not paid for August and September.\n\nChuma expressed frustration with the police at Harare Central, saying they had failed to serve the warrant on Mwonzora for the third time.\n\nAccording to ZRP sources, the matter is registered under case number M389.

Its a case of misplaced priorities.\n\nMnangagwa was received with pomp and ceremony at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport by his deputies, senior government officials, and security chiefs  a display critics described as extravagant and out of touch with the hardships faced by the majority of citizens.\n\nDespite the grand welcome, the mood on the ground remains grim, as many Zimbabweans struggle to see how Mnangagwas new COMESA role will bring any meaningful change to their lives.\n\n",

The court heard that Phiri had perfected a fast-talking hustle  walking into shops, pretending to have a US$100 note in the car, pocketing change, and vanishing before anyone caught on.\n\nBut his run came to a dramatic end when furious residents cornered him during his fourth attempt at Mkhosana Shopping Centre, finally exposing the conmans act.\n\nAccording to prosecutor Daphine Ntini, Phiri preyed mostly on female shopkeepers and vendors between September and October 2025, recycling the same charming but deceptive routine.\n\nIn one incident, he walked into Calvary Collection, picked scissors worth US$20, and claimed his US$100 note was with a taxi driver outside. The shopkeeper handed him US$80 change  and he disappeared, Ntini told the court.\n\nThe next day, Phiri struck again  this time at Victoria Falls Pharmacy, convincing a worker to hand him US$80 change for supposed court fees, pointing to a nearby parked car as proof of his story.\n\nAt Comesa Market, he duped a shoe vendor out of US$75, before pulling the same trick at Soppers Shop, buying a US$5 item and pocketing US$95 in change  a vanishing act that had become his signature.\n\nBy the time the con unraveled, Phiri had swindled a total of US$330, none of which was recovered.\n\nIn delivering sentence, Magistrate Dzvene branded Phiri a serial trickster whose antics had eroded public trust and targeted innocent livelihoods.\n\nSuch behaviour must be punished to protect honest citizens, she ruled, sending him straight to jail for nearly three years, with five months suspended for good behaviour.\n\nPhiris saga has since become a cautionary tale in Victoria Falls  a smooth talkers hustle that finally met its match in the hands of angry locals and a no-nonsense magistrate.\n\n",

Speaking at a Womens League empowerment programme at Chiwetu Training Centre in Makoni West Constituency, Chinomona  a politburo member  appeared visibly agitated as she read the riot act to party members.\n\nWe have the conference which is coming up in Mutare in Manicaland province next week. We dont want things which are not good; please, we dont want people who are destroying our party. Dont destroy your own party, she said.\n\nI am the leader of the womens league and I am ready to suspend people who are spreading falsehoods ahead of the conference. We dont want that, please.\n\nHer remarks laid bare the growing sense of panic within ZANU PF as internal divisions threaten to overshadow Mnangagwas leadership ahead of the 22nd annual national peoples conference to be held at Mutare Polytechnic Pavilion Grounds.\n\nThe tensions stem largely from the ongoing campaign by Mnangagwa loyalists to push for a constitutional amendment that would allow him to remain in power until 2030  a move fiercely opposed by some senior party officials who argue it violates the spirit of the 2013 Constitution.\n\nIronically, Chinomona herself was among the architects of the 2004 Tsholotsho Declaration, a failed attempt to alter ZANU PFs leadership structure in favour of Mnangagwa. The scheme, which angered then-President Robert Mugabe, saw Chinomona and several provincial chairpersons suspended  including current Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda, who now serves as the partys secretary-general.\n\nAt the same event, Information Minister Jenfan Muswere and ICT Minister Tatenda Mavetera  both staunch Mnangagwa loyalists  used their addresses to pledge allegiance to the embattled President.\n\nWe have a training centre here at Chiwetu; its going to train women and youths, said Muswere, carefully steering clear of the ongoing succession debate.\n\nMavetera, who also heads the Young Women for ED movement, was less cautious. We are also saying that our President should rule until 2030, she declared, echoing the sentiments of the Presidents inner circle.\n\nManicaland Provincial Affairs Minister Misheck Mugadza urged women to take part in empowerment projects and announced plans to build a rehabilitation centre in the province  an attempt to project unity and development amid the widening cracks.\n\nBut behind the public speeches and pledges of loyalty, the Mutare conference threatens to become a battleground for power within ZANU PF. As fears of open rebellion mount, Mnangagwa risks facing his most embarrassing show of defiance since taking power in the 2017 military-assisted transition that toppled Mugabe.\n\n",
