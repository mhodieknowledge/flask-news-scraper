When Gama failed to produce his military ID, they allegedly restrained him with a shoelace and began a brutal assault.\n\nEyewitnesses reported that Gama was repeatedly punched and kicked in the face until he bled and collapsed. Efforts to intervene by a barman, Cephas Mudyiwa, and patron Hardlife Maheya, were allegedly rebuffed by the accused.\n\nProsecutors allege that after assaulting Gama, the two soldiers took US$45 and a mobile phone from his pocket before fleeing the scene.\n\nMilitary Police officer Tapera Mbizvo responded to the incident and found Gama unconscious. He was first taken to the 4/2 Camp Battalion Clinic before being transferred to Gutu Mission Hospital and later to Josiah Magama Tongogara Army Hospital in Harare. Despite medical intervention, he succumbed to his injuries two weeks later.\n\nThe trial is being presided over by Justice Helena Charewa. Innocent Mazvuru is represented by Omen Mafa of Mutendi, Mudisi and Shumba Legal Practitioners.\n\n",

Our President, Cde Thembisani Mfulongatshi Mpofu, witnessed firsthand the unlawful activities when he and other party leaders visited a group of disgruntled white farmers.\n\nThese farm invasions are a clear demonstration of ZANU-PFs disregard for the law and the rights of citizens in Matabeleland. Farms such as Sentinel in Beitbridge, forcefully grabbed by Kembo Mohadi, and WestAcre farm along Plumtree road, partially taken by a ZANU-PF member, are just a few examples of this egregious behavior. The ZANU-PF party members and Central Intelligence Organization Officials are reportedly targeting a number of farms in Matabeleland, which include Marula FARM Marshlands owned by Zeitsman, they are threatening to kill Mrs Knott if she doesnt vacate the farm, the White farmers are no longer feeling safe.\n\nAs a party, we say nothing for us without us. If you want to invade farms, go and do it in Mashonaland. We in Matabeleland will not sit idly by while people come from Mashonaland East to take our land by force. This is a blatant disregard for the Constitution of Zimbabwe, specifically Section 71, which guarantees the right to property.\n\nThese actions also contravene international law, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 17, which states that everyone has the right to own property alone or in association with others. Furthermore, the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, Article 14, guarantees the right to property.\n\nThe MRP will not stand idly by while our citizens are threatened and intimidated. We will protect the rights of all citizens by all means necessary. We call on the authorities to take immediate action to stop these illegal activities and uphold the rule of law. We urge people from Mashonaland to refrain from using ZANU-PF to occupy our land by force.\n\nWe demand that the government takes immediate action to:\n\nThe MRP will continue to advocate for peace, justice, and the protection of our citizens rights.\n\nMRP For Peace And Justice In Our LifetimeSisonke Sibambene SinguMthwakazi Sesikulungisa\n\n",

Momo showed up at 10:30 PMwell past his scheduled performance time of 8:00 PMand played for less than an hour before abruptly ending his set, leaving fans frustrated and short-changed.\n\nThe event had kicked off at 3 PM and drew hundreds of Amapiano enthusiasts, many of whom had forked out as much as US$30 for VIP access in anticipation of extended sets by top-tier DJs.\n\nI feel robbed. We came here expecting at least three hours of Kelvin Momo, but he barely played. For what we paid, this is unacceptable, said one disgruntled fan.\n\nAnother headline act, Kabza De Small, also failed to deliver a memorable set, further dampening the spirits of attendees who had braved the evening chill in hopes of a musical feast under the stars.\n\nCarpe Diem had promised an electrifying showcase of Africas finest Amapiano talent. The lineup included Kelvin Momo, Kabza De Small, DJ Madeherbelieve, DJ Ash T, DJ Sfiso, Thakzin, DJ Tapiwa, Mimi, and Jay, with organizers marketing the event as a one-of-a-kind celebration of the continents vibrant electronic music scene.\n\nThe Carpe Diem series has grown into a signature event in Zimbabwes entertainment calendar, celebrated for its fusion of sound, culture, and community. The first season featured over 12 DJs from across Africa and was praised for its high energy and pan-African spirit. It was this track record that raised expectations for an even better Season 2.\n\nSet in the relaxed, open-air setting of First Capitalk Sports Club, the event encouraged fans to bring picnic blankets, cooler boxes, and charcoal heaters to create a laid-back, communal atmosphere. But for many, the night ended on a sour note due to poor time management and what fans described as unprofessional conduct by the headline performers.\n\nDespite the backlash, the event organizers, led by seasoned promoter Walter Wanyanya, were praised for maintaining high production values and ensuring a safe and inclusive environment. However, many now say the credibility of the Carpe Diem brand could suffer if headline artists fail to respect fans and deliver promised performances.\n\nWith social media abuzz with disappointed reactions and calls for refunds, it remains to be seen whether Carpe Diem can bounce back and restore confidence among its loyal fan base.\n\n",

The murmurs are there, that the VP has let them down. But the army cannot withdraw security from the president and they cannot meet privately and publish it. They will be killed straight away.\n\nThe sources insisted that any authentic military arrangements of such a sensitive nature would never be made public. If the army arranges something, it will never be published, one source said, shutting down speculation of a brewing military revolt.\n\nThe Vice President, who reportedly returned from Rome today, has not commented on the rumours. Meanwhile, ZDF Commander General Valerio Sibanda was confirmed to have been attending a presidential agricultural meeting focused on the arrival of goats and sheep from Belarus  a project already drawing internal criticism over a lack of veterinary expertise and practical benefit to the armed forces.\n\nWhile government insists that the presidents security remains intact, the source acknowledged that ordinary army personnel can withdraw security from the Vice President, but not from the President. Thats impossible.\n\nPresidential Spokesman George Charamba had not commented at the time of writing.\n\nThe controversy was sparked by reports that army commanders had convened without their superiors to protest years of poor conditions, particularly the deteriorating welfare of soldiers. In 2022, Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri publicly lamented that soldiers had been reduced to rations of just sadza and beans, with many living in townships under squalid conditions due to lack of barracks accommodation.\n\nOur forces are renting accommodation and theyre being insulted daily, Muchinguri told Parliament. Sometimes they go without food, even uniforms  these are constitutional requirements.\n\nDespite the denials, deep internal frustrations remain evident. Other legislators have repeatedly warned that the governments continued neglect of the army and police forces could become a national security threat.\n\nMuchinguri herself is still to respond to viral accusations by war veteran is that she is receiving US$30,000 from corrupt people in order to block the constitutional removal of the president.\n\nStill, the official message seemed repeatedly clear by mid afternoon Monday: no mutiny has taken place, and any attempt by the military to independently challenge presidential authority would be met with instant consequences.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\n",
