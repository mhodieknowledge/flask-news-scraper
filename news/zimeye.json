            "content": "Emmerson Mnangagwas Dubious Liberation War Legacy and Allegations of Treachery.\n\nThe Mystery of Corporal Obert Ndlovu Mabaleka: Why Does This Man Resemble Emmerson Mnangagwa?\n\nWhy does Corporal Obert Ndlovu Mabaleka, a decorated Selous Scout operative during the Rhodesian Bush War, bear such an uncanny resemblance to Emmerson Mnangagwa? Why does his age align so closely with Mnangagwas? Could it be that their stories are intertwined in ways we are yet to fully uncover? And if so, what does this mean for our understanding of Zimbabwes liberation history?\n\nMabaleka was no ordinary soldier. As an infiltrator for the Rhodesian Selous Scouts, he disguised himself as a freedom fighter, infiltrated guerrilla camps, and led unsuspecting comrades into deadly ambushes. He was celebrated for his cunning, awarded the Bronze Cross of Rhodesia for gallantry, and operated in a world of shadows and deception. But what if the skills he perfecteddeceit, manipulation, and survivalmirror the traits of those who ultimately rise to power? Could this describe Mnangagwa himself?\n\nWhy has history seen infiltrators and manipulators ascend to leadership while true fighters are pushed aside? Could Mabaleka, had he survived (thats if he is even dead in the first place) have risen to the same heights as Mnangagwaperhaps even becoming president? And why do their timelines, roles, and methods seem eerily similar?\n\nThis story forces us to ask uncomfortable questions: Who were the real freedom fighters, and who merely played the part? Could the skills of a Selous Scout like Mabaleka reflect the very foundation upon which Zimbabwes leadership was built? The parallels between these two men demand answers, and the truth may change everything we thought we knew.\n\nIn the contested narrative of Zimbabwes liberation struggle, Emmerson Mnangagwa, the countrys president, has long portrayed himself as a revolutionary hero. However, allegations of betrayal, historical inconsistencies, and unanswered questions about his role in the struggle cast serious doubts on this image. Testimonies from former war veterans, political figures, and historical records challenge Mnangagwas narrative, raising questions about whether he was a genuine freedom fighter or an opportunist maneuvering for power.\n\nAllegations of Betrayal and Treachery\n\nFormer First Lady Grace Mugabe unleashed a startling claim in 2017, accusing Mnangagwa of plotting Robert Mugabes assassination shortly after the 1980 elections. Grace stated:This man, Emmerson Mnangagwa, tried to kill the president soon after the elections in March 1980. He told the president to go to Mozambique, saying whites wanted to kill him, while he had arranged for Mugabe to be killed.\n\nThis accusation mirrors similar allegations surrounding Mnangagwas alleged involvement in the suspicious death of his brother-in-law, Josiah Tongogara, a legendary commander of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). Tongogara died in a mysterious car crash in December 1979. Many believe his death was orchestrated to remove a powerful rival for leadership.\n\nPolitical analyst Dr. Pedzisai Ruhanya observed:Tongogaras death conveniently cleared the path for Robert Mugabe to consolidate power, and Mnangagwa was deeply entrenched in that system. It raises questions about his role in eliminating key liberation figures.\n\nDespite these serious allegations, Mnangagwa has remained silent, fueling further suspicion.\n\nQuestioning Mnangagwas Liberation Credentials\n\nMnangagwa has long claimed to be a member of the famed Crocodile Gang, a group led by the late Cde William Ndangana that conducted sabotage missions in the 1960s. However, war veterans have dismissed these claims as fabricated.\n\nAt a 2019 press conference in Harare, Cde Karen Kazingizi, a liberation war veteran, directly questioned Mnangagwas liberation credentials:We want to know these comrades who go around cutting voters hands. Are they real comrades, or are they Mugabes people he took from Ian Smiths mercenaries? Emmerson Mnangagwa is one of them.\n\nShe added:After coming out of prison, Mnangagwa studied law instead of joining the war effort. He was recruited by Mugabe to replace those of us who fought in the trenches. How does that make him a liberation hero?\n\nHer comments reflect a broader frustration among genuine war veterans who feel their contributions have been overshadowed by politically motivated distortions of history.\n\nParallel Narratives: Obert Ndlovu Mabaleka and the Selous Scouts\n\nHistorical accounts from Rhodesian records present a chilling parallel to Mnangagwas ambiguous history. 644764 Corporal Obert Ndlovu Mabaleka, a decorated member of the Selous Scoutsa Rhodesian military unit specializing in pseudo-operationsexemplifies how Africans were recruited to infiltrate and sabotage liberation movements.\n\nMabalekas role as a pseudo-operator included infiltrating ZANLA camps and manipulating fighters into ambushes by Rhodesian forces. A Rhodesian military historian wrote:Mabalekas operations were highly effective. On one occasion, he convinced a group of 30 fighters to walk into a Rhodesian patrol, resulting in 10 enemy fatalities. His work blurred the lines between friend and foe, a hallmark of pseudo-operations.\n\nThis history raises unsettling questions: could Mnangagwa, whose age and timeline align with Mabalekas, have played a similar role? The silence surrounding his activities during critical years of the liberation struggle only deepens the mystery.\n\nGrace Mugabes Warning and Mnangagwas Evasion\n\nGrace Mugabes revelations extend beyond accusations of assassination plots. She also highlighted Mnangagwas alleged role in fostering a culture of political elimination:He worked with Mugabe to sideline real fighters after the war. Look at what happened to the Gamatox faction and other liberation leaders Mugabe purged.\n\nIndeed, Mnangagwas record during the Gukurahundi massacres of the 1980s, in which thousands of Ndebele civilians were killed, reveals a pattern of ruthless political maneuvering. As Minister of State Security at the time, Mnangagwa was accused of overseeing the Fifth Brigade, a North Korean-trained unit that carried out the atrocities.\n\nWar Veterans Demand Answers\n\nWar veterans have increasingly spoken out against Mnangagwas narrative. Cde Karen Kazingizi expressed the frustrations of many veterans:We fought in the trenches, but our contributions have been erased. Instead, we see individuals like Mnangagwa, who did not fight, claiming the glory. The youth deserve to know the truth.\n\nThe Truth Behind the Crocodile\n\nThe emerging contradictions in Mnangagwas narrative, coupled with testimonies from war veterans and Grace Mugabes explosive allegations, cast a long shadow over his liberation war legacy. His silence on these matters only amplifies doubts.\n\nZimbabweans deserve an honest reckoning with their history. Until Mnangagwa directly addresses these allegations, the question of whether he was a genuine freedom fighter or an opportunist working behind the scenes will continue to haunt his legacy. As Cde Kazingizi put it:The truth always finds a way to surface. It is time for Zimbabwe to confront its past.\n\n",

            "content": "Heartbreaking Scene at Inyathi Mission Hospital: Mining Accident Victim Abandoned in Agony.\n\nBubi District, Matabeleland North Province  A shocking story of neglect and suffering has emerged from Inyathi Mission Hospital, where 36-year-old Mr. Fanuel Moyo, a mining accident survivor, has endured unimaginable pain and hardship for eight years.\n\nMr. Moyos left leg harbors a deep, rotting wound infested with live maggots that feed on his flesh, leaving blood-stained trails on his skin. This disturbing sight is a grim reminder of his prolonged suffering and lack of adequate medical care.\n\nSpeaking to the Sunday News on Wednesday, Mr. Moyo revealed the tragic series of events that led to his current condition.\n\nI am sitting out here in the sun because I feel very cold; I just took a bath, he said from his wheelchair, his voice heavy with sorrow.\n\nMining Accident That Changed His Life\n\nOn October 19, 2017, Mr. Moyo was severely injured in a mine collapse in the Dromoland area of Inyathi. Trapped from the waist down, he was pulled out using a rope tied around his chest, resulting in a spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed.\n\nAfter being treated at Inyathi Hospital, he was transferred to Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo and later referred to Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare. However, financial constraints cut his treatment short, forcing him to return to Mpilo and eventually his family home.\n\nHis mother, who suffered a stroke and was unable to care for him, could not provide the support he needed. With no suitable living conditions or caregiver available, he was readmitted to Inyathi Mission Hospital, where he has remained ever since.\n\nStruggles with Neglect and Pain\n\nMr. Moyos physical condition has deteriorated significantly over the years. Due to incontinence caused by his injury, he has sustained severe damage to his urethra and can no longer use urinary catheters. This has resulted in frequent leakage and infections, worsening his overall health.\n\nHis leg wound, described as deep and rotting, constantly produces maggots despite efforts by hospital staff to clean and treat it. He also suffers from multiple bedsores caused by prolonged periods of immobility.\n\nSome sores are healing, while others keep appearing because I am always sitting or lying down. I need medication to help with the healing, but I dont have money, he said.\n\nMr. Moyo revealed that his family has stopped visiting him, leaving him without financial support or food. The mine owner, Mr. Nhlanhla Makuyana, who initially provided assistance on the day of the accident, has since withdrawn his support.\n\nA Cry for Help\n\nInyathi Mission Hospital staff continue to do their best to care for Mr. Moyo, but limited resources have hindered their ability to provide adequate treatment.\n\nThis tragic story underscores the plight of disabled individuals in Zimbabwe, particularly those from impoverished backgrounds. It highlights the urgent need for improved healthcare services and social support systems for vulnerable patients like Mr. Moyo.\n\nFor now, Mr. Moyos suffering remains a stark reminder of the human cost of neglect and the urgent need for intervention to ensure he receives the care and dignity he deserves.-ZimEye\n\n",

            "content": "Zim Woman Brutally Murdered in Alberton Over a Canvas Dispute\n\nBreaking News: Zimbabwean Woman Brutally Murdered in Alberton Over a Canvas Dispute\n\nAlberton, South Africa  A 36-year-old Zimbabwean woman was savagely hacked to death with an axe by a South African man in the Emikhukhwini section of Alberton last week. The horrific attack occurred in front of her children while she had a baby strapped to her back.\n\nThe woman had reportedly approached the man to reclaim a canvas he had allegedly stolen from her shack to cover the roof of his own leaking shelter. The suspect, whose identity is known to the community, remains at large as law enforcement agencies have yet to apprehend him.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Community in South Africa (ZimCommunitySA), an organization that advocates for the rights of Zimbabwean nationals living in South Africa, has strongly condemned the brutal killing.\n\nZimCommunitySA condemns in the strongest terms the barbaric murder of this young mother, said the organizations spokesperson, Mr. Bongani Mkwananzi, in a statement. With her baby on her back and her children by her side, she was viciously attacked while simply trying to reclaim her property. This inhumane act highlights the ongoing vulnerability and systemic injustices faced by migrants in South Africa.\n\nMr. Mkwananzi criticized the apparent inaction by local authorities, stating that despite the suspect being known to the community, the police have not made any arrests, citing a lack of evidence.\n\nThis lack of decisive action emboldens criminals and sends a dangerous message that crimes against migrants are treated with less urgency, he added. The right to life, as guaranteed by South Africas Constitution, is universal and must be upheld for all individuals, regardless of nationality.\n\nThe spokesperson also pointed out that this tragic incident is not an isolated case but part of a broader pattern of violence, discrimination, and neglect faced by migrants. He emphasized the systemic failures in addressing such issues, which also impact migrants access to essential services, including healthcare.\n\nZimCommunitySA has called on community members to stand united against such acts of violence and demand accountability from both law enforcement and public institutions.\n\nWe urge South Africans to reflect on our shared humanity, said Mr. Mkwananzi. Migrants contribute significantly to the social and economic fabric of this country. Violence against any individual, regardless of their nationality, undermines the principles of justice and dignity.\n\nThe organization extended its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased and pledged its commitment to pursuing justice for the victim.\n\nMeanwhile, residents in the Emikhukhwini area have expressed fear and outrage over the incident, demanding immediate action from the police to ensure justice is served and to prevent further violence in their community.\n\nAs the search for the suspect continues, the case has sparked renewed calls for better protection of vulnerable migrant communities in South Africa.\n\n",

This lavish salary, which includes additional allowances for airtime, fuel, and entertainment, has sparked outrage among union members and staff.\n\nAccording to sources, Mutero has been using his leadership position to advance his personal interests, rather than serving the needs of his members.
