            "content": "When we think about roads, its easy to focus on the vehicles that use them. But roads arent just meant for cars, trucks, and bikes; they are shared spaces where pedestrians also have the right to walk.\n\nAs drivers, we have a responsibility to ensure the safety of everyone using the road, including those on foot.\n\nPedestrians are vulnerable road users. Whether they are crossing at a designated crosswalk or walking along the roadside, they deserve the same respect and attention that drivers give to other vehicles.\n\nSlowing down when approaching a pedestrian crossing isnt just a courtesyits a critical safety measure. Pedestrians have the right of way, and as drivers, its our job to make sure they can cross the road safely.\n\nIf you spot a pedestrian already in the crosswalk, dont hesitate to stop and allow them to finish crossing before proceeding. Its essential to give them the time they need to move safely without rushing or creating a dangerous situation. It only takes a few seconds, but it can make all the difference in ensuring that no one gets hurt.\n\nPracticing road courtesy doesnt only apply to pedestrians. As a responsible driver, your actions behind the wheel should always prioritize safety, not just for yourself but for everyone around you. Being aware of pedestrians, staying alert to crossing signals, and yielding when necessary are all parts of safe defensive driving.\n\nUltimately, safety begins with us. Its not enough to drive safely in terms of speed limits and traffic signals; we must also be vigilant and empathetic toward those who might be at greater risk on the roads. So, lets share the road and respect pedestrian rightsby doing so, we can help create a safer, more considerate environment for everyone.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  Amid mounting economic turmoil, widespread unemployment, and the governments desperate need for external support, President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration is ramping up efforts to entice Zimbabweans in the diaspora to return home.\n\nHowever, given the countrys current economic struggles, it remains uncertain whether the diaspora community will respond positively to these overtures.\n\nThe government is preparing for the 3rd Zimbabwe Annual Diaspora Conference (ZADC), scheduled for April 10-12, 2025, in the scenic Manicaland Province.\n\nThe event is billed as a major platform for Zimbabweans abroad to reconnect with their homeland, explore investment opportunities, and contribute to national development.\n\nThe ZADC will also serve as a space for Zimbabweans to evaluate how they might help alleviate the countrys economic woes by supporting key sectors such as trade, agriculture, and infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the question remains: Will the diaspora, many of whom fled the country due to economic instability, political repression, and a lack of opportunities, be willing to return under the current conditions?\n\nAccording to numerous sources, many Zimbabweans in the diaspora are skeptical of the governments ability to deliver lasting change.\n\nWhile the government keeps pushing these initiatives, there are still deep-rooted issues like inflation, a struggling healthcare system, and a lack of jobs, said a Zimbabwean entrepreneur based in the UK.\n\nMany of us left because of these problems. I want to invest in Zimbabwe, but I need to see real change first.\n\nThe government, however, seems intent on proving that it can turn things around. President Mnangagwas administration has emphasized the crucial role the diaspora could play in driving Zimbabwes economic revival, particularly through investment and remittances.\n\nThe diaspora is a key pillar in achieving our Vision 2030 goals, said a government spokesperson. Their expertise, investments, and remittances are essential to stimulating growth and rebuilding our country.\n\nTo facilitate this, the government has launched several initiatives, including the Know Your Diaspora program, aimed at fostering stronger ties between Zimbabweans abroad and their home country.\n\nPrevious diaspora-focused conferences in provinces such as Matabeleland North and South, as well as national events in Bulawayo and Masvingo, have seen mixed results. While some diaspora members have shown interest in contributing to national development, many remain disillusioned by ongoing political and economic instability.\n\nThe 3rd ZADC will focus on themes such as Engaging, Enabling, and Empowering the Diaspora: Catalyzing Investment, Trade, and Philanthropy for National Development, but many within the diaspora remain wary of the governments long-term commitment to reform. We hear these promises, but until we see real, tangible changes in the economy and governance, its hard to justify coming back, said another Zimbabwean professional living in South Africa.\n\nWith unemployment at record highs and inflation eroding the value of local currency, the diaspora community is not convinced that simply offering investment opportunities will be enough to lure them back.\n\nHowever, the government is determined to demonstrate that it can offer more than just promises.\n\nIn the coming months, it will be crucial to see if the 3rd ZADC and other government efforts can address the genuine concerns of Zimbabweans abroad or whether they will remain unconvinced, staying in their adopted countries where opportunities seem more promising.\n\n",

Two inmates, Feliciano Simango, also known as Fidelis Jorum Mauyangwe, and Never Matoma, escaped from lawful custody.\n\nThe ZPCS clarified that the escape occurred while the inmates were engaged in a supervised work assignment outside the prison. The escapees took advantage of the situation and unlawfully gained access to a ZPCS vehicle, according to the statement. The vehicle was initially used in their attempt to flee the area, but it was involved in an accident about 2.5 kilometers from the location, leaving it inoperable. After the crash, the inmates fled on foot, evading further capture.\n\nThe ZPCS is actively investigating the incident, with heightened security measures being implemented to prevent similar occurrences in the future. The statement urged the public to be vigilant and report any sightings or relevant information regarding the escapees to local police stations or correctional facilities.\n\nFor further details or tips, individuals are encouraged to contact Assistant Commissioner Meya Khanyezi, the National Public Relations Officer, at 0773418132 or 0714239142.\n\nThe ZPCS emphasized that it remains committed to public safety and the secure custody of all inmates and assured the public that additional updates would be provided as necessary.\n\n",
