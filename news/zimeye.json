            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda-A Bulawayo woman has died after being thrown out of a window from her flat by her husband, in a tragic incident reminiscent of President Emmerson Mnangagwas infamous brutality against the late broadcaster Godfrey Majonga.\n\nThe victim, 33-year-old Siphiwe Ndlovu, was allegedly thrown from the window of their Burombo flat by her husband, 44-year-old Meluleki Ndlovu, during a domestic dispute on Saturday night.\n\nSpeaking toa local online news portal on condition of anonymity, a source from the area said they heard a heated argument from the couples flat at around 10 PM.\n\nThe dispute reportedly started when the husband confronted his wife over a phone number he had found on her device.\n\nIt was around 10 PM when the argument started. The husband was demanding answers about a number he had seen on his wifes phone, the source said.\n\nAn hour later, she fell from the window of their flat, landing on the ground below. She broke her leg and sustained other injuries. She was taken to the hospital, but sadly, she died yesterday afternoon.\n\nActing Bulawayo police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Nomalanga Msebele confirmed the incident and thearrest of the suspect.\n\nPolice confirm the arrest of Meluleki Ndlovu, a male adult aged 44 of Burombo Flats, Bulawayo, in connection with the murder of his wife, Siphiwe Ndlovu, a female adult aged 33, said Asst Insp Msebele.\n\nAccording to police, Meluleki assaulted Siphiwe inside their locked flat.\n\nIn an attempt toescape, she stepped onto a sofa and jumped out of the window.\n\nShe sustained a fractured right leg, a swollen stomach, and was bleeding from the nose and mouth. A neighbour who witnessed the fall rushed to help, grabbed the keys, and opened the door for Meluleki. Upon seeing his injured wife, Meluleki called an ambulance, which took her to the hospital, Asst Insp Msebele said.\n\nAsst Insp Msebele urged the public to resolve disputes peacefully and avoid resorting to violence.\n\nThe tragic death of Siphiwe Ndlovu brings chilling memories of an incident in the 1980s involving President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who allegedly threw former broadcaster Godfrey Majonga out of a second-floor window in Harare.\n\nMnangagwa, a feared enforcer of the late President Robert Mugabes regime, reportedly gave Majonga a brutal ultimatum: either sit on a scorching hot electric stove or jump from the second floor of a flat in the Avenues area after catching him with his girlfriend.\n\nMajonga, fearing for his life, opted to jump from the flat, suffering permanent spinal cord injuries that left himwheelchair-boundfor the rest of his life.\n\nHe died in August 2019.\n\nDuring the height of the G40-Lacoste power struggles, former First Lady Grace Mugabe revived Mnangagwas violent past, citing the Majonga incident as an example of his ruthlessness.\n\nThe revelation further deepened the factional wars within Zanu PF before Mnangagwa orchestrated the 2017 coup that ousted Mugabe.\n\nWhile Mnangagwa has never publicly responded to the allegations, the Majonga case remains one of the darkest stains on his legacyone that many Zimbabweans have not forgotten.\n\n",

We are running awareness campaigns to educate people about the dangers of playing near water bodies. Parents should closely monitor their children and explain the risks associated with playing near water. Water is safe only for drinking, Chazovachiyi stated.\n\nThe incident unfolded when the boys, who were playing at Tafadzwas parents homestead, managed to slip away unnoticed while Tafadzwas mother, Junior Mhukayesango, was busy with chores. Upon realizing the boys were missing, Mhukayesango searched the vicinity and found their clothes on the riverbank, leading to the grim discovery after the water was drained from the pool.\n\nThe community is grappling with the tragedy, with some villagers suggesting that dark spirits might inhabit the water, adding a layer of folklore to the sorrowful event.\n\nAs investigations continue, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the need for vigilance around natural water bodies, especially in rural settings where childrens play often extends to these areas.\n\nAuthorities are urging all guardians to heighten their supervision of children near any water source to prevent such accidents from recurring.\n\n",

            "content": "Harare, Zimbabwe  In a harrowing case that recently unfolded before the Harare Magistrates Court, a 14-year-old Form 2 pupil from Harare was subjected to a brutal assault by four men. The incident occurred on the evening of October 20th, 2024, when the victim left her home after an argument with her mother.\n\nAccording to court documents, the young girl was lured into the home of the first accused, a 30-year-old man, under the pretense of being offered accommodation for the night. Upon arrival, she encountered three other men, aged 34, 36, and 30. The group then proceeded to threaten her with a knife, beat her with a hose pipe, and spike her drink with an unknown substance, rendering her unconscious.\n\nIn her incapacitated state, the four men took turns sexually assaulting her. The victim awoke the next morning in severe pain, with visible evidence of the assault on her body. She confided in her aunt, who promptly reported the incident to the police. A medical examination confirmed the assault.\n\nThe first accused was found guilty of rape and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. However, in a surprising turn of events, his three accomplices were acquitted at the close of the state case. The National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) is currently contemplating an appeal regarding the acquittal of the three accomplices.\n\nThis case has sparked outrage and concern over the safety of young individuals in the community, highlighting the need for stronger protective measures and justice for victims of such heinous crimes. The community awaits further developments as the NPAZ decides on the next steps in this disturbing case.\n\n",

            "content": "By Farai D Hove | ZimEye | At a time when Zimbabwes President Emmerson Mnangagwa has been caught on camera instructing his supporters to push for the suspension of the constitution so he can extend his rule indefinitely, he has ironically declared himself to be so democratic.\n\nDuring a recent meeting with a select group of editors, Mnangagwa attempted to reaffirm his commitment to constitutionalism and term limits, even as growing evidence suggests he is laying the groundwork to remain in power beyond his legally mandated two terms.\n\nIm So Democratic, Says Mnangagwa Amid Moves to Undermine Democracy\n\nIn response to a journalists question about whether he would respect the constitutional limit on his presidency, Mnangagwa stated:\n\nI thought you are putting me very clear that I have two terms, and these terms are very definite, and Im so democratic. When they come to an end, Ill step aside, and my party will let my successor that is as clear as day. Those who have other imaginations, its a democratic society for people to dream.\n\nThis statement came as a contradiction to his recent remarks captured on video, where he was heard instructing people to demand the suspension of parliamenta move that would effectively keep him in office beyond his current term.\n\nMnangagwas Contradictions: Public Promises vs. Private Plans\n\nWhile Mnangagwa told the editors that he was not entertaining calls to extend his rule to 2030, his actions tell a different story. At the Zanu-PF Annual Peoples Conference in Bulawayo last year, a resolution was passed advocating for his term extension, citing his governments infrastructure and economic projects. Despite publicly maintaining that he will step down when his time is up, Mnangagwa has simultaneously been allowing and even encouraging efforts to keep him in power.\n\nHe downplayed these efforts as part of democratic discourse, stating:\n\nIts not imaginable that there is anybody in the country who can push me. I feel very uncomfortable. I am very solid. I have always said I am a constitutionalist. I have my two terms, and when they come to an end, the country and the party will move on by electing my successor.\n\nHowever, the recently surfaced footage suggests otherwise. Instead of rejecting the unconstitutional push outright, he has been subtly guiding his supporters on how to engineer a legal loophole that would allow him to remain in office indefinitely.\n\nA Democratic Leader Who Wants to Suspend Parliament\n\nThe stark contradiction between Mnangagwas words and actions raises serious concerns about the future of democracy in Zimbabwe. While he publicly portrays himself as a champion of constitutionalism, his behind-the-scenes maneuvers suggest he is laying the groundwork to extend his presidency through unconstitutional means.\n\nHis claim that facts will carry the day appears increasingly hollow in the face of mounting evidence that he is actively engaging in efforts to override those very facts. By instructing his supporters to call for a constitutional suspension, Mnangagwa is effectively undermining the very democracy he claims to uphold.\n\nPersuading the Persuaders While Enabling Them\n\nWhen asked how he would ensure he remains committed to his stated position of stepping down, Mnangagwa said:\n\nI will persuade the persuaders not to persuade me so that I remain constitutional.\n\nYet, his actions indicate he is not only tolerating these so-called persuaders but is actively directing them on how to achieve their goal of keeping him in power.\n\nConclusion: A Democracy in Peril\n\nMnangagwas latest remarks stand in sharp contrast to the reality on the ground. While he insists he will respect the constitution, his behind-the-scenes efforts suggest he is determined to remain in power by any means necessary. His claim of being so democratic rings hollow in the face of overwhelming evidence that he is actively undermining Zimbabwes democracy.\n\nAs calls for constitutional violations grow louderwith his tacit approvalthe question remains: Will Zimbabwes institutions withstand this pressure, or is the country heading toward yet another era of entrenched authoritarian rule?\n\n",

The ruling was delivered by Bulawayo magistrate Mr. Ernest Muzembe, who also imposed a four-month suspended prison sentence.\n\nNchama, who has been residing in Zimbabwe since 2014, was found guilty of remaining in the country without a valid permit. According to court records, his student permit expired on January 17, 2025, after several extensions. However, he failed to renew it and continued to stay in the country illegally.\n\nLegal Ruling and Security Concerns\n\nDuring sentencing, Magistrate Muzembe emphasized that Nchamas case was a strict liability offence, meaning his intention did not need to be provenhis mere presence in the country without documentation was sufficient for conviction.\n\nFurther, the court acknowledged concerns raised by Chief Immigration Officer, Mr. Godfrey Kondo, who stated that Nchamas continued presence in Zimbabwe posed a national security threat.\n\nViolence Allegations and Protection Order\n\nThe case took a dramatic turn after it was revealed that Nchama was also involved in a domestic dispute. His girlfriends mother, Ms. Gertrude Makwamba, filed for a protection order against him, citing violent behavior.\n\nAccording to State Prosecutor Mr. Mehluli Ndlovu, Nchama allegedly assaulted Ms. Makwamba over accusations that she failed to properly groom her daughter. He reportedly went as far as accusing her of hiring men to sleep with her daughter. The matter came to light after Ms. Makwamba approached the Harare Civil Court, leading to the exposure of his illegal immigration status.\n\nDeportation Orders\n\nFollowing the court ruling, immigration authorities will now process Nchamas deportation back to Equatorial Guinea. His four-month suspended sentence will remain active should he re-enter Zimbabwe unlawfully in the future.\n\nAuthorities have reiterated the importance of maintaining strict immigration laws to safeguard national security and uphold the countrys legal framework.\n\nThis case highlights the consequences of immigration violations and underscores the need for strict enforcement of immigration policies across the region.\n\n",
