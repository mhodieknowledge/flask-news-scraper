An infographic  juxtaposes the value of a high-end shoe collection belonging to Sir Wicknell Chivayo and the cost of solar panel installations by Tanganda Estates. The comparison reveals a stark contrast in resource allocation and priorities.\n\nWicknell Chivayo@wicknellchivayos 293 shoes he boasts of in one room, can purchase 5 power stations the size of Tangandas thats about to start selling off electricity, as this@climatenewsromreport triggers.https://t.co/QC19YWFSu7pic.twitter.com/nLpEsHxdNy\n\nTanganda Leads the Way in Solar Energy Innovation\n\nTanganda Estates, a prominent agricultural company, has successfully installed solar power plants across three of its five estates. With 280 solar panels generating clean energy, the company has demonstrated its commitment to sustainability and resilience. Notably, these solar installations shielded Tanganda from power outages in 2024, a period marked by severe energy crises.\n\nThe total cost of the solar project, at $22,400, underscores the affordability and long-term value of renewable energy investments. With plans to sell surplus electricity through grid-tying and net metering, Tangandas solar strategy promises economic and environmental benefits.\n\nSir Wicknells Shoe Collection: A Costly Display\n\nOn the other side of the comparison, Sir Wicknell Chivayos 293-pair luxury shoe collection, valued at an estimated $117,200, has sparked debates about wealth and its potential impact. Critics have pointed out that the total value of the shoe collection could fund the construction of five similar solar power plants, contributing significantly to national energy needs.\n\nWhile Sir Wicknells collection reflects personal success, the comparison with Tangandas solar investments has raised questions about societal priorities, particularly in addressing critical issues like energy security and climate change.\n\nAs the debate continues, the infographic serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of renewable energy to drive sustainable development. It also challenges society to rethink the balance between personal luxury and collective progress.\n\nThe shoes vs solar debate is more than just a comparison; it is a call to action for individuals and organizations to evaluate their investments and contributions to the greater good. Tangandas success story stands as a beacon of hope and inspiration in the quest for a cleaner, greener future.\n\n",

            "content": "The Meteorological Services Department (MSD) has assured Zimbabweans that the country will not be affected by Severe Tropical Storm Dikeledi throughout the week of Friday, January 10 to Wednesday, January 15, 2025. The storm is currently located approximately 3,000 kilometers away from Zimbabwe.\n\nIn a weather advisory issued at 6 PM on Friday, January 10, the MSD reported that Tropical Storm Dikeledi is expected to make landfall north of Vohemar town in Antsiranana province, northeastern Madagascar, on January 11, during the mid-afternoon (UTC).\n\nThe storm, classified as a tropical cyclone due to its maximum sustained winds of up to 179 km/h, is expected to weaken after crossing Madagascar before re-emerging in the Mozambique Channel.\n\nThe MSD emphasized that Dikeledi poses no direct threat to Zimbabwe. However, the department has forecast heavy rainfall and thunderstorms in Matabeleland North, Mashonaland West, and Manicaland provinces, which are unrelated to the tropical storm.\n\nThe MSD outlined the trajectory of Dikeledi and provided context for Zimbabwes cyclone season, which typically begins in December but started early this year, in October 2024.\n\nTo date, there have been two Tropical Cyclones  Ancha and Bheki  which did not reach Mozambique or Zimbabwe, and one, Chido, that reached Mozambique but not Zimbabwe, the advisory stated.\n\nThe advisory explained that Dikeledi, the fourth system of the season, has reached the Severe Tropical Storm stage, weaker than a tropical cyclone. It is expected to weaken further after passing over Madagascar.\n\nConsidering the current trajectory, the impacts on Mozambique  if any  will only be assessed after it enters the Mozambique Channel, specifically after Sunday, January 12, 2025. The Meteorological Services Department will continue to monitor and keep the nation informed about its strength and path.\n\nWhile Zimbabwe remains unaffected, the MSD highlighted the importance of vigilance during the tropical cyclone season, as most cyclones affecting the country originate in the Southwest Indian Ocean.\n\nCitizens in provinces experiencing heavy rains and thunderstorms are advised to take necessary precautions to avoid risks such as flooding and lightning strikes.\n\nThe department assured the public of continuous updates regarding Dikeledi and other weather developments, urging them to rely on official communication channels for accurate information.\n\n-Pindula\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent | ZimEye | The promise of hope can be a cruel illusion, especially for those already burdened by desperation and the weight of dreams deferred. For a group of jobseekers yearning for a better future in the UK, this illusion came in the form of Ekiwe Kalolo Mashonganyika, a churchwoman and social worker who they believed to be a beacon of trust and opportunity. Instead, their faith was shattered, their lives upended, and their dignity diminished.\n\nEkiwe presented herself as a lifeline, offering instant five-year Certificates of Sponsorship (CoS) that promised legal work opportunities abroad. She spoke with confidence, invoking her professional background and connections as assurance of her credibility. To those who had worked with her before, she seemed genuinea trusted figure in their community. It was a convincing faade, one that made it easy for them to place their hard-earned savings and fragile hopes in her hands.\n\nOn October 20, 2023, the first payments were made. Thousands of pounds were transferred to a designated bank account . In a gesture of ultimate trust, an additional 35,000 in cash was handed to her at her home just three days later. Along with the money, these jobseekers submitted their personal profilessnapshots of their lives and ambitionsall with the expectation that their paths to a brighter future had been set.\n\nBut the promised instant CoS never materialized. Days passed, and their anticipation turned to unease. Ekiwes assurances grew less convincing with every delay. Applicants were shuffled through a confusing maze of changing company names, hastily arranged Zoom interviews, and group chats that led nowhere with Victoria Panshe Kanyemba and Maxine Zolanski who owns Sekhmet healthcare .\n\nThe cracks in her story widened, exposing the void beneath.The company named Quantum healthcare owned by Aubrey and his registered NHS GP Lindiwe capitalised from the immigrants and issued no refunds\n\nBy the time the truth emerged, the damage was already done. One applicant received a single CoS, not for five years as promised, but for oneand without a job attached to it. Others were left with nothing but empty promises and dwindling hope. In their desperation to reclaim their money, the group uncovered further betrayal: Ekiwe had taken a significant cut of the funds, far exceeding the agreed amount, and admitted to having already spent much of it.\n\nFor months, the victims fought for justice. Small amounts were refunded after external intervention, but it was far from enough. Of the more than 35,000 entrusted to Ekiwe, 26,800 remains unreturned. Her explanations now shift blame to others, painting herself as a victim in a scheme of her own making. Meanwhile, the jobseekers are left to piece together their lives, their trust shattered, and their futures uncertain.\n\nThis harrowing ordeal is not just about moneyits about stolen dreams and the anguish of being preyed upon when most vulnerable. For these jobseekers, the betrayal cuts deeper than financial loss; it is a wound to their faith in others, their community, and their ability to rise above adversity. They sought a lifeline and were instead handed an anchor that dragged them down further.  sponsored\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZanu PF recently shared a survey result on its official Facebook page, claiming that an overwhelming 98.9% of Zimbabweans are satisfied with President Emmerson Mnangagwas leadership. The post, published on Friday, references data from Afrobarometer, a leading think tank that conducts research on African governance. In the post, Zanu PF wrote, The Afrobarometer research has revealed that 98.9% of Zimbabweans are satisfied with President Mnangagwas leadership. 2030 VaMnangagwa Vanenge Vachitonga! which roughly translates to In 2030, Mnangagwa will still be leading.\n\nThe claim has since sparked questions and debate among citizens and political analysts alike. The reported 98% satisfaction rate is undeniably high, but how accurate is this data, and does it reflect the true sentiment of Zimbabweans?\n\nA Closer Look at Afrobarometers Survey\n\nAfrobarometer is a well-regarded organization known for its independent surveys on democracy, governance, and human rights across Africa. While their research is generally considered reliable, one must consider the context in which this particular survey was conducted. Its essential to assess the methodology, sample size, and potential biases in the data collection process before fully accepting the claim that nearly 99% of the population supports Mnangagwa.\n\nAfrobarometer typically conducts face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of citizens, ensuring that the results reflect a broad cross-section of the population. However, critics of the government have argued that political suppression, economic challenges, and restrictions on free expression might distort public opinion. Given Zimbabwes history of electoral controversies, some question whether these findings accurately represent the sentiments of all Zimbabweans, particularly in light of reports of harassment and intimidation in certain regions.\n\nPublic Sentiment: A Mixed Reality?\n\nWhile Zanu PF presents the survey results as evidence of widespread support, many Zimbabweans on the ground may not fully share that sentiment. For example, opposition leaders and critics of Mnangagwas government have expressed concerns about the countrys economic struggles, widespread unemployment, and limited political freedoms. We have seen nothing but hardship under this government, one Harare resident commented. These numbers are far from the reality we live every day.\n\nEconomic hardships, including inflation, power shortages, and a high cost of living, continue to dominate conversations across the country. These issues could lead many to question the accuracy of any poll that suggests such high levels of satisfaction with the leadership. Its clear that a sizable portion of Zimbabweans are grappling with daily struggles that might not be captured in a survey that claims overwhelming approval for the president.\n\nGovernment Support and Opposition Perspectives\n\nZanu PFs portrayal of the survey results reflects a desire to project stability and legitimacy ahead of future elections, particularly as the 2030 presidential election approaches. The message, 2030 VaMnangagwa Vanenge Vachitonga! suggests the partys belief that Mnangagwas leadership will continue to enjoy widespread backing in the years to come. However, opposition parties, such as the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), argue that the 98% figure is a gross exaggeration, intended to placate international observers and the local populace.\n\nIn response to the survey, CCC spokesperson Fadzayi Mahere stated, While it is crucial to have open discussions about leadership, surveys that do not reflect the everyday struggles of Zimbabweans fail to capture the true essence of public sentiment. We are seeing growing frustration from citizens who are concerned about the state of the economy and the erosion of democratic rights.\n\nConclusion: Discrepancies in Perception\n\nWhether 98% of Zimbabweans are truly satisfied with Mnangagwas leadership remains open to interpretation. While Zanu PFs post highlights positive survey results, its important to approach such figures with caution. Public opinion in Zimbabwe is shaped by a multitude of factors, including political repression, economic hardships, and media coverage. As such, the 98% approval rating may not represent the full picture, and its crucial to continue seeking diverse and independent voices to gauge the true feelings of Zimbabwes citizens.\n\nUltimately, the true test of public opinion will come in future elections, where Zimbabweans will have the chance to voice their approval or disapproval at the ballot box. Until then, the debate over Mnangagwas leadership will likely continue, with figures such as this survey serving as a flashpoint for both support and dissent.\n\n",
