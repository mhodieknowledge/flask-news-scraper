Financial institutions have also stepped in with short-term funding facilities to support restocking efforts.\n\n",

The harrowing incident, which occurred on January 22, 2021, underscores the persistent issue of gender-based violence (GBV) in the region.\n\nAccording to court documents, the accused ambushed his ex-wife while she was walking home with friends. He chased away her companions, forcibly leading the victim into a nearby bushy area. There, he produced a knife, threatening her before ordering her to undress. The court heard how the man raped her without protection, subjecting her to both physical and psychological trauma.\n\nFollowing the assault, the perpetrator forced his ex-wife to accompany him to his home. His intention, as revealed during the trial, was to take her to South Africa against her will. However, during their journey, the accused learned that the victims family was actively searching for her. In a bid to evade capture, he borrowed a bicycle and transported her back to her family home. The brave survivor reported the matter to the police, leading to his subsequent arrest and conviction.\n\nThe National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) has applauded the survivors courage and urged other victims of sexual abuse to come forward and seek justice. In a public statement, NPAZ emphasized, We encourage survivors of sexual abuse to report abuse and seek justice. #EndGBV #ProtectSurvivors #SayNoToRape.\n\nThe courts decision sends a strong message against gender-based violence, reinforcing the nations stance on combating crime and corruption. Community leaders and advocacy groups have welcomed the sentence, hoping it will deter potential offenders and offer solace to survivors.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues its fight against GBV, this case highlights the critical need for continued support, awareness, and robust legal action to protect vulnerable individuals from abuse and exploitation.-ZimEye\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent | Harare, Zimbabwe  In a surprising twist, Prophet Walter Magaya, the charismatic leader of PhD Ministries, has announced an ambitious plan to construct 10 football stadiums across Zimbabwe by 2032, despite his organization facing a court-ordered auction to settle outstanding debts. The announcement, made during a tour of the under-construction Chahwanda Stadium in Kwekwe, has sparked a mixture of skepticism and disbelief among observers.\n\nWhile Magaya envisions hosting international tournaments such as the Council of Southern Africa Football Association (COSAFA) and the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Zimbabwe, his ministrys financial troubles are unfolding publicly. LM Auctioneers recently announced the auction of PhD Ministries assets, including approximately 5,000 plastic chairs, forklifts, generators, TVs, trailers, and assorted speakers, under a legal case labeled Simon Tendai vs. PhD Ministries (Case # HRECCG779/24).\n\nThe auction is scheduled for Thursday, 13 February 2025, at 1 Sherwood Drive, Simon Mazorodze Road, Waterfalls, Harare. A $1,000 deposit is required for vehicles and heavy-duty generators. The auction list suggests that basic operational items of the ministry are being liquidated to cover debts, casting a shadow over Magayas stadium-building aspirations.\n\nGrand Vision vs. Harsh Reality\n\nMagayas latest pronouncement came as he showcased progress at Chahwanda Stadium to journalists and local council representatives from Masvingo and Kadoma. He revealed ongoing negotiations with authorities in Masvingo, Kadoma, and Shurugwi to either construct new stadiums or rehabilitate existing ones, with the ultimate goal of transforming Zimbabwe into a viable host for major African football events.\n\nMy dream is to construct 10 stadiums by 2032, and God willing, I will achieve this, Magaya said. If I fail, I will still thank God for allowing me to build what I would have managed to in that timeframe. Should the stadiums be there by 2032, Zimbabwe will be able to bid to host COSAFA and AFCON tournaments. That is why I have a target of renovating at least one stadium in each of the 10 provinces.\n\nHowever, with essential assets heading to the auction block, questions are mounting about how Magaya intends to fund these grand projects. Critics argue that if the ministry cannot retain basic furniture and equipment, the feasibility of constructing multi-million-dollar sports facilities remains highly questionable.\n\nLocal Authorities Skeptical\n\nMasvingos Deputy Mayor, Daniel Mberikunashe, confirmed that the city council would deliberate on Magayas proposal in an upcoming full council meeting. While Magayas vision could boost local infrastructure and economy, the financial instability surrounding his ministry has raised concerns among potential stakeholders.\n\nA local economist, who preferred to remain anonymous, commented, This situation is like building castles in the air. The economic environment is harsh, and his financial troubles are too public to ignore. Unless there is a transparent and viable financial model, this might be more of a publicity stunt than a genuine development project.\n\nWhat Next for Magaya and PhD Ministries?\n\nAs the auction date approaches, all eyes will be on Magayas next move. Will he find a way to resolve his financial woes and realize his dream of transforming Zimbabwean football, or is this a sign of a deeper crisis within his ministry?\n\nFor now, Zimbabweans remain dividedsome hopeful for development and others wary of empty promises. One thing is clear: while Magaya dreams of stadiums, reality is knocking on his ministrys door, ready to take away more than just plastic chairs.\n\n",
