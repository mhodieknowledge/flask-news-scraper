            "content": "The ruling ZANU PF party has launched primary elections to select candidates for both parliamentary and local council positions in Gutu East constituency.\n\nSix contenders  Zvarevashe Masvingise, Christopher Mashuro, Maone Vheremu, Norbert Chikumbo, Nicolas Chiname, and Phinias Chagonda  are vying for the partys ticket to represent Gutu East in Parliament.\n\nIn Ward 10, three candidates are also contesting the council seat.\n\nThe primary elections were triggered by the recent expulsion of former Gutu East MP Benjamin Ganyiwa and former Ward 10 Councillor Jainos Mudonhi. A senior party official confirmed the development, stating:The Politburo took a firm stance on disciplinary matters. Ganyiwa and Mudonhi were expelled for gross misconduct that was deemed inconsistent with party values.\n\nVoting took place across 26 district centres, where party supporters came out in significant numbers.The turnout has been impressive. People are enthusiastic to choose candidates who will carry forward the partys vision in the upcoming by-elections,said a ZANU PF provincial coordinator who requested anonymity.\n\nThe winners of the primaries will stand as ZANU PFs official candidates in the forthcoming by-elections.Only those who emerge victorious from this process will have the mandate to contest under the party banner,the source added.\n\nBy-elections are expected to be held later this year, though the official date is yet to be announced.\n\n",

            "content": "Harare  April 16, 2025\n\nIn a fiery and emotional address today, the National Vendors Union of Zimbabwe (NAVUZ) publicly condemned the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development for what it called three weeks of deafening silence following an urgent appeal submitted last month.\n\nSpeaking in central Harare, NAVUZ Chairperson Sten Zvorwadza accused the government of abandoning the countrys informal sector, which he said represents over six million Zimbabweans trapped between two sharp and deadly horns  the 2% Intermediated Money Transfer Tax (IMTT) and rampant police corruption.\n\nThis is not just a crisis of policy, Zvorwadza declared. It is a crisis of conscience.\n\nNAVUZ said its March 10 letter to Finance Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube was a plea for urgent economic relief on behalf of the countrys street vendors, cross-border traders, and micro-entrepreneurs  those Zvorwadza described as the backbone of Zimbabwes real economy. The letter, NAVUZ said, has gone unanswered.\n\nIn a rare and sharply worded rebuke of state policy, the union painted a grim picture of life for informal traders who are simultaneously taxed by the government and extorted by what it described as rogue elements in the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and municipal authorities.\n\nBy day, the government bleeds every transaction with the 2% tax, Zvorwadza said. By night, vendors are harassed, threatened, and robbed by those meant to protect them.\n\nThe IMTT  a digital transaction tax introduced in 2018  has long been controversial. But NAVUZ is now calling for its complete removal from all informal sector transactions, arguing that it punishes survival and drives people back to the informal cash economy.\n\nThis tax does not build Zimbabwe  it shrinks it, Zvorwadza said. It locks people in poverty. It is economic violence.\n\nNAVUZ also called for a formal meeting with the Ministry of Finance and a full public inquiry into police abuse and corruption targeting vendors  citing repeated instances of harassment, forced bribes, and illegal confiscation of goods.\n\nThe union warned that the governments failure to respond to informal sector concerns is not only unsustainable, but dangerous.\n\nIf the government does not hear us in Parliament or the corridors of power, Zvorwadza said, it will hear us in the streets, in the markets, and in the hearts of citizens who know this injustice must end.\n\nNAVUZs public demands include:\n\nThe statement closes with a stern warning to the government: If you continue to tax the poor and protect corruption, you are no longer governing  you are exploiting.\n\nGovernment officials have yet to respond to todays address.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\n",

Prophet Ndlovu, once viewed as a moral compass for many devout followers, now finds himself in the crosshairs of a potential financial scandal of international proportions.\n\nFaith-Based Facade\n\nSources close to the investigation suggest that this latest move is part of a strategy to sanitize dirty money through high-profile religious endorsements.\n\nIn one photo, Prophet Ndlovu and his wife are seen proudly holding vehicle registration documents bearing the Zimbabwean government seal, an apparent attempt to showcase legitimacy. However, investigators believe these are merely part of a broader public relations smokescreen.\n\nWhat Next?\n\nWith growing regional pressure to crack down on illicit financial flows, South Africa is expected to formally notify Zimbabwean authorities of its findings. However, given the political connections of both Chivayo and his beneficiaries, questions loom over whether any meaningful action will be taken domestically.\n\nAs of this writing, Prophet Ian Ndlovu has not issued a public statement. Calls to his church, Divine Kingdom Baptist Ministries, went unanswered.\n\nThis story is developing.\n\n",

            "content": "By Investigative Correspondent | ZimEye\n\nMELBOURNE  In a scandal that has cast a long shadow over Australian energy giant Viva Energy, one of its Advanced Process Control Engineers, Tawanda Calvin Mutasa, is at the center of a deeply disturbing family saga that calls into question both his personal integrity and, by association, the ethical standards of his employer.\n\nMutasa, a Zimbabwean national turned Australian resident, now enjoys a lucrative engineering career at Viva Energy. But behind the polish of his professional title lies a festering controversy: a $200,000 unpaid university loan provided by his now ailing 75-year-old aunt, Beryl Nkwazia woman who once rescued him from Zimbabwes economic crisis with a heart full of hope and a wallet nearly emptied by sacrifice.\n\nInstead of honouring the verbal agreement to repay her once employed, Mutasa has reportedly dismissed the debt with a callous claim that he already paid her backwith a single car ride. His stance has not only ripped apart his family but left his benefactor on the brink of losing her home in Canada.\n\nThis is no private quarrel gone quietly into the night. It is a public scandal, backed by court filings, email correspondence, and witness testimony. And yet, Viva Energya company that touts values of responsibility and respecthas continued to employ a man accused of heartless deceit, pathological greed, and emotional manipulation.\n\nViva Energys Reputational Risk\n\nAs the scandal gains traction, industry observers and ethicists are raising serious concerns: What does it say about a company when it retains an employee accused of leaving an elderly woman destitute after she bankrolled his education abroad? Should a corporation committed to corporate social responsibility stand by someone who, by multiple accounts, abandoned that very principle at home?\n\nThis is not simply a private matter between two relativesit is a glaring ethical question that now reflects on Viva Energys corporate culture. What kind of character does the company reward? What message does this send to employees, shareholders, and the broader community?\n\nMutasas public dismissiveness only compounds the reputational damage. In a July 2024 interview with journalist Simba Chikanza, when asked about the debt, he curtly responded, There is nothing outstanding, so everything has been concluded. He then hung up the phone.\n\nAn Aunts Kindness Turned Tragedy\n\nBack in 2006, as Zimbabwe teetered under economic collapse, Beryl Nkwazi, a Canadian immigrant, agreed to fund her nephews studies in Canada. She covered tuition, rent, groceries, and daily expenses, under the clear understandingnow backed by emailsthat this was a loan, not a gift. Once Mutasa secured work, repayment was expected.\n\nBut the repayment never came. And when Nkwazi, now battling severe illness and emotional trauma, took the matter to court, Mutasa and his mother, Graceherself a former Standard Bank managerdenied the existence of the agreement altogether. Email evidence has since debunked their denials.\n\nThis is not just financial betrayal, Nkwazi said in a recent statement. Its emotional abuse. I sacrificed everything for himand now, I may lose my home.\n\nDespite Graces courtroom denial, internal family communications confirm the agreement. One relative, Charles Mangurenje, publicly testified: Tawanda cannot be enriched at my sisters expense. She is facing homelessness while he flourishes.\n\nPrivilege Built on Pain\n\nWhat cuts deepest for Beryl is the arrogance with which Mutasa has treated her suffering. During the years she struggled to keep him fed and housed, bank statements revealed that other family members were secretly wiring him additional moneyenabling a lifestyle that included luxury dining, trips, and expensive clothing.\n\nHis coldest move, relatives say, came when he allegedly told another family member that his chauffeuring his aunt between Saskatoon and Calgary oncea ride needed after her night shiftwas equivalent compensation for the $200,000 she spent on him. A slap in the face, Beryl calls it.\n\nIn his defense, Mutasa has gone so far as to mock his aunt, asking whether she now wants to be a shareholder in my education.\n\nEthics Under Scrutiny\n\nIn a global industry increasingly defined by ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) metrics, Viva Energy must ask itself: Is this the calibre of individual we promote as the face of our workforce?\n\nCorporate accountability doesnt end at the office door. While Mutasa profits from a career his aunt paid for, she now faces a humiliating descent into poverty and homelessness. That this happens while he draws a healthy salary in one of Australias most respected companies makes the betrayal not just personalbut institutional.\n\nUnless Viva Energy addresses the matter, it risks being seen not merely as indifferent to ethical violationsbut complicit in enabling them.\n\nWill Mutasa repay the woman who built the foundation of his successor will Viva Energys silence speak louder than justice ever could?\n\n",
