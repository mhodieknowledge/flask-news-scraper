            "content": "By Investigations Desk | ZimEye\n\nIn the face of mounting evidence that he has falsified claims about being police-cleared by the British Embassy, controversial journalist Hopewell Chinono has respondednot with the expected apology to UK authoritiesbut with a sprawling 22-paragraph Facebook post, saturated with emotional appeals and large piles of at least eight invocations of the word hatred.\n\nHopewell Chinono Responds to Evidence of Fabrication With 22-Paragraphs Piled With Hatred Tirade Instead of Apology to British EmbassyBy Investigations Desk | ZimEyeIn the face of mounting evidence that he has falsified claims about being police-cleared by the Britishpic.twitter.com/V4NQjNVkt3\n\nHe was investigated by many professionals including his former employer, Geoff Nyarota following suspicious alleged materialistic behaviour and also multiple incidents of accusing news sources of tension with the army, therefore endangering them.\n\nRather than take responsibility for his 14-year-long falsehood he has used the journalism profession to claim that his multiple names were once police cleared by the embassy, Chinono has attempted to deflect calls for accountability by painting himself as a victim of jealousy and tribal resentment. He frames the urgent demandsimply to amend his record with the British authoritiesas a hate campaign by fellow Zimbabweans.\n\nBut critics say this is a textbook case of gaslighting, especially given the glaring contradiction at the heart of his story: a 2011 political letter he has cited as a statement from the British Government has no mention whatsoever of police clearance, or a declaration that he is not a fugitive from justice.\n\nUK based academic, Wilbert Mukori commented saying, Chinonos claim of financing his first home purchase from a 50,000 British sportscar loan, not at all the CABS Zimbabwe bank mortgage he has before announced, is further evidence that Chinono has a case to answer.\n\nNo one would get such a loan (the equivalent of 130,000 present value) in 1996, let alone a 25 year old immigrant from Zimbabwe, said Mukori.\n\nOfficial Denials from the British Embassy\n\nThe UK Embassy has publicly and repeatedly clarified that it does not issue police clearance certificates. A pinned 2017 statement from the Consular Section at the British Embassy in Harare explicitly reads:\n\nThe Consular Section at the Harare Embassy cannot issue UK police clearance certificates.\n\nFurthermore, there is no known record of any embassy document stating that Hopewell Chinono is not a fugitive from justice in Britain, despite Chinonos repeated claimsverbatimacross podcasts and social media.\n\nCompromising UK Airport Security\n\nBeyond the lies, there are now serious national security implications. Sources at two British airports confirmed that Chinonos persistent use of this fabricated clearance claimcited during heightened scrutiny in 2024compromised airport security procedures. In at least two known incidents, individuals referenced his case when contesting immigration and customs protocols, believing falsely that the British Embassy clears individuals like Chinono on a political basis.\n\nThree Names, Three IDs  Still No Clarity\n\nAlso under scrutiny is Chinonos use of three distinct identities: Hopewell Chinono Hopewell Mukusha Hopewell M. Chingono\n\nPhotos of documents including Zimbabwean passports, BBC ID cards, and notarised affidavits have confirmed these multiple aliases. Despite claiming his name change was legal, Chinono has never provided a timeline or justification for using multiple identities simultaneouslysomething that has caused chaos at border control and continues to raise red flags internationally.\n\nThe Weaponisation of Victimhood\n\nInstead of addressing these grave concerns, Chinonos Facebook post resorts to weaponising victimhood. Rather than clarifying his identity records, or apologising for bringing the British Embassy into disrepute, he refers to those asking for the truth as:\n\nhateful, jealous, vindictive evil people\n\nThis narrative conveniently ignores the core concern: the false attribution of a UK government statementused to silence critics, gain credibility, and possibly influence immigration processes.\n\nTime to Apologise or Face Scrutiny\n\nAt the heart of this saga is a very simple expectation: that Hopewell Chinono should apologise to the British Government for falsely claiming that they cleared his criminal record and publicly declared him innocent of fraud.\n\nThe longer he delays this, the deeper the damagenot only to his reputation, but to public trust in journalism and to international institutions whose names he continues to exploit.\n\nHis silence on how his actions have impacted UK airport security in 2024 with at least two incidents at Heathrow (29 April 2024) and Gatwick (26 Aug 2024) speaks volumes.\n\n",

            "content": "Sports Correspondent\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey  July 6, 2025\n\nKylian Mbapp delivered a moment of pure magic in second-half stoppage time as Real Madrid edged Borussia Dortmund 3-2 in a pulsating Club World Cup quarterfinal clash at MetLife Stadium, securing a high-stakes semifinal showdown with Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nIn a frantic final 10 minutes, three goals were scored deep into added time, with Mbapps acrobatic bicycle kick standing out as the decisive blow that kept Madrids title hopes alive.\n\nLate Drama Seals the Deal\n\nAfter a controlled performance for much of the match, Real Madrid looked poised for a comfortable finish. However, Maximilian Beier gave Dortmund hope with a goal three minutes into stoppage time, slicing the deficit to 2-1.\n\nAlmost immediately, Mbapp, who came on in the 67th minute, extinguished Dortmunds momentum. The French superstar latched onto a lofted cross and executed a stunning overhead kick to restore Madrids two-goal cushion.\n\nThen, in a twist, Serhou Guirassy converted a penalty in the 98th minute after being fouled by Dean Huijsen, who was shown a red card and will miss the semifinal. Madrid were left hanging on with 10 men as Dortmund threw everything forward in the dying seconds.\n\nCourtois Saves Madrid at the Death\n\nThe final play of the game nearly produced even more drama, but Thibaut Courtois came to Madrids rescue, stretching out to fingertip Marcel Sabitzers last-gasp effort away from danger.\n\nIt got crazy at the end, Real Madrid head coach Xabi Alonso admitted to DAZN after the match. We were doing really well and the match looked under control, but in the last 10 minutes we lost a bit of our focus and intensity when we didnt have the ball. Luckily, nothing else happened. But overall, we had a good 80 minutes and 10 minutes to improve.\n\nSemifinal Clash Set: Mbapp vs PSG\n\nMadrid will now face Paris Saint-Germain, Mbapps former club, in what promises to be a blockbuster semifinal. PSG reached the final four by defeating Bayern Munich 2-0 earlier in the day.\n\nThe winner of Madrid vs PSG will meet either Chelsea or Fluminense in the final.\n\nMbapps goal  already being hailed as one of the greatest in Club World Cup history  could prove to be the defining moment in Real Madrids tournament run.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nBULAWAYO The High Court has delivered a damning verdict against the governments takeover of Esidakeni Farm in Matabeleland North, describing the seizure as irrational, unlawful, and a gross violation of property rights. The court ordered the removal of several Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) operatives and senior ZANU PF official Obert Mpofu from the land.\n\nThe 550-hectare Nyamandlovu property, jointly owned by human rights advocateSiphosami Malunga, scientistZephaniah Dlamini, and minerCharles Moyo, was forcibly acquired by the state in 2020. The trio had legally purchased the farm in 2017 through a full acquisition of Kershelmer Farms (Private) Limited.\n\nDespite their legal ownership, the Ministry of Lands went on to issue offer letters to a dozen individuals  includingZANU PF Secretary for Administration Obert Mpofuand high-rankingCIO officials claiming the land was being repossessed for resettlement.\n\nBut JusticeBongani Ndlovu, in a judgment delivered on June 30, 2025, dismissed the acquisition as constitutionally flawed, politically motivated, and fundamentally unjust.\n\nThe farm owners are indigenous Zimbabweans. They are black people. The liberation struggle was waged so that black people could reclaim the land. They, however, purchased this farm, said Justice Ndlovu.\n\nThe fact that the beneficial ownership of this land is in the hands of black Zimbabweans means that its acquisition is void. It is illegal.\n\nThe judge said the states conduct violated both constitutional provisions and the very principles the land reform programme was meant to uphold.\n\nIt is irrational in that it cannot satisfy the constitutional imperatives. It is contrary to the principle of legality, he ruled. This is not, and cannot be, the purpose of land redistribution. That taints the acquisition and renders it invalid.\n\nThe court heard that the land seizure was allegedly engineered byGatsha Mazithulela, then deputy director of the CIO, who had failed to muscle his way into the trios business partnership. Justice Ndlovu called out this abuse of state institutions and personal vendettas.\n\nAny policy that allows people to be stripped of property simply because they are critics of the ruling elite is uncouth. It is reminiscent of the Dark Ages, said the judge.\n\nHe also challenged the rationale of redistributing land from one group of black Zimbabweans to another under the guise of empowerment.\n\nAcquired land must be given to landless indigenous Zimbabweans. How can land be taken from indigenous Zimbabweans and be parcelled out to other Zimbabweans? Are those beneficiaries more Zimbabwean than Malunga and the two others who jointly own the farm?\n\nJustice Ndlovu further ruled that the Ministry of Lands had violated due process by failing to formally notify Malunga, Dlamini, and Moyo prior to the acquisition. This omission, he said, rendered the entire process arbitrary, malicious, and capricious.\n\nThe courts decision has been welcomed by legal experts and land rights activists, who see it as a landmark moment in reaffirming property rights and exposing the politicisation of land reform.\n\nWith the ruling now in their favour,Malunga,Dlamini, andMoyoare expected to regain full control ofEsidakeni Farm restoring not just their rights, but also hope for others facing similar injustices.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nA fierce political row has erupted between Zanu PF and Mthwakazi activists, with the ruling party accusing opposition groups and foreign embassies of plotting to derail the ongoing Gukurahundi hearings  a national process aimed at reconciliation and healing in Matabeleland.\n\nOn Saturday, Zanu PF activist Dereck Goto issued a strongly worded statement accusing ZAPU, the Mthwakazi Republic Party (MRP), and foreign-backed NGOs of inciting unrest and threatening the integrity of the hearings.\n\nZAPU, Mthwakazi, and their foreign backers are plotting to disrupt national reconciliation through threats, incitement, and foreign-sponsored sabotage, said Goto.Let it be known: the Government will act decisively to defend this process and ensure the safety and dignity of all participants.\n\nGoto alleged that funds from the US and Swedish embassies were being funneled to several local organisations  including ZAPU, MRP, the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops Conference, Save Matabeleland Coalition, and South Africas Afro-Forum  under the guise of civic activism.\n\nThese efforts, masked as activism, are part of a broader agenda to interfere in Zimbabwes internal affairs, he claimed.\n\nHe specifically named Busani Sibindi of the Save Matabeleland Coalition as a key actor in the alleged foreign interference plot.\n\nGoto also condemned ZAPUs legal challenge against the hearings, which was dismissed by the courts.\n\nZAPUs court challenge  conveniently filed on the day of the hearings  was rightly dismissed. Justice Mutevedzi questioned why they waited until the last moment if they were genuinely aggrieved, Goto noted.Sibangilizwe Nkomo, whose party is financially bankrupt, has once again exposed himself as a pawn of foreign interests.\n\nTurning his attention to Mthwakazi Republic Party, Goto issued a stern warning against alleged intimidation of traditional leaders and citizens involved in the hearings.\n\nThe MRP is warned: your threats against Chiefs and participants are criminal and will be dealt with. Tribal politics and violence have no place in todays Zimbabwe.\n\nDespite these accusations and rising tensions, Goto reiterated that the Government remains firmly committed to the national healing process.\n\nThe process will proceed  orderly, dignified, and protected by the State. Treasury has already allocated US$1 million to support the hearings, with further funding to follow, he said.Zimbabwe will not be derailed by relics, radicals, or their foreign sponsors. The healing process moves forward.\n\nThe Gukurahundi hearings, initiated under President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration, are aimed at addressing the atrocities committed in the 1980s when thousands of civilians in Matabeleland and Midlands were killed during a military operation targeting alleged dissidents.\n\nWhile the Government says the process is designed to foster unity, critics argue it lacks transparency, independence, and trust  with some accusing the state of trying to control the narrative while marginalising genuine voices of the affected communities.\n\n",

He remained a custodian of the ideals of the liberation struggle. He died a pauper because he refused to renege on what people fought for, said Takaona.He was attacked and injured in defence of one man one vote. The key objective of the liberation struggle was one man one vote.\n\nTakaona also took aim at Zanu PF, accusing the party of betraying the ideals it once stood for.\n\nZanu PF has been taken over by mercenaries who joined the war in pursuit of fortunes, he said.\n\nnother speaker, Lloyd Mufudze, an opposition district coordinator, used the occasion to caution traditional leaders against taking sides in political matters.\n\nYou tarnish your names and your standing as traditional leaders when you do illegal things including forcing your subjects to support Zanu PF, Mufudze warned.Village heads and chiefs must not work for any political party  its not part of their role, and its unlawful.\n\nChiseses refusal to align with Zanu PF after the brutal assault he suffered reportedly left him ostracised and destitute. Yet, for many at the funeral, his life symbolised resistance against fear and political coercion  and his burial, a quiet but powerful protest against injustice.\n\nNo Zanu PF representative addressed the mourners. Attempts by ruling party officials to take the podium were firmly rejected by the family, according to attendees.\n\n",
