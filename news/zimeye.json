            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nAt the weekend, Mrs Emmerson Mnangagwa received sewing machines from the Zanu PF Womens League UK District, in what she described as a gesture to support her mission of empowering women and youth across Zimbabwe.\n\nI had the honour of receiving a delegation from the Zanu PF Womens League UK District, who donated sewing machines to support my mission of empowering women and youth across Zimbabwe, she said. The women said they were inspired by my work through the Angel of Hope Foundation, as I traverse every corner of Zimbabwe. I humbly accepted the gesture, thanking them for standing with us in promoting self-reliance and skills development for our nation.\n\nHowever, critics argue that such handouts do little to address the deep-rooted poverty affecting millions of Zimbabweans. Giving out a few sewing machines will not solve systemic unemployment or the rising cost of living, said economist Tawanda Chikohora. This is more of a photo opportunity than a genuine solution to poverty.\n\nOthers have expressed concern that the initiative may serve more as political theatre than a sustainable empowerment strategy. While Mrs Mnangagwas intentions may be well-meaning, these small gestures cannot replace comprehensive economic policies or create meaningful, long-term job opportunities, commented social commentator Nomalanga Dube.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues to face high inflation, limited job prospects, and food insecurity, many question whether such initiatives by political figures are enough to genuinely uplift citizens or merely act as symbolic acts with little real impact.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a move that has drawn both attention and criticism, controversial Zanu PF businessman Wicknell Chivayo on Monday announced a USD 150,000 cash donation to Leroy Zaware, popularly known as Comic Elder.\n\nThe donation comes just days after the comedian also received a brand new motor vehicle from President Emmerson Mnangagwa, highlighting the high-profile patronage of entertainers in a country struggling with economic hardship.\n\nChivayo, in a statement loaded with braggadocio, said:\n\nLAUGHTER IS THE GREATEST MEDICINE  In a world where we often take life too SERIOUSLY and where each day presents its fair share of TRIALS and TRIBULATIONS, laughter remains the purest THERAPY known to mankind. In Zimbabwe, young comedians have become the unsung HEALERS of our Nation. Through their social media SKITS, these talented youths have helped us manage our STRESS and keep us entertained.\n\nHe went on to lavish praise on Comic Elder:\n\nToday, I wish to celebrate an EXTRAORDINARY young man who is known by countless stage names which include ANNA MUGWAKU, OBVIOUS MUTUTU, ALFRED MWEYA, NICHODIMAS CHIGOVANYIKA, JAPHET KASADZA , POTIPHER ZVOMBO, NATHAN MUTSETSE, just to name a few. His natural humour has earned him great admiration across the country and recently, he received the highest recognition from His Excellency, President E. D. MNANGANGWA at the National Youth Symposium  This exceptionally talented artist is none other than COMIC ELDER, whose real name is LEROY TADIWANASHE ZAWARE.\n\nChivayo also highlighted the significance of making the President laugh:\n\nFor a young comedian to make the PRESIDENT of the REPUBLIC laugh is never a small achievement! More importantly, His Excellencys words that, NDAFARA NEWE MFANA sets you apart and ukafadza President, neniwo unenge wandifadza and wafadza NYIKA YESE! I wish to thank His Excellency for his gift to COMIC ELDER which reaffirms his principle of LEAVING NO ONE AND NO PLACE BEHIND. From traditional leaders to CHURCHES, from entrepreneurs to artists, and from the elderly to the YOUTH, the President gives NATIONAL recognition to everyone who contributes in their own way to the SOCIO-ECONOMIC development of Zimbabwe.\n\nThe businessman added:\n\nAs a small token of my APPRECIATION for your hard work and comical talent which makes us LAUGH each day, and more specifically which made the PRESIDENT laugh, please go and see my lawyer, SIKHUMBUZO MPOFU, on FRIDAY and collect US$150,000 in cash  so you can buy yourself a decent HOUSE in any area of your choice. For safety, the money can be transferred directly to your preferred bank account or my lawyer can facilitate the purchase of your DESIRED house and transfer it into your name. The choice is ENTIRELY yours.\n\nDespite the fanfare, critics argue that such high-profile handouts do little to address Zimbabwes deeper economic challenges. Handing out huge sums of cash to entertainers while ordinary citizens struggle with unemployment, inflation, and food insecurity highlights the inequality in how wealth and recognition are distributed, said economist Tendai Moyo.\n\nSocial commentator Nomalanga Dube added: While Comic Elders talent is undeniable, these gestures risk sending the wrong message about what constitutes national contribution. It suggests that fame and political connections are rewarded more than hard work in essential sectors like health, education, and agriculture.\n\nChivayo concluded:\n\nLet this gesture serve as an INSPIRATION to all young people, that with PATIENCE, hard work, and PASSION, your time will certainly come. In GODs time, He will make everything PERFECT! To my young brother Comic Elder, well done and a BIG CONGRATULATIONS to you, please continue to make ZIMBABWE laugh \n\n",

He reportedly drives a vehicle for Masvingo West, Chadzamiras constituency, where Chadzamira is the elected MP.\n\nPolice sources said that while investigators could technically proceed with the court case using alternative evidence, Mutanhos political connections make him effectively untouchable.\n\nHe is too powerful and too well-connected for us to move against him aggressively, said one police source.\n\nThere are growing concerns that the matter, reported by Savanhu under RRB 6403795 on July 23, 2025, might be stalled or deliberately slowed due to Mutanhos influence.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Supreme Court has given Fernicary Farm (T/A Rutendo Farm), owned by former water resources minister Munacho Mutezo, a reprieve after it reinstated its appeal against a High Court ruling which awarded Des Monies Farm (Pvt) Ltd, US$455,000 in compensation for farm improvements.\n\nDes Monies Farm is represented by Philemon Thambatshira Matibe.\n\nThe dispute arose after Matibe moved from Botswana in 2019 to take up farming operations at Rutendo Farm, on an eight-year lease, and later claimed to have invested over US$750,000 in improvements on the farm.\n\nThis was after he had been evicted from the farm for nonpayment of rentals and vandalism of equipment and machinery at Rutendo Farm, according to court records.\n\nMutezo had repeatedly raised these issues in writing, but they were ignored resulting in him obtaining a court-ordered eviction against Matibe.\n\nAfter eviction, Matibe sued, claiming compensation for alleged improvements which included the repair of external and internal roads, erection of fences to mark the farm boundaries, refurbishment of the main house. water reticulation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure.\n\nHowever, according to the lease agreement, all improvements required Mutezos prior approval, and an independent valuation.\n\nAccording to Rutendo Farm represented by Mutezo , neither condition was met but Des Monies Farm claimed that a worker at the farm had approved all the improvements that it undertook at the farm although no documentation such as invoices, receipts, quotations, bank statements, requisitions or valuation reports was produced.\n\nRutendo Farm (Mutezo) had argued that at the time Matibe moved in, the farm was already well-equipped with tractors, ploughs, irrigation systems, barns, and well-maintained roads. Photographs and messages supporting this were presented in court but were allegedly ignored\n\nRutendo Farm had argued that a joint inspection by both parties and their lawyers revealed there was no evidence of improvements. What was seen was the vandalism and damage that had been done by the lessee (Matibe) It said the alleged improvements included normal operational costs (like land ripping,liming), his supervision of farming operations and also even council road grading, which clearly did not constitute legitimate farm improvements.\n\nDes Monies Farm also claimed amounts such as US$150,000 for bush clearance, which Rutendo Farm argued were operational costs, not farm improvements.\n\nRutendo Farm further questioned the economic logic of investing the alleged USS750,000 on a farm with six-year lease that would take over 30 years to recover was deemed irrational and thus untrue. That amount was enough to buy him his own two or three farms.\n\nDespite this, the High Courts Commercial Division awarded Matibes Des Monies Farm US$455,000 in damages.\n\nRutendo Farm (Mutezo) sought to appeal against the High Court judgment but could not timeously do so and it missed deadlines in serving its notice of appeal, causing the case to be deemed abandoned.\n\nThe delay in filing the notice of appeal was because Rutendo Farms (Mutezos) lawyers at the time were under the mistaken belief that under the IECMS system, (electronic case management system used by the courts) the registrar of the court would be automatically served.\n\nKey features of IECMS include online document filing and tracking.\n\nHowever, Supreme Court judge, Justice George Chiweshe, sitting in chambers, ruled that although Rutendo Farm had failed to meet procedural timelines, its case carried reasonable prospects of success, allowing the appeal to proceed.\n\nAlthough the delay in complying with the infringed rule is not inordinate, the explanation for such delay is not plausible. However, I am of the view that the intended appeal has reasonable prospects of success. It is for that reason that the application must succeed, Chiweshe said.\n\nIn the result it is ordered as follows: the application for reinstatement of appeal be and is hereby granted.\n\nThe Supreme Courts ruling means the appeal will now be heard on its merits, setting the stage for a decisive judgment in this commercial farming dispute.\n\nThe reprieve given to Rutendo Farm (Mutezo) came after farm machinery and livestock belonging to Rutendo Farm was auctioned in August this year to settle Matibe after the High Court ruling and the subsequent delay in filling the Supreme Court appeal.\n\nENDS\n\n",

Edited by Dr Richard Mahomva, director of International Communication Services in the Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, alongside Professor Paul Mapfumo and Mr Tawanda Zinyama, the book details how the Second Republic under President Mnangagwa has repositioned Zimbabwe on the global stage through progressive, people-oriented policies and pragmatic diplomacy.\n\nSince taking office in 2017, President Mnangagwa is credited with reshaping both domestic and foreign policy. His famous mantra, Zimbabwe is Open for Business, is described in the book as symbolising a break from the past and an invitation to global investors, development partners, and the diaspora community to be part of Zimbabwes economic renaissance.\n\nChapter 13, titled Zimbabwes Second Republic: A Dispensation of Pragmatism, Inclusivity, and Citizen-Centric Approaches, highlights this transformation. The book states: President Mnangagwas epoch-defining clarion call, Zimbabwe is Open for Business, marked the end of the countrys nearly two-decade-long isolationist foreign policy trajectory. This open-minded and pragmatic perspective of engaging all friendly nations has repositioned Zimbabwe as a partner of choice in Africa and beyond.\n\nThe publication portrays the President as steering the nation into a new era, where pragmatic governance and inclusivity are central to Zimbabwes economic and diplomatic revival.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent  Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) Commander, General Philip Valerio Sibanda, is set to retire next month, in what political and military insiders describe as a carefully managed transition that could position him for a senior role within ZANU PFs top leadership.\n\nAccording toThe Masvingo Mirror, preparations for Sibandas handover of command are already underway at the KG6 military headquarters in Harare, signalling that the long-serving commander is on his way out. Sibanda, who has led the ZDF since 2017 following Constantino Chiwengas elevation to the vice presidency, is currently on pre-retirement leave and is expected to formally exit service by November 23, 2025.\n\nSources say the handovertakeover ceremony is tentatively scheduled for November 9, and that the process is being quietly managed under President Emmerson Mnangagwas direct supervision.\n\nWhile ZDF Director of Public Relations Colonel Charles Mutizhe dismissed the reports as speculative, insisting that no official communication had been made, Defence Ministry insiders confirmed that Sibandas retirement plans were already in motion. For now, no official communication has been done regarding the matter, and should the General retire, the media will be made aware through a press statement, said Mutizhe. Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri declined to comment.\n\nGeneral Sibanda, who turned 71 this year, has served as the commander of the Defence Forces for eight years, maintaining a reputation for professionalism and restraint in a period marked by intense political manoeuvring within both the security sector and ZANU PF.\n\nAlthough largely viewed as apolitical compared to some of his peers, Sibanda briefly found himself at the centre of controversy last year when President Mnangagwa appointed him as an ex officio member of the ZANU PF Politburo. The appointment  unprecedented for a sitting military commander  was widely interpreted as a strategic move by Mnangagwa to draw Sibanda into the political fold and balance internal power dynamics with his ambitious deputy, Vice President Chiwenga.\n\nHowever, the decision backfired almost immediately. Legal experts, including constitutional lawyer Advocate Tabani Mpofu, condemned the move as unconstitutional, citing Section 208(3) of Zimbabwes Constitution, which prohibits serving members of the security services from engaging in partisan political activities. Within weeks, Sibandas name was quietly removed from the Politburo list  a move that saved the government from a potential court challenge but also exposed the blurring lines between party politics and the military establishment.\n\nDespite the controversy, analysts believe the appointment revealed Mnangagwas long-term intentions. Mnangagwa was testing the waters for a post-military political transition for Sibanda, said a political analyst based in Harare. The idea was to bring him closer to the party structure and position him as a stabilising figure  someone who could secure loyalty within the security sector while maintaining public confidence.\n\nSibandas exit comes amid a broader reshuffle of Zimbabwes security leadership as Mnangagwa tightens his grip on the state ahead of the 2028 elections. In recent months, the President has replaced long-serving Police Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga with Stephen Mutamba and appointed Fulton Mangwaya as the new Director-General of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), succeeding Isaac Moyo.\n\nThese changes are widely viewed as part of a broader strategy to weaken military-linked factions aligned with Vice President Chiwenga, who still commands loyalty within sections of the armed forces and war veterans. Analysts say Mnangagwas reshuffle reflects his determination to secure both political and military control in the run-up to the next election.\n\nSibandas retirement, therefore, may be more than routine. According to sources within ZANU PF, he is being considered for a top party or cabinet post following his exit  a move that would allow Mnangagwa to reward loyalty while keeping the respected general within his political orbit. Mnangagwa wants Sibanda close enough to neutralise any potential threat but far enough to prevent him from becoming an independent power centre, one senior party insider toldThe Masvingo Mirror.\n\nSince taking over the Defence Forces in 2017, Sibanda has been regarded as a moderating influence in the military  a contrast to the openly political posture of some of his predecessors. His disciplined leadership helped stabilise the army after the 2017 coup that ousted Robert Mugabe, but his growing proximity to the political elite suggests that the boundary between the barracks and the party continues to blur.\n\nAs Mnangagwa prepares for his succession and the 2028 elections, the generals next role will be closely watched. Whether as a Politburo member, cabinet minister, or diplomat, General Sibandas transition from the military to the political arena could reshape Zimbabwes power landscape  marking the latest phase in Mnangagwas effort to consolidate authority and manage the delicate balance between ZANU PF and the armed forces.\n\n",
