            "content": "By A Correspondent  Nine students at a Mutare school missed the Zimbabwe School Examinations Council (ZIMSEC) Family and Religious Studies (FRS) Ordinary Level exam after the headmaster and school director refused them entry, citing inappropriate haircuts.\n\nEducation Minister Torerai Moyo condemned the officials actions, saying they violated the learners rights and went against Ministry guidelines. While the Ministry does not have a strict policy on hairstyles, it expects students to be neatly dressed with haircuts that clearly identify them as pupils.\n\nThe headmaster and director were arrested two weeks ago on Friday and appeared in the Mutare Magistrates Court the following Monday, Moyo said. Both were granted bail and are scheduled to return to court on 9 December 2025.\n\nThe blocked students arrived 55 minutes after the exam began, missing the Ministrys 15-minute entry window and thus the opportunity to sit the test.\n\nThe incident has sparked discussion on the balance between enforcing school appearance standards and protecting students right to education, raising questions about how far disciplinary measures should go.\n\n",

In an era of rising cyber threats, vigilance is key. If you receive a WhatsApp message from a relative or friend urgently requesting money, always call them directly using a voice call to verify their identity before responding. Hackers often compromise accounts and exploit your contact list to scam loved ones. May the good Lord bless your Wednesday.\n\nWhile many welcomed the guidance as timely, the message drew mixed reactions from the public. Critics pointed to Maveteras affiliation with the ruling Zanu PF party, which has faced accusations of manipulating polls and contributing to economic instability, questioning whether her advisory addresses the deeper vulnerabilities faced by Zimbabweans.\n\nCybersecurity experts have also stressed the importance of verifying contacts, avoiding sharing personal information online, and remaining alert to unusual messages, particularly those requesting money transfers.\n\nMaveteras warning highlights the growing cybercrime risks in Zimbabwe, but the mixed public response reflects broader frustrations with governance and economic challenges that leave many citizens exposed to fraud.\n\nTatenda Mavetera ICT Minister\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri While the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) celebrates a sharp decline in inflation, many ordinary citizens remain sceptical, as the touted economic recovery has yet to improve daily life for most Zimbabweans.\n\nAt its 1 December 2025 meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) announced that annual inflation had dropped from 82.7% in September to 19.0% in November, with projections for single-digit inflation in early 2026.\n\nGovernor John Mushayavanhu credited the reduction to prudent monetary policy and strong foreign currency inflows.\n\nHowever, critics argue that these statistics do little to alleviate the hardships faced by households and businesses. The Bank Policy Rate remains at a punishing 35%, while high statutory reserve requirements for deposits continue to restrict access to affordable credit. Small businesses and ordinary borrowers are left struggling, unable to take advantage of the reported macroeconomic improvements.\n\nThe RBZ also highlighted over US$13 billion in foreign currency inflows and US$1 billion in reserves as stabilising factors for the Willing-Buyer Willing-Seller (WBWS) foreign exchange system. Yet many analysts warn that reliance on external inflows leaves Zimbabwe vulnerable to global economic shocks, while domestic production and liquidity constraints continue to frustrate local enterprises.\n\nEven the reduction of the Intermediated Money Transfer Tax (IMTT) from 2% to 1.5% on ZIG-denominated transactions is seen by some as a minor relief that does not address the broader economic challenges affecting ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nDespite the MPC projecting 6.6% economic growth for 2025, sceptics warn that the figures remain largely theoretical, highlighting a growing disconnect between macroeconomic indicators and the lived realities of citizens. Until policies translate into tangible benefitsaffordable credit, lower borrowing costs, and improved access to basic goodsthe celebrated economic recovery may remain an abstract promise rather than a lived reality for Zimbabweans.\n\nZiG notes on display\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri  Zanu PF leader Emmerson Mnangagwa on Wednesday publicly appealed for unity within his party, a move widely seen as an acknowledgment of deepening divisions, factionalism and growing resistance among senior members.\n\nAddressing the 388th Ordinary Session of the Zanu PF Politburo at the partys headquarters in Harare, Mnangagwa urged party structures to stop gatekeeping and allow new members to join, signalling rising internal tensions ahead of the 2028 elections.\n\nZanu PF must accommodate new members, he said. Let us not put ourselves and individuals above the party. Our activities must be guided by the constitutions of the party.\n\nHis remarks come amid complaints that long-serving elites are blocking new entrants to protect their influence, creating friction within the party.Mnangagwa warned the Politburo to take responsibility and restore discipline, saying: The Politburo must provide bold guidance for the party. Let us remain disciplined and never put the partys name into disrepute.\n\nAnalysts say the unusually strong language reflects growing instability within Zanu PF, where power struggles and mistrust continue to overshadow government business.\n\nMnangagwa also repeated his claim that unnamed enemies were working to destabilise the country. I challenge the nation to continue to be vigilant safeguarding against any machinations by our enemies, he said  a statement critics often dismiss as a tactic to deflect from domestic problems.\n\nThe President went on to push his long-standing vision for Zimbabwe to become an upper middle-income economy by 2030, despite widespread doubt from citizens struggling with rising prices, low wages and deteriorating public services.\n\nLet us turn Zimbabwe to an upper middle income economy by 2030. The duty is ours, he said. Mnangagwa added that sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, commodity exports and diaspora remittances were giving a positive balance on the current account.\n\nHowever, the optimistic rhetoric did little to mask the underlying message of the day: Zanu PF is grappling with serious internal turmoil, and its leader is now openly pleading for order.\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri- The Action Democratic Movement (ADM) has issued a powerful call for Zimbabwean churches to reclaim their moral authority, warning religious leaders against becoming instruments of political power while citizens continue to suffer.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, ADM reminded church leaders that their true role is not to serve government interests or provide cover for corruption, but to act as the nations conscience. You were not created to be an extension of government power, nor a shelter for corruption, nor a silent witness to suffering, the statement read.\n\nThe movement highlighted alarming realities facing ordinary Zimbabweans: children learning under trees, women dying in childbirth, families going hungry, victims of abuse suffering in silence, and corruption devouring national resources.\n\nADM criticised the Church for speaking loudly on select issues, such as abortion, while remaining silent on child abuse, domestic violence, political violence, poverty, sexual abuse within churches, exploitation of congregants, and theft of national resources. The Gospel is not selective. Righteousness is not seasonal. Justice is not political. Truth is not negotiable, the statement said.\n\nThe party emphasised that its message is not an attack on Christianity, but a demand for a return to authentic faith. It urged religious leaders to:\n\nReturn to truth even when it is uncomfortable\n\nStand with the oppressed even at personal risk\n\nReject corruption even when profitable\n\nProtect the vulnerable, especially the poor\n\nSpeak boldly for the voiceless\n\nResist political capture\n\nTrue Christianity is not about proximity to powerit is about courage to challenge power, ADM said.\n\nThe statement concluded with a call for spiritual and moral renewal: Rise again, Zimbabwean Church. Be the shepherd, not the spectator. Be the watchman, not the worshipper of power. Be the voice, not the echo.\n\nADMs warning is expected to spark debate over the role of religious institutions in confronting injustice and protecting the vulnerable in Zimbabwe.\n\nAction Democratic Movement\n\n",

Friends and family know her as Happiness, a name that reflects her warm personality and deep commitment to maternal health. She explained her academic motivation:\n\nI really wanted to learn about the populations that I was serving and how to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, which is why I completed an additional degree in Geography and Environmental Studies, as well as a Monitoring and Evaluation Special Honours Postgraduate.\n\nSeeking broader exposure, Mushaninga moved to Doncaster in January 2023 to apply her skills in a developed healthcare system and to deepen her understanding of maternal and neonatal care. She credits the Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (DBTH) for making her transition smooth:\n\nIve been supported by the Trust every step of the way  from finding accommodation and completing bootcamp to registering with the Nursing and Midwifery Council, to helping me reunite with my family five months later.Their support has been incredible, and having my family here has made all the difference.\n\nHer dedication quickly paid off. In less than a year as a Rotational Midwife, Mushaninga was appointedDeputy Ward Managera role that reflects both her clinical expertise and leadership potential.\n\nShe further strengthened her professional profile by completing a leadership programme with theFlorence Nightingale Foundationand participating inElevate, an initiative that supports career advancement for ethnic minority staff.\n\nToday, Mushaninga also serves as aCultural Safety Support Championat DBTH. She sits on theDecision-Making Councilfor internationally educated healthcare professionals and contributes to thePROMPTfaculty, where she supports colleagues and trains students across maternity services.\n\nReflecting on her remarkable rise, she said:\n\nWhen I came here, I didnt see myself being where I am today, but there are so many opportunities in the NHS.My Trust made us aware of them, and I just grabbed every one that came my way.I had to be uncomfortable to become comfortable.\n\nHer journey is now an inspiration to many Zimbabwean health professionals seeking opportunities beyond the countrys borders.\n\n",
