The statement read:\n\nPUBLIC NOTICE:NOTICE TO ALL CHURCHES\n\nThe Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) wishes to inform all churches about an upcoming Stakeholder Engagement. This forum aims to address tax compliance across all applicable tax categories, as part of ZIMRAs commitment to transparency and compliance support.

He described Ndlovus decision to accept the car as a mockery of his otherwise stellar reputation.\n\nIts sad to note that Peter accepted Chivayos gift.\n\nThe question is, where did the money come from? Coltart questioned, implying that Chivayos financial dealings might not be above board.\n\nThe controversy has cast a shadow over Ndlovus legacy, as critics argue that associating with such a figure could damage his public image.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa once again found himself taking over ministerial duties typically performed by other officials. On Thursday, the President traveled from Harare to Shurugwi to officiate at the commissioning of the newly upgraded Shurugwi-Mhandamabwe Road. Ordinarily, such a task would fall under the purview of the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development, but Mnangagwas involvement raises questions about the role of the Minister in overseeing infrastructure projects.\n\nAt the event, President Mnangagwa spoke about the importance of infrastructure development, stating that the country will continue to score major milestones in infrastructure development, by harnessing deliberate policies enunciated by the Second Republic. He emphasized that such projects are central to the vision of the current administration, which has focused heavily on improving Zimbabwes national road network.\n\nThe Shurugwi-Mhandamabwe Road, which had been in poor condition for years, has been transformed into a modern, multi-million dollar road. The project, which involved widening the road and other extensive upgrades, is expected to alleviate traffic congestion and improve connectivity. Notably, this road links the Beitbridge Border Post with towns like Gweru and Kwekwe, offering a new route that avoids the previously winding path through Masvingo.\n\nMnangagwa was pleased to highlight the significance of the roads completion for the Midlands province, commenting, Look at the development which is there now, in the 40s we would say there is one secondary school in one district. Im very happy that this development was registered under the Second Republic. He further noted his pride in the ongoing progress, emphasizing the trajectory of the countrys infrastructure under his administration.\n\nAs Mnangagwa continues to step into roles beyond his presidential duties, one might wonder about the specific responsibilities of the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development. Why is the President personally handling tasks traditionally managed by other cabinet members, such as the commissioning of a key infrastructure project?\n\n",

Police were subsequently notified.\n\nThe Criminal Investigations Department (CID) Vehicle Theft Squad is investigating the case, adding it to the growing list of gun-related crimes plaguing the country.\n\nSince the 2017 military-led coup that ousted long-time ruler Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe has witnessed a concerning proliferation of firearms.\n\nAnalysts point to political instability, weakened law enforcement, and porous borders as key contributors to the surge in illegal guns.\n\nThis has fueled an alarming rise in violent crimes, including armed robberies, cash heists, carjackings, and home invasions.\n\nThe brazen attack on a high-profile political figures vehicle highlights how gun violence is spiralling out of control, posing a significant threat to public safety.\n\n",
