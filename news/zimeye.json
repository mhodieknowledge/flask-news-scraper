            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda- Police in Beitbridge have arrested two men who were intercepted with a firearm on Monday as they attempted to gain access to a function where President Emmerson Mnangagwa was officiating at a groundbreaking ceremony.\n\nThe arrests occurred at a security checkpoint just a few hundred meters from the venue, where Mnangagwa, alongside his deputies Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi, was leading a high-profile event attended by approximately 1,000 people.\n\nWe are investigating such a case. Our Criminal Investigation Department is holding some men in connection with that offence, and that is all I can say for now, Beitbridge Police District commander Chief Superintendent Mesuli Ncube confirmed.\n\nThe incident has heightened concerns over Mnangagwas security, especially in the wake of increasing tensions within ZANU-PF and reports of military activity in the capital.\n\nLast week, Harare residents witnessed the unusual sight of army tanks rolling through the citys streets, sparking speculation about internal power struggles within the ruling party and potential threats to Mnangagwas hold on power.\n\nThe presence of military hardware in Harare immediately drew comparisons to the events leading up to the November 2017 coup that toppled former President Robert Mugabe.\n\nWhile the government has said the tanks were on routine drills, sources within the security sector, suggest it may have been a show of force amid growing discord within ZANU-PF.\n\nVice President Constantino Chiwenga, a former army general, has been at the centre of speculation regarding internal factionalism, with some political analysts suggesting he still enjoys strong backing from elements within the military. The sighting of tanks has only fueled suspicions that Mnangagwas grip on power is increasingly being challenged from within.\n\nAdding to the turmoil, war veteran and Zanu PF central Committee member Blessed Geza recently launched a scathing attack on Mnangagwa, accusing him of being a failed leader who has lost control of both the economy and the state apparatus.\n\nGezas criticism and outburst shared widely on social media, has intensified the ongoing debate about Mnangagwas leadership amid economic hardships, corruption allegations, and growing discontent within his party.\n\nFactional battles have long plagued ZANU-PF, and with the 2028 elections on the horizon, tensions appear to be reaching a boiling point.\n\nChiwenga, who played a key role in ousting Mugabe, is believed to be positioning himself for a possible leadership takeover. Mnangagwa is reportedly consolidating his power through purges and strategic appointments within the party and the security forces.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has once again praised the involvement of Chinese investors in Zimbabwes economy, this time lauding a significant US$3.6 billion energy generation project being developed by Chinese firm Xinganglian.\n\nThe project, a part of the Palm River Energy Metallurgical initiative located in Beitbridge, is expected to boost the countrys energy sector and create jobs.\n\nAt the commissioning event this Monday, Mnangagwa took the opportunity to reaffirm Zimbabwes status as a favorable investment destination, claiming that the Chinese investment was proof of the countrys growing appeal to foreign investors. This project is a clear testament to the successful partnerships we are fostering through our engagement and re-engagement policies, Mnangagwa said. We are pleased to welcome more investments from China and our global partners who recognize the potential in Zimbabwe.\n\nDespite the optimistic rhetoric, the Palm River project raises some important questions about the long-term sustainability and impact of these foreign investments. While the President emphasized the projects role in advancing industrialization, technological progress, and energy self-sufficiency, there are increasing concerns about the nature of these foreign partnerships. Critics argue that while Chinese investments have provided capital, they often come with terms that benefit foreign entities more than the local population.\n\nThe energy metallurgical plant, which will be part of the Beitbridge Special Economic Zone, combines two crucial industriesenergy and metallurgyand aims to push the countrys industrial development agenda. According to Mnangagwa, the integration of sustainable mining practices, low greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling of waste are key components of the project. However, some critics question whether the environmental promises will be met, considering the history of mining projects in the region.\n\nDespite the positive outlook on the project, there remains skepticism regarding the governments ability to ensure that the benefits of such projects reach the local communities. President Mnangagwa called on mining companies to comply with Zimbabwes regulations and better serve local people, but many are unconvinced that these companies will do so without significant government oversight.\n\nThe Palm River Energy Metallurgical project is just one of several major collaborations between China and Zimbabwe. The Chinese government and its companies have been involved in a variety of projects, including the expansion of the Hwange 7 and 8 thermal power stations, the construction of the New Parliament Building in Mt Hampden, and upgrades to the countrys airports. However, as Zimbabwe continues to lean heavily on Chinese investments, there is increasing public debate about the broader implications of such relianceespecially as local communities remain on the sidelines while foreign companies reap the rewards.\n\nWhile the governments economic policy positions emphasize job creation and technological innovation, it remains to be seen whether these promises will materialize into lasting improvements for ordinary Zimbabweans, or if they will simply serve as another chapter in a growing dependence on foreign powers with mixed consequences.\n\n",

            "content": "Dar es Salaam, Tanzania  In a significant diplomatic development, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East African Community (EAC) have appointed three eminent former African leaders to lead peace mediation efforts in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where prolonged hostilities between government forces and rebel groups have caused thousands of deaths and displaced millions.\n\nThe appointed mediators include former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, and former Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn Boshe. This appointment follows a joint summit of the SADC and EAC, co-chaired by SADC Chairman President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe and EAC Chair President William Ruto of Kenya, in Tanzania earlier this month.\n\nMandate of the Mediators:\n\nThe trio of experienced African statesmen will facilitate the EAC-SADC peace process, a merger of the Luanda and Nairobi processes, aimed at halting the violent conflict in Eastern DRC. Their mandate includes:\n\n Enforcing an immediate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities.\n\n Coordinating humanitarian assistance for displaced communities.\n\n Securing main supply routes to ensure the flow of aid and commerce.\n\n Developing a security plan for Goma and surrounding areas.\n\n Reopening Goma Airport and assessing additional interventions to stabilize the region.\n\nDiplomatic and Military Coordination:\n\nOn 21st February 2025, the EAC Chiefs of Defence Forces held preparatory meetings in Nairobi, focusing on the security dynamics in Eastern DRC. Simultaneously, the SADC Chiefs of Defence Forces convened in Dar es Salaam, adhering to directives from the joint summit on 8th February 2025.\n\nA Joint EAC-SADC Chiefs of Defence Forces Meeting took place yesterday in Dar es Salaam, setting the stage for the Joint Ministerial Meeting on February 28, which aims to finalize the terms of the ceasefire agreement.\n\nCeasefire Urgency:\n\nThe EAC-SADC joint statement called on all parties, including M23 rebels and other armed groups, to halt hostilities and respect the ceasefire. The situation in Goma, a strategic and resource-rich provincial capital, remains tense, with rebels controlling large portions of Eastern DRC.\n\nInternational Backing:\n\nThe United Nations Security Council recently adopted a unanimous resolution condemning the M23s offensive, amplifying international pressure on armed groups to withdraw and support peace efforts.\n\nHumanitarian Crisis:\n\nThe conflict has created a severe humanitarian crisis, with millions of civilians forced to flee their homes. Aid agencies are struggling to provide essential support, including food, shelter, and medical assistance.\n\nLooking Forward:\n\nWith the combined diplomatic weight of SADC and EAC, and the experienced leadership of Kenyatta, Obasanjo, and Desalegn, there is renewed hope for a lasting resolution to the conflict. The international community and regional stakeholders will closely monitor progress, as any failure to secure peace could have devastating consequences for the Great Lakes region and beyond.\n\nThis is a developing story, and further updates will be provided as they become available.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a move that appears more focused on political maneuvering than genuine development, the government of Zimbabwe has launched the much-publicized Presidential Rural Solar Installation programme in Mashonaland West. This project, which is meant to electrify up to 1.2 million rural households by 2030, is being rolled out as part of a broader narrative of rural empowerment and industrialization.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting in Chinhoyi, the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Honourable Marian Chombo, framed the initiative as a major step towards bridging the urban-rural divide. This project demonstrates our commitment to sustainable energy solutions, she proclaimed, conveniently tying it to the Presidents rural industrialization agenda. The truth, however, may not be so simple.\n\nChombo highlighted that the programme would solarize at least 1.2 million households across the nation by 2030, with an ambitious goal of benefiting 200,000 households annually starting in 2025. Yet, given Zimbabwes track record of over-promised but under-delivered initiatives, this claim raises more questions than it answers.\n\nMr. Gabriel Jaji, the Permanent Secretary for Mashonaland West Provincial Affairs and Devolution, added that Kariba district would spearhead the programme, due to its perceived vulnerability. He emphasized that districts such as Siyakobvu and Mola would be prioritized, but again, one cannot ignore the political undertones of this decisionKariba is home to many voters from various influential constituencies. Could this move be an attempt to court support ahead of upcoming elections?\n\nThe governments narrative is further bolstered by the involvement of several local authorities and organizations, including the Rural Electrification Agency (REA), the Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (RIDA), and Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT). These stakeholders have applauded the programme as a means to reduce dependence on non-renewable energy and catalyze rural industrialization. However, skepticism lingers.\n\nIdentifying needy communities in blackout zones is a start, but the true test will lie in the delivery, said Engineer Last Sauramba, highlighting that real change requires more than just flashy announcements. The focus on training local youths to handle installation and maintenance sounds promising, but one has to wonder whether this initiative is aimed at long-term sustainability or merely serving as a temporary solution to score political points.\n\nFor all the talk of rural empowerment, its hard to ignore the optics of a government that has a history of unveiling major projects right before an election season. The emphasis on vulnerable groups such as war veterans and households in need may seem altruistic, but is it really about addressing energy poverty, or is it simply a ploy to rally rural voters?\n\nIn the end, the solar initiative may or may not bring tangible benefits to the people of Mashonaland West. But with the election cycle on the horizon, one cannot help but wonder if this is all just another political gimmick designed to win the hearts and minds of a crucial constituency. Only time will tell whether this ambitious project delivers on its promises or fades into the background like so many others before it.\n\n",

The verdict was delivered by Gweru regional magistrate Mr. Christopher Maturure, who found Jackson guilty of the lesser offense of having sexual intercourse with a minor, as opposed to the original rape charges.\n\nJackson, represented by Mr. Esau Mandipa of Mandipa, Makwara, and Chikukwa Legal Practice, entered a not-guilty plea to the rape charges. However, at the conclusion of the States case, the court convicted him under Section 70(1) of Zimbabwes Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, which criminalizes consensual sexual intercourse with minors aged between 12 and 16.\n\nSentencing and Legal Considerations\n\nMagistrate Maturure sentenced Jackson to five years in prison, with two years suspended on the condition of good behavior, meaning Jackson will serve an effective three-year jail term. The court emphasized the need to protect minors from sexual exploitation and abuse, underscoring the serious legal consequences of such offenses.\n\nCase Details:\n\nProsecutor Mr. Talent Tadenyika told the court that the incident occurred on October 28, 2022, involving a 14-year-old female complainant residing at ZRP Main Camp, Gweru, who was a neighbor to Jackson.\n\nAfter returning home from a party at Windsor Park suburbs and finding her house locked, the complainant was approached by Jackson, who offered to take her to Milan Family Restaurant. During the outing, he bought her food and later parked his vehicle outside Gweru Rural Police Station, where the initial incident occurred. Jackson then took the complainant back to his residence, where a second encounter happened.\n\nThe complainant disclosed the events to her parents the following morning, leading to Jacksons arrest and subsequent trial.\n\nCommunity Reaction and Legal Implications\n\nThe sentencing has sparked discussions within the Gweru community about the responsibilities of law enforcement officers and the critical need to safeguard childrens rights. The case also serves as a reminder of the strict enforcement of laws against sexual offenses involving minors.\n\nAuthorities urge the public to report any suspicious activities involving minors to prevent further incidents of abuse and exploitation.\n\nThis is a developing story, and further updates will be provided as more information becomes available.\n\n",

Frankly, we cant keep going like this. The situation is unacceptable, and people are suffering because of it.\n\nMakumire, who has been the sole opposition representative for Chiredzi in Parliament since 2023, expressed deep concern over the governments lack of urgency in improving healthcare infrastructure and services.\n\nHe criticized the government for repeatedly neglecting the needs of citizens, especially in rural areas where healthcare facilities are severely underfunded and under-equipped.\n\nHe emphasized that the recent deaths from accidents were a stark reminder of how dire the situation had become. These deaths could have been prevented if our hospitals were adequately equipped to handle emergencies, he said. This is a matter of life and death, and we need to fix our hospitals now.\n\nMakumires remarks reflect the growing frustration of many Zimbabweans who feel abandoned by the government when it comes to basic services like healthcare. The Chiredzi MPs call for immediate reform serves as a powerful reminder of the urgent need for change in Zimbabwes healthcare system.\n\n",

His lawyer, Chris Mhike, confirmed Mhlangas detention and his expected court appearance the following day.\n\nGeza, for his part, is now wanted by authorities on multiple charges, including insulting the President. His wife, Roseline Tawengwa, has also been detained by the police, with the whereabouts of Geza still unknown.\n\nZINEF has strongly condemned Mhlangas arrest, emphasizing that his journalistic actions were legitimate and conducted in the public interest. The forum insists that the arrest of journalists for doing their jobs has a chilling effect on press freedom and undermines the constitutionally protected right to freedom of expression. In its statement, ZINEF demanded Mhlangas immediate release, urging authorities to ensure his safety in custody and refrain from any form of mistreatment.\n\nFurthermore, ZINEF reiterated its call for the government to respect the constitutional rights of journalists, particularly those enshrined in Section 61 of Zimbabwes Constitution. This section guarantees the right to freedom of expression, media freedom, and the right to seek and communicate information. The organization reminded the government that while freedom of expression does not extend to promoting violence or hate speech, Mhlangas interviews fall well within the bounds of journalistic and constitutional rights.\n\nZINEF also called for a safer working environment for journalists, free from harassment and intimidation. The organization expressed solidarity with Mhlanga, his family, and colleagues, emphasizing their continued commitment to advocating for the protection of journalists rights and press freedom in Zimbabwe.\n\nAmnesty International has also condemned the arrest, with a statement expressing strong support for Mhlanga. The human rights organization criticized the Zimbabwean authorities for using the justice system to suppress media freedom, which it views as essential for advancing human rights and a free society.\n\nAmnesty International called for the immediate release of Mhlanga and the unconditional dropping of all charges against him. The organization reaffirmed that journalism is not a crime, and media professionals should be allowed to work without fear of retaliation.\n\nThis incident highlights growing concerns about press freedom in Zimbabwe, where journalists continue to face intimidation and legal threats for their work.\n\nBoth local and international organizations have voiced their support for Mhlanga, calling for a free press and an end to government attempts to stifle independent journalism.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has once again praised the involvement of Chinese investors in Zimbabwes economy, this time lauding a significant US$3.6 billion energy generation project being developed by Chinese firm Xinganglian.\n\nThe project, a part of the Palm River Energy Metallurgical initiative located in Beitbridge, is expected to boost the countrys energy sector and create jobs.\n\nAt the commissioning event this Monday, Mnangagwa took the opportunity to reaffirm Zimbabwes status as a favorable investment destination, claiming that the Chinese investment was proof of the countrys growing appeal to foreign investors.\n\nThis project is a clear testament to the successful partnerships we are fostering through our engagement and re-engagement policies, Mnangagwa said. We are pleased to welcome more investments from China and our global partners who recognize the potential in Zimbabwe.\n\nDespite the optimistic rhetoric, the Palm River project raises some important questions about the long-term sustainability and impact of these foreign investments. While the President emphasized the projects role in advancing industrialization, technological progress, and energy self-sufficiency, there are increasing concerns about the nature of these foreign partnerships. Critics argue that while Chinese investments have provided capital, they often come with terms that benefit foreign entities more than the local population.\n\nThe energy metallurgical plant, which will be part of the Beitbridge Special Economic Zone, combines two crucial industriesenergy and metallurgyand aims to push the countrys industrial development agenda. According to Mnangagwa, the integration of sustainable mining practices, low greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling of waste are key components of the project. However, some critics question whether the environmental promises will be met, considering the history of mining projects in the region.\n\nDespite the positive outlook on the project, there remains skepticism regarding the governments ability to ensure that the benefits of such projects reach the local communities. President Mnangagwa called on mining companies to comply with Zimbabwes regulations and better serve local people, but many are unconvinced that these companies will do so without significant government oversight.\n\nThe Palm River Energy Metallurgical project is just one of several major collaborations between China and Zimbabwe. The Chinese government and its companies have been involved in a variety of projects, including the expansion of the Hwange 7 and 8 thermal power stations, the construction of the New Parliament Building in Mt Hampden, and upgrades to the countrys airports. However, as Zimbabwe continues to lean heavily on Chinese investments, there is increasing public debate about the broader implications of such relianceespecially as local communities remain on the sidelines while foreign companies reap the rewards.\n\nWhile the governments economic policy positions emphasize job creation and technological innovation, it remains to be seen whether these promises will materialize into lasting improvements for ordinary Zimbabweans, or if they will simply serve as another chapter in a growing dependence on foreign powers with mixed consequences.\n\n",
