Inside the main bedroom safe, the robbers took an additional USD55,000.\n\nAs the robbers continued their raid, Elphas Maruta, armed with a .303 rifle loaded with four rounds, advanced toward the house after being alerted to the robbery.\n\nA shootout ensued, with Maruta firing two shots and the suspects firing back three shots.\n\nThe gang ultimately fled the scene with a total of US$74,600 in cash and valuables. Police later recovered stolen property worth US$3,800.\n\n2 of the Wicknell Chivayo in laws who are robbery suspectspic.twitter.com/NDYj5KOhxF\n\n",

However, if FIFA finds South Africa guilty, they risk losing three points, which would significantly improve Nigerias chances of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nThe controversy surrounds South Africas 2-0 win over Lesotho, in which they allegedly fielded Teboho Mokoena, who had accumulated two yellow cards in previous games. According to FIFA rules, Mokoena should have been suspended for the match against Lesotho.\n\nMokoena picked up yellow cards in South Africas 2-1 win over Benin on matchday 1 and their 3-1 win over Zimbabwe on matchday 4. FIFA rules state that a player who receives two cautions in two different matches of the same competition will be automatically suspended from the teams subsequent match.\n\nHowever, Mokoena played in South Africas subsequent game against Lesotho, despite being ineligible. FIFA has yet to release a statement on the situation, leaving the Super Eagles waiting anxiously for a decision that could potentially change their World Cup qualifying fortunes.\n\n",

            "content": "Sports Correspondent\n\nThe Super Eagles of Nigeria are in a precarious position in their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign, and their upcoming match against Zimbabwe is crucial. Nigeria has had a dismal start to the campaign, with draws against Lesotho and Zimbabwe, a loss to Benin Republic, and a recent win against Rwanda.\n\nThe team currently sits fourth in Group C with six points from five matches, behind South Africa (10 pts), Benin (8 pts), and Rwanda (7 pts). With only the top two teams securing direct qualification for the World Cup, every point and result is crucial.\n\nTwo upcoming fixtures, South Africa vs. Benin and Rwanda vs. Lesotho, will have significant implications for Nigerias qualification hopes. A win for South Africa against Benin would widen the gap between them and Nigeria, while a draw or loss could reopen the race for the top spot.\n\nIn the other match, Rwanda faces Lesotho, a team that held Nigeria to a draw in Uyo. A win for Rwanda would revive their World Cup chances, while Lesotho hopes to prove their result in Nigeria was not a fluke. For Nigeria, a win for Rwanda and a draw in this game might be the most favorable outcome.\n\nUltimately, Nigeria must take responsibility and win their remaining matches, including tricky away ties against Benin, Rwanda, and South Africa.\n\nAnything short of that, and the three-time African champions risk missing out on the World Cup once again.\n\n",

            "content": "When walking along the road, it is crucial to prioritize your safety by always walking facing oncoming vehicles. By doing so, you enhance your ability to see approaching traffic and stay aware of your surroundings, relying on both your sight and hearing to assess potential dangers. This simple precaution allows you to step aside or into a safe area, such as a ditch, if a vehicle unexpectedly loses control.\n\nWalking with your back to traffic, on the other hand, puts you in a vulnerable position. In such a scenario, you would have to rely only on your ears to detect a vehicle approaching from behind, which can be risky. A driver may unintentionally hit you without you being aware of their presence, especially if they are speeding or driving too close to the edge of the road.\n\nAdditionally, to avoid the dangers of distracted walking, always keep your focus on the road ahead rather than on your mobile phone. While listening to music or podcasts can make your walk more enjoyable, it can be risky if it prevents you from hearing nearby vehicles. A simple solution is to keep one earphone out, ensuring you can still listen for approaching cars while enjoying your walk.\n\nWhile walking facing oncoming traffic is generally the safest option, its important to note that some areas, such as hills or sharp curves, may make this practice dangerous. In such areas, visibility is limited, and both you and oncoming vehicles may not see each other until its too late. In these situations, walking on the opposite side of the road might be the safer choice.\n\nBy staying alert, walking facing traffic, and avoiding distractions, you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and ensure a safer walking experience.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a controversial move, President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Monday rewarded Ezra Ruvai Chadzamira, his close ally and friend, as the Best Performing Minister of State.\n\nChadzamira, the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution in Masvingo, received this recognition despite mounting allegations of corruption and looting against him.\n\nSources within the Benjamin Burombo building in Masvingo have accused Chadzamira of embezzling farming inputs and unlawfully seizing sugarcane plots in Chiredzi.\n\nThese accusations have raised significant concerns among residents and political analysts, who question the integrity of rewarding someone under such serious allegations.\n\nOne source, speaking anonymously, stated, Chadzamira has been involved in several corrupt activities across Masvingo province, from looting agricultural supplies meant for farmers to taking over land in Chiredzi. Its no surprise that he has been recognized by Mnangagwa. It seems like corruption is being rewarded at the highest levels.\n\nDespite these serious claims, Chadzamiras recognition came during the Performance Contracts Signing and Awards Ceremony, where other government officials were also acknowledged for their contributions. Alongside Chadzamira, Honourable Felix Mhona was named Best Performing Cabinet Minister for 2024, while other officials like Engineer Joy Pedzisayi Makumbe and Dr. Addmore Pazvakavambwa were recognized for their roles in infrastructure and provincial affairs.\n\nThe award given to Chadzamira has sparked outrage, with critics arguing that it sends a troubling message. This is a clear example of the government rewarding its loyalists, even when they are involved in damaging activities. It is corruption at its finest, said one political commentator.\n\nChadzamiras reputation in Masvingo remains marred by accusations of abuse of power, but his continued political rise and this recent recognition illustrate the ongoing patronage system within Mnangagwas Zanu PF regime.\n\nAs tensions continue to rise, many are questioning whether such awards truly align with the values of transparency and good governance that the public desperately needs.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a move that has raised eyebrows, President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Monday presented a house to war veteran Cde Mujuru as part of a broader initiative aimed at securing the loyalty of former freedom fighters. The house was handed over during a ceremony at Murehwa Centre, marking the latest attempt by the Zanu PF leader to maintain the support of this influential group.\n\nAccording to a statement from Zanu PF, the house was given to Mujuru under the Presidential War Veterans Fund, borehole drilling, and Rural Housing Scheme.\n\nThe handover was facilitated by ZANU PF Secretary for War Veterans Affairs, Douglas Mahiya, and Special Presidential Advisor Paul Tungwarara.\n\nThe ceremony was also attended by the Mashonaland East provincial leadership, headed by Chairman Daniel Garwe.\n\nToday (Monday), ZANU PF Secretary for War Veterans Affairs Douglas Mahiya and Special Presidential Advisor Paul Tungwarara handed over a house at Murehwa center to Mash East based War Veteran Cde Mujuru under the Presidential War Veterans Fund, borehole drilling, and Rural Housing Scheme, read the statement from the ruling party.\n\nThe presentation of the house, along with the associated rural development projects, is widely seen as part of Mnangagwas strategy to appease and retain the support of war veterans who have played a critical role in the countrys political history. The addition of a borehole project, which addresses water shortages in rural areas, further demonstrates the governments attempt to make tangible improvements in the lives of those who fought for Zimbabwes independence.\n\nThis gesture comes at a time when Mnangagwas government has been facing increasing pressure from both within and outside the Zanu PF party. Many political analysts view these kinds of moves as attempts to secure the loyalty of key figures, especially from the war veterans community, who have often played a significant role in influencing political outcomes in Zimbabwe.\n\nHowever, critics have argued that these actions, which some consider bribes, highlight a broader pattern of patronage politics, where support is bought rather than earned through genuine development or policy changes. It seems that the government is using material gifts to secure loyalty instead of addressing the underlying issues affecting war veterans and the wider population, said one political analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAs the government continues to distribute resources under the guise of development programs, the motivations behind such acts are likely to remain a subject of intense debate in Zimbabwean political circles.\n\n",
