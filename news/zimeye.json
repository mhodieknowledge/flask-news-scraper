            "content": "By A Correspondent Masvingo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs, Ezra Chadzamira, has been implicated in the violent disruption of opposition politician Job Sikhalas book launch held in Masvingo last week,  a disruption that Sikhala has since described as an assassination attempt on his life.\n\nAccording to investigations by theMasvingo Mirror, the attack was carried out by a terror gang allegedly led by known Zanu PF activist Esau Mutanho and Zanu PF district youth secretary Mashingaidze Mabhucho.\n\nIt has since emerged that the group used a Zanu PF-branded Toyota Hilux Twin Cab (registration number AGE-0791), reportedly allocated to Chadzamira for his Masvingo West Constituency. Sources claim the youths involved in the disruption gathered at Dhiyo Shopping Centre, where Mutanho allegedly promised them generous payments from Minister Chadzamira once the mission was completed.\n\nSikhala, in response, has filed a US$150,000 lawsuit against Mutanho, whom he accuses of being central to what he now believes was a coordinated attempt on his life under the guise of political disruption.\n\nTheMirroris in possession of several videos allegedly showing Mutanho disrupting multiple events in Masvingo, including the Zanu PF primary elections in which Chadzamira was a contestant, and the Public Voluntary Organisations (PVO) Bill hearing held on May 16, 2024.\n\nEfforts to get a comment from Minister Chadzamira were unsuccessful. He did not answer calls nor respond to messages. Repeated visits byMirrorreporters to his offices at Benjamin Burombo Building also yielded no results, with officials saying he was away touring gold mines in the province.\n\nMutanho, who is also reportedly involved in illegal foreign currency dealings, refused to comment and instead accused the reporter of harassment.\n\nChadzamira is accused by sources of vowing to block all opposition meetings in the province, or any public gatherings that do not align with his political stance.\n\nOne of the youths involved in the disruption, Maguchu  reportedly unemployed and intoxicated at the time  told reporters he was proud of stopping the event. He claimed the speakers had insulted his President, in reference to President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\n",

The result leaves DeMbare firmly entrenched in the bottom half of the table, with pressure mounting on both players and technical staff.\n\nDespite dominating possession for large parts of the game, Dynamos once again lacked a cutting edge in front of goal and were ultimately punished by a late sucker punch from one of their own.

            "content": "By A Correspondent-Zanu PF has redeployed the fired Retired Lieutenant General Dr Engelbert Rugeje to China on a high-level agricultural investment mission, barely months after unceremoniously firing him from key ministerial boards, in a move widely interpreted as part of a broader purge targeting Vice President Constantino Chiwengas military allies.\n\nRugeje, once a prominent figure in the military-engineered 2017 coup that ousted the late Robert Mugabe and installed Mnangagwa, is leading a Zimbabwean delegation currently engaging the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences (JAAS) in Nanjing. The Chinese expressed interest in collaborative projects with Zimbabwean universities and agricultural institutions, and a memorandum of mutual cooperation was reportedly reached.\n\nThe visit, while seemingly routine, comes under the shadow of deepening internal tensions in ZANU-PF.\n\nRecently Rugeje was among five senior retired military officers summarily removed from the boards of the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB) and the Agricultural Marketing Authority.\n\nSources familiar with the developments said the purged generals were suspected of resisting Mnangagwas reported bid to extend his presidency beyond 2028.\n\nFrequent flyer rewards\n\nThe dismissals have fuelled speculation of an intensifying cold war between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga, with the latest moves seen as part of a wider strategy to weaken the vice presidents influence ahead of a potentially explosive ZANU-PF elective congress.\n\nBoth Rugeje and Chiwenga were central to the 2017 military operation that propelled Mnangagwa to power, but relations have since deteriorated amid fierce succession battles.\n\nA source toldZimEyethat the removals were meant to test Chiwengas capacity to respond or revolt, and signaled a new phase in the political chess game within the ruling elite. Rugeje declined to comment, referring questions to the Ministry of Agriculture, which had not responded at the time of publication.\n\nDespite his demotion, Rugeje was all diplomacy in China, projecting loyalty to Mnangagwa and reiterating Zimbabwes commitment to inclusive, agriculture-led economic growth. He praised the presidents Vision 2030 agenda, which targets a US$13.75 billion agricultural economy by 2025up from an initial US$8.2 billion goal. He also outlined strategic plans under the Agriculture and Food Systems Transformation Strategy to triple agricultural output by 2030.\n\nWe see immense potential in sectors such as maize, wheat, cotton, livestock, poultry, and horticulture. These areas are ripe for investment and growth, Rugeje told Chinese officials.\n\nHis delegation extended an invitation to JAAS for joint research, student exchanges, and curriculum development to help modernise Zimbabwes agriculture sector through smart technologies and innovation.\n\nBut analysts say Rugejes reassignment to a largely technical diplomatic mission, stripped of his former policymaking influence, signals a deliberate sideliningpart of Mnangagwas broader strategy to dismantle the remaining networks loyal to Chiwenga within the state, military, and party structures.\n\nFrequent flyer rewards\n\nSince the 2023 elections, which Mnangagwa controversially won amid widespread allegations of rigging, political tensions within ZANU-PF have been rising. Chiwengas silence has only heightened intrigue around his political future, as key allies are gradually being removed from influential roles.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether Mnangagwas tactical purges will neutralise internal resistanceor provoke the same kind of backlash that once toppled Robert Mugabe.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Zimbabwean government is pushing ahead with a proposed law to exhume, repatriate, and rebury thousands of fallen liberation war heroes  a move raising eyebrows as the country grapples with a deteriorating public health system.\n\nThe legislation, currently under legal review, aims to support a nationwide and cross-border effort to recover the remains of combatants still buried in unmarked mass graves more than four decades after the countrys independence.\n\nMinister of War Veterans Affairs Monica Mavhunga defended the move during a press briefing in Harare on Thursday, insisting it is a matter of national dignity and historical justice.\n\nAs we continue to look after surviving veterans, it is not lost on Government that there is a need for memorialisation through repatriation, exhumation, reburials and related processes, she said. This legislation is a key step towards fulfilling the promises made by comrades during the war that no one would be left behind.\n\nThe announcement comes just weeks ahead of the Heroes and Defence Forces commemorations set for August 11 and 12, and as government hospitals face chronic shortages of medicine, equipment, and personnel.\n\nCritics say the exhumation programme, however noble, exposes misplaced priorities in a nation battling collapsing health services, rampant drug stockouts, and low doctor morale.\n\nStill, authorities are pressing ahead. Minister Mavhunga said the process would involve several ministries, veterans associations, traditional leaders, political structures, and even foreign governments.\n\nThe Ministry has approached the Office of the President and Cabinet to provide guidance on a coordinated approach, she said. We are working hand-in-hand with the Ministries of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage; Local Government and Public Works; Foreign Affairs and International Trade and other stakeholders to ensure this is done in a dignified, inclusive and nationally guided manner.\n\nShe also commended the work already being done by the Fallen Heroes Trust of Zimbabwe and traditional leaders to identify and exhume remains in areas such as Masvingo, Hurungwe, Sanyati, and Rusape.\n\nI want to sincerely appreciate the work being done by the trusts, traditional leaders and communities who have kept this memory alive. Their role in identifying graves has been invaluable, Mavhunga said.\n\nMinister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Kazembe Kazembe added that the programme transcends political and geographical boundaries.\n\nThese gallant sons and daughters are still our heroes, said Kazembe. Whether they lie at the National Heroes Acre or in the bush, they are the foundation of our independence. We are crafting not only policy, but also a historical correction. The journey towards their reburial has begun.\n\nMavhunga said efforts were also underway to locate and honour fighters buried beyond Zimbabwes borders.\n\nWe are engaging neighbouring countries to assist with the identification and possible repatriation of our fighters. In cases where repatriation isnt possible, we will ensure their resting places are marked and preserved, she said.\n\nIn a recent exhumation operation at Sanyati Rest Camp, the Fallen Heroes Trust unearthed the remains of 29 ZIPRA fighters and is preparing to return to exhume 15 more, a mix of ZIPRA and ZANLA cadres. A total of 64 remains  55 ZIPRA and 9 ZANLA  will soon be reburied at the Grand Parade in Hurungwe in a joint ceremony.\n\nAs the Bill moves through Parliament, the government insists it is fulfilling Zimbabwes promise to its liberators  but critics are left wondering whether the living are being forgotten in the process.\n\n",

You dont just donate boreholes and goats to one church unless youre trying to manufacture loyalty.\n\nDespite the political suspicion, the practical benefits are visible. Local schools now have electric lighting, a first in the area. The solar borehole supplies clean water, and women are producing and selling uniforms thanks to sewing machines funded by the First Ladys office. One hundred goats are also expected to kickstart a livestock program.\n\nThe President is saying water is life. Let us complement the First Ladys work by taking care of this borehole, Muchinguri-Kashiri said.\n\nChurch officials were quick to defend the gesture. What the First Lady did here is more than charity. It changed how we think and live, said national chairperson Gwinyai Banganwa. Children are now going to better schools, people have clean water, and our women are making an income.\n\nBut critics remain skeptical, pointing out that such high-profile handouts in religious spaces blur the lines between faith, state, and party politics.\n\nIts campaign PR dressed as philanthropy, said a local teacher. Meanwhile, hospitals still lack basics like power and medicine.\n\nThe church has also entered talks with Marondera University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology to train congregants in agro-business, a move welcomed by both government and church representatives.\n\nStill, the lasting motive behind the First Ladys generosity remains under scrutiny. Today its goats and gifts, the civic leader said. Tomorrow, its ballots theyll be collecting.\n\n",
