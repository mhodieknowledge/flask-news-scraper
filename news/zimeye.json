            "content": "BREAKING LEGAL DRAMA: Lawyer Needs a Lawyer  Makebi Zulu Named in Pretoria Lawsuit as Lungu Family Faces Skyrocketing Legal Bills\n\nBy A Correspondent | PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA  In a jaw-dropping legal twist, prominent Zambian lawyer and politician Makebi Zulu has found himself at the center of an international legal showdown  one so tangled, its now being joked that even the lawyer needs a lawyer.\n\nThe family of late former Zambian President Edgar Chagwa Lungu is reportedly paying a staggering legal bill to Zulu, who is spearheading the familys efforts to bury the late leader in South Africa  a move now facing fierce resistance from the Zambian government. But heres the catch: Zulu is not admitted to the South African Bar, and by law, cannot argue in South African courts without meeting strict legal thresholds, including registering through the Legal Practice Council  just as no South African lawyer can argue in Zambian courts without passing through the ZIA.\n\nThe matter escalated dramatically this week when Zambias Attorney General, Mr. Mulilo D. Kabesha SC, filed a public interest litigation in the Gauteng Division of the High Court of South Africa, Pretoria, seeking an urgent interdict to halt the burial.\n\nThe State vs. The Family\n\nThe lawsuit targets the Lungu family  including former First Lady Esther Nyawa Lungu, daughters Tasila and Bertha, sons Chiyesu and Dalitso, and associates Charles Phiri and Makebi Zulu  along with Two Mountains Pty, the South African funeral home currently holding Lungus remains.\n\nKabesha argues that Lungus burial is not a private family affair, but a matter of national interest, governed by Zambian law which mandates military honours and ceremonial rites for a former Head of State. Even if Lungu expressed a preference for a more discreet burial abroad  a claim Kabesha disputes  the Attorney General maintains that public interest must override personal wishes.\n\nHe cites the precedent of Kenneth Kaunda, Zambias founding president, whose own familys burial preferences were set aside by the Zambian courts in favour of interment at Embassy Park, the official burial site for the countrys top statesmen.\n\nThe interim court hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, 25th June 2025 at 08:00hrs, where the Pretoria High Court will decide whether to halt the burial pending full resolution of the dispute.\n\nA Legal Feeding Frenzy\n\nBut beyond the constitutional questions and political symbolism, a new drama is unfolding  the lawyers are cashing in.\n\nWith multiple high-profile parties lawyered up in two countries, some observers say Zambia is witnessing the beginning of a legal gold rush. We are talking about dozens of billable hours, cross-border consultations, constitutional arguments, and possible appeals, one legal insider noted. And Makebi Zulu, even if he cant argue in South Africa himself, is at the heart of it.\n\nIronically, Zulu  a sharp legal mind known for courtroom theatrics in Lusaka  might now need South African legal representation to defend himself in a Pretoria courtroom. Hes a lawyer, but now hell need a lawyer, one source quipped.\n\nAs the funeral becomes a courtroom battlefield, its not just about where Lungu will be buried  but who will profit most before he is.\n\nWho Pays the Bill?\n\nReports suggest the Lungu familys legal tab is ballooning, with some critics asking if state resources are being used indirectly. Meanwhile, public interest in the case is surging, with calls for full transparency on who is funding whom  and how much Zambians may ultimately pay for this constitutional fight over one mans final resting place.\n\nAs the Pretoria court convenes at dawn tomorrow, one thing is clear: when presidents die, lawyers live.\n\n",

These cases have included maternity complications, premature births, and other critical emergencies. Many lives have been saved.\n\nHe added that plans were underway to expand the service by positioning more air ambulances in strategic regional centres such as Victoria Falls, Mutare, and Masvingo.\n\nHowever, the health minister admitted that a shortage of pilots was hindering full operational capacity.\n\nThere are currently no pilots for the helicopters, Mombeshora said, highlighting the complexity and expertise required to operate the air ambulances.\n\nThe air ambulance assetsnamely the helicoptersare wholly owned by the government of Zimbabwe. Operating these aircraft requires highly technical expertise, including checks by IATA-certified engineering technicians before and after each flight.\n\nTo address the shortfall, the government recently signed a contract with aviation firm Game Drive to provide certified pilots and technical staff. The company will also train Zimbabwean personnel to eventually take over operations from foreign experts, primarily Russian nationals who had been manning the programme.\n\nThe objective is to ensure sustainability and build our own local capacity, said Mombeshora.\n\nThe air ambulance service was introduced as part of broader efforts to improve emergency medical care and reduce preventable deaths, especially in rural and remote parts of the country where ground ambulance services are often limited.\n\n",
