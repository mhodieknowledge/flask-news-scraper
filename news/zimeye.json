            "content": "By A Correspondent Government has disbursed ZiG147 682 500 to Zanu PF and the opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) under the Political Parties (Finance) Act, according to General Notice 1829 published by Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi in an Extraordinary Government Gazette this week.\n\nCCCs allocation, however, has reignited controversy as the money will be administered by self-imposed Secretary-General Sengezo Tshabangu, whose claim to leadership has divided the opposition and weakened it in the face of Zanu PFs consolidation of power.\n\nTshabanguwidely viewed as a proxy of President Emmerson Mnangagwaemerged in late 2023 when he unilaterally announced the recall of CCC legislators, councillors and senators, accusing them of being imposed candidates. His actions, backed by court rulings and state institutions, left CCC in disarray and effectively handed Zanu PF a two-thirds majority in Parliament.\n\nWhile opposition leader Nelson Chamisa had formed CCC and structured it to resist state infiltration, Tshabangus sudden prominence and continued recognition by government exposed deep vulnerabilities in the party. Chamisa eventually resigned from CCC in January 2024, citing state capture of the movement, paving the way for Tshabangu to claim full control.\n\nIn terms of the Gazette, Zanu PF received ZiG102 343 972,50 after securing 69,3 percent of the vote in the disputed 2023 harmonised elections, while CCC under Tshabangu was allocated ZiG45 338 527,50 for its 30,7 percent share.\n\nIt is hereby notified, in terms of section 3(2) of the Political Parties (Finance) Act, that the total amount of moneys payable to political parties in respect of the year beginning 1st of January, 2025 and ending on the 31st of December, 2025 is ZiG147 682 500. The money shall be disbursed as follows  (a) ZiG102 343 972,50 to Zanu PF; (b) ZiG45 338 527,50 to CCC, Minister Ziyambi said.\n\nThe funding arrangement is significant: it gives state recognition and financial muscle to Tshabangus faction at the expense of Chamisa-aligned structures, further cementing Mnangagwas influence over the divided opposition. Analysts say the move is part of Mnangagwas long-standing strategy to weaken opposition politics through infiltration, selective recognition, and co-option of loyal opposition figures.\n\nTshabangus proximity to Zanu PF has been highlighted by his swift access to state media, judicial backing in leadership disputes, and now control over public funds. For many CCC supporters, this disbursement confirms their fears that Tshabangu is not merely an internal rebel but a state-engineered figurehead designed to neutralize genuine opposition.\n\nThe Political Parties (Finance) Act, introduced to prevent foreign funding of parties, has now become a tool through which government rewards compliant opposition while starving dissenting factions. Last year in September, government disbursed ZiG70 million under the same framework, with CCC again sidelined from accessing funds under Chamisas leadership.\n\nCritics argue that Mnangagwas administration is weaponising the law to reward Tshabangu for effectively hijacking CCC and ensuring that Zanu PF faces no meaningful opposition ahead of future elections.\n\n",

            "content": "By Business Reporter President Emmerson Mnangagwa this week announced yet another so-calledmega dealwith the Chinese, unveiling a US$600 million agreement with China Railway International Group (CRIG) to rehabilitate Zimbabwes broken railway system.\n\nBut history offers little reason for optimism. Since the early 2000s, when Zimbabwe adopted its Look East Policy, Harare has repeatedly paraded billion-dollar agreements with Chinese firmsnone of which delivered the promised transformation.\n\nInstead, the country has been left poorer, while ruling elites, including Mnangagwa himself, enriched themselves through opaque deals and resource plunder.\n\nThe most glaring example remains the looting of Marange (Chiadzwa) diamonds. Billions of dollars worth of gems were extracted under Chinese joint ventures involving Anjin Investments and other shadowy companies.\n\nInstead of funding hospitals, schools, or infrastructure, much of that diamond wealth disappeared into offshore accounts, Zanu PF patronage networks, and the pockets of political and military elites.\n\nIn return, Zimbabwe received firearms, water cannons, and tear gastools of repression used against its own people.\n\nMnangagwa, who was very influential during the early Marange looting years, now presides over a new cycle of resource-for-debt agreements that critics say are designed to benefit him, his close allies, and even his sons, who have become regular fixtures in shady business ventures linked to Chinese investors.\n\nThe latest railway deal follows the same script. Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube hailed CRIG, a subsidiary of Fortune 500 giant China Railway Group Limited (CREC), as a serious partner ready to modernise the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ). He spoke of feasibility studies, financing models, and alignment with regional rail gauge standardsgrand promises eerily similar to those made during Robert Mugabes rule, which never materialised.\n\nOnce you develop the NRZ infrastructure, that will lower the cost of logistics, the cost of doing business in Zimbabwe. It will save our roads, Ncube told reporters, insisting that a final agreement could be signed within four months.\n\nYet Zimbabweans have grown accustomed to such pronouncements. In 2018, Mnangagwa returned from China with 17 high-impact agreements, including a memorandum to recapitalise NRZ and construct a railway between Harare and Chitungwiza. Six years later, nothing has materialised.\n\nMeanwhile, roads crumble, industries grind to a halt, and mining companies ferry millions of tonnes of ore using overstretched highways. Instead of genuine development, Zimbabwes leadership seems more interested in using Chinese deals as cover for resource exploitation, elite accumulation, and political survival.\n\nIn the same week, Mnangagwa also met executives from Huawei, promising to expand ICT investment and roll out artificial intelligence technologies. Huawei has been in Zimbabwe for 26 years and, like other Chinese firms, has entrenched itself through close ties with the ruling establishment, despite concerns over surveillance, digital authoritarianism, and data security.\n\nCritics warn that the pattern is clear: Zimbabwe exchanges its vast mineral wealthgold, lithium, and diamondsfor debt, opaque contracts, and repressive technologies, while ordinary citizens remain trapped in poverty.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent As Zimbabwes tobacco planting season begins, the promised prosperity from record harvests is failing to reach the growers who produce the crop, highlighting deep inequalities and systemic exploitation in the sector.\n\nDespite the last marketing season generating over US$1 billion, growers report persistent delays in payments, inflated costs of inputs, and contracts that leave them with minimal earnings. Many argue that middlemen and foreign buyers are capturing the bulk of the profits while those working the land struggle to survive.\n\nEveryone talks about the billions earned from tobacco, but the people who actually plant and harvest the crop are the ones suffering, one grower said. We see the money, but it never reaches us in time, and often its too little to cover basic costs.\n\nEconomists warn that Zimbabwes heavy reliance on tobacco exports masks underlying economic vulnerabilities. While the sector contributes significant foreign currency, it also exposes growers and the national economy to manipulation by buyers and fluctuating global markets.\n\nThe tobacco sector may look successful on paper, but the reality is starkly different, said an industry analyst. The profits leave the country, environmental damage continues, and rural communities remain trapped in poverty.\n\nCritics also point to opaque government systems and weak oversight, which allow contracts and pricing mechanisms to favor elites, contractors, and foreign companies, leaving ordinary producers with little recourse.\n\nFor many growers, the start of the new season is a reminder that Zimbabwes tobacco success story is built on broken promises, with record harvests translating into windfalls for everyone except those who actually produce the crop.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nHARARE  The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has reaffirmed that it will not reverse its decision to phase out the US dollar, a stance that has triggered widespread anxiety among businesses and ordinary citizens who fear the move could plunge the country back into economic turmoil.\n\nPresenting its blueprint titled Path to a Mono-Currency by 2030, on Monday, the central bank outlined plans to end the current multi-currency systemwhere the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) circulates alongside the US dollar and other foreign currenciesand establish ZiG as the only legal tender for local transactions.\n\nBy 2030, Zimbabwe will have transitioned fully to a mono-currency system anchored on the ZiG, the RBZ stated. Foreign currency will remain available only for imports, international travel, and medical requirements.\n\nThe bank argued that the transition will be underpinned by key milestones: boosting foreign reserves to between three and six months of import cover, cutting inflation to 30 percent by the end of 2025, and achieving single-digit inflation from 2026 onward. It also promised to stabilize the exchange rate by keeping the parallel market premium below 30 percent.\n\nHowever, skepticism continues to mount. Business leaders say removing the US dollar risks destabilizing trade and fuelling hyperinflation, while many Zimbabweans fear losing the financial security they enjoy from dollar-based savings and transactions.\n\nPeople still trust the US dollar more than anything the government has introduced, said a shop owner in Harare. Every time they force us to use a local currency, prices shoot up and savings vanish.\n\nEconomists have also cast doubt on the central banks optimism. Without meaningful reforms, these targets are unrealistic, one analyst remarked. Pushing a weak currency onto the population will only strengthen the black market and erode public confidence further.\n\nAlthough the greenback is still in circulation, the RBZs insistence that there will be no going back has intensified fears that Zimbabwe may be heading toward yet another cycle of economic crisis.\n\n",

Party spokesperson Willie Aucamp said Ramaphosas praise ignores the devastating consequences the land seizures had on Zimbabwes economy and society.\n\nBecause land was not legally transferred, the failed Zimbabwe model praised by Ramaphosa led to crippling financial reparations being due to former farmers and land owners, Aucamp said.\n\nHe further accused the president of attempting to rehabilitate Zimbabwes policy in order to pave the way for the ANCs own controversial push to seize land in South Africa.\n\nRamaphosa is attempting to whitewash the disaster in Zimbabwe, to create momentum for the ANCs land expropriation agenda in terms of the Expropriation Act of 2025, Aucamp argued.\n\nWhile reaffirming the DAs backing for addressing South Africas land inequality, Aucamp stressed that the process must remain constitutional and respect property rights.\n\nHe added: The DA strongly supports addressing past injustices, particularly through fair and lawful land reform that restores dignity and economic opportunity.\n\nAccording to Aucamp, land expropriation without compensation, championed by the ANC, undermines the Constitution and the rule of law  principles he says must remain central to any credible land reform effort\n\n",
