She was also ordered to perform 210 hours of community service at Greendale Clinic.\n\nChivasa appeared before the same magistrate and was granted US$50 bail while awaiting trial.\n\nAccording to the state, on May 16, 2025, Chivasa misrepresented her academic qualifications while applying to the Parirenyatwa School of Nursing. She submitted a forged certificate claiming to have passed five O Level subjects, including a C in Combined Science, a C in Agriculture, and an A in Mathematics.\n\nHowever, the state alleges that Chivasa actually received an E in Combined Science, a D in Agriculture, and was ungraded in Mathematics.\n\nThe forgery was uncovered by human resources manager Macdonald Magavu during a routine verification of credentials. He alerted loss control officers, leading to a police report and Chivasas subsequent arrest.\n\nNomsa Kangara appeared for the state in the matter.\n\n",

Instead, he vanished.\n\nMurisa said efforts to resolve the matter amicably hit a brick wall as Mbeu allegedlyignored calls, refused to communicate, and even referred Murisa to his wife,Faith Mashami who later claimed she was no longer with the musician.\n\nScreenshots of WhatsApp conversations shared with this publication confirm that Mashami eventually told Murisa to reach out to Mbeu directly, stating:\n\nWe are no longer staying together.\n\nMurisa, who had initially hoped to avoid legal action, said he was left withno choice but to approach the police, leading to the issuance of the warrant of arrest.\n\nThey had agreed to fix my car, which is still parked at home. I didnt want it to end this way, but he gave me no option, Murisa added.\n\nIronically, it was onlyafter the warrant was issuedthat Mbeu resurfaced, reportedlypleading for a meeting with Murisa at Highlands Police Station.\n\nContacted for comment, Mbeu admitted the delay but maintained he is now cooperating.\n\nI know the guy, Im meeting him on Thursday. We are actually talking, he said.\n\nIn a now-controversial post on social media, Mbeu reflected on surviving the accident, writing:\n\nOn the 1st of January 2025, just a day before my second borns birthday, I got into a horrible accident and almost lost my life I owe God my life. I will rise again and even stronger! Mbeu ndini!\n\nHowever, critics argue that while he had time to post about the crash online,he failed to do the honourable thing and make amendswith the man whose vehicle and life were upended.\n\nIn a country where celebrities are expected to be role models, Mbeus silence, deflection, and delay raise uncomfortable questions aboutthe social responsibility of public figures.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent- At least 15,000 teachers have resigned or taken early retirement, fleeing the collapsing education sector under President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration due to poor salaries, deplorable working conditions, and psychological distress, teachers unions have revealed.\n\nProgressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) president Takavafira Zhou said the mass exodus reflects a growing crisis that is crippling the countrys education system, particularly in the sciences where critical shortages are now widespread.\n\nYes, we have received such cases, Zhou said. What is most worrisome is thedelay in processing retirement benefitsfor those who formally retire  some even die before accessing their pensions. The sciences  Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Combined Science and ICT  are the most affected.\n\nZhou added that while accurate data is hard to obtain, estimates show that Zimbabwe is losingbetween 15,000 and 20,000 teachers annuallydue to desertions.\n\nThese statistics are computable, he explained. Apart from monthly provincial reports, the Salary Services Bureau provides monthly updates on members whose dues can no longer be deducted after leaving the profession.\n\nZhou accused the government ofdeliberately punishing teachers, saying many have been demoralised by continuous blame and lack of support, despite doing their best under dire conditions.\n\nThere is a general feeling that the government is fixing teachers for a crime best known to the employer. Many are psychologically affected.\n\nHe also slammed the governmentstop-down imposition of curricula reformswith little consultation, planning, or provision of teaching materials.\n\nThere is little room for genuine engagement. The government imposes changes without appropriate educational taxonomy, prudence, interoperability, or standardisation  let alone resources for implementation.\n\nThe exodus of educators marks adeepening crisis in Zimbabwes public sector, with long-term implications for the countrys human capital and development prospects.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZanu PF MP for Mberengwa Central, Tinashe Shumba, is at the centre of controversy after the rapid construction of a fuel service station near Mucheke River in Masvingo, raising concerns about political influence and regulatory shortcuts.\n\nThe GTS-branded station, believed to stand for Goga Tinashe Shumba  a combination of the MPs nickname and initials  was completed and operational within five weeks.\n\nLocated in the proposed site for Masvingos new Central Business District and smart city, it is currently the only structure in the undeveloped zone.\n\nShumba, who has a background in gold mining and was once a security guard, denied ownership of the station. Im merely a contractor at the site, he told The Masvingo Mirror, distancing himself from direct links to GTS despite evidence from Chronicle identifying him as the proprietor of multiple GTS stations in Mberengwa and Kwekwe.\n\nThe project initially faced resistance from the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), which halted construction in February for non-compliance.\n\nThe new GTS service station was ordered to stop construction work on 11 February 2025 because it did not yet have an EMA certificate of development, said an official at EMA Masvingo.\n\nHowever, the ban was lifted within days, and by May 12, the station was already serving customers.\n\nCritics argue the speed and approval process reflect preferential treatment. If it were any ordinary citizen, theyd still be battling with paperwork. This is what unchecked political power looks like, said a local resident who declined to be named.\n\nShumba is no stranger to controversy. In 2024, the Deputy Judge President, Justice Garainesu Mawadze, issued a court order barring him and Kubatana Mining Syndicate from evicting villagers in Mberengwa in pursuit of gold mining. Villagers accused him of using armed men to intimidate them and boasting that no authority could stop him.\n\nAccording to Chronicle, Shumba rose from humble beginnings to become a symbol of government empowerment, leveraging gold mining ventures to build a growing business empire that now includes fuel retail.\n\nWhether the GTS service station is a mark of entrepreneurial success or a case of political privilege remains a divisive question in Masvingo  but for now, the pumps are running.\n\n",

            "content": "FULL TEXT BELOW\n\nHistory was struck today 21st May 2025, when the Zimbabwe Defence Forces stamped up two official requests to retire President Emmerson Mnangagwa on the grounds of incapacitation and other concerns.\n\nThe documents were officially stamped by two arms of the ZDF, the ZNA (army) and the Airforce.\n\nThe development is the first time since war veteran Blessed Geza began press conferences calling for a constitutional and legal resolution to the Zimbabwean crisis.\n\nDetails of the documentation and the original stamped files are availed by the ZimEye news network.\n\nFULL TEXT BELOW\n\n.\n\nCall for Intervention by Citizens to the Zimbabwe National Army on State Capture and Presidential Incapacity\n\nWe, the citizens of Zimbabwe, implore the Zimbabwe National Army to intervene in the pressing issues of state capture and presidential incapacity. The current administration, led by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, has been marred by corruption, nepotism, and regionalism, resulting in widespread suffering and the undermining of the rule of law.\n\nCorruption\n\nPresident Mnangagwa and his close associates have been involved in numerous corrupt activities, including: Corruptly awarding companies formerly owned by the Zimbabwe National Army to Kuda Tagwirei. Awarding state tenders to cartels without following procurement procedures. Involvement in the goat project, involving the transfer of funds to Mnangagwas account in the Mpofu and Chimombe court case. Forcibly seizing mines from their rightful owners and awarding them to Mnangagwas family members and associates. Awarding tenders to cartels that charge unreasonable and exorbitant prices, with 100% funding from the Treasury, yet no work has been done. A case in point is Wicknell Chivhayo, who was awarded the Gwanda Solar Project, but to date, nothing has materialised. Over and above that, Chivhayo received millions of dollars even after a court challenge by ZESA.\n\nFailure to Address Bread and Butter Issues\n\nThe President has failed to address critical issues affecting ordinary Zimbabweans, including: Poor remuneration for civil servants, with salaries below the poverty datum line. High unemployment rates, leading to increased crime and drug abuse among the youth. Essential services have collapsed due to corruption and mismanagement. Vision 2030 should focus on upgrading and building new infrastructure, not merely maintaining existing structures. Hospitals are in a dire and deplorable state. Our roads have become death traps for our loved ones. Poor water reticulation systems are a public health hazard. Everything is now being termed a presidential scheme, raising serious questions about the role of line ministries. Natural resources are being diverted for personal gain rather than being channelled through relevant ministries for the benefit of all Zimbabweans.\n\nPresidential Incapacity\n\nThere are growing concerns about the Presidents health, specifically vascular dementia, which may impair his ability to perform his duties. According to Section 97 of the Constitution, if the President is incapacitated due to a medical condition, Parliament should investigate with a view to his removal from office. Section 97 clearly outlines the grounds for removal: gross misconduct, wilful violation of the Constitution, and physical or mental incapacity. There is clear evidence that President Mnangagwa has violated the Constitution, which warrants his removal from office.\n\nAttempt to Extend Presidential Term Limit\n\nThe 2030 Agenda includes a plan to amend the Constitution to extend the presidential term limit to 2030, in violation of Sections 91(2) and 328(7). This attempt has received mixed reactions, with the majority supporting the 2013 Constitution as it stands. Amending the Constitution requires two separate referendums, a costly process that diverts funds from critical needs such as healthcare. Our road network has become deadly, and water reticulation failures pose serious health risks. We, the citizens, oppose any constitutional amendment designed to benefit Emmerson Mnangagwa and his close associates.\n\nHuman Rights Abuses\n\nThe current regime stands accused of numerous human rights abuses, including: Suppression of Freedom of Speech, Association, and ExpressionThe regime has deployed the police to deter citizens from peacefully demonstrating, despite constitutional guarantees of these freedoms. Arbitrary Arrests and DetentionOn March 31, 109 citizens were arrested and only granted bail after one month. Journalist Blessed Mhlanga was also arrested and spent nearly three months in remand prison before being granted bail. Compromised JudiciaryZimbabwes judiciary has been captured and compromised, eroding public trust and allowing those in power to act with impunity.\n\nNepotism, Regionalism, and Tribalism\n\nThe President has consistently promoted nepotism and regionalism, appointing relatives and extended family to key positions and prioritising personal and regional interests over national well-being.\n\nWe, the citizens of Zimbabwe, urge the Zimbabwe National Army to intervene in these urgent matters to restore the rule of law, accountability, and transparency.\n\nWe have appended our signatures as citizens from all 10 provinces on the attached separate page.\n\n",
