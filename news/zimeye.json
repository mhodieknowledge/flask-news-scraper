            "content": "By A Correspondent | Mnangagwa Promotes FAZ Leader Walter Tapfumaneyi to Major General in Apparent Power Consolidation Move\n\nHarare  6 June 2025\n\nIn a move widely seen as an effort to neutralise growing dissent within ZANU PF ranks and secure his grip on power, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has promoted Brigadier General Asher Walter Tapfumaneyithe architect of the controversial Forever Associates Zimbabwe (FAZ) operationto the rank of Major General.\n\nThe announcement, made during a formal ceremony at Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) Headquarters on Friday, comes just weeks after Tapfumaneyi was transferred from the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) to the Zimbabwe National Army. The rapid elevation has sparked concern over what critics call the deepening militarisation of civilian politics in Zimbabwe.\n\nTapfumaneyi, a long-serving CIO operative and former Deputy Director General of the spy agency, is best known for founding and leading FAZa CIO-linked outfit accused of orchestrating voter intimidation and parallel electoral operations in favour of Mnangagwas controversial 2023 re-election. FAZ operatives were widely deployed across rural Zimbabwe where they allegedly surveilled voters, coerced communities, and undermined the integrity of the vote. The group operated outside of Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) oversight and in direct violation of constitutional electoral protocols.\n\nObservers from SADC and the European Union condemned FAZs activities, with reports indicating that its command centres near polling stations compromised vote secrecy and enabled systematic voter coercion in ZANU PF strongholds. Despite the outcry, the government has defended FAZ as a patriotic volunteer group.\n\nNow, Tapfumaneyis promotion to Major General signals a reintegration into the formal military command and a reward for loyalty to the ruling elite.\n\nCongratulations to you, Major General Tapfumaneyi, and welcome back to the ZDF. We are looking forward to working with you, said Commander of the Defence Forces General Philip Valerio Sibanda at the investiture ceremony.\n\nIn his remarks, Tapfumaneyi thanked President Mnangagwa for the promotion, pledging loyalty to both the Commander and the Presidents national security objectives.I am determined and committed to supporting the Presidents vision and the Commanders plan in defence of this country and making sure the country remains secure. I want to thank His Excellency for promoting me, he said.\n\nTapfumaneyi has previously served as Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Veterans of the Liberation Struggle Affairs and played a central role in ZANU PFs post-2017 repressive election machinery.\n\nAnalysts view the promotion as a strategic countermeasure against internal threats, including what some sources describe as a Blessed Geza insurgencya reference to growing discontent within the ruling party from elements believed to be aligned with sidelined war veterans and anti-Mnangagwa factions.\n\nMnangagwa is reinforcing his inner circle with trusted operatives embedded in security organs. Tapfumaneyis rise is no coincidenceits a clear message that loyalty to the party leader will be rewarded with institutional power, said one security analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nSince 1980, the ruling party has relied heavily on the military and intelligence arms to retain power, a trend that escalated during the 2008 elections and was cemented by the 2017 military-assisted transition that ousted Robert Mugabe. The 2018 and 2023 elections further entrenched the fusion of party and state, with the army and intelligence agencies playing increasingly direct roles in political affairs.\n\nWith this latest promotion, Mnangagwa appears intent on shielding his presidency from both internal and external threatsensuring that the command structures of the military remain firmly in the hands of loyalists at a time of mounting social, economic, and political discontent.\n\n",

This is nothing short of electoral coercion, said one source who asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons.\n\nThe lack of police intervention in the face of these blatant electoral violations has sparked outrage.\n\nPolice in Gutu East are not just silenttheyre complicit through inaction, said a local human rights monitor.\n\nWe are witnessing the weaponisation of fear, with state institutions either captured or paralysed.\n\nAs the by-election nears, pressure is mounting on the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) to explain its failure to uphold electoral laws and protect all candidates and voters equally.\n\nMeanwhile, Gonese insists he will not be intimidated:We will not stop. Were offering people real change, and no amount of thuggery will silence us.\n\nWith just days to go, the Gutu East by-election has become a test not just of political popularitybut of the integrity of Zimbabwes electoral and law enforcement institutions.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tinashe Sambiri\n\nIn a move that underscores the dramatic collapse of Zimbabwes once-thriving agricultural sector, the Zimbabwean government has announced plans to import milk, sunflower oil, and agricultural machinery from Belarus  a decision critics say signals the countrys failure to restore self-sufficiency decades after the violent land reform program.\n\nThe announcement was made by Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, and Rural Development, Vangelis Haritatos, during an official visit to Belarus for the Belagro 2025 international exhibition. Zimbabwes milk demand is estimated at 130 million litres per year, and we currently produce 120 million litres, Haritatos told Belarusian Agriculture Minister Yuri Gorlov. We are interested in ramping up the output of this product. We also want to buy sunflower oil and agricultural machinery.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the need to import such basic commodities is a direct consequence of decades of misguided and chaotic agricultural policies. Zimbabwe, once lauded as the breadbasket of Africa, has suffered a steady decline in agricultural productivity since the early 2000s following the violent and racially charged land reform campaign known as hondo yeminda.\n\nThe ZANU-PF-led land seizures displaced thousands of white commercial farmers, many of whom had generations of expertise in large-scale agriculture. Hundreds were killed or forced into exile, and millions of hectares of productive farmland fell into disuse or were handed over to politically connected elites with no agricultural background.\n\nThe irony is staggering, says agricultural economist Tendai Moyo. We chased away people who knew how to farm, and now were going halfway across the world to buy milk. Its not just a policy failure  its a national tragedy.\n\nDespite Haritatos claims that Belarusian machinery has helped dramatically increase agricultural productivity, data from Zimbabwes own Ministry of Agriculture shows continued shortfalls in key commodities like maize, wheat, and dairy products. Critics say that importing machinery is a stopgap solution that does not address the root causes of underperformance, such as lack of investment in farmer training, inconsistent government support, and corruption in land allocation.\n\nThis isnt a partnership of equals  its a band-aid over a self-inflicted wound, says human rights activist Ruvimbo Chitiga. We cant import our way out of bad governance.\n\nWhile the Belarusian partnership may offer short-term relief, many Zimbabweans are left wondering whether their government will ever make the hard decisions necessary to rebuild the agricultural backbone that once fed the region.\n\nAs Zimbabwe ships in milk and machinery from Eastern Europe, the image of a nation that once exported food to its neighbors has faded into memory  replaced by empty silos, idle land, and a growing reliance on foreign aid and imports.\n\n",

I vividly remember that in 2016, one of the Green Fuel security guards Borniface Shungwa (47) shot three (3) villagers and killed one (1) on the allegations these villagers stole sugarcane, Madhuku said.\n\nFor me, it is about the training, orientation and safeguarding issues that must be addressed by Green Fuel, Madhuku added.\n\nDuring the community radio live programme, Mr Owen Dhliwayo, who is a communications and media advocate, voiced out that Green Fuel needed to work hard on its public image to respond to the public outcry of this nature. The local community has harboured a perception that Green Fuel was always operating above the law, therefore fears no consequence from the local community.\n\nBy virtue of having a juristic personality, Green Fuel is liable and should be held accountable to the disgraceful action of its personnel, and has to issue a public apology that shows genuine remorse over the incident, Owen Dhliwayo explained.\n\nMembers of the local community, including those in the diaspora, vented their anger through social media to demand action against Green Fuel should there be no issuance of public apology. The public is citing cases of Green Fuel drivers who are involved in accidents with local community members. The company is accused of poor public relations during accidents and altercations with the local community, preferring to abandon their employees to face the wrath of the community alone.\n\nTonderai Nikisi, a local community member, contributed to the discussion by warning Green Fuel of bigger consequences if there was no apology.\n\nIt is high time something must be done at Green Fuel uuum this is unfair, we are now back to colonial era. People taking justice into their own hands, Tonderai wrote.\n\nThrough his articles, Artwel Chingwara Sithole of Rimbi village described the behaviour by Green Fuel security guards as wanton, disgusting and unacceptable.\n\n",
