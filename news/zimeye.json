England-based midfielder Marvelous Nakamba has already linked up with the team, joining camp last week to add experience and stability in midfield.\n\nDefender Teenage Hadebe is also set to join his teammates after arriving from the United States last week, providing a major boost to the defensive department.\n\nAt the same time, ZIFA has been in negotiations with English League One side Plymouth Argyle regarding the release of defender Brendan Galloway. The club had initially wanted Galloway to feature in their fixture against Wycombe Wanderers on Tuesday before allowing him to join the Warriors.\n\nWith the official deadline for player release set for 15 December, the technical team remains confident that all targeted players will report on time. The AFCON tournament is scheduled to kick off in Morocco on 21 December, giving Zimbabwe limited but crucial days to fine-tune their preparations.\n\n",

He said the date was included in the relevant statutory instrument (SI) following pressure from the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI).\n\nThe 2030 date was never a government date. I remember I worked on the SI, and I argued that lets not put a closing date on this, Guvamatanga explained. There was strong pushback from CZI, who said we want a date, and we put a date.\n\nHe added that ongoing consultations with industry stakeholders had since led to a reconsideration of the timeline. Guvamatanga also revealed that the statutory instrument itself was largely drafted by the Bankers Association of Zimbabwe (BAZ) in collaboration with CZI.\n\nThe SI is not even ours; it was largely driven by BAZ, and CZI had influence. They wrote the SI; its their lawyers who wrote the SI. CZI came with the date, BAZ came with the SI, and we simply published it, he said.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube, who attended the conference, expressed support for removing the deadline altogether.\n\n",

Many high-profile cases appear stalled or result in minimal penalties, while insiders continue to exploit state resources with impunity. As one activist noted: The President talks about zero tolerance, yet the so-called Zvigananda continue to move freely, looting public funds while ordinary citizens suffer.\n\nMnangagwa commended the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) and the NPA, but conceded that more must be done to strengthen their investigative capacity and synergies to expunge the perception of a catch-and-release trend. Critics, however, say the perception of selective justice has only worsened over the years, with enforcement appearing politically motivated.\n\nThe government has also introduced a fast-track court system and approved the Whistle-blowers and Witness Protection Bill, intended to accelerate the fight against corruption. Yet, analysts warn that legislation alone cannot curb entrenched graft if political will is lacking. One legal expert commented: Bills and strategies look good on paper, but unless there is consistent accountability, corruption will continue to thrive.\n\nObservers argue that while Mnangagwa speaks of ending corruption, the reality on the ground tells a starkly different storyone where those with connections continue to loot state resources at will, leaving the average Zimbabwean to bear the cost.\n\n",

One Harare commuter commented: Its laughable to say our roads are in the top ten in Africa when you can barely drive through a single suburb without hitting a pothole.\n\nDespite the accolades in the report, many Zimbabweans remain frustrated by the state of the nations roads and see the ranking as a political boast rather than a reflection of reality.\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri President Emmerson Mnangagwas recent donation of US$400,000 to the Zimbabwe Senior Mens football team, the Warriors, has sparked debate over whether such handouts are a genuine boost or a distraction from deeper issues in Zimbabwean sports.\n\nThe contribution, announced this week by Minister of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture Anselem Sanyatwe at a ZIFA-organised send-off event in Harare, was said to come directly from the Presidents office, rather than the state fiscus. Sanyatwe said: Let me proudly inform you that the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe injected a total of US$400,000 from his office, and not fiscus, for the welfare of our Warriors during AFCON.\n\nWhile the ceremony brought together Deputy Minister Emily Jesaya, ZIFA president Nqobile Magwizi, business representatives, and football supporters, critics argue that such lavish donations do little to address the systemic issues plaguing football in the country. Questions have been raised about transparency, the source of the funds, and whether similar support trickles down to grassroots clubs struggling for basic resources.\n\nAnalysts noted that while players may benefit in the short term, the focus on one-off donations risks masking chronic underfunding and poor infrastructure across Zimbabwean football. It is commendable to support the national team, but $400,000 for a send-off does not solve the long-standing neglect of youth development and domestic leagues, one sports commentator said.\n\nAt the event, Minister Sanyatwe urged the Warriors to give their all in the challenging Group B, which includes South Africa, Angola, and Egypt. Meanwhile, ZIFA unveiled the teams new jersey for AFCON, designed by local brand Warrior Pride, ahead of their departure for Morocco on 16 December.\n\nObservers suggest that while the gesture may generate temporary excitement, the move raises serious questions about prioritisation and whether Zimbabwean football is being used for political pageantry rather than meaningful development.\n\nEmmerson Mnangagwa\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent  The late former Radio Two head, Timothy Makoni  affectionately known as TZ by his colleagues  has been declared a provincial hero. He will be buried today in Nyazura, Manicaland Province.\n\nMakoni, who died last week on Friday at his farm in Nyazura near Mutare, was not only a respected broadcaster but also a war veteran who operated under the liberation nameCde Torai Zvombo.\n\nHis long-time colleague and close friend, veteran broadcaster John Masuku, paid a heartfelt tribute soon after news of Makonis passing broke. Below is Masukus detailed remembrance, shared on his Facebook page:\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I share the sad news about the departure of Timothy Makoni (Cde Torayi Zvombo-cum-Cde Syrup), a former ZBC workmate, friend, and neighbour. This comes only a few weeks after reporting about and mourning Temba Bassopo Moyo, a digital news gathering guru and media scholar.\n\nMakoni died this morning in Nyazura, where he went farming after leaving the public broadcaster in 2001. He loved and enjoyed farming. Long before the land reform programme, he always took leave in November to till the land in rural Chendambuya in Manicaland.\n\nHe is the former Head of Radio Two (now Radio Zimbabwe), having previously led Radio Four (now National FM) while also serving as Area Manager for Mbare Studios when I was Controller Radio Services and later Controller at Montrose Studios.\n\nWe both left ZBC in 2001 during the era of massive retrenchments overseen by then Minister of Information Jonathan Moyo, Board Chair Dr Gideon Gono, and CEO Alum Mpofu.\n\nTZ or Syrup, as we affectionately called him, was a former freedom fighter. After sustaining injuries on the front, he was deployed to the ZANU Department of Informations Voice of Zimbabwe to broadcast from Madagascar.\n\nHe joined ZBC at Independence, starting at Radio One (then General/English Service), before moving to Radio Two under the leadership of Victor Mhizha Murira (Cde Victor Mhizha), deputised by Amon Nyamambi uMaqhulayibambe, and later Godwin Mbofana, father to Comfort Mbofana.\n\nMakoni, a devout Catholic educated at St Benedict Mission School, had a pleasant personality and related well with people from all walks of life.\n\nDuring his tenure at Mbare Studios, he worked with and led notable broadcasters such as Ezra Tshisa Sibanda, Eric Knight, Brenda Moyo, Sam Sibanda, Loveness Muchina, Lazarus Tembo, Joseph Panganayi Mukaronda, Nonceba Mnkandla, Simon Pashoma Ncube, Maguire Mike Godzongere, Lisbern Nasasara, Albert Mtimanzi Kashiri, Zenzo Ncube and Aaron Chiundura Moyo, among many others.\n\nI had made a strong promise to visit Timothy at his farm in Nyazura and had finalised plans with another friend and war veteran, Douglas Justice Dhliwayo (Cde Justice Chikukwa), my Executive Producer onEconomic Forumon ZBC-TV and proprietor of Medianet Studio. At Independence, I worked with Justice on the TV News Desk at Pockets Hill as Sub-Editor and Newsreader.\n\nOnly two weeks ago, I spoke with Timothy at length about the excruciating pain he had been experiencing, which kept him bedridden most of the time, though he had begun taking short walks ahead of a major operation. I told him, If my car is not ready for the urgent trip, I will come by public transport. He then gave me directions on where to disembark and walk to his farm.\n\nMy condolences go to Timothy Makonis family and friends, especially his children, who were of similar age and school streams as mine.\n\nHe called me Joe and I called him TZ.\n\nMHDSRIP.\n\nCOURTESY: JM Archives\n\n",
