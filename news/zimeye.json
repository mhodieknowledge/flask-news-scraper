            "content": "STIRLING, SCOTLAND  By A Correspondent | ZimEye | Disgraced preacher Walter Masocha, founder of the Agape for All Nations Ministries International, has been convicted of multiple sexual offences after a chilling trial revealed years of exploitation disguised as deliverance.\n\nMasochawho once competed (as it were) with Zimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chinono for the attention and trust of the same complainant during trial in 2014, used his spiritual authority to molest, manipulate, and attempt to rape women in his congregation under the pretense of casting out demons and fulfilling Gods will.\n\nThe 61-year-old was found guilty of attempted rape, indecent assault, and sexual assault at the High Court in Livingston, relating to a series of incidents that took place between 2006 and 2012 at properties in and around Stirling.\n\nGod Has Given You to Me\n\nOne victim, now 39, testified that Masocha began abusing her when she was just 20. Referring to him as Dad or Daddy, she said he used spiritual language to groom and violate her, claiming divine instruction to care for her intimately.\n\nGod has given you to me to nurture you, look after you, and love you in any way you want to be loved, she recalled him saying.\n\nShe described being groped during church surgeries, kissed by force, slapped on the bottom, and in one instance, nearly raped in his bedroom before managing to escape. On another occasion, Masocha guided her hand onto his erect penis while fully clothed, during a private session at his Sauchieburn mansion.\n\nCompeting Daddies for the Same Victim.\n\nOne of the victims trust and vulnerability was not only exploited by Masocha. Evidence and testimonies reveal that high-profile journalist Hopewell Chinono also portrayed himself as a Daddy figure toward the same woman, creating an emotionally manipulative environment of religious and psychological dominance.\n\nWhile Chinono has not been charged with any offence, the courtroom revelations cast light on a disturbing pattern outside: two influential Zimbabwean men vying for control over the same vulnerable womaneach presenting himself as a saviour, protector, or father figure, only to cause further emotional trauma.\n\nPretending to Remove Demons\n\nAnother woman, now 58, testified that Masocha had also molested her approximately 20 years ago. She said he claimed she was a gift from God and that he was removing demons from her by placing his hand in her underwear and groping her genitals.\n\nHe said God had told him to kiss me to bless me through his holy lips, she said.\n\nHer husband told the court that when they confronted Masocha in accordance with Zimbabwean tradition, the preacher fell to the floor and asked for prayer, saying, Im sorry. I loved you too much.\n\nRepeat Predator.\n\nMasocha was previously convicted in 2015 for sexually assaulting a woman and groping a schoolgirl during church sessions. In that case, he also claimed to be removing demons. The conviction was later quashed on appeal due to procedural errors (that happened after the other Daddy character, Hopewell Chinono had encroached the main complainant for an affair disguised as a news interview), but the latest guilty verdicts leave no doubt about his pattern of abuse.\n\nJudge Susan Craig remanded Masocha in custody ahead of sentencing scheduled for July 28, calling his actions appalling and warning that a custodial sentence is inevitable. A risk assessment is also underway to determine whether he qualifies for an extended sentence due to the danger he poses to the public.\n\nWalter Masocha wasnt just a pastor and a preacher. He was a predator who thought that his power and position rendered him immune from suspicion, said lead prosecutor Michael McIntosh.\n\nJournalists social media supporters mislabelled complainant.\n\nThroughout the periods since the 2014 hearings, one of the elderly complainants was labelled a mad person by the Daddy character Hopewell Chinonos online supporters. But she was not at all insane, says one complainant whos now an adult. She says: a lot of you ask me why am I talking about this now? Why did I not talk about this when it happened? When it happened? I wont talk about it because I think of the time there was a lady who came up and spoke about it and people said that the devil speaking about speaking to her she lying you know shes probably shes angry or something And Lady In because I feel like it was a cold and we were like brainwashed to believe this person this one man so I never spoke about never spoke about my experience because I didnt think anybody would believe me because Woman who told her truth and we didnt believe her.\n\nFrom Archbishop to Sex Offender.\n\nMasocha, a ZAOGA pastor, and a former accountancy lecturer at the University of Stirling, founded his church in 2007 and quickly grew it into a global ministry with over 2,000 members across the UK, US, Canada, and parts of Africa. He awarded himself the title of Archbishop and drew a salary comparable to the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nBut behind the titles and televised sermons was a man abusing power, hiding behind God, and taking advantage of vulnerable women looking for prayer and healing.\n\nSupport Services: If you or someone you know has been affected by abuse in a religious setting, please contact local safeguarding services or support hotlines in your area.\n\n",

Gorimbo asked his followers. Say yes if you are and your reason not to go home. Lets see how people actually feel. Voice of the voiceless.\n\nHe went on to address the diaspora more broadly:Are you a Zimbabwean in any foreign land but wish to go back home? What is not allowing you to go home vana vamai?\n\nSwitching to a mix of Shona and English, the UFC fighter spoke of his own desire to contribute to Zimbabwes development, but expressed frustration over the lack of meaningful opportunities and political interference:\n\nNeniwo ndotoda kundo trenera Zimbabwe ndichiuya kuno kuzorova vanhu ndodzokera kanyi ndeindo tovewa ndiri kumba, he wrote. But ha ma1. Kutojadhira uri kuno plus ma opportunity for vana because paZimbabwe ma opportunity asarira zvigananda nevana vazvo. Nevamwe vano benefiter by association.\n\nTranslation: Even I would love to train in Zimbabwe, go compete abroad and return home, just like anyone else. But its tough. Life outside is expensive, and opportunities for the youth back home have been monopolised by these Zvigananda and their associates.\n\nGorimbos remarks have drawn sharp backlash from ZANU PF hardliners and online defenders, known as Varakashi, who quickly labelled him unpatriotic and accused him of using his platform to attack the ruling party. Some warned him to stay out of Zimbabwean politics and focus on fighting in the cage.\n\nHowever, Gorimbos supporters have rallied behind him, applauding his bravery for speaking truth to power. Many Zimbabweans across the diaspora echoed his sentiments in the comment sections, sharing stories of blocked dreams and the longing to return homeif only conditions improved.\n\nDespite the criticism, Gorimbo has not backed down, positioning himself as the voice of the voiceless and vowing to continue raising uncomfortable truths.\n\nHis remarks reflect a growing tension between politically-connected elites and the broader populationparticularly the youth and professionals in the diasporawho feel shut out of Zimbabwes political and economic system.\n\nWhether his outspokenness will attract further political backlash or inspire wider discourse, one thing is certain: Themba Gorimbo is not pulling any punchesinside or outside the ring.\n\n",

Makorokoto, Amhlophe, Mnangagwa declared.\n\nBut as he praised electoral outcomes and claimed growing support for the government, millions of ordinary Zimbabweans continue to grapple with crippling inflation, meager salaries, collapsing healthcare, and chronic shortages of basic services.\n\nOur people-centered development programmes and projects across every sector [are] gaining the support and appreciation of the citizens, said Mnangagwa. Government, on its part, will continue to prioritize the capacitation and resourcing of our Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies to sustain the momentum of high-impact programmes and projects.\n\nHowever, many citizens took to social media to express disbelief, with some accusing the president of being out of touch with the reality on the ground.\n\nThere is no electricity, water is a luxury, hospitals are broken, and people cant afford a loaf of bread.
