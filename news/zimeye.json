            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Environmental Management Agency (EMA) has slapped a US$5,000 fine on Chinese-owned Labenmon Investments for breaching environmental regulations at its Wih-Zim Construction Material Investments cement plant in Magunje, Hurungwe District, Mashonaland West.\n\nThe penalty comes after EMA found that Labenmon Investments failed to comply with key conditions set in its Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Certificates (numbers L10000034346 and L10000099080) before starting construction at the site.\n\nThe violations were uncovered following an inspection in July, mandated by Chinhoyi High Court Judge Justice Philda Muzofa on 4 February 2025. Justice Muzofa had ordered EMA to investigate alleged breaches after residents of Chasara and Kapere villages complained that the company had encroached on their farming and grazing lands.\n\nDespite a court order halting further construction activities pending investigation, villagers reported that the company continued ground clearing and leveling 10 hectares, building staff quarters, and moulding bricks at the site. Residents filed a contempt of court application on 26 February 2025 with the assistance of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights lawyers Tinashe Chinopfukutwa and Kelvin Kabaya. The High Court has yet to rule.\n\nEMA confirmed that Labenmon Investments ignored critical EIA conditions, including relocating and compensating affected families and addressing the environmental impact of a diversion road on villagers fields. Additionally, the company had failed to obtain a Communal Lands Occupation certificate from Hurungwe Rural District Council, as required by law.\n\nCritics say the incident exposes systemic corruption and government negligence in enforcing environmental laws. It is shocking that a company can blatantly flout court orders and environmental regulations with no immediate consequences, said one affected villager, speaking on condition of anonymity. It feels like the authorities are protecting investors at the expense of ordinary people and the environment.\n\nAnother resident added, The governments laxity has encouraged these violations. We keep complaining, yet construction continues as if the law does not exist.\n\nEMA has ordered Labenmon Investments to halt all project activities until full compliance with EIA requirements is achieved and recommended continuous monitoring due to the projects high environmental impact.\n\nObservers warn that without stricter enforcement and accountability, foreign investors and local companies may continue exploiting loopholes, leaving communities vulnerable and Zimbabwes environment at risk.\n\n",

            "content": "By Crime and Courts Reporter  Police investigations into the brutal killing of prominent businessman Joseph Mutangaz Mutangadura have taken a dramatic twist amid leaked social media messages suggesting possible inside involvement.\n\nMutangadura, 67, was gunned down late Sunday night inside his 13-room farmhouse at Lisheen Estate in Ruwa. Initial police reports described the incident as a violent robbery, but fresh details now point to the possibility of an assassination.\n\nMessages circulating on social media, purportedly from a close family relative, claim that police seized the wifes cellphone and that hired gunmen unknowingly began demanding payment directly from detectives posing as her. One message alleged that of the seven attackers, one was captured in Gazebo while the other six were traced to Epworth.\n\nPolice have not confirmed the authenticity of the leaked messages, andZimEyeis still verifying the information.\n\nAccording to official police accounts, seven masked men armed with pistols, crowbars, and hammers overpowered a security guard before storming the house. They tied him up, demanded a description of Mutangadura, and went straight to his bedroom, where he was with his wife, Patience.\n\nDespite his reported offer to show them cash at an abattoir, the intruders shot him multiple times in the stomach and chest, killing him on the spot. Curiously, the gang left behind valuables and took only a cellphone worth about US$10  fueling suspicions that their mission was not robbery, but elimination.\n\nWhat is disturbing is that the gang was not after the money but the life of Joseph, a family member told reporters.\n\nPatience, who had only recently reunited with Mutangadura after a divorce, was rendered unconscious during the attack and later hospitalized. She is now under police protection. However, reports that her cellphone was confiscated by investigators have intensified speculation about possible insider links to the attackers.\n\nNational police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the murder but maintained that it remains under investigation as a robbery-homicide. The value of stolen property is yet to be verified, he said.\n\nThe chilling precision of the attack mirrors a worrying trend of suspected contract killings that have plagued Zimbabwe since the 2017 coup, where victims are executed and little or nothing is stolen.\n\nMutangadura, who owned butcheries, Lisheen Estate, and the popular Mutangadura Hideout, was a towering figure in business circles in Ruwa and Harare. His violent death has shocked the community and left unanswered questions about who wanted him dead  and why.\n\nDetectives from the CID Homicide Unit are leading the manhunt for the killers. But with Patiences phone now in police custody and speculation mounting, relatives and residents are convinced this was no ordinary robbery, but a carefully planned assassination.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent-The United States embassy in Harare has suspended routine visa services until further notice, citing unresolved concerns with the Government of Zimbabwe. The embassy clarified in a notice issued this week that the pause does not amount to a travel ban and that holders of valid visas will not be affected.\n\nThe suspension, which took effect on August 7, 2025, applies to all visa categories except most diplomatic and official visas. It has disrupted travel, business, and education plans for many Zimbabweans who rely on US visas for academic programs, medical visits, and family connections.\n\nAlthough the embassys official statement did not detail the concerns, the US has previously raised issues around Zimbabwes high rate of visa overstaying. According to the US Department of Homeland Security, Zimbabwe had an overstay rate of 10.57% in 2023, one of the highest globally, and the numbers have been rising. Washington has repeatedly warned about visa misuse, stressing the need to protect the integrity of its immigration system.\n\nThe development adds another layer to the complex and often strained relations between Harare and Washington. Since the early 2000s, the US has maintained targeted sanctions against selected Zimbabwean officials and entities over alleged human rights violations, governance failures, and electoral irregularities. While Washington insists that the measures are not directed at ordinary Zimbabweans, Harare has long argued that US policies amount to broader economic sanctions that have crippled the countrys economy.\n\nDespite these tensions, people-to-people ties between the two countries have remained significant. Thousands of Zimbabweans live, study, and work in the US, contributing to remittances that have become a lifeline for the economy back home. American universities also attract a steady stream of Zimbabwean students, while US-based NGOs and foundations fund health, education, and governance programs in the country.\n\nThe suspension of visa services is therefore likely to cause widespread anxiety. Prospective students preparing for the new academic year, families planning reunions, and business professionals requiring travel are among those affected. The embassy has pledged to provide updates once discussions with the Zimbabwean authorities yield progress.\n\nFor now, Zimbabweans must wait and see when visa processing will resumea reminder of how diplomatic tensions between Harare and Washington continue to shape the daily lives of ordinary citizens.\n\n",

The President and government will not stand by while people enrich themselves using the names of our principals. This is no longer a civil matter  it is a criminal and security issue.\n\nHe warned that no official would be spared, regardless of rank: We do not care what position you hold in the party or government. If you are abusing office and the names of the President and Vice-Presidents to grab land, pack your things and vacate immediately. We will deal with it decisively.\n\nThis comes barely weeks afterThe Standardrevealed that Tourism and Hospitality deputy minister Tongai Mnangagwa  son of the President and MP for Hunyani constituency  sought to regularise the occupation of his supporters on land reserved for airport expansion. In a letter dated July 2, 2025, addressed to the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ), Tongai asked that settlements in the airports yellow zone be sanctioned.\n\nThe controversy has revived memories of 2015, when the late former President Robert Mugabe ordered the demolition of houses built by Nyikavanhu Housing Cooperative near the airport, calling them an eyesore and a security risk to airport development.\n\nMuguti further accused senior party members and government officials of abusing Zanu PF logos to write letters authorising land grabs and demanding payments from desperate home seekers and businesses.\n\nThis habit of pegging land and lying that the government has stopped demolitions must end, Muguti said. The Presidential Title Deeds Programme is not a certificate of authenticity for criminals. Land is not bought like sweets on the road.\n\nDespite repeated audits over the years to expose illegal land allocations in urban areas, the government has not made the findings public. Illegal settlements linked to powerful land barons remain widespread across Harare, with demolitions by the council failing to bring lasting solutions.\n\n",
