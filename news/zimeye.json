He does not represent the voice of Mashonaland West,she said.\n\nZanu-PFsWomensLeague and Youth League also echoed the calls forGezasexpulsion, with ProvincialYouth Chairperson Tapiwa Masendawarningthat thepartysvanguard would not tolerate any opposition toMnangagwasleadership.\n\nMnangagwascontinued snubbing of Chiwenga and his camp signals a clear intention to eliminate any remaining threats to his leadership within Zanu-PF.\n\nThe move against Geza is just one example of a broader strategy to neutralize opposition within the party, ensuring that Mnangagwa remains unchallenged.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nVice President General (Retired) Dr. Constantino Chiwenga, a key figure in Zimbabwes political landscape, is finding solace in the church amidst escalating tensions within the ruling party, Zanu PF. As the battle for succession intensifies, Chiwengas position has come under scrutiny, with growing whispers that he may be a stumbling block to President Emmerson Mnangagwas bid for a third term in office. While Mnangagwas supporters push for a 2030 agenda that extends his leadership, Chiwengas influence and loyalty to his principles are raising questions about the future direction of the party.\n\nIn a significant personal moment, Chiwenga was recently inducted into the Roman Catholic Guilds at the Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception at the House of Nazareth in Harare. This event, marked by his wife Colonel Miniyothabo Chiwenga and children, highlighted the Vice Presidents deep connection to his faith, which has been a guiding force throughout his life.\n\nSpeaking to the media after the ceremony, Chiwenga spoke passionately about the role of the Catholic Church in shaping his character and guiding his service to the nation. I was baptized soon after my birth on the 2nd of July 1956 and I have been a Catholic ever since. Fast forward, when I went to the war of liberation in 1973, I never stopped my Catholicism. I went to war with my rosary and I came back with it, Chiwenga said. His statement is a testament to the enduring strength of his faith, which he says has been integral to both his personal and professional life.\n\nFor Chiwenga, the church has been a steadfast support system through various trials. The guild system within the Catholic Church encourages members to deepen their faith and build a strong sense of community, values which Chiwenga aligns with his approach to leadership. He emphasized that the church plays a key role in promoting national cohesion, unity, and peacevalues he believes are essential to Zimbabwes development.\n\nChiwengas commitment to the church and his strong sense of moral duty appear to guide his approach to governance. His routine, which includes arriving early to work and staying committed to his faith, seems to reflect a man dedicated to both his country and his belief system. This blend of personal conviction and professional dedication is perhaps what sets Chiwenga apart in Zimbabwes increasingly complex political environment.\n\nHowever, as Zanu PFs internal struggles over succession heat up, Chiwenga finds himself at the center of the storm. His supporters argue that his military background, leadership experience, and commitment to Zimbabwes sovereignty make him a natural successor to Mnangagwa. Yet, Mnangagwas allies are pushing for him to extend his rule beyond the constitutional limits, with the 2030 agenda serving as the rallying point for those who wish to see the President remain in power.\n\nAs the nation watches these developments unfold, Chiwengas public return to his religious roots may be an attempt to find balance in the midst of political turbulence. Whether or not the church can provide him with the guidance needed to navigate this volatile situation remains to be seen, but it is clear that Chiwengas faith continues to serve as a cornerstone of his leadership.\n\nIn the coming months, Zimbabwe will likely see an intensification of political maneuvering within Zanu PF, with Chiwengas role in the succession battle likely to remain a pivotal topic of discussion. As the church serves as a source of solace for the Vice President, it may also play an unexpected role in the unfolding political drama.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a troubling development, the ruling Zanu PF party has been accused of hijacking the Basic Education Assistance Module (BEAM) in Masvingo Province, with government insiders revealing that well-connected individuals are now benefiting from the programme intended to assist vulnerable students.\n\nThe BEAM programme, which was created to help financially disadvantaged students access education, has long been a lifeline for many families in Zimbabwe.\n\nHowever, sources within the Ministry of Education have disclosed that influential figures are now using their power to redirect the benefits of the programme to their own advantage.\n\nThe BEAM programme has become chaotic. Government is struggling to fund and above all, those associated with Zanu PF are seizing the BEAM Programme. The whole thing is disastrous, said a school head, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nEducation in Zimbabwe is among the most expensive in Africa, and as a result, over 500,000 primary and secondary school learners have dropped out due to financial constraints. BEAM was originally intended to alleviate this burden by offering financial assistance to students from poor families.\n\nUnfortunately, the programme has struggled with inadequate funding, and now, with political figures allegedly exploiting it for personal gain, many vulnerable students are being left without the help they desperately need.\n\nDespite promises from the government to improve education access, the constitutional guarantee of free primary education and affordable secondary education remains largely unfulfilled. As the governments ability to fund BEAM continues to wane, the situation grows increasingly dire for families already facing financial hardship.\n\nThe situation in Masvingo Province is just one example of how the political elites involvement is threatening the future of education for Zimbabwes underprivileged students. The misappropriation of resources from programmes meant to help the poor only deepens the divide between the wealthy and those in need, undermining the goal of providing equal access to education for all.\n\nAs the crisis deepens, questions remain about how the government will address this growing scandal and whether real change will ever come for the students who depend on BEAM to stay in school.\n\n",

Geza, a Zanu PF Central Committee member, expressed deep regret at a press conference held in Harare on Sunday.\n\nI am deeply sorry and with hindsight, I regret this, Geza said, visibly emotional. We replaced Mugabe with a monster, a korokoza, he added, using the Shona term for a small-scale gold panner, which he used to describe Mnangagwas leadership as opportunistic and destructive.\n\nGeza went on to criticize Mnangagwa for what he sees as a dynastic grab for power, stating that the president has handed over the reins of state power to his wife and children. Mnangagwa is busy building a family empire. We helped in a big way, and today he says we are bad, Geza lamented.\n\nHis remarks have drawn attention to the growing disillusionment among some war veterans who were once strong supporters of Mnangagwas leadership. These comments also suggest that the countrys political landscape is seeing increasing internal divisions, with those who once helped bring Mnangagwa to power now questioning his leadership.\n\nThe war veterans apology adds another layer to the complex and often volatile political situation in Zimbabwe, where many are increasingly disillusioned with the direction in which the country is heading.\n\nVideo credit: HStv. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PutbMrVcqo\n\n",
