            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) has intensified its efforts to boost its revenue collection, announcing new tax measures targeting livestock this week. This move has raised concerns among already struggling citizens, particularly farmers, who are now being asked to include the value of their livestocksuch as goats, sheep, and other animalsas part of their gross income for tax purposes.\n\nZIMRAs latest initiative is in line with Section 8 (1) (h) of the Income Tax Act, which mandates farmers to include the closing stock value of livestock in their income reports. According to the law, livestock includes not only cattle, sheep, and goats, but also pigs, crocodiles, poultry, ostriches, zebras, and horses. These animals are further classified into stud livestock, which are kept for breeding, and ordinary livestock, which are either born on the farm or purchased for purposes other than breeding.\n\nFarmers must report the value of their livestock at the close of the year, which is incorporated into their gross income for tax calculations. To determine this closing value, farmers can choose from various valuation methods, but these methods must be approved by the ZIMRA Commissioner.\n\nAs ZIMRA stated, The reviewed values must be approved by the Commissioner, emphasizing the need for approval for any adjustments.\n\nThis new move comes at a time when many Zimbabweans are already facing severe economic hardships, and farmers are expressing concerns that these measures could add further strain.\n\nOne farmer, who wished to remain anonymous, shared their frustrations: Were struggling to feed our families, let alone deal with more government regulations- that will only add to our financial burden.\n\nCritics argue that this latest tax imposition will only exacerbate the economic challenges faced by smallholder farmers, particularly those who rely heavily on livestock for their livelihoods.\n\nDespite the concerns, ZIMRA maintains that the new measures are necessary to increase government revenue. A spokesperson for the authority stated, As a country, we need to ensure that every taxable item, including livestock, is properly accounted for in order to sustain public services.\n\nFarmers, however, remain skeptical, wondering whether this new tax system will further push them into deeper financial trouble. The pressure is mounting for both the government and citizens to find a balance between revenue generation and economic survival in a nation already grappling with inflation and unemployment.\n\n",

In a statement released on Tuesday, Chamisa emphasized the critical need to restore trust between the government and the people in order to foster national unity and success.\n\nThere is no government that can ever prosper, succeed, or be functionally effective when the majority of the citizens are not in agreement with it, Chamisa stated. He went on to stress that the deep-rooted mistrust between the government and the citizens has been a major obstacle to the countrys advancement. We must and will fix this problem, he added, showing his resolve to address the issue head-on.\n\nChamisa, who leads the opposition party Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), has been vocal about the need for political reforms and greater accountability from the government. His comments come at a time when many Zimbabweans are struggling with economic challenges and feel increasingly alienated from their leadership.\n\nThe lack of faith in the government, according to Chamisa, is not only a political issue but a barrier to economic recovery and national development. The people must have trust in their leaders, and without that trust, the entire nation suffers, Chamisa remarked.\n\nThe opposition leaders call to action highlights the urgency for dialogue and political reconciliation, as Zimbabwe faces a crossroads in its path to stability and prosperity. His comments resonate with many citizens who have long expressed frustration with the current political climate and are eager for change.\n\n",

The leagues Annual General Meeting (AGM) and elections, which were expected to usher in new leadership, have been inexplicably delayed.\n\nRumors are rife that the current leadership is deliberately stalling the electoral process, fearing that they will lose their positions if elections are held. This apprehension is fueled by the leagues dismal performance in 2024, which was marred by allegations of financial mismanagement, poorly organized tournaments, and questionable appointments.\n\nThe 2024 season was widely regarded as a disaster, with many clubs and academies expressing frustration with the leagues leadership. As a result, there is a growing consensus among stakeholders to install a new, competent executive to revitalize the HPJFDL.\n\nWith the leagues future hanging in the balance, it remains to be seen when the AGM and elections will be held, and whether the current leadership will relinquish power to make way for a new, more effective administration.\n\nOne thing is certain, however: the status quo is unsustainable, and drastic changes are needed to restore the HPJFDL to its former glory.\n\n",
