            "content": "By A Correspondent | Harare  Tuesday, 4 November 2025 | Barely hours after being granted US$3,000 bail by High Court Judge Justice Gibson Mandaza, self-proclaimed Prophet Walter Magaya is once again facing dramatic developments  this time, as over 15 armed police officers have positioned themselves at the Harare Magistrates Court gates, reportedly preparing to re-arrest him on fresh charges.\n\nZimEye correspondents on the ground report that armed CID officers and uniformed police are stationed both at the main exit gate and around Magayas convoy, effectively blocking his departure soon after the High Court ruling.\n\nHigh Court Bail Granted Earlier Today\n\nEarlier in the day, Justice Gibson Mandaza granted Magaya US$3,000 bail, ordering that he surrender his passport, report weekly to police, and not interfere with witnesses or complainants.\n\nThe ruling came after Magayas arrest on November 1, when he was detained by a Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) crack team over multiple counts of rape and fraud.\n\nHis wife, Tendai Magaya, and two companies linked to him  Plannet Africa Pvt Ltd and Yadah Connect Pvt Ltd  are jointly charged in a 13-count fraud case involving thousands of dollars collected from church members for non-existent housing and farming projects.\n\nPolice Mobilise at Court Gates\n\nWitnesses at the Harare Magistrates Court say police reinforcements arrived shortly after 3PM, minutes before Magayas lawyers began processing his release papers.\n\nOfficers from both the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) and Support Unit are reportedly on site.\n\nOne senior officer told ZimEye off record that the fresh arrest is linked to separate pending investigations  believed to involve additional complainants who recently approached the police with new allegations.\n\nThere are further cases being compiled. This is not over, said a law enforcement source familiar with the operation.\n\nTense Atmosphere Outside Court\n\nAs of publication, Magaya remained inside the courthouse, flanked by his legal team, while his convoy of luxury vehicles was parked in the restricted zone under heavy police presence.\n\nSources described the atmosphere as tense and uncertain, with officers reportedly awaiting final instructions from senior commanders before executing the re-arrest.\n\nBackground: Fraud and Rape Charges\n\nThe latest move follows allegations outlined in official CID documents (CR 720/12/23), accusing Magaya of defrauding congregants through fake residential and farming schemes between 2016 and 2018.\n\nThe court papers detail how Magaya and his associates allegedly misrepresented ownership of land  including New Donnington Farm, owned by Dr Gideon Gono  and collected thousands of dollars from PHD members for stands that never materialised.\n\nHe is also facing separate rape allegations, currently being handled under closed court proceedings.\n\nZimEyes Earlier Warning Proven Correct\n\nZimEye last week cautioned members of the public against sharing personal data with unverified individuals claiming to be CID officers following circulation of a fake police notice.\n\nThe ongoing arrests and overlapping investigations appear to confirm the sensitive and expanding scope of the case, which ZimEye has been tracking since 2014.\n\nDeveloping Story\n\nAs of this report, Magayas legal team was in urgent discussions with police commanders to clarify the basis of the new detention.\n\nCourt officials have not yet issued an official statement, and ZimEye will continue to provide live updates from the scene as the situation unfolds.\n\n",

            "content": "By Gift Ostallos Siziba  I was once arrested with Hon. Job Sikhala and all l can say is that he has endured more than most, all because of his undoubtable conviction to see a better Zimbabwe. For over three decades, he has walked in constant contact with danger, yet he continues to fight.\n\nHis life has been one of torment and torture, spent in the cruel hands of a brutal regime in Harare. Out of more than 90 false charges brought against him, he was acquitted in all, never compensated, never offered even a word of apology. Instead, they mocked and vilified him, turned him into cartoons and jokes told by regime troglodytes whose future he has sacrificed everything to defend.\n\nAfter spending more than a year in prison, he could have chosen the easier path, to retreat into private life. But that is not the life of a revolutionary. That is not the life of a fighter. You fight, no matter the cost!\n\nThey tormented him, his family, his spirit and when that was not enough, they pursued him even beyond our borders, into South Africa. Tonight, his future once again hangs in uncertainty.\n\nOf everything, Wiwa has been more than a comrade! We have laughed together. We have shared cells, buried comrades, canvassed for the movement, and celebrated small victories.\n\nWe can only look ahead with the conviction that one day, the people of Zimbabwe shall indeed be free!\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nFree Wiwa!\n\n",

Yet some locals expressed skepticism, questioning whether the so-called empowerment programs translate into tangible support for ordinary citizens.\n\n",

As long as its in the best interest of the citizenry, opposition, under my leadership in Parly, will support it.\n\nCritics argue that Tshabangus endorsement undermines the very principles of opposition politics, raising concerns that the CCC is compromising its integrity for political expediency. Observers condemned the move as a betrayal of the citizenry and the democratic mandate of the opposition.\n\nOne political analyst remarked, This is a shocking display of loyalty to the ruling party rather than the people. Supporting the extension of the Presidents term is a direct attack on democratic norms and the trust citizens place in opposition leaders.\n\nTshabangus sudden emergence from relative silence to champion a highly unpopular proposal has left many questioning his motives, with some accusing him of aligning with the ruling party for personal gain rather than genuine public interest.\n\n",
