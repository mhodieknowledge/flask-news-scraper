            "content": "In a dramatic turn of events, the leadership crisis within Zimbabwes Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) is set to reach a critical juncture as the High Court hears a case on Monday that pits acting president Professor Welshman Ncube against interim secretary-general Mr Sengezo Tshabangu. The outcome could determine the future direction of the fractured opposition party.\n\nBackground of the Dispute\n\nThe conflict stems from Mr Tshabangus recent controversial decision to recall several CCC leaders from key parliamentary positions, including the leader of the opposition in Parliament, Lynette Karenyi-Kore, and chief whip Edwin Mushoriwa. Tshabangu also replaced various Parliamentary Portfolio Committee chairpersons, actions that have been hotly contested by Prof Ncube and his allies.\n\nProf Ncube, through his law firm, Mathonsi Ncube Law Chambers, has filed an urgent chamber application at the Bulawayo High Court to nullify these decisions. He argues that Tshabangu acted without proper authority and violated CCCs internal processes.\n\nIn his affidavit, Prof Ncube contends that decisions such as appointing or removing party representatives in Parliament require resolutions from the partys organs. He also challenged Tshabangus authority, stating, The first respondent has placed himself above his seniors in the hierarchy of the party, thereby disrespecting the organisational integrity of the party.\n\nTshabangus Counterarguments\n\nTshabangu, through his lawyer, Mr Nqobani Sithole, has dismissed Prof Ncubes claims, arguing that Ncube lacks the legal authority to represent or act on behalf of the CCC party. Tshabangu also asserts that the matter is not urgent, as the changes in parliamentary leadership have already been implemented.\n\nTshabangu further disputes Prof Ncubes position as the acting president of the party, stating, He was not appointed to act in that capacity in perpetuity. In any event, his term of office and that of the entire executive along with him has expired.\n\nLeadership Battle Intensifies\n\nThe CCCs leadership has been in disarray since the resignation of its former leader, Nelson Chamisa, earlier this year. Chamisa stepped down after Tshabangu orchestrated recalls of MPs aligned with his faction, further deepening divisions within the party. Prof Ncube was appointed as the acting leader of one faction, while Tshabangu has emerged as a powerful force in his own right.\n\nAnalysts view Mondays High Court hearing as a critical moment for the CCC. If Prof Ncube succeeds, it could consolidate his authority and restore some order within the party. However, a ruling in favor of Tshabangu would cement his dominance and potentially weaken Ncubes faction.\n\nImplications for the CCC and Zimbabwes Opposition\n\nThe CCCs internal strife comes at a time when Zimbabwes opposition is under immense pressure to present a united front against the ruling ZANU-PF. The leadership battle risks further fragmenting the party, which has already lost significant ground due to infighting.\n\nPolitical analysts warn that the dispute could have long-term consequences for the partys credibility and effectiveness. Dr. Tendai Moyo, a political commentator, remarked, The CCC needs to resolve its internal conflicts urgently. The prolonged leadership crisis is eroding public trust and leaving a void in Zimbabwes opposition politics.\n\nWhats Next?\n\nAs the High Court prepares to hear the case, all eyes are on Prof Ncube and Tshabangu. The ruling will not only decide who controls the CCC but also shape the partys ability to function as a viable opposition force.\n\nFor now, the CCC remains a party at war with itself, and the battle for its soul shows no signs of abating.\n\nBREAKING- The self imposing opposition leader, Sengezo Tshabangu (standing with a brown trousers and flat cap, while waiting)  has just turned up for a ZANU PF meeting at Crowne Plaza with a notorious Mabvuku man working for the GoldMafia's Scott Sakupwanya, he has been gettingpic.twitter.com/Y1NZzoIgHd\n\n",

            "content": "video loading below\n\nAnd even Christians are like that. Many of them don't see any good. See any good? There's there's one, there's one. In social media thing called ZimEye, those ones, they just love. I don't know they love hitting me from time to time. It doesn't mattermuch to me,because it's\n\nAndrew Wutaunashe spends 8 hour church sermon to denounce ZimEye news network | Videopic.twitter.com/2DK2ntan6P\n\nHarare, Zimbabwe  Prophet Andrew Wutaunashe, and ally of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, took an extraordinary 8 hours on Christmas Day to deliver an impassioned sermon targeting the ZimEye news network. In an emotional address, Wutaunashe lashed out at the publication for its recent expos, which highlights his demands for a luxury car from his impoverished church members while publicly claiming to advocate for the poor.\n\nThe ZimEye article, published earlier this month, highlighted the preachers December 15 sermon in which he announced his expectation of receiving a brand-new car by Easter 2025, stressing that this should be arranged by his bishops who must prove that they love him through this. The report pointed out the contradiction in Wutaunashes condemnation of the British government for allegedly lacking a conscience for the poor while simultaneously making costly demands on his financially struggling followers.\n\nIn his Christmas sermon, Wutaunashe referred to ZimEye as a social media thing and instructed his congregation to rebrand it as ZimOwl, drawing on an unusual anecdote from his childhood involving witches, snakes, and hyenas.\n\nWhen we were young, we would sing in the African bush in the village The snake is the whip. The headlight is an owl, he said in the lengthy speech. He accused ZimEye of being part of a network of Zimbabwean witches intent on disrupting national progress. You are used by Satan to disrupt all the progress and the blessing to bring peace to this nation, he declared.\n\nA Call for a Luxury Vehicle\n\nThe preacher, who is known for his close ties to Zimbabwes political elite, also reiterated his demand for a new car during his sermon. At Easter camp next year, the bishops will give me a car I wont tell them what type, otherwise they will be in shock, he stated to applause.\n\nThis statement has sparked widespread criticism on social media, with many Zimbabweans questioning the ethics of such a demand from a congregation largely composed of economically disadvantaged members. The backlash has also reignited debates about the role of religious leaders in perpetuating poverty while living lavish lifestyles.\n\nThe ZimEye team has yet to issue an official response to the sermon but has shared clips of the preachers speech on their platforms, prompting further scrutiny of his statements. Commentators have noted the irony of Wutaunashes claim to stand for the poor while making public demands that strain the finances of his flock.\n\nGrowing Divisions in Zimbabwes Religious and Political Landscape\n\nThe incident adds to a growing rift between Zimbabwes religious leaders and the public, with many accusing high-profile prophets of exploiting their congregations. Critics argue that Wutaunashes alignment with the ruling ZANU-PF party has shielded him from accountability while allowing him to maintain his affluent lifestyle.\n\nAs Easter 2025 approaches, it remains to be seen whether the bishops promise of a car will materializeor if this controversy will further erode the preachers credibility among Zimbabweans.\n\n",

            "content": "Posthumous Recording Reveals Dlakamas Prophetic Vision for Mozambiques Freedom\n\nMaputo, Mozambique  A newly uncovered recording of the late Alfonso Dlakama, the former leader of Mozambiques opposition party RENAMO, has sent shockwaves through the nation. In the cryptic yet evocative audio, Dlakama appears to deliver a prophetic message foretelling a significant moment of liberation for Mozambique, pinpointing the month of December as pivotal in the countrys future.\n\nThe recording, shared anonymously, has sparked widespread speculation and introspection, with Dlakamas words being interpreted as a vision of Mozambiques path to true freedom:\n\nSeismic message says, message approach the program as the independence of you. My tentative to go to study map put UV a Fauci the days on the it does the December, middle of centers is state is simple.\n\nThough fragmented, Dlakamas words suggest a profound belief in a December milestone that could mark a turning point for Mozambique. His mention of a seismic message and independence of you has been interpreted by some as a call to action for the Mozambican people to embrace a new chapter of self-determination and national progress.\n\nA December of Transformation\n\nThe prophetic tone intensifies as Dlakama seemingly ties his vision to themes of unity and renewal:\n\nNow, Kanza, marital, Kia, ora per to another hospital, measure, military, along with the Kennedy Kanda podemos era Maputo, el paso a mostrarlos, Kanza room, dispara na que Altura forum.\n\nAnalysts suggest this segment reflects Dlakamas belief in Mozambiques capacity to overcome divisions, symbolized by the imagery of hospitals, military measures, and forums of unity. The mention of Maputo, the capital, underscores its central role as a hub of transformation and leadership in achieving national freedom.\n\nThe most striking aspect of the recording lies in Dlakamas apparent prediction of Mozambiques resurgence in the face of adversity, tied to the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath:\n\nSe me se ja post de independencia, porque se requie us, Maputo para recurtare us, ma context sera que A parte de Avi acegado NUS parte Maputo para Coronavirus militaris.\n\nHere, Dlakama seems to foresee a future where Mozambique emerges stronger and more united, having confronted both health crises and socio-political challenges. His mention of a post-independence moment hints at a second wave of liberationone driven by the resilience of the people and a renewed sense of national purpose.\n\nPublic Reactions\n\nThe recording has sparked emotional reactions across Mozambique, with many viewing it as a final message of hope from the late leader. Supporters of Dlakama have hailed the clip as evidence of his unwavering commitment to Mozambiques freedom, even beyond his lifetime.\n\nThis is not just a recording; its a call to action, said one RENAMO supporter in Maputo. Dlakama is telling us that December will bring change if we are ready to embrace it.\n\nOthers have pointed to the mysterious nature of the message, urging careful interpretation. While the specific details remain unclear, the overarching theme of freedom and resilience resonates deeply with Mozambicans.\n\nDlakamas Legacy\n\nDlakama, who passed away in 2018, remains a towering figure in Mozambiques history. As the leader of RENAMO during the countrys tumultuous post-independence period, he played a key role in shaping Mozambiques political landscape, often calling for justice and equality.\n\nThis latest revelation adds a new dimension to his legacy, casting him as a visionary who believed in Mozambiques enduring potential for liberation and growth.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nWhether Dlakamas prophecy comes to fruition remains to be seen, but his words have already reignited hope and determination among Mozambicans. As December approaches, many are looking to the future with renewed optimism, inspired by the possibility that the late leaders vision of freedom might finally become reality.\n\nFor now, the nation watches and waits, its people united by a message that transcends time: that Mozambiques greatest days may yet lie ahead.-ZimEye\n\n",

Mpofus message continued, May the Festive Season be filled with laughter, love and warmth and may the new year bring with it a renewed sense of patriotism and pride in our beloved nation.\n\nHowever, many Zimbabweans feel that the message is tone-deaf and insensitive to the struggles they face daily. The country has been plagued by economic instability, high inflation, and shortages of basic goods, leaving many citizens struggling to make ends meet.\n\nZimbabwe has a long history of political and economic turmoil, dating back to the colonial era . The country gained independence in 1980, but has since been ruled by the Zanu PF party, which has been accused of authoritarianism and human rights abuses.\n\nAs the country heads into the new year, many Zimbabweans are skeptical about the prospects for improvement. The Zanu PFs festive season message has only added to their frustration and sense of disillusionment with the ruling party.\n\nIn a year that promises to bring more challenges and uncertainties, Zimbabweans are calling for genuine action and solutions from their leaders, rather than empty words and festive greetings.\n\n",

Lorraine, in her trademark witty style, responded decisively: Rodza hama dzako iwe (Advise your own relatives instead), a response that has gone viral and fueled discussions about gender expectations in modern Zimbabwe.\n\nA Stand for Independence\n\nLorraines refusal to conform to traditional expectations has been celebrated by many, particularly younger women, who see her as a role model for self-sufficiency and independence. This is a woman who has built her own success and refuses to let societal norms dictate her timeline, said one supporter on Twitter.\n\nHer message aligns with a growing movement among women in Zimbabwe and beyond, rejecting the notion that marriage is the ultimate marker of success. Lorraines fans point out that her accomplishmentsbuilding a career in entertainment and becoming a household namespeak volumes about her ability to thrive without societal validation through marriage.\n\nCriticism from Traditionalists\n\nNot everyone supports Lorraines stance. Traditionalists argue that marriage remains a cornerstone of Zimbabwean culture and see her response as dismissive of values tied to family and community. Women who wait too long miss the chance to build stable families, wrote one Facebook commenter.\n\nHowever, critics of this perspective argue that such views unfairly pressure women into life decisions based on outdated standards, rather than allowing them to prioritize personal growth and financial independence.\n\nA Broader Conversation\n\nThis debate has highlighted the tension between traditional gender roles and the evolving aspirations of modern women in Zimbabwe. Social commentator Rutendo Moyo explains, Lorraines response is not just a rejection of marriage pressure; its a rejection of the idea that women should live their lives according to a timeline imposed by others.\n\nHer stance comes at a time when many young women are choosing to focus on their careers and personal development, challenging longstanding cultural expectations.\n\nLorraine Guyos decision to confront societal pressures head-on has sparked a necessary conversation about womens autonomy and the changing landscape of gender roles in Zimbabwe. Whether celebrated or criticized, her boldness underscores a generational shift in perspectives on marriage and success.\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear: Lorraine Guyo remains unapologetically true to herself, inspiring others to do the same.

            "content": "By Dorrothy Moyo | ZimEye |A tense and chaotic scene unfolded on stage in Chitungwiza as Ngwere, popularly known as Silent Killer, faced an unrelenting and angry crowd at a packed auditorium. What started as an electrifying performance soon turned into a nightmare for the hip-hop artist, as fans loudly demanded he be replaced by Zimbabwean music legend Alick Macheso.\n\nSilent Killer\n\nSilent Killer appeared on stage, donning a signature AMIRI shirt, and began his set with high energy. The crowd, however, was not receptive. Chants of Macheso! Macheso! echoed through the venue, drowning out the artists lyrics and overpowering the music.\n\nDespite his efforts to engage the audience, Silent Killers performance faltered as the crowds frustration escalated. The restless attendees shouted and gestured, calling for the immediate replacement of the rapper with the much-loved sungura maestro, Alick Macheso.\n\nStage Scenery Turns Tense\n\nThe stage, lit with vibrant lights and filled with energy at the start, became a battleground of boos and protests. Silent Killers backing crew appeared visibly uneasy, while event organizers huddled backstage, scrambling to regain control of the situation. The once-jubilant atmosphere had turned sour, with many attendees waving their hands and shouting in unison for their musical preference.\n\nSeveral fans approached the stage, urging organizers to end Silent Killers performance. Security personnel stepped in to maintain order, but the chants for Macheso only grew louder. Silent Killer, visibly frustrated, eventually stopped mid-performance and addressed the crowd, pleading for their attention and understanding. His words, however, fell on deaf ears.\n\nFans Demand Machesos Return\n\nThe incident highlighted the unwavering loyalty of Zimbabwean fans to Alick Macheso, one of the countrys most beloved musicians. Known for his unmatched mastery of the sungura genre, Macheso commands a level of respect and admiration that few can rival. Many fans who attended the event expected to see Macheso headline, leaving them disappointed and vocal when the lineup did not go as anticipated.\n\nEvent Organizers in the Spotlight\n\nThe organizers have since faced backlash for their failure to handle the crowds expectations and dissatisfaction. Questions have been raised about why Macheso, a fan favorite, was not given the main performance slot.\n\nAs for Silent Killer, the incident may be a sharp reminder of the challenges artists face in winning over a crowd that has its heart set on a particular performer. While his talent remains undisputed, last nights events demonstrated the unwavering passion of Zimbabwean music fans for their legends.\n\nThe night concluded with Silent Killer exiting the stage prematurely, as the crowds chants for Macheso continued unabated. Whether this experience will lead to a reconciliation between the artist and his audience remains to be seen. ZimEye\n\n",
