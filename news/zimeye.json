Coincidentally, 6 years is also the period in which Mnangagwa in a recent speech says he has allowed state procurement thugs to thrive.\n\nThe incident happened the same day anti corruption activist Blessed Geza announced further allegations that Mnangagwa is suffering from acute dementia.\n\nThe President sent someone from the B1 branch of the CIO, go to President Mugabe and call him, I cant hold the meeting without him, sources told ZimEye.\n\nFurther details were not available.\n\nThe Presidents office had not passed comment over the matter at the time of writing.\n\nThe development comes at a time when the president is accused of having lost his capacities to a health challenge.\n\nGeza says the country is now being run by his wife and businessman Kuda Tagwirei.

            "content": "Harare  April 23, 2025 | ZimEye News Desk\n\nBy A Correspondent | ZimEye | A kombi driver has been abducted by a group of unidentified men in Dzivarasekwa Extension, Harare, in a dramatic escalation of violent incidents that rocked the area earlier this morning.\n\nThe abduction occurred at Transerv, a local service centre, just hours after a violent assault spree by five unidentified men driving two white Toyota GD6 Fortuners, without number plates. Witnesses told ZimEye that the gang, dressed in civilian clothing, descended into the suburb around 10AM and began indiscriminately beating residents with baton sticks.\n\nAt least 16 people were assaulted, accused by the attackers of burning tyres on Chesa Road in Dzivarasekwa Extension. However, residents say they have no knowledge of who was behind the tyre-burning.\n\nWe do not know who burnt the tyres. We arrived at the spot and found the six tyres already burning on the road, said one witness.\n\nThe violence continued for over 15 minutes, forcing local shops to shut down. A tyre repairman known only as Shamhamha was among those severely injured. He was reportedly struck with a shovel and later admitted to Parirenyatwa Hospital, where his condition remains unknown. Efforts to get official comment from hospital authorities were unsuccessful at the time of publication.\n\nIn a disturbing turn, the same group is believed to have later abducted a kombi driver from Transerv. The motive behind the kidnapping is unclear, and the identity of the victim has not yet been released.\n\nThe assailants, still unidentified, effectively shut down the entire area during the assault. Tensions remain high in Dzivarasekwa Extension as residents fear further violence.\n\nAuthorities have yet to issue an official statement.\n\nThis is a developing story. More to follow.\n\n",
