The cart, which lacked proper illumination or warning signals, became a hazard in the dark.\n\nMr. Sunday, who was riding home, suffered serious head injuries as a result of the impact and died at the scene near Mlondiwa Homestead.\n\nAdding to the tragedy, the individuals operating the donkey-drawn cart fled the scene, leaving the cart and animals behind. Police are currently searching for the individuals responsible for the cart.\n\nThe people who were driving the scotch cart disappeared from the scene, leaving the cart and the animals,said Inspector Mahoko.\n\nThe Growing Danger of Donkey-Cart Accidents\n\nDonkey-drawn carts are a common mode of transport in rural areas but pose significant risks when operated unsafely or without proper precautions, especially at night.\n\nRising cases of collisions involving motorcycles and animal-drawn carts highlight the need for greater safety awareness on rural roads.\n\nTips to Avoid Accidents with Donkey-Drawn Carts\n\nMotorists, motorcyclists, and cart operators can take precautionary steps to avoid accidents:\n\nFor Motorcyclists and Drivers:\n\n1.Reduce Speed at Night: Always slow down on rural roads, especially where animals or carts might be present.\n\n2.Use Proper Lighting: Ensure headlights are bright and functional to illuminate hazards ahead.\n\n3.Be Alert for Slow-Moving Vehicles: Donkey-drawn carts are common in rural areas and may appear suddenly.\n\n4.Stay in Control: Avoid excessive speed to ensure you can react quickly to unexpected obstacles.\n\n5.Wear Protective Gear: Helmets can reduce the severity of injuries in the event of an accident.\n\nFor Donkey-Cart Operators:\n\n1.Avoid Traveling at Night: Carts are hard to see in low light conditions and pose significant hazards.\n\n2.Use Reflective Materials: Attach reflectors or bright cloth to the cart and animals to improve visibility.\n\n3.Signal Caution: If traveling at night is unavoidable, carry lanterns or torches to alert approaching traffic.\n\n4.Control Speed: Keep animals at a safe, manageable pace to avoid sudden movements.\n\n5.Follow Road Rules: Operate the cart responsibly and ensure it remains on the correct side of the road.\n\nCalls for Action\n\nLocal authorities and safety advocates are urging for increased awareness campaigns targeting rural road users. Inspector Mahoko emphasized the need for mutual responsibility among road users to prevent such tragedies.\n\nThis accident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by unregulated animal-drawn carts and speeding vehicles, particularly on poorly lit rural roads.\n\nOngoing Investigation\n\nPolice continue to investigate the accident and are actively seeking the individuals responsible for the donkey cart.\n\nStay tuned for updates on this developing story as authorities work to improve road safety and prevent similar incidents.\n\n",

The report highlighted how the Accord, underpinned by the philosophy of the Second Republic, leaves no one and no place behind.\n\nThe 1987 Unity Accord has been hailed for propelling inclusive development across the country, buttressed by the Second Republics philosophy of leaving no one and no place behind, the ZBC broadcast noted.\n\nThe historic agreement between Cde Robert Gabriel Mugabe, leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), and Dr. Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo, leader of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU), resulted in a strong alliance.

            "content": "By Farai D Hove | ZimEye |Hwange, Zimbabwe  The sentencing of Patricia Dube, a 39-year-old Hwange woman, to an effective 12-month jail term for misappropriating US$10,000 entrusted to her by her neighbor, has reignited debates about the fairness of the judicial system in Zimbabwe. While Dubes case highlights the importance of trust and accountability, comparisons with high-profile cases involving millions of dollars have raised questions about consistency in sentencing.\n\nDube, convicted by Hwange magistrate Ms Fungai Dzimiri for theft of trust property, must restitute US$9,969 to the complainant Sympathy Moyo by 30 January 2025, failing which she risks serving an additional 18 months in jail. The strict punishment has drawn comparisons to recent cases where individuals who misappropriated significantly larger sums were not subjected to custodial sentences.\n\nCase Comparisons: Double Standards in Sentencing?\n\n1.The NSSA Scandal (2019): Misappropriation of US$95 Million\n\nIn one of Zimbabwes largest financial scandals, the National Social Security Authority (NSSA) lost US$95 million through fraudulent investments and misuse of funds. Despite the scale of the financial loss and its devastating impact on pensioners, several implicated officials were either fined, suspended, or simply relieved of their duties, with no significant custodial sentences issued.\n\nThe former NSSA board chairperson faced corruption charges but secured bail and, ultimately, avoided long-term incarceration. The disparity between the treatment of Dubewho mishandled a relatively smaller amountand NSSA officials has left the public questioning the equality of justice.\n\n2.The ZINARA Fraud Case (2020): US$3 Million Misused\n\nThe Zimbabwe National Road Administration (ZINARA) was embroiled in a scandal involving the misuse of US$3 million meant for infrastructure projects. The funds were siphoned through inflated contracts, ghost companies, and improper procurement practices. Key individuals implicated in the ZINARA scandal faced court trials, but most of them received non-custodial sentences, such as fines and community service.\n\nCritics argue that ZINARA officials lenient treatment reflects systemic favoritism, contrasting sharply with Dubes harsh 12-month jail term for US$10,000.\n\n3.The Harare City Council Scandal (2022): US$1 Million Stolen\n\nIn 2022, Harare City Council officials were accused of misappropriating over US$1 million through unauthorized allowances, fuel abuse, and dubious tenders. Despite the scale of the offense, the accused officials avoided jail time, instead receiving fines or being dismissed from their positions.\n\nThe contrast between Dubes custodial sentence and the outcomes of the council scandal has intensified public frustration, with many Zimbabweans questioning whether ordinary citizens are held to a different standard than those in influential positions.\n\nA Closer Look at Dubes Sentence\n\nWhile Dube undeniably betrayed the trust placed in her, her sentencing to jail raises broader questions about proportional justice. Critics argue that her punishmentdespite involving a relatively small amountwas disproportionately severe compared to the leniency shown to individuals accused of looting millions.\n\n",

            "content": "Chaos Unfolds as President Mnangagwa Criticizes Cabinet Absenteeism Amid Renaming Controversy\n\nBy Dorrothy Moyo |Harare, Zimbabwe  In a tense conclusion to the year, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has slammed Cabinet Ministers for failing to attend critical government meetings while presiding over the controversial renaming of the Mbudzi Interchange to Trabablas Interchange, a nickname often associated with the President himself.\n\nThe renaming, announced during a Cabinet press briefing, was intended to honor Mnangagwas visionary leadership. However, the event has been overshadowed by growing irony and chaos after revelations that many Cabinet members have been skipping meetingsa situation Mnangagwa deems unacceptable.\n\nPresidents Rebuke\n\nDuring the final Cabinet meeting of 2024, Mnangagwa issued a stern warning, calling out errant ministers and senior government officials for their consistent absenteeism. He described their absence as tantamount to dereliction of duty, warning of dire consequences in 2025 if attendance does not improve.\n\nCabinet processes are anchored on the timely submission of vital documents and regular attendance by Ministers and officials. The worrisome tendency to absent themselves is untenable,Mnangagwa declared.\n\nThe Chief Secretary, Dr. Martin Rushwaya, has been tasked with closely monitoring attendance, signaling a stricter regime moving forward. Mnangagwa emphasized that Cabinet meetings must take precedence over all other responsibilities.\n\nTrabablas Interchange Controversy\n\nThe renaming of Mbudzi Interchange to Trabablas Interchange, intended as a tribute to the President, has stirred significant public debate. Critics, including former Minister Walter Mzembi, ridiculed the move, calling it a sycophantic gesture and proposing satirical alternatives such as Musoro Wambuya Vako Interchange, a colloquial insult.\n\nMzembis viral post highlights the growing public frustration with government priorities amid Zimbabwes economic challenges and the misalignment of leadership focus.\n\nMixed Public Reaction\n\nPublic opinion on the renaming remains polarized:\n\nSupporters view the renaming as a symbolic gesture recognizing Mnangagwas infrastructure efforts.\n\nCritics argue that it reflects misplaced priorities and underscores a disconnect between leadership and public sentiment.\n\nThe controversy, combined with the Presidents rebuke of his own Cabinet, has sparked a chaotic end to the political year, raising questions about the governments ability to balance optics with governance.\n\nPerformance Contracts and Accountability\n\nMnangagwas administration introduced performance contracts for Cabinet Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, and parastatal heads to improve efficiency and service delivery. Despite this, absenteeism has remained a recurring issue. Moving forward, Deputy Ministers will also sign performance contracts, ensuring greater accountability.\n\nThe Presidents stern address signals a renewed push for discipline and leadership responsibility in 2025 as Zimbabwe continues to pursue Vision 2030its ambitious plan for economic growth and transformation.\n\nWhats Next?\n\nAs the political storm surrounding Trabablas Interchange and Cabinet absenteeism continues, all eyes are on the governments ability to restore confidence and deliver meaningful progress in the coming year.\n\nStay tuned for updates on this developing story.\n\n",

However, in a statement issued on December 17, Emang Mutapati, the Press Secretary to President Boko, refuted these claims as baseless and unfounded.\n\nMutapatis statement emphasized: The Office of the President categorically refutes false allegations that President Duma Boko has received any breed of cows or similar gifts from His Excellency President Emmerson Mnangagwa of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\n\nThe statement further clarified that President Boko has no involvement in farming activities, stating, President Boko has never been involved in farming, either as a cattle rancher or in any other manner.\n\nThe press release described the rumors as a deliberate act of propaganda designed to mislead the public, detract from the critical work of the administration, and tarnish the strong diplomatic relations between Botswana and Zimbabwe. Mutapati called on the public to disregard the allegations and stated, We urge the public to dismiss these misleading allegations with the contempt they deserve.\n\nIn addition, the statement called on the Botswana Editors Forum to protect the public from those spreading misinformation, saying, We call on the leadership of the Botswana Editors Forum to protect the public from rogue elements who masquerade as journalists while engaging in deliberate misinformation campaigns.\n\nThe statement concluded by reaffirming that the diplomatic relationship between Presidents Boko and Mnangagwa remains focused on strengthening cooperation and fostering mutual development between the two nations.\n\n",
