The government must engage the best companies or investors who can revive the Kariba Dam Hydro Power Plant.\n\nThe group also provided a visual explanation of the current state of the power supply. They shared two photos, with the first showing the turbines at the Kariba Dam, noting, These are our turbines, and only 2 out of 5 are working. Unfortunately, as of yesterday, only one turbine was functional.\n\nThe second photo depicted Zambias situation, which is similarly strained. Zambia also had only 2 turbines working. Water levels have decreased so much despite other challenges, they added.\n\nThe Varakashis comments highlight the growing frustration and urgency surrounding the ongoing power crisis in the country.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nInfighting within the ZANU PF Youth League has escalated, as Youth League Secretary Tinoda Machakaire has demanded that his deputy, John Paradza, immediately retract a circular that he issued, which allegedly nullified a recent reshuffling of the national executive council.\n\nOn December 9, 2024, Machakaire announced the reshuffle of the ZANU PF Youth League, a move that was met with resistance from Paradza. Paradza argued that the reshuffle was unconstitutional and instructed the affected officials to remain in their positions.\n\nIn his response, Paradza referred to specific provisions within the partys constitution, asserting, May you acquaint yourself with the provisions of Article 26(340)(1)&(2) which provide for the functions and responsibilities of the Deputy Secretary for Youth Affairs. He emphasized that as Deputy Secretary for Youth Affairs, Machakaire had no right to interfere with the functions of the Secretary for Youth Affairs, stating that Machakaire had no constitutional basis for making such a move.\n\nParadza further challenged Machakaires actions, saying, In your letter, you have made vague reference to the composition of the Youth League National Executive Council without particularity on the provision you rely on in making your assertions. He pointed out that there had been no breach of the constitution in the reshuffle, as no official had been removed from the National Executive Council.\n\nMachakaire, in his own letter, defended the reshuffle, stating, Adjustments in the departmental leadership of the Youth League National Executive Council have been implemented purely for the purposes of enhancing the fulfilment of the Youth Leagues constitutional obligations and the execution of the National Peoples Conference Resolutions.\n\nHe also made it clear that the changes were in line with guidance from his principal, asserting, As head of the Youth League, I have communicated the adjustments as I have been duly guided by my Principal in terms of Article 10(88)(1), (2)&(13) and Article 26(339)(1)&(4).\n\nIn conclusion, Machakaire ordered Paradza to withdraw his circular immediately, warning that failure to do so would result in further disciplinary actions. Your much circulated and published correspondence contesting the communicated position is irregular and must be withdrawn forthwith, failing which the appropriate measures shall be set in motion, he stated.\n\nThe growing tension within the Youth League highlights deepening divisions within ZANU PF, with significant implications for the partys future cohesion.\n\n",

            "content": "South Africa The Department of Home Affairs and the Border Management Authority (BMA) have intensified anti-immigration measures, unveiling drones and deportation busesin a bidto curb illegal border crossings ahead of the festive season.\n\nThese measures, described by critics as xenophobic, primarily target Zimbabweans and other regional migrants seeking refuge in Pretoria amid economic hardships back home.\n\nAt the same time, Botswana has adopted a more inclusive approach, expediting documentation processes for skilled Zimbabweans to fill labour gaps in its booming economy, particularly in the diamond sector.\n\nThe use of drones, hailed as a first-of-its-kind initiative, was launched by Democratic Alliance (DA) Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber.\n\nAt the launch event, Schreiber emphasised the governments commitment to monitoring South Africas bordersmore rigorously.\n\nNo longer will it be the case that people can move around without us having eyes on them, Schreiber said. We want to send a very clear message to people who want to violate South Africas immigration laws: for the very first time, you wont even know that we are seeing you. We are above you, we are around you, and we are watching for infringements along the borderline.\n\nThe drones willbe supplementedby body cameras for border guards to prevent corruption and ensure safety.\n\nTo further bolster enforcement, the government has introduced buses tasked with deporting undocumented migrants back to their home countries.\n\nSchreiber stressed the importance of distinguishing between those who follow the law and contribute to the South African economy and those who do not.\n\nWe welcome anytraveler, investor, tourist, or skilled person who will follow our laws and help us build South Africa. But that is different from people who violate our law and dont want to comply with our rules.\n\nIn a symbolic demonstration of the new measures, the first wave of deportations saw 290 illegal miners sent back to Mozambique.\n\nWhile South Africa tightens its grip, Botswana has taken a markedly different stance.\n\nThe country announced plans to expedite work permits and documentation for skilled Zimbabweansalreadycontributing to its economic growth.\n\nThe move, celebrated by many Zimbabwean professionals, is part of Botswanas broader strategy to harness regional talent in key industries.\n\nThe contrasting approaches highlight divergent regional strategies toward migration.\n\nWhile South Africas methods are increasingly focused on border militarisation and mass deportations, Botswanas policies appear to underscore the potential of skilled migrants to foster economic development.\n\n",
