            "content": "By Courts Reporter  A dramatic twist has emerged in the rape case involving popular social media personality Mai Jeremaya, as the two accused men now claim the encounter was a paid arrangement that went sour over a fee dispute.\n\nThabo Blessing Dube (27) and Martin Charlie (25), arrested over the weekend, appeared in court on Monday facing rape charges. The complainant, known widely as Mai Jeremaya, waived her right to anonymity by posting a video detailing the alleged assault. Her account sparked widespread outrage and support from other women, including social media figures such as Mai TT.\n\nHowever, in court documents submitted by the State yesterday, the accused men presented a radically different version of events.\n\nThey allege that Dube facilitated a meeting between Charlie and Mai Jeremaya at Joina City in central Harare, where she allegedly agreed to engage in sex with Charlie for a US$20 fee. They claim the three proceeded to a lodge in Eastlea, where Mai Jeremaya willingly undressed, kissed Charlie, and had consensual sex with him, fully aware of the nature of their encounter.\n\nDube, on the other hand, denies any sexual contact with her, contrary to her allegations.\n\nAccording to their defence, trouble began after the act, when Mai Jeremaya allegedly demanded US$500 instead of the agreed US$20. They claim she still accepted the US$20, took a shower, and was escorted to a taxi by the duo.\n\nTwo days later, the men allege, she sent a private investigatorTafadzwa Detective Kedha Chidawato locate them as part of an extortion attempt. When they refused to pay more, they say, the rape allegation was made.\n\nThe State had initially consented to bail, but Magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa challenged this decision, questioning why the accused were not also facing aggravated indecent assault charges, as they allegedly forced the complainant to perform oral sex.\n\nIn its revised submission, the State acknowledged this concern but argued that both the rape and the alleged forced oral sex formed part of the same transaction. Prosecutors said charging both offences would amount to splitting of charges, as the same evidence applies to both.\n\nDespite the seriousness of the allegations, the State said it had no compelling reasons to deny bail.\n\nThere are no well-founded fears that the accused will abscond, the submission read. They have fixed addresses, no previous convictions or pending cases, and did not show any conduct suggesting flight risk.\n\n",

            "content": "Cape Town South African authorities have ramped up investigations into fugitive Malawian preacher Shepherd Bushiri and controversial Zimbabwean businessman Wicknell Chivayo, both implicated in high-level cross-border fraud and money laundering schemes that are now drawing growing regional attention.\n\nThe developments emerged during the 15th Commonwealth Regional Conference for Heads of Anti-Corruption Agencies in Africa, currently underway in Cape Town. Hosted by South Africas Special Investigating Unit (SIU), the conference has brought together anti-corruption agencies from 21 Commonwealth African countries under the theme:Enhancing Inclusive Participation of State and Non-State Actors to Prevent and Combat Corruption.\n\nChivayo is under scrutiny by South Africas Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC), the South African Revenue Service (SARS), and the police, following allegations that Zimbabwes Ministry of Finance irregularly paid over R1.1 billion to Ren-Form, a Johannesburg-based printing company contractedwithout a public tenderto supply election materials for Zimbabwes 2023 general elections.\n\nMore than R800 million of that amount is believed to have been funneled into companies linked to Chivayo, including Intratrek Holdings and Dolintel Trading. A confidential FIC report, accessed byZimLive, outlines how these funds were swiftly disbursed into Chivayo-controlled entities and then redistributed through suspicious transactions. Notably, R351 million was paid to Asibambeki Platinum Group, R5.4 million to luxury car dealership Daytona, and R4 million to the law firm Strauss Scher Inc.\n\nAlthough Chivayo insists the transactions were legitimate business operations, his defense has been severely weakened by leaked audio recordingsallegedly of himbragging about bribing senior Zimbabwean officials to secure the lucrative contract. While he later issued an apology to President Emmerson Mnangagwa and others mentioned in the tapes, he did not deny making the payments.\n\nThis is not Chivayos first run-in with the law. In early 2000, he was convicted of fraud and was, during the Mugabe era, charged with corruption in connection with a failed Zimbabwe Power Company contract. Despite this, he has maintained close ties to the ruling elite and is often seen at state functions alongside President Mnangagwa.\n\nParallel to the Chivayo investigation, South African authorities have renewed efforts to extradite self-proclaimed prophet Shepherd Bushiri, who fled to Malawi in 2020 while facing charges of fraud, money laundering, and racketeering involving over R100 million.\n\nBushiri and his wife, Mary, were initially arrested in South Africa but fled while out on bail, citing threats to their lives. However, South African prosecutors allege that the couple used their church, the Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG), to operate elaborate miracle seed scams, defrauding investors under the guise of religious donations.\n\nEfforts to bring the Bushiris back to face trial have been stalled by legal and diplomatic hurdles, with Malawi citing procedural irregularities in the extradition process. Meanwhile, South African authorities argue that failure to extradite the couple undermines regional efforts to hold financial criminals accountableparticularly those who exploit religious platforms for personal gain.\n\nWith both cases now receiving renewed attention at the anti-corruption conference, law enforcement agencies across the continent are being urged to deepen collaboration in tracking, extraditing, and prosecuting politically connected criminals who exploit weak oversight systems across borders.\n\nSouth Africa, which loses billions annually to procurement corruption, hopes the Cape Town conference will help galvanize political will across Africa to curb illicit financial flows, strengthen accountability, and dismantle networks involved in state capture.\n\nAs evidence mounts and pressure intensifies, both Chivayo and Bushiri now stand as symbols of the continents broader struggle against impunity and corruption.\n\n",

The result sees the Nerazzurri return to the final, echoing their 2010 triumph when they also knocked out Barcelona en route to glory.\n\nWere overjoyed and Im proud of everyone, especially Marcus [Thuram], Dumfries said post-match.

Yes, to be honest, I was really tired, he admitted. Ive just come back from a long injury, jumping straight into games like this is tough. However, Im happy I managed it.\n\nYann Sommer earned Man of the Match honors for his heroics in goal, but it was the collective determination that saw Inter overturn a late deficit in one of the most memorable semi-finals in recent years.\n\nThe Nerazzurri now await the winner of the other semi-final between Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain. But Dumfries isnt concerned about the opponent.\n\nPSG or Arsenal? Both are great teams, well see, but the most important thing is we won this match, he said. This is a show, and Im really happy we made the final. Thirteen goals in two matches, its spectacular for the fans and football lovers.\n\nAs for celebrations? We definitely wont be going to bed early, Dumfries joked.\n\nWith momentum on their side and a chance to avenge their 2023 final loss to Manchester City, Inter Milan will look to finish the job and lift Europes most coveted trophy once again.\n\n",
