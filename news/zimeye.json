This statue, poised to adorn the State House, is less a symbol of Mnangagwas legacy than it is an artifact of whispered defiance, casting a shadow that intertwines history and intrigue.\n\nIt does not have the permanent black mark inflicted by Mnangagwas sister Diana after he tried to kill her.\n\nThe unmistakable resemblance to Chihurithe man once positioned to arrest Constantino Chiwenga during Zimbabwes fraught 2017 coupspeaks louder than the bronze silence it embodies. This artistic misstep or deliberate ambiguity carries an ominous weight. Mnangagwas subtle, veiled commentary becomes a poetic dagger, unearthing the treacherous layers of betrayal, loyalty, and ambition that pulse beneath Zimbabwes political theater.\n\nChihuris role in that historical chess game, where soldiers in disguise disarmed the polices Support Unit and shielded Chiwenga, now finds its echo in the statues silent gaze. The bronze lips seem to murmur the words that Mnangagwa hinted at recently: a need for order, for consequence, for the arrest of dreams too ambitious to stand unchecked.\n\nAnd yet, the facecrafted to immortalizeis a paradox, for it immortalizes not Mnangagwas visage but the specter of a man who once stood at the crux of betrayal. The artistry, or lack thereof, carries with it a coded language understood by those attuned to the nuances of Zimbabwes fraught corridors of power. It is as if the statue leans toward Chiwenga and whispers: Before you dream of power, remember who fell, who stood, and who remains.\n\nIt is a sculpture of shadow and tension, not merely of form. What it symbolizes may outlast the presidency it is meant to celebrate, casting a bronze reminder that history, though malleable in the hands of power, has a memory of its own.\n\n",

The unfolding events are not isolated but rather part of a broader agenda to dismantle any functional opposition-linked governance structures, ensuring that nothing outside ZANU PFs control operates effectively.\n\nZIMBABWE vs SOUTH AFRICA on managing local govt in an election losspic.twitter.com/GK60jdXr6e\n\nMabvuku Residents Evicted Amid Corruption Allegations\n\nThe latest victims, four residents of Stand 46 Marembo Street, including Mr. Mofolo Makasa and Mrs. Maggie Mazonde, have been forcibly removed from properties they have leased and paid for since 1992. Their eviction clears the way for new beneficiaries tied to a corrupt allocation scheme allegedly overseen by officials connected to ZANU PFs broader agenda.\n\nDespite holding valid lease agreements and maintaining up-to-date council accounts, these residents find themselves battling illegal land grabs. Evidence of unlawful construction activities and the destruction of council boundary pegs has surfaced, highlighting a well-orchestrated attempt to erode trust in Harares opposition-linked municipal governance.\n\nMnangagwas Strategy to Cripple MDC-CCC Governance\n\nAnalysts argue this is the most prolific example of Mnangagwas masterstroke to render any opposition-controlled council dysfunctional. The confusion and mismanagement seen in Harare City Council, driven by scandals and interference, align with a calculated directive from ZANU PF: Nothing outside ZANU PF control must work, and all MDC/CCC programs must die at Harvest House.\n\nThis systematic sabotage ensures that even opposition factions aligned with Mnangagwas government-assisted proxies, like the Sengezo Tshabangu faction, will ultimately be discarded after serving their purpose of dismantling Nelson Chamisas influence.\n\nMnangagwas program has already delivered its poetic justice: those former MDC/CCC councillors who betrayed Chamisa, thinking the Tshabangu faction would last until 2028, are now finding themselves politically irrelevant. Their trust in ZANU PFs temporary alliances has left them stranded as the ruling party consolidates total control.\n\nThe Role of Corruption in Mnangagwas Plan\n\nThe chaos in Mabvuku exemplifies the corrupt mechanisms employed to discredit and destroy opposition governance. The emergence of land barons like Jacob Jackson, boasting of strong council links, reflects the deliberate cultivation of scandals designed to tarnish the reputation of MDC/CCC-run councils.\n\nMr. Makasa and Mrs. Mazondes plight underscores the extent of this engineered dysfunction. Mr. Makasas valid payments were mysteriously rejected at Mabvuku council offices, only to be accepted at central offices, highlighting deliberate obfuscation. Meanwhile, illegal construction activities on their property continue unabated, supported by complicit municipal officials.\n\nResidents Call for Justice as Betrayed Councillors Face Irrelevance\n\nAs Harare residents endure the fallout of Mnangagwas broader strategy, betrayed councillors who aligned with Tshabangus government-backed faction are discovering their political careers are effectively over. The program that dismantled Chamisas influence has now turned on them, leaving them to face the consequences of their short-sighted allegiance.\n\nOne affected resident, Mrs. Mazonde, expressed her frustration: I have lived here for decades, raised my children here, and paid my bills religiously. Now, I am being evicted without justification. This is part of a wider scheme to destroy everything the opposition ever built.\n\nThe Death of Opposition Programs\n\nWith ZANU PF ensuring that no MDC or CCC program succeeds at any level of governance, Harares residents are bearing the brunt of a well-coordinated agenda. The directive to render opposition governance ineffective, regardless of the faction, is not just a political strategy but a deliberate attack on the very idea of opposition in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis latest scandal in Mabvuku is not merely a land dispute but a microcosm of Mnangagwas genius construct: destroy the opposition from within, discredit their programs, and leave the electorate in disarray. As Mnangagwa chews up his temporary allies and consolidates power, the question remainshow long can Harares residents endure this systematic destruction of their citys governance? ZimEye\n\n",

            "content": "By Tinashe Sambiri\n\nZimbabwes opposition leader, Advocate Nelson Chamisa, has launched a scathing critique of President Emmerson Mnangagwas government, describing the countrys current state as trabablas.\n\nChamisas comments follow a controversial decision by the government to rename the Mbudzi Interchange in Harare to the Trabablas Interchange. The name change has sparked widespread public debate, with many seeing it as symbolic of the countrys spiraling troubles.\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, Chamisa seized on the renaming as a metaphor for Zimbabwes broader woes, which he argues are driven by an incompetent and disorganized administration.\n\nITS ALL TRABABLAS We are living in Trabablas times. Its really a trabablas administration, running a trabablas economy, with trabablas policies and a trabablas currency! Especially after trabablas elections, Chamisa declared, highlighting what he perceives as the absurdity of the governments actions amid widespread economic and political crises.\n\nChamisas use of the term trabablas is a direct attack on the ruling regime, suggesting that Mnangagwas government is ineffective and chaotic.\n\nThe term has quickly resonated with many Zimbabweans, who are grappling with a collapsing economy, high inflation, unemployment, and a currency that has lost much of its value.\n\nThe decision to rename Mbudzi Interchange, a key junction in Harare, has been widely criticized, with critics arguing that it reflects the governments misplaced priorities. Instead of focusing on addressing pressing issues such as poverty, healthcare, and infrastructure, Mnangagwas administration has been accused of engaging in symbolic gestures that do little to alleviate the countrys problems.\n\nChamisa, who has consistently challenged Mnangagwas legitimacy since the controversial 2018 elections, argues that Zimbabwes political and economic systems are in disarray under the current government. We have a country where everything is falling apart: the economy is crumbling, businesses are closing, and ordinary Zimbabweans are struggling to survive, he said.\n\nBut instead of focusing on real solutions, the government is changing names and engaging in trivial distractions.\n\nHis remarks also refer to the recent presidential elections, which he and many international observers have criticized as neither free nor fair. Especially after trabablas elections, Chamisa added, alluding to the contested nature of the polls that many believe were marred by irregularities and voter suppression.\n\nIn this context, trabablas has become more than just a catchphrase; its a symbol of the frustration and disillusionment felt by many Zimbabweans.\n\nThe term was also used by Mnangagwas deputy, Constantino Chiwenga three years ago at Great Zimbabwe Ruins.\n\nChamisas critique of the government resonates with the growing public sentiment that Mnangagwas administration is not only failing to address critical issues but is also increasingly out of touch with the realities faced by the people.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues to grapple with a myriad of challenges, Chamisas pointed remarks underscore the discontent that many Zimbabweans feel about the direction in which the country is headed. Whether the ruling government will heed these criticisms or continue with its current approach remains to be seen.\n\n",
