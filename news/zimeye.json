            "url": "https://www.zimeye.net/2025/01/11/nick-mangwana-puts-on-military-attire-is-he-a-threatening-vp-chiwenga/",
            "content": "By Dorrothy Moyo |Zimbabwe government spokesperson Nick Mangwana has announced that he is taking a break, but his choice of attire in the announcement has sparked significant speculation. The government official was photographed wearing a traditional military-style outfit reminiscent of the attire worn by Zimbabwean guerrilla fighters during the Rhodesian Bush War and the farm invasions of the 2000s.\n\nThe announcement comes amid swirling rumors of internal strife within ZANU-PF, the ruling party.\n\nReports of growing tensions between factions loyal to President Emmerson Mnangagwa and those supporting his deputy, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, have dominated political discourse in recent weeks.\n\nSymbolism in Mangwanas Attire\n\nMangwanas outfitcommonly associated with Zimbabwes liberation struggleraises questions about its timing and intent. The visual parallels to military traditions may carry subtle undertones in a political climate marked by speculation of power struggles within the ZANU-PF hierarchy.\n\nObservers have pointed out the significance of Mangwana donning this attire during a period where political alliances within the party are reportedly being tested. Historically, military symbolism has played a central role in Zimbabwes political narrative, with clothing serving as a silent yet powerful message.\n\nHeightened Tensions: A Veiled Threat Against VP Chiwenga?\n\nThe political landscape is further complicated by recent remarks made by a ZANU-PF provincial chairperson who issued a bold statement targeting Vice President Constantino Chiwenga. The official declared that Chiwenga must drink crocodile milk before he dreams of taking over poweran apparent reference to Mnangagwas nickname, The Crocodile, and his perceived grip on authority.\n\nThis statement, combined with Mangwanas symbolic military attire, is being interpreted by political analysts as a possible warning to Chiwenga and his faction. The use of crocodile symbolism in Zimbabwean politics often reflects loyalty to Mnangagwa and serves as a metaphorical message to rivals attempting to challenge his position.\n\nAnalyst Richard Mahuni remarked:\n\nThis could be the clearest sign yet that Mnangagwas allies are drawing battle lines and sending a strong warning to Chiwenga. The crocodile imagery is not accidentalit is a reminder of who holds the ultimate power within ZANU-PF.\n\nMilitary Influence in Politics\n\nMangwanas announcement coincides with the reintroduction of the controversial National Youth Service program, commonly referred to as the Green Bombers. Images of uniformed youths undergoing training have resurfaced, evoking memories of the programs politicized history. The program has been criticized for its association with violence and intimidation tactics during elections.\n\nThe resurfacing of military-related imagerywhether in the form of Mangwanas attire, the Green Bombers, or veiled threats to Chiwengapaints a picture of a ruling party invoking its liberation war legacy as both a rallying point and a warning to dissenters.\n\nFactional Battle Lines\n\nSpeculation about Mnangagwa and Chiwengas relationship has intensified since their alliance during the 2017 coup that ousted Robert Mugabe. While Mnangagwa took the presidency, Chiwenga has been rumored to harbor ambitions for the top job. Recent events suggest a growing rift, with Chiwengas faction reportedly seeking to assert its influence ahead of the 2028 elections.\n\nThe symbolic messages conveyed by Mangwanas attire and the crocodile milk remark indicate a deepening of factional politics. Mangwanas announcement could be interpreted as aligning with Mnangagwas camp, sending a message of unity among his allies while signaling potential consequences for challengers.\n\nWhat Lies Beneath the Surface?\n\nThe interplay of military symbolism and political rhetoric within ZANU-PF suggests a calculated effort to consolidate power amid internal divisions. Whether these gestures are mere political theater or a prelude to a broader confrontation within the party remains to be seen.\n\nNick Mangwanas decision to pair his leave announcement with military-inspired attire, alongside veiled threats targeting Vice President Chiwenga, has amplified speculation about ZANU-PFs internal dynamics. As tensions between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga factions rise, these symbolic acts could reflect a power struggle that is quietly brewing but may soon erupt onto the national stage. Observers will be closely monitoring these developments as Zimbabwes political landscape continues to evolve.\n\n",

Tshabangus suspension was announced shortly after a High Court ruling barred him from making changes to the partys parliamentary leadership .\n\nTshabangus legal representative, Nqobani Sithole, claimed in an interview with CITE News, they had received no formal communication about the suspension.\n\nSithole argued that Ncube lacks the authority to make leadership decisions, stating, What I know is there is a legal opinion that we communicated with the party to the extent that there is no president in the meantime because Prof Ncubes term of office expired.\n\nSithole emphasized that Ncube is merely an ordinary party member, saying, Welshman was also included when we communicated. He is not the acting president but masquerading as one.\n\nSithole added that Tshabangu remains the secretary-general of the party and leader of the opposition in Parliament.\n\nSithole pointed out that Ncubes term as party president expired, and his attempt to suspend Tshabangu is invalid.\n\nSithole stated, The rotation never happened, and the five years for holding the partys congress have expired, and surely he cannot all by himself purport to continue in contravention of their own constitution.\n\nTshabangus team plans to appeal the High Court ruling at the Supreme Court. Sithole confirmed, We have been instructed to appeal the High Court ruling.\n\nThere are certain internal issues being attended to, and soon after that, we will be given the green light to proceed with our client.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nChinese authorities have confirmed a surge in cases of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), particularly among children. This increase is attributed to a seasonal spike, with the virus being most active during this time of year.\n\nWhile the rise in cases may be alarming, authorities and public health experts have reassured the public that HMPV is not similar to COVID-19. In fact, HMPV has been present for decades and was first identified in the Netherlands in 2001, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) .\n\nHMPV typically causes mild upper respiratory tract infections, characterized by symptoms such as coughing, fever, and nasal congestion. For most people, the virus is practically indistinguishable from the flu. However, in very young children and individuals with weakened immune systems, HMPV can lead to more severe illness.\n\nThe virus spreads through airborne transmission, direct contact with infected individuals, or by touching contaminated surfaces. As with any respiratory virus, taking precautions such as frequent handwashing, avoiding close contact with those who are sick, and maintaining good hygiene practices can help reduce the risk of transmission .\n\n",
