            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nChief Chilonga of Chiredzi has called on the government to provide engine-powered boats to assist villagers in crossing the increasingly perilous Runde River, as annual drowning incidents continue to rise due to the flooding of Chilonga Bridge during the rainy season.\n\nThe chief, born John Beni, made the heartfelt plea during a community sensitization meeting held on Tuesday at the Chiredzi Rural District Council (RDC) boardroom. He highlighted the severe risks posed by the flooded bridge, which serves as a critical link between Chiredzi South and Chiredzi Town.\n\nEvery rainy season, Chilonga Bridge becomes impassable, and many lives are lost as people attempt to cross the river, often using makeshift boats, said Chief Chilonga.\n\nIt would be much safer if we had engine-powered boats to assist people in crossing. This could prevent more tragic drownings and save lives.\n\nThe chiefs remarks were echoed by local leaders, including Chiredzi Central MP Ropafadzo Makumire, Chiredzi East MP Siyaki Mundungehama, Chiredzi West MP Darlington Chiwa, and Chiredzi South MP Joel Sithole.\n\nAlso present were Chiredzi RDC Chairman Aspect Mashingaidze, CEO Ailes Baloyi, and several other councilors and stakeholders.\n\nThe rising number of drownings has become a major concern for the community. Many villagers are forced to risk their lives crossing the swollen river when the bridge is flooded, as they have no other way to reach the town or access essential services.\n\nIn response to the concerns raised, Chief Chilonga urged that the construction of a more reliable crossing point, such as a new bridge, be prioritized in the upcoming government infrastructure plans. The construction of Chilonga Bridge is already part of the Chiredzi RDCs draft master plan, but Chief Chilonga believes that immediate relief in the form of boats could help alleviate the ongoing danger faced by local residents.\n\nWe cannot afford to wait for a new bridge to be built before addressing the lives at risk, said Chilonga.\n\nThe government must act now and provide the resources to ensure that our people can cross the river safely.\n\nThe issue of flooding and the lack of safe transportation options across the Runde River is expected to be a major point of discussion at future community meetings, as locals and officials seek to find lasting solutions to the growing problem.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nRwandas President Paul Kagame has accused South Africas President Cyril Ramaphosa of dishonesty regarding their conversations about the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\nKagame claims that Ramaphosas public statements about their discussions have been distorted and filled with lies.\n\nI held two conversations this week with President Ramaphosa on the situation in Eastern DRC, including earlier today.\n\nWhat has been said about these conversations in the media by South African officials and President Ramaphosa himself contains a lot of distortion, deliberate attacks, and even lies, Kagame stated.\n\nKagame clarified several points, including that the Rwanda Defence Force is a professional army, not a militia. The Rwanda Defence Force is an army, not a militia, he emphasized.\n\nHe also criticized the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC), stating that it is not a peacekeeping force, but rather a belligerent force authorized to engage in combat operations. SAMIDRC is not a peacekeeping force, and it has no place in this situation. It was authorized by SADC as a belligerent force engaging in offensive combat operations to help the DRC Government fight against its own people, working alongside genocidal armed groups like FDLR which target Rwanda, while also threatening to take the war to Rwanda itself.\n\nKagame also denied that Ramaphosa had given him any warnings, saying, President Ramaphosa has never given a warning of any kind, unless it was delivered in his local language which I do not understand.\n\nFurthermore, Kagame revealed that Ramaphosa confirmed to him that the M23 rebels did not kill the South African soldiers, but rather the FARDC (Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo). President Ramaphosa confirmed to me that M23 did not kill the soldiers from South Africa, FARDC did, Kagame said.\n\nKagame emphasized that South Africa is not in a position to be a peacemaker or mediator in the conflict, stating, If South Africa wants to contribute to peaceful solutions, that is well and good, but South Africa is in no position to take on the role of a peacemaker or mediator. And if South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day.\n\n",
