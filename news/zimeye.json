            "content": "Overloading buses to the point where passengers are standing is becoming an increasing safety hazard. While it may be a common practice, this situation poses serious risks to passengers and needs to be addressed by authorities.\n\nOne of the main dangers of overcrowded buses is the excessive weight that is placed on the vehicle.\n\nWhen a bus is overloaded, it becomes harder for the driver to maintain control, especially when navigating sharp turns or sudden stops. In the event the driver is forced to apply the emergency brake, passengers who are standing are at risk of falling and sustaining injuries due to the lack of support.\n\nMoreover, standing passengers are more vulnerable to accidents in the event of sudden maneuvers.\n\nThey lack the security of a seat belt or a steady handrail, making them more likely to be thrown off balance and potentially hurt in an accident. The possibility of injury only increases when buses are traveling at high speeds or during congested traffic conditions.\n\nThe safety of passengers should always be a priority, and overloading buses compromises this fundamental principle. Passengers deserve a safe and secure journey, and it is crucial for bus operators and regulatory authorities to enforce strict guidelines on vehicle capacity to prevent overloading.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, authorities should consider increasing inspections of public transportation systems and impose fines for overloading violations. Moreover, bus companies must adhere to regulated passenger limits and ensure that all safety protocols are followed to protect the well-being of those traveling.\n\nIn conclusion, the practice of overloading buses is not only illegal but extremely dangerous. It is essential for both passengers and authorities to recognize the risks involved and work together to prioritize safety in public transport.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nMasvingo  For the past few months, residents leaders in Masvingo have been the target of escalating threats after exposing the illegal gold mining activities around the citys water reservoirs at Tagert Kopje hills. The situation has grown increasingly tense as powerful politicians, allegedly involved in the illegal mining, have reportedly targeted the leaders of the Masvingo United Residents and Rate Payers Alliance (MURRA) in a bid to silence their efforts.\n\nMURRA Director, Anoziva Muguti, recently revealed that he has been receiving anonymous threats from illegal gold panners who warned of harm to him and his staff. This follows MURRAs legal battle against the illegal mining operations, which has included reviving a High Court case seeking an interdict to stop the mining activities threatening both the citys water supply and the safety of its residents.\n\nWe will not be intimidated. We will continue to fight for justice and accountability, no matter the cost, Muguti stated firmly.\n\nMugutis resolve comes as a response to the ongoing illegal mining activities, which he insists pose a severe risk to the water tanks situated at Tagert Kopje hills. The tanks store over a million cubic liters of water for the city, and the illegal miners are operating dangerously close to these vital resources.\n\nWe will not back down. The people of Masvingo deserve nothing less than clean water and a safe environment, Muguti asserted.\n\nResidents have raised alarms about the illegal minings environmental impact. There are growing concerns that the hazardous chemicals used, such as cyanide, could leak into the water supply, jeopardizing public health. Additionally, fears have emerged that the mining activity beneath the tanks could lead to a catastrophic collapse of the reservoirs, threatening the lives of residents in nearby suburbs, including Majange, Hillside, and Tagert Kopje.\n\nDespite the threats against him, Muguti remains determined to continue MURRAs fight to stop the illegal mining. He stressed that they are not alone in their efforts.\n\nWe are not alone in this fight. There are countless others who have suffered at the hands of these illegal mining operations. Together, we demand justice and accountability, Muguti emphasized.\n\nResidents have also reported that the blasting of rocks in the area has caused significant cracks in their homes, heightening fears that the structures could eventually collapse as well.\n\nMURRA has yet to report the threats to the police, as they are still investigating the individuals behind the intimidation. However, Muguti revealed that they have gathered the names of several influential politicians and their families involved in the illegal mining activities. These names, however, will not be disclosed until confirmed through legal proceedings.\n\nWe are taking our time to ensure the right people are held accountable. We will reveal names only once the courts have positively identified them, Muguti concluded.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwas announcement of the Presidential Solar Programme is being widely viewed as a calculated move to bolster Zanu PFs political base in rural areas, with critics arguing that the initiative is less about empowering villagers and more about reinforcing political loyalty ahead of upcoming elections.\n\nThe programme, which promises to provide solar power to 200,000 households across the countrys eight rural provinces, was unveiled by Information Minister Dr. Jenfan Muswere during a post-cabinet briefing this Tuesday.\n\nFollowing the approval of the Implementation Plan for the Presidential Solarisation Programme in December 2024, significant milestones have been made towards the provision of solar power to 200,000 households, Dr. Muswere said.\n\nHowever, the timing and execution of this programme have raised concerns about its real intent. Skeptics believe it is a deliberate attempt by Mnangagwa to ingratiate himself with rural voters, especially those in areas where Zanu PFs support has been under pressure.\n\nThe solar initiative is being touted as a solution to power shortages, but many see it as a tool for political grandstanding.\n\nThe guidelines for the programme have been established, with stakeholder mapping and identification of beneficiaries already completed, Dr. Muswere explained, pointing to the completion of community mobilization efforts across the rural provinces. But critics argue that the programmes implementation could be skewed, with those loyal to the ruling party likely to be the first to benefit.\n\nVillagers have already begun expressing doubts about the true motives behind the programme. Many suspect that this solar gift will be used as a form of political patronage, rewarding those who show unwavering support for Mnangagwa and his Zanu PF government.\n\nThe installation of the solar kits will reportedly be carried out by Youth Service graduates, with assistance from experts at the Harare Institute of Technology and the Rural Electrification Agency. But the question remains: will the solar power truly reach all households, or will it serve as a tool to further entrench political loyalty?\n\nWith Zanu PFs stronghold traditionally rooted in rural areas, Mnangagwas government may be hoping this gesture will solidify that base as elections approach. Its a pattern seen before: grand gestures aimed at securing votes in exchange for political allegiance.\n\nIn a country where the rural electorate is a key determinant in election outcomes, Mnangagwas solar programme risks being perceived not as an act of goodwill, but as a deliberate attempt to hoodwink villagers and consolidate his partys power in the most vulnerable regions.\n\nThis move, while touted as a step towards rural development, could also be seen as a calculated gimmickdesigned to distract from the countrys ongoing economic hardships while reinforcing Zanu PFs control over Zimbabwes rural population.\n\n",
