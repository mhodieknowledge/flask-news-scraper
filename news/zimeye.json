            "content": "By A Correspondent | ZimEye | London, 7 April 2025  In a dramatic escalation of Zimbabwes internal political strife, a war veterans group has alleged that Major Sean Mnangagwa, son of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, has been appointed the de facto President of Zimbabwe, bypassing constitutional protocol and sidelining the incumbent Vice President, Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe accusation comes from a newly formed group calling itself the Defenders of Vice President Chiwenga and the Constitution of Zimbabwe  England Branch, led by self-described war veteran Cde Jekanyika. In a press release issued on 6 April in Luton, England, the group claims that Sean Mnangagwas rise is part of a broader parallel state orchestrated by First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa and powerful business magnate Kudakwashe Tagwirei.\n\nAccording to the document, Sean Mnangagwa is now effectively controlling the affairs of the state through covert military and intelligence appointments, despite having no constitutional authority. The Zimbabwe National Army must designate Major Sean Mnangagwa a terrorist because he has a plan to attack critical infrastructures in order to put blame on a group of war veterans who are fighting against corruption, the groups statement reads.\n\nThe allegations come amid growing discontent within ZANU-PFs military-aligned factions, many of whom have grown increasingly vocal about what they describe as endemic corruption, economic collapse, and abuse of state power by the Mnangagwa family. The press release also alleges that President Mnangagwa, said to be in deteriorating health, is being manipulated by those close to him, including his wife and son.\n\nNotably, the veterans group calls for Vice President Chiwenga to assume leadership after Mnangagwas term ends in 2028 and contests the upcoming elections. They also call for Major Sean Mnangagwa to be stripped of any military authority, labelling him a terrorist.\n\nThe statement further highlights a litany of corruption scandals allegedly involving the Presidents family, including looting from national schemes such as the Command Agriculture programme, the Presidential goat scheme, and the controversial Gwanda solar project. It also condemns the arrests of over 100 anti-corruption protesters and the detention without trial of journalist Blessed Mhlanga.\n\nThis development marks one of the most significant intra-party challenges to Mnangagwas leadership since he seized power in 2017 through a military-assisted transition that sidelined Robert Mugabe.\n\nThere has been no official response from the Zimbabwean government or ZANU-PF at the time of publication.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nGlen View South was shaken by a wave of political violence on the night of April 5, 2025, when supporters of independent candidate Tonderai Chakaredza were targeted in a brutal attack.\n\nThe homes and vehicles of prominent opposition members, including Ward 23 Councillor Gaudencia Marera and Shadreck Rateiwa, were bombed by unknown assailants, believed to be politically motivated.\n\nThe attack occurs just days before the upcoming by-election on April 12, 2025, following the sudden passing of the Honorable Glandmore Hakata, which has created a political vacuum in the area and heightened tensions.\n\nCouncillor Gaudencia Marera, who resides at House Number 337 in Glen View 1 Extension, was left devastated after discovering that both his vehiclesa Nissan X-Trail (AGF6795) and a Honda Fit (AFL5622)were destroyed in the attack. Similarly, his fellow opposition ally, Shadreck Rateiwa, who lives at 737 Dare Rechimurenga in Glen View 4 Extension, found his home severely damaged by the bombing.\n\nThe bombings caused extensive damage, shattering windows, damaging walls, and compromising the roofs of both properties. Councillor Marera spoke to Change Radio, visibly shaken, saying, I am devastated by the bombing of my house and the destruction of my two cars. Politics should not resemble a life-and-death battle; rather, it is a contest aimed at representing the needs of our citizens. I vehemently condemn this violence and urge law enforcement to apprehend those responsible.\n\nRateiwa, equally distressed, shared his outrage over the damage to his home and the loss of valuables. My house was bombed, and countless valuables were lost. The damage amounts to thousands of U.S. dollars, he said. I am profoundly disappointed by the actions of these political thugs.\n\nBoth Marera and Rateiwa are vocal supporters of independent candidate Tonderai Chakaredza, who is vying to represent Glen View South in the upcoming by-election. This violent episode has raised serious concerns about potential voter intimidation tactics being used by opposing political factions.\n\nHonorable Eric Murai, the campaign leader for Chakaredza, condemned the violence and linked it directly to efforts to suppress support for his candidate. Before the bombing, Councillor Marera and Rateiwa were actively campaigning for Chakaredza. This act of violence is clearly an attempt to intimidate our supporters and instill fear, aiming to suppress their willingness to vote for him, Murai said.\n\nAccording to Murai, police are already on the scene and are investigating the incident.\n\nThe political landscape in Glen View South is further complicated by the presence of several other candidates, including independent candidates Tungamirai Madzokere and George Makwangwaidze, along with Perpetua Mukanda of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), and Tsitsi Tranquility Towomhera, representing Zanu PF.\n\nWith the by-election fast approaching, the community is left grappling with the consequences of the violent attacks. As residents brace for the upcoming vote, the hope for justice remains strong, but the fear of more violence looms, threatening to undermine the integrity of the democratic process.\n\n",

Mhaka fled UK soon after conviction for high profile cheque fraud in 2008, and was not as lucky as Hopewell Chinono who left UK 7 yesrs earlier when Britains fingerprinting system was still to be integrated post 911 upgrade. As a result, Chinonos name change remains out of the cache, also because he was not convicted.However, his latest notorious operations were last year when he encouraged people to compromise airport security since 29 April 2024. One of the colleagues who Chinono encouragedis one Jennifer Banyure, who was encouraged by Chinono, to sabotage Gatwick Airports database on 26 Aug 2024.\n\nBanyure engaged a hacker on Chinonos encouragement to delete her other name she used to enter UK and then changed in the same year Chinono (previously surnamed Mukusha) changed his, 2001.\n\nBanyure was captured on camera inside Nottinghams St James Hotel with a hacker performing the hacking operation.\n\nUnder Chinonos encouragements and instructions, Banyure moved over to try and rob a senior engineer of his multi million pound property. She did this using the fake identity she shifted to in the same year Hopewell Chinono changed his.\n\nFollowing an investigation by ZimEye however, a Derby County Court judge Justice Pittman, has ruled a clean break resolution that blocks Banyure from her manoeuvres. This was after an identity fraud case was raised at court 2 weeks after the hacking attempt. The hacker was an undercover investigative journalist. WATCH THE FULL DOCUMENTARY HERE\n\n",
