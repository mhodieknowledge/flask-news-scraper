            "content": "Charlton Hwendes apparent position as a champion of the opposition belies a more sinister reality. In truth, he is an entrenched collaborator of Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwas regime, complicit in the plundering of Zimbabwes resources. The clandestine transportation of looted minerals across the Forbes border into Mozambique, facilitated by Hwendes trucks, constitutes a damning indictment of his culpability.\n\nThis duplicity is further underscored by Hwendes sanctimonious denounciations of the late Ian Smith, even as his ally, Mnangagwa, protects the interests of white farmers in the Midlands, thereby perpetuating the historical injustices inflicted upon Black Zimbabweans. Mnangagwas own tenure has been marred by horrifying corruption, including the expropriation of Precabe Farm from the CIO during his ministerial tenure, and the displacement of indigenous Zimbabweans in Chiredzi and Binga to benefit foreign white interests.\n\nHwendes involvement in the Gold Mafia, characterised by the sneaky smuggling of gold to Dubai and linked money laundering, serves as a stark illustration of his entrenched complicity in Zimbabwes corrupt nexus. The oppositions reliance on individuals of Hwendes ilk, who prioritise personal aggrandisement over the welfare of Zimbabweans, ensures that meaningful change will remain an ephemeral chimera.\n\nThe logical question persists: why does Hwende abstain from accountability for Mnangagwas transgressions? The response is straight forward: Hwende is tied under an obligation to the same corrupt infrastructure that sustains Mnangagwas regime. His links in gold mafia, his trucks contracted to ferry out our looted minerals to the Mozambican ports,surely Hwende sees ED as his Saviour the one that butters his bread at the expense of the masses of Zimbabweans.\n\nUltimately, Zimbabwes prospects for meaningful transformation are determined upon a paradigmatic shift in the oppositions leadership. Until Zimbabweans demand authentic, principled leadership, the nation will continue to languish under the weight of corruption and exploitation. Hwende and his cohorts must be held accountable for their actions, and a new era of transparency and accountability must be ushered in. Hwende you are the last sellout of our generation to even dare criticise those calling out Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa as  worst than Ian Douglas Smith. ED might be your Boss yet to Zimbabweans he is a villain who deserve to be hanged by the pee balls.#edmustgo #sayno2to2030#cdesistermwenewazvo#kerinamujati\n\n",

The ghostcharecterslatest messages include:\n\nThe posts mix half-truths with blatant propaganda to fracture opposition movements and bolsterFRELIMOsgrip on power.\n\nGiven the similarities between Unay Cambuma and Baba Jukwa, questions arise about potential collaboration between Zanu PF and FRELIMO.\n\nBoth parties share a history of leveraging propaganda and suppressing dissent to maintain power, and theexportation of ZanuPFsdisinformation model could be a strategic move to fortifyFRELIMOsregime.\n\nMozambiquespolitical analysts warn that such tactics could further destabilise the country, undermining democratic processes and entrenching authoritarianism.\n\nAs Mozambique faces mounting political tension,the influence of digital propaganda campaigns like Unay Cambuma cannot be underestimated.\n\nThe international community and local activists must remain vigilant, countering disinformation and advocating for electoral transparency to uphold democracy in the region.\n\n",

Ronald is the sole and rightful owner of Getaway, including every lyrical and creative element of the song. The song was officially launched on 31 December 2016 during the Heartfelt International Ministries March overnight event, a performance that remains available on YouTube.\n\nIn 2020, Ronald discovered Getaway online, falsely attributed to an artist named Jerdan Paradise. Despite approaching him to address the matter, Jerdan denied Ronalds ownership and insisted the song was his.\n\nThis year, without Ronalds consent, Jerdan Paradise re-recorded Getaway with Denzel and Madam Boss. On 14 December 2024, upon seeing the song online again, Ronald reached out to Jerdan, who once more claimed ownership, even posting on Facebook that the song was his. The post was later edited to remove the word written after public backlash, but the initial claim remains unacceptable.\n\nFollowing public outcry, the YouTube description of the song was updated to acknowledge Ronald Ngulube as the writer. However, no agreement, past or present, was ever made for the song to be recorded, distributed, or altered by Jerdan Paradise or any other party.\n\nThis behavior is a blatant violation of copyright laws and a disregard for ethical standards in the creative industry. Ronald Ngulubes management is deeply disappointed by such conduct and is exploring all legal options to address this infringement and protect Ronalds intellectual property.\n\nWe also formally demand the immediate removal of Getaway from all platforms where it has been unlawfully published or distributed.\n\nWe urge all stakeholders in the music and arts industry to respect copyright laws and uphold the values of integrity and creativity. Such actions not only undermine artists hard work but also erode trust within the artistic community.\n\nRonald Ngulube Management\n\n",

            "content": "ByLifestyle Reporter-President Emmerson Mnangagwas eating habits have ignited heated debate following a candid revelation by First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa during an interview on the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC).\n\nThe First Lady disclosed that Mnangagwa insists on having meat with every meal and is fond of dried kapenta fish (matemba) paired with milk.\n\nThis disclosure comes as a surprise to many, considering Mnangagwas 2022 public declaration encouraging Zimbabweans to embrace plant-based diets for health reasons.\n\nAt the time, he dubbed meat consumption unhealthy and lauded vegetables and potatoes as a healthier alternative.\n\nGovernment spokesperson Nick Mangwana amplified the First Ladys comments on X (formerly Twitter), writing, When the @ZimFirstLady was asked about the Presidents favorite food, she said there must be some meat somewhere among the dishes, but what he likes most are matemba nemukaka. On the streets, we call that keeping it real.\n\nThe revelation has drawn mixed reactions:\n\nOne Louis Muronda: Even Mugabe ainzi baba venyu havana kana mari ava vanoda simple food.Samuel Huni, recalled: Vamwe vachiti Zondo.Tich Gotwe Gwindi remembered: Paye makamboti zondo nemasese makamboti mirivo nemapotato.Vadye Mbutu asked: Mapotatoes akasiya hre kkk?.\n\nThis contrast between Mnangagwas personal preferences and his earlier health advice has reignited public discourse about the authenticity of his lifestyle recommendations.\n\nWhile the First Ladys remarks offer a relatable glimpse into the Presidents affinity for traditional Zimbabwean cuisine, they also expose inconsistencies in his public messaging.\n\nAdding to the intrigue is Mnangagwas reputation for indulgence, which includes occasional allegations of whisky-fueled antics.\n\nThese contradictions between his dietary habits, his past public health narrative, and perceptions of excessive behaviour raise questions about the Presidents alignment with the values he projects.\n\n",
