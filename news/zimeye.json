            "content": "By Engineer Jacob Kudzayi Mutisi-I am a black Zimbabwean, born and bred in this land of striking beauty. But in my lived experience, I have observed something that continues to trouble me. Among my circle of friends, it is often my white Zimbabwean companions who display more visible and vocal patriotism than many of my black peers and relatives. It is an uncomfortable truthbut one that deserves honest reflection.\n\nMany of my black relatives and friends, regardless of their age or status, seem to be waiting for the next visa, the next scholarship, or the next job offer abroad. Conversations over lunch or at family gatherings frequently circle back to getting out. The phrasendirikuda kuenda kuUK(I want to go to the UK) has become as common as greetings. For many, the dream is not to contribute to the rebuilding of Zimbabwe, but to escape it.\n\nContrast this with my white Zimbabwean friendsmost of whom are descendants of settlers who arrived generations agowho, despite our complex history, now know no other home. They own farms, run businesses, sponsor local sports teams, and continue to invest in their communities. They stay through currency crashes, droughts, land invasions, and daily power cuts. Some of themwhocouldleavechoose not to. Not because they are blind to the countrys problems, but because they believe Zimbabwe is worth fighting for.\n\nThis irony stings. Historically, the black population fought and won independence to reclaim the land, dignity, and identity of Zimbabwe. One would expect that this hard-won freedom would inspire a deeper sense of ownership and loyalty to our homeland. But today, the children and grandchildren of the liberators are among the most disillusionedeager to trade the dust of Zimbabwe for the asphalt of London, New York, or Perth.\n\nWe cannot ignore the reasons behind this. Decades of economic instability, corruption, poor governance, and a politicised education system have drained hope from an entire generation. For many black Zimbabweans, patriotism feels like a luxury they cannot afford when schools are underfunded, hospitals under-equipped, and job prospects grim. By contrast, many white Zimbabweanshaving historically benefited from economic advantagesmay find it easier to be patriotic. They often have the means to ride out the storms.\n\nStill, patriotism should not be defined by who suffers least or who stays longest. It should be measured by who contributes meaningfully. Patriotism is not about blind loyalty to a government, but an unwavering belief in the potential of our people and land.\n\nAs a black Zimbabwean, I do not want patriotism to be something I outsource to others. I want to see more black Zimbabweans reclaiming a sense of national pridenot through slogans, but through action. Our country needs us. If we all run away, who will fix what is broken?\n\nPerhaps the greatest act of patriotism is not staying when it is easy, but committing to return and rebuildespecially when its hard.\n\nWe can ride this difficult wave together.\n\n-Engineer Jacob Kudzayi Mutisi\n\n",

Its the countrys sixth attempt since 2009 to replace the dollar as the southern African nations main transacting currency, but is yet to succeed.\n\nSeveral measures will need to be adopted to boost ZiG usage, including deepening the foreign-exchange market to ensure full price discovery, said Wojciech Maliszewski, the Washington-based lenders mission chief, who is in Zimbabwe to review its request for a new SMP. The nations last program ended abruptly in 2019 after the central bank printed money that fueled the collapse of the local currency.\n\nRight now we see good stability in the official market and we also see a convergence between the parallel and official rate, he told reporters Monday after meeting Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in the capital, Harare. Ideally, we would like to see an elimination of this gap, we would like to see one exchange rate.\n\n-Bloomberg\n\n",

Its about laundering public moneyunder the cover ofa nationalprogramme, said a senior opposition official who declined to be named. The lack of transparency in how these deals are structured shows that this is another self-enrichment scheme for the First Family and their associates.\n\nMnangagwa has long been accused of turning Zimbabwe into a kleptocracy where state resources are captured by a small elite closely tied to him.\n\nHis sons have been linked to shady gold deals, fuel imports, and large-scale tender scandals involving infrastructure, agriculture, and energy.\n\nIn most cases, oversight mechanisms are bypassed and the proceeds are allegedly stashed in offshore accounts or used to finance luxury lifestyles.\n\nThe presidents relationship with controversial businessman Wicknell Chivayo has already drawn widespread criticism, with billionslost to undelivered energy projects.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dr. Trywell Muzerengi\n\nArtificial insemination (AI) is revolutionising livestock production in Zimbabwe and around the world, allowing farmers to improve the quality of their herds without the need for a live bull.\n\nAt its core, AI involves introducing semencollected from genetically superior bullsinto a female animals reproductive tract to achieve conception. This technique offers a wide range of benefits that traditional breeding methods cannot match.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of AI is the ability to access semen from top-tier bulls sourced globally. This allows farmers to enhance the genetic pool of their herds, boosting productivity, resilience, and overall animal quality.\n\nAnother benefit is controlled breeding. Through a process called synchronisation, female animals can be induced to go into heat at the same time. As a result, they will conceive and calve around the same period, allowing for better planning, streamlined management, and more predictable production cycles.\n\nAI also opens the door to sexed semena scientific breakthrough that enables farmers to choose the gender of the offspring. This is particularly useful for dairy farmers who often prefer female calves for milk production.\n\nAdditionally, AI significantly reduces the risk of spreading sexually transmitted diseases that can be passed through natural mating. By eliminating the need to transport bulls between farms, AI also cuts down on logistics costs and reduces the risk of animal stress and injuries.\n\nIn short, artificial insemination is safer, more efficient, and far more strategic than traditional methods of breeding. It is a modern solution that puts the farmer in controlboosting productivity, protecting animal health, and helping build a stronger and more sustainable livestock industry in Zimbabwe.\n\nemail:[emailprotected]\n\n",
