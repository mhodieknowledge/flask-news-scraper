            "content": "By Municipal Correspondent  Vice President Constantino Chiwenga has been directly implicated in the forced eviction of over 300 families in St Martins, Harare, in what residents describe as one of the citys most blatant cases of land double-dipping and administrative fraud.\n\nThe affected properties lie along Airport Road, opposite One Commando Barracks, near the Catholic University of Zimbabwe. The residents allege the City of Harare resold the same land to the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops Conference (ZCBC) despite their lawful ownership.\n\nDavid Jenje, chairperson of the St Martins Pay Scheme, said: We hold documented rights and interests in this land, supported by official records from the City of Harare  including the District Officer and Housing Directors offices. We have offer letters, sale agreements, and receipts confirming payment of the full land value.\n\nResidents began developing the land in 2019, with infrastructure projects including roads, water, and sewerage underway. Building materials were even delivered to the site and stored at the Councils Remembrance Offices. Some of that material later went missing, and the city acknowledged responsibility, Jenje added.\n\nThe dispute escalated after a letter from the Ministry of Local Government, signed by Secretary Dr. J. Basera, cited Vice President Chiwengas direct involvement. The letter ordered the City of Harare to immediately facilitate freeing up of all encumbrances on the property and to urgently transfer same to Government for a medical hub project. It adds: Government will compensate City of Harare with 36 hectares of land at Kimcote Farm Given the urgency of this matter, may you expedite the transfer so that the project may take off.\n\nOne resident told ZimEye: City Council sold the land to us first, but years later they offered the same land to the Catholic University. Now we are being told that Vice President Chiwenga, who is Catholic, is pushing for the land to be transferred to the university. They even say we should move to a farm in Beatrice. This land is private property  government has no right to repossess it.\n\nThe residents describe the evictions as illegal and unconstitutional. We are 300 legitimate beneficiaries. We bought this land lawfully in 2018. We paid everything required by City Council. Now we are being threatened with eviction simply because of political influence. If this goes through, no private property in Zimbabwe is safe, the resident added.\n\nMayor Jacob Mafume, whose office oversees municipal operations, has been drawn into the controversy, though his office declined comment. Civic groups say the scandal highlights corruption, incompetence, and lack of accountability within the citys land administration system.\n\nAs legal action is being prepared, the residents are appealing to the public to intervene. We just want justice and public awareness, the resident concluded. Anyone can lose their land if someone powerful wants it. This is abuse of power at the highest level, and it must be exposed.\n\n",

            "content": "Harare  Wednesday, 22 October 2025\n\nBy A Correspondent | A shocking video circulating online has captured a Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) traffic officer in full uniform grappling for control of a moving vehicles steering wheel  a reckless act that has drawn widespread outrage and renewed calls for urgent reform of traffic policing methods in the country.\n\nThe footage, recorded by passengers, shows a uniformed police officer seated beside a mshikashika (pirate taxi) driver, forcibly holding the steering wheel as the car continues to move through a crowded street. The visibly tense driver, stripped to his vest, can be seen struggling to maintain balance while the officer  apparently attempting to commandeer or stop the vehicle  keeps his grip firm on the wheel.\n\n ZRP TRAFFIC COP CAUGHT GRAPPLING FOR STEERING WHEEL IN MOVING MSHIKASHAIKA Harare  Wed, 22 Oct 2025A shocking video has emerged showing a Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) traffic officer grabbing the steering wheel of a moving mshikashika in a crowded street  almostpic.twitter.com/W3GJ2L97fF\n\nDozens of onlookers can be seen outside, screaming in confusion as the dangerous scuffle unfolds.\n\n A Disaster Waiting to Happen\n\nTransport safety analysts warn that this kind of conduct could easily result in catastrophic loss of life.\n\nThis is not just misconduct  its suicidal behaviour on a public road, said a former traffic instructor who viewed the footage. No officer should ever attempt to seize a moving vehicles controls. Standard police procedure demands that the vehicle be safely stopped first.\n\n Pattern of High-Risk Confrontations\n\nThis is not the first time ZRP officers have been filmed engaging in dangerous confrontations with public transport operators. In recent years, similar incidents  from officers jumping onto moving vehicles to smashing windscreens  have sparked public outcry and calls for accountability.\n\nCritics argue that such confrontations stem from poor enforcement strategy, lack of training, and a toxic bribe culture between some rogue officers and commuter operators.\n\n Public Reaction\n\nThe video has gone viral across social media platforms, with citizens condemning the conduct and calling for disciplinary action.\n\nWe could have been reporting a fatal accident today. This madness must stop, wrote one user.\n\nPolice should be enforcing safety, not creating danger, said another.\n\n Calls for Action\n\nTraffic safety advocates are urging ZRP Command to:\n\nThe Zimbabwe Traffic Safety Council has also been urged to investigate and issue new operational guidelines to prevent such near-fatal confrontations.\n\n Editorial Comment\n\nThis incident epitomises a wider collapse of discipline and safety ethics on Zimbabwes roads. When a law enforcement officer becomes part of the danger, the rule of law itself is under threat. A single wrong move in that car could have ended multiple lives  including the officers own.\n\nAuthorities must act decisively, not after tragedy strikes, but before the next viral video becomes a national obituary.\n\n",

Failure to comply will result in the City of Harare exercising its statutory powers to enforce compliance, Nyabezi wrote.\n\nThe directive has triggered outrage among residents, who argue that they werelegally allocated the stands by the City Council in 2019. Through their chairperson,David Jenje, of the St Martins Pay Scheme, the residents accused the city of betrayal and corruption.\n\nWe hold documented rights and interests in this land, supported by official records from the City of Harare  including the District Officer and Housing Directors offices. We have offer letters, sale agreements, and receipts confirming payment of the full land value, Jenje said.\n\nHe added that many residents had already begun constructing homes, with several families now living on the land. Roads, sewerage, and water infrastructure projects were already underway  all with the citys knowledge and approval.\n\nBuilding materials were even delivered to the site and stored at the Councils Remembrance Offices. Some of that material later went missing, and the city acknowledged responsibility, Jenje added.\n\nDocuments seen byZimEyereveal that each stand was sold forUS$12,000, and inApril 2023, theDirector of Housing and Community Services, MrSithole, confirmed in writing that some residents building materials had gone missing. He promised that Council would replace the materials once authorised.\n\nThis department has prepared a report seeking authority to replace the missing materials once Council accedes to the request, Sithole said in correspondence with residents.\n\nDespite this assurance, no action was taken. For nearly four years, communication between the residents and the City Council stalled  until last week, when the sudden eviction order was issued.\n\nIts been four years since this project began. We paid the full land value and all development fees, but now we are being told to vacate. This is daylight robbery by the same Council that sold us the land, one furious homeowner said.\n\nThe development has reignited public concern overcorruption and governance failuresat Town House, where senior officials have previously been accused of land scams and double allocations.\n\nAs the citys chief administrator,Mayor Jacob Mafume who is responsible for overseeing municipal operations  is under increasing pressure to explain how the Council sold one piece of land to two separate parties. Efforts to obtain comment from Mafume or his spokesperson,Stanley Gama, were unsuccessful at the time of publication.\n\nResidents and civic groups say the scandal highlights the depth ofcorruption, incompetence, and lack of accountabilitywithin the citys land administration system  and has once again eroded public trust in the local authority.\n\nThis is adeveloping story.\n\n",

            "content": "INTERVIEWER: Can you explain how this land dispute started?\n\nRESPONDENT:We bought our land from the City of Harare in 2018. We paid the full amount, including the intrinsic land value, and each of us received an Agreement of Sale. There are about 300 members in our cooperative, and we were allocated stands along Airport Road, opposite One Commando Barracks, near St Martins.\n\nAfter completing our payments, we began preparing to service and develop the land. But later, we discovered that the City Council had also offered the same land to the Catholic University.\n\nINTERVIEWER: So now both you and the Catholic University are being told you own the same land?\n\nRESPONDENT:Exactly. City Council sold the land to us first, but years later they offered the same land to the Catholic University. Recently, we were served with papers accusing us of illegal occupation, even though we have valid agreements of sale and receipts.\n\nPeople have already started building, and contractors are working on sewer and water connections. Now, we are being told that the Vice President, Rtd. Dr. C.D.G.N. Chiwenga, who is Catholic, is pushing for the land to be transferred to the Catholic University for a project called a Medical Hub.\n\nThey are even saying we should be moved to a farm in Beatrice, which makes no sense because this land is private property that was sold to us by Council. Its not state land, so government has no right to repossess it.\n\nINTERVIEWER: You mentioned a letter dated 20 October. What does it say?\n\nRESPONDENT:Yes  this is the letter that changed everything. Its from the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works, signed by Dr. J. Basera, the Secretary for Local Government and Public Works. Its addressed to Eng. Mabhehna Moyo, the Town Clerk of Harare, and copied to His Worship, the Mayor, Councillor J. Mafume.\n\nThe letters subject line reads:\n\nREQUEST FOR HANDOVER OF LAND BOUND BY CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY TO THE SOUTH, JOSHUA N. NKOMO ROAD (AIRPORT ROAD) TO THE EAST, VITALIS ZVINAVASHE ROAD (DIEPPE ROAD) TO THE NORTH AND SEKE ROAD TO THE WEST (EXCLUDING EXISTING (OLD) ST MARTINS SUBURB);  TO GOVERNMENT FOR PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING A MEDICAL HUB.\n\nThe letter says, and I quote:\n\nThis letter follows the several meetings conducted and chaired by the Honourable Vice President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Rtd. Dr. C.D.G.N. Chiwenga, in respect of the proposed medical hub to be established in the area as defined above. Following the last meeting held on Tuesday, 14 October 2025, at which the handover of the land was discussed, I hereby formally request Council to immediately facilitate freeing up of all encumbrances on the property and to urgently transfer same to Government.\n\nIt then adds that:\n\nGovernment will compensate City of Harare with 36 hectares of land at Kimcote Farm. In due course, valuations may be conducted to ensure fair value of compensation. Given the urgency of this matter, may you expedite the transfer so that the project may take off.\n\nThats the key part  it explicitly says freeing up of all encumbrances, which means they want to remove us from our land.\n\nINTERVIEWER: How large is the land?\n\nRESPONDENT:Its quite large  about 300 stands, all properly allocated by City Council. Every buyer has an agreement of sale and payment receipts.\n\nINTERVIEWER: What was your progress in developing the stands?\n\nRESPONDENT:We paid our development fees, and City Council was managing the project. We even bought sewer and water materials that Council kept for us  but later, we found they had used our materials elsewhere.\n\nWe reported it to the police. During an interview, the Director of Housing and Town Planning admitted that Council had diverted our material to another project and promised to replace it. They never did. Thats why servicing was delayed.\n\nNow, Council is using that delay as a pretext to say the land is idle and should be transferred to government.\n\nINTERVIEWER: So, this is what you call a double allocation?\n\nRESPONDENT:Yes. This is a double allocation  which is fraudulent. City Council cannot hold meetings and reallocate land that was already sold and paid for.\n\nAnd the Vice President cannot direct that land which is not state land be handed over to government. The Constitution is clear  private property cannot be taken over without compensation and consent.\n\nINTERVIEWER: What action are you taking?\n\nRESPONDENT:We are urgently preparing court papers. We have all documentation proving ownership  agreements of sale, receipts, and payment records. Some people have already built structures, others are still developing.\n\nWeve written to the authorities to highlight that the land handover is illegal and unconstitutional. We believe Council is cooperating with the Ministry to cover up the missing materials they took from us.\n\nINTERVIEWER: And what are you hoping to achieve by going public?\n\nRESPONDENT:We just want justice and public awareness. We are 300 legitimate beneficiaries. We bought this land lawfully in 2018. We paid everything required by City Council.\n\nNow we are being threatened with eviction simply because of political influence. If this goes through, it means no private property in Zimbabwe is safe  anyone can lose their land if someone powerful wants it.\n\nThats why we are appealing to the public and the media to help expose this abuse of power before people are displaced.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent  The late Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirais widow, Elizabeth Macheka Tsvangirai, attended the funeral of Raila Amolo Odinga, Kenyas former Prime Minister and one of Africas most enduring opposition figures.\n\nOdinga and Tsvangirai shared more than just political titlesthey were allies forged in the fire of democratic struggle, united by a shared vision of freeing their nations from decades of authoritarian rule. Their relationship, which began in the early 2000s, was anchored in mutual admiration and collaboration, as both men led popular movements that challenged deeply entrenched liberation-party regimesZANU-PF in Zimbabwe and the Kenya African National Union (KANU) establishment that later evolved into the Jubilee coalition.\n\nMorgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), and Raila Odinga, head of Kenyas Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), were both former trade unionists who rose to prominence as the faces of their countries democratic struggles. They became symbols of the oppositions courage against violent state repression and electoral manipulation.\n\nBoth men endured state persecution, rigged elections, and personal loss in their pursuit of democratic change. Their struggles culminated in power-sharing governments that symbolised hope for reformOdinga serving as Kenyas Prime Minister from 2008 to 2013 after the post-election crisis, and Tsvangirai holding the same position in Zimbabwes unity government between 2009 and 2013 following the bloody 2008 elections.\n\nTheir friendship deepened during these years of shared governance. They often exchanged ideas on coalition politics, governance under authoritarian presidentsRobert Mugabe and Mwai Kibakiand strategies to democratise African states through peaceful political negotiation. Both men were also active in continental networks advocating electoral reforms and human rights.\n\nIt is within this context that Elizabeth Macheka Tsvangirais presence at Odingas funeral carried powerful symbolic weighta rekindling of the historic alliance between two political giants whose paths and struggles mirrored each others.\n\nMacheka first made a public appearance at Raila Odingas home in Bondo on Saturday, October 18, where she accompanied Mama Ida Odinga during a press briefing at Opoda Farm. Her appearance drew attention not only for its diplomatic significance but also for her eleganceshe wore a simple long-flowing black dress and subtle makeup that radiated calm dignity.\n\nIn her brief remarks, she expressed condolences to the Odinga family and spoke warmly of the close bond between her late husband and Raila Odinga. Raila was not just a friend to Morgan, but a brother in the struggle for African democracy, she said.\n\nDuring the burial on Sunday, Macheka once again captured public attention. Kenyans on social media praised her composure and fashion sense at the solemn event. Dressed in a black bodycon gown paired with matching heels, a fascinator, and dark sunglasses, she exuded understated elegance. Her modest jewelrya watch and earringscombined with red lipstick completed a look that reflected both mourning and grace.\n\nHer appearance became one of the most talked-about aspects of the ceremony, with many Kenyans and Zimbabweans online reflecting not only on her beauty but also on the enduring historical friendship between the Odinga and Tsvangirai families.\n\nBorn in 1976,Elizabeth Machekais a Zimbabwean businesswoman and daughter ofJoseph Macheka, a seniorZANU-PFpolitician and former mayor of Chitungwiza. Despite her political lineage, she gained prominence after marrying Morgan Tsvangirai in 2012 in a high-profile but controversial wedding in Hararethree years after the tragic death of his first wife,Susan Tsvangirai, in a car crash.\n\nTheir union was marked by controversy. The Catholic Church refused to officiate the ceremony due to disputes over Tsvangirais alleged customary marriage to Locadia Karimatsenga. Moreover, the 25-year age gap between the two drew public scrutiny. Some of Tsvangirais political supporters viewed Macheka with suspicion due to her fathers ties to ZANU-PF, accusing her of being a political plant, claims she strongly denied.\n\nDespite the public controversy, Elizabeth remained steadfast beside her husband until his death from colon cancer in February 2018. Since then, she has largely withdrawn from active politics, focusing on her business ventures in retail and catering. She occasionally makes public appearances to honour her late husbands legacy and continues to advocate for peace, unity, and democratic integrity.\n\nOn social media, particularly Instagram, she presents a more personal sidesharing glimpses of her family life, golf outings, and her love for her pet dogs.\n\nElizabeth Tsvangirais attendance at Raila Odingas funeral was more than a gesture of condolenceit was a symbolic reunion of two intertwined political legacies. Both Odinga and Tsvangirai came to embody Africas post-liberation democratic awakeningleaders who dared to challenge one-party dominance and inspired millions across the continent to imagine freer societies.\n\nIn mourning Raila Odinga, Elizabeth also honoured the enduring friendship between two men who fought, failed, rose again, and left indelible marks on Africas democratic history.\n\n",

            "content": "By Etiwel Mutero-The late afternoon sun of the Zimbabwean dry season beat down upon the dusty expanse, turning the landscape into a study of scorched browns and pale gold. It was a world defined by the unrelenting thirst for the distant waterholeand into this harsh beauty strode the monarch of the Mopane scrub: a truly immense bull elephant, known by local trackers simply asThe Colossus. To witness him was not merely to observe an animal; it was to stand in the presence of a living, breathing, ancient monument.\n\nHis sheer size was the first staggering impression. He stood taller than two mena walking hillock of granite-grey muscle and bone. His form was less like that of a mammal and more like a great geological formation that had somehow learned to move. The weight of his presence seemed to compress the very atmosphere around him, forcing the world into quiet reverence. Every step was deliberate, a slow, earth-trembling thump that spoke of mass and unhurried confidence. He was the definition of power made patient.\n\nThe elephants hide was a masterpiece of texture and history. It was not smooth, but a deeply furrowed landscapea map of every migration, every battle, and every drought he had survived. The skin was the colour of dried river mud and charcoal, shot through with patches of reddish Kalahari dust where he had recently tossed soil onto his flanks for cooling. The great, hanging folds of flesh around his shoulders and legs gave him an archaic, armour-plated appearance. Thousands of tiny, rigid bristleslike iron filingsdotted the surface, lending the texture a roughness that defied the suns soft light. Here and there, one could spot pale pink scar tissue: faded medals of endurance acquired from tussles with rivals or scrapes against thorny acacia brancheseach marking a chapter in his long, solitary existence.\n\nAbove this mountainous bulk was the immense skull, dominated by two perfect, curving tusks. These were the ivory trophies of his age and success, polished smooth at the tips from decades of scraping against rocks, levering up tough roots, and marking trees. They tapered to sharp points, glistening faintly even under the dustserving as both intimidating weapons and exquisitely fine-tuned sensory tools.\n\nBut the most mesmerising feature was his trunkthe great, liquid whip of muscle, cartilage, and sensitivity. It was a five-foot-long instrument of unparalleled dexterity. You could watch it move with the fluidity of a striking cobra, yet perform a task requiring the gentleness of a human hand. In one moment, it flared wide at the tip, testing the air for the scent of distant water or danger; in the next, it curled with infinite precision, plucking a single green shoot or delicately siphoning up a mouthful of water from the damp mud of a shrinking pool. When he drank, the trunk plunged deep, drawing in gallons with a single, powerful suction, before curling upward and emptying the refreshing deluge directly into his mouth with an audible, satisfying slosh.\n\nHis ears, vast and wing-like, were perpetually in motionenormous, intricate fans of thin skin, latticed with pronounced veins resembling the tributaries of the great Zambezi River. With a slow, languid rhythm, they flapped, creating an almost silent whoosh of displaced air, working as essential biological radiators to cool his massive internal furnace. The movement gave his profile a serene, almost philosophical quality, as if he were patiently signalling to the surrounding savanna.\n\nContrasting sharply with his massive scale were his eyes: surprisingly small, dark, and set deep within the folds of his face. Yet they were windows to an unreadable, profound intelligence. They held no maliceonly the deep-seated weariness and wisdom of generations. As he stopped beneath a towering African teak, the elephant shifted his weight, and a low, resonant rumble emanated from his chest. This infrasonic communication, too low for the human ear to truly comprehend, vibrated through the earth itselfa silent dialogue with the dispersed herd scattered across the plains. It was the sound of kinship and connection, the heartbeat of the bush.\n\nHe moved toward the last remaining pool, and the moment he reached it, his pace changed. He began to apply a generous coat of thick, grey mud, using his trunk to plaster it onto his head and back with purposeful swings. The mud bath was a luxury, a cooling balm, and a defence against biting insectstransforming the Colossus briefly from a dust-coloured giant into a figure moulded from wet, living clay. When he emerged, his silhouette against the setting sun was magnificent: a creature reborn in the cool, momentary protection of the earth.\n\nThe Zimbabwean elephant is more than just a magnificent beast; he is the custodian of the continents memorya living metaphor for enduring wildness. His ancient, thoughtful presence anchors the landscape, reminding all who watch that scale, patience, and deep connection to the earth remain the highest forms of sovereignty in the wild heart of Africa.\n\nEtiwel Mutero is a teacher, archivist, librarian, and political analyst.

            "content": "By A Correspondent  The ruling Zanu PF party is sitting on a staggering war chest of nearly US$10 million, even though it has not yet received its statutory allocation under the Political Parties (Finance) Act, according to figures contained in the central committee report tabled at its 22nd National Peoples Conference in Mutare last week.\n\nThe report shows that the partys accounts hold US$9 819 821.64 and ZWG722 860.97, positioning Zanu PF among the wealthiest political organisations in Southern Africa. Yet the revelation has reignited long-standing concerns over how the party amasses such vast resources in an economy where hospitals are collapsing, civil servants are underpaid, and millions of citizens are trapped in poverty.\n\nFor over four decades, Zanu PF has sustained its dominance through an intricate and coercive fundraising system that fuses state institutions, parastatals, and private businesses into its financial lifeline. What analysts term a shadow financing system has allowed the party to thrive while the national economy crumbles.\n\nFrom the 1980s onward, state-owned enterprises such as the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ), Grain Marketing Board (GMB), ZESA Holdings, TelOne, and the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) have routinely been compelled to donate cash, fuel, vehicles, and equipment to fund Zanu PF programmes, congresses, and election campaigns. These patriotic contributions, couched in the language of nationalism, have blurred the boundary between state resources and party coffers.\n\nCivil servants have also been caught in this extractive web. Teachers, nurses, agricultural extension officers, and district administrators have for years complained of forced membership contributions or voluntary donations deducted from their wages under state-driven initiatives that critics say channel funds into Zanu PFs political machinery.\n\nIn the private sector, coercion takes a subtler but equally potent form. Executives in mining, construction, and tobacco industries quietly admit that maintaining business operations often depends on making unofficial donations to the ruling party. Access to government tenders, licences, and contracts is widely perceived to hinge on demonstrating financial loyalty to Zanu PF. This entrenched patronage economy has enabled the party to convert political power into perpetual wealth, even as the broader economy deteriorates.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the partys national fundraising committee  chaired by flamboyant businessman Phillip Chiyangwa and including figures such as James Makamba, Supa Mandiwanzira, Betty Kaseke, John Paradza, Patience Tapomwa, and gold dealer Scott Sakupwanya  has raised millions of dollars in foreign and local currency. The committee oversees resource mobilisation for party operations, staff salaries, congresses, and restructuring exercises.\n\nThe central committee report reveals that Zanu PF collected US$120 869 and ZWG40 216 from membership subscriptions, with provincial structures instructed by treasurer-general Jacob Mudenda to ensure full annual payments by senior party officials, including members of the Politburo, Central Committee, and District Coordinating Committees.\n\nThe party also reported US$9.17 million and ZWG361 644.97 from donations, US$163 595 from the sale of vehicles, US$268 690 from conference contributions, and US$95 103.64 from tent hire. Expenditure figures show that Zanu PF disbursed US$3.98 million in staff salaries and US$1.74 million in gratuities.\n\nEven without its allocation from the state under the Political Parties (Finance) Act or dividends from its investment arms, Zanu PFs robust balance sheet demonstrates its ability to sustain itself independently of formal public funding  a feat critics attribute to decades of systematic resource extraction from institutions that depend on state favour.\n\nThe partys commissariat report further boasts that Zanu PF commands 81 167 cells and villages nationwide, representing a membership base of 4 058 350. Analysts argue that this structure is maintained not merely through ideological appeal but through material incentives  loans, food aid, and contracts tied to party allegiance. The report also lists 150 affiliate organisations, many benefiting from the Presidential Empowerment Revolving Fund, which opposition parties and civil society see as a conduit for patronage distribution.\n\nAlthough the party claims to have introduced new mechanisms to enhance financial accountability, past audits of empowerment schemes such as the Youth Fund, Command Agriculture, and the Presidential Inputs Scheme exposed widespread looting by politically connected elites.\n\nPolitical scientist Prof. Eldred Masunungure has long described Zanu PFs financial model as a fusion of public and partisan finance,arguing that it erodes democratic competition and entrenches corruption by rewarding loyalty over accountability.\n\nMeanwhile, the partys much-vaunted digitalisation project, set for completion by September 2025, is officially billed as a transparency measure  but critics say it is part of a broader surveillance strategy designed to track loyalty and control citizens.\n\nZanu PFs declared bank balance of nearly US$10 million thus represents more than prudent bookkeeping. It symbolises the partys mastery of political extraction  a system that bleeds the state to enrich the ruling elite. In a nation where public services crumble and citizens endure chronic deprivation, the ruling partys financial abundance starkly illustrates Zimbabwes paradox: a regime that prospers while the nation collapses.\n\n NewsDay\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresidential spokesperson George Charamba has launched a blistering attack on former Norton MP Temba Mliswa, calling him a mere talkative nobody and a failed opposition figure who can go hang on a banana tree.\n\nResponding to Mliswas criticism that he was not doing enough to defend President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Charamba took to X (formerly Twitter) on Monday to deliver a fiery response.\n\nI hardly have time for a failed opposition figure who seeks to play saviour to my principal or to ZANU PF, which he is yet to re-join, Charamba posted. I will only take notice of his errant views when he becomes a member of ZANU PF, or an MP after winning a seat in a free and fair electoral contest. For now, he is a mere talkative nobody who has no lessons for me! You can advise him to go hang on a banana tree if he has any, or runs an orchard!\n\nCharambas remarks came after Mliswa publicly accused him of failing to properly defend President Mnangagwa in the face of criticism, sparking a heated exchange on social media.\n\n",
