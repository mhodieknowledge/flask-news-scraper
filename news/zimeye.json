After a sluggish start to the campaign, with a 1-1 draw against Green Fuel and a 2-0 loss to Scotland FC, the Green Machine finally found their rhythm.\n\nJuan Mutudza proved to be the hero, scoring a crucial brace in the first half. He netted the opener in the 15th minute and doubled the lead just 11 minutes later, sealing the win for the visitors.\n\nThe loss further compounded Triangle Uniteds woes, as the Sugar Boys remain winless and pointless after three games. In contrast, CAPS Uniteds triumph injects momentum into their season, and they will look to build upon this result in their upcoming matches.\n\n",

            "content": "Speeding is more than just a violation of traffic laws; it is a deadly risk that can change lives in an instant. Each time you choose to drive above the speed limit, you are not only endangering yourself but also putting others at risk. Speeding kills, disables, and causes heartache, leaving behind broken families and shattered lives. Its essential to understand the profound impact of your actions on the road and the ripple effect they can have on others.\n\nOne of the most tragic consequences of speeding is the loss of life. Car accidents are a leading cause of death worldwide, and speed is often a contributing factor. When drivers exceed the speed limit, they decrease their ability to react to sudden changes in road conditions, such as pedestrians crossing, animals running into the road, or other vehicles making unexpected movements. At higher speeds, the impact of a collision is much more severe, increasing the chances of fatalities or life-altering injuries.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the driver. A fatal or serious crash caused by speeding can leave children without parents, spouses without partners, and entire families grieving. Imagine the pain and suffering that your loved ones would endure if you were taken from them because of your reckless decision behind the wheel. Your family loves you and wants you to come home safely at the end of each day. They depend on you, and speeding compromises that promise.\n\nMoreover, speeding can lead to long-term disabilities for both drivers and other road users. Survivors of high-speed crashes often face permanent injuries, which can affect their ability to work, care for their families, or live independently. These injuries are not just physical; they can also have a psychological toll, leading to trauma, depression, and a diminished quality of life. The emotional and financial burden of recovery falls not only on the individual but also on their family and community.\n\nRespecting road laws and driving responsibly isnt just about following rules; its about ensuring the safety of everyone on the road. There are countless other drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists sharing the same roads as you, and their lives are just as important. Your behavior behind the wheel affects them directly. Driving carefully and within speed limits is a basic way of showing respect for the lives and safety of others. By choosing to drive responsibly, youre helping to create a safer, more considerate driving environment for everyone.\n\nWe all have a responsibility to ensure that our actions on the road do not harm others. Every life is precious, and the impact of speeding is far-reaching. It can change your life forever and leave scars on those around you. So, before you accelerate, take a moment to think about the consequences. Your loved ones, the people around you, and even strangers on the road depend on you making the right choice. Drive safely, follow the speed limits, and remember that speeding kills. Its not just a statistic  its a reality we can all prevent.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZiyambi Ziyambi, a member of the ZANU PF Politburo and Minister of Justice, Legal, and Parliamentary Affairs, has sharply criticized journalist Blessed Mhlanga of Heart & Soul Television (HSTV) and Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) for allegedly using social media platforms to incite violence.\n\nAt a Special Provincial Coordinating Committee meeting in Chinhoyi, Ziyambi made it clear that the government would not tolerate such actions, warning that the law would take decisive action against those spreading violent or provocative messages. He stated:\n\nIt is irresponsible for any journalist to foster panic and uncertainty.\n\nHe further emphasized the seriousness of the issue, asserting that:\n\nThe law will act decisively against the broadcasting of incitement and violent messages. This kind of behaviour is not only dangerous but also poses a threat to our nations stability and economic progress.\n\nZiyambi also declared that no nation would accept calls for violent uprisings against its leadership, reinforcing the governments stance against such actions.\n\nMhlanga was arrested on February 24, 2025, after he voluntarily turned himself in to the police. His arrest came after allegations that he had incited public violence through his broadcasts on HSTV, which included interviews with political figures critical of the government. Among those interviewed was Blessed Geza, a war veteran known for his outspoken criticism of President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nMhlanga is facing charges under Section 164 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act for allegedly transmitting messages intended to provoke violence or harm property. Although his lawyer sought to challenge the evidence and secure bail, the High Court indefinitely postponed his bail hearing, leaving him in custody at Harare Remand Prison.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a move that seems to reinforce his familys influence within the political landscape, Major Sean Mnangagwa, the son of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, made a significant contribution to the construction of Zishumbe clinic in Masvingo North Constituency. His donation of 100 bags of cement has raised eyebrows, with political insiders suggesting it may also be a strategic maneuver to assert his fathers authority amid rising political tensions within the ruling Zanu PF party.\n\nSpeaking at the weekend, Masvingo North Constituency Member of Parliament Brian Mudumi expressed gratitude for the donation, which is expected to significantly aid in the completion of the clinic, a vital project for the community.\n\nWe are truly grateful for Major Sean Mnangagwas generous contribution of 100 bags of cement towards the construction of Zishumbe clinic, Mudumi said.\n\nThis donation will undoubtedly play a significant role in the completion of the clinic, which will provide essential healthcare services to the people of Masvingo North.\n\nThe clinic construction, a crucial development for the area, is part of ongoing efforts to improve healthcare infrastructure in rural Zimbabwe.\n\nHowever, the timing of the donation raises questions about underlying political motivations, particularly in light of the increasing rift between factions within Zanu PF.\n\nA source within the ruling party hinted that Major Sean Mnangagwas charitable act could be part of a broader strategy to strengthen his fathers position amid growing political tensions. Its a calculated move meant to portray President Mnangagwa as a man of the people. The whole thing is meant to ease the heightening tension, the source explained, suggesting that the donation was not just an act of goodwill but also a response to internal party rivalries.\n\nWith Zanu PF facing ongoing factional infighting, particularly between allies of President Mnangagwa and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, the donation could be seen as a subtle way for the Mnangagwa family to assert its dominance, sidelining Chiwengas supporters in the process.\n\nWhile the gesture has been positively received in Masvingo, the political ramifications are more complex, signaling the Mnangagwa familys keen interest in shaping the narrative and maintaining influence within the party.\n\n",

In the appeal, Mhike argued that Magistrate Gwitima grossly erred and misdirected himselfby denying bail to Mhlanga on 28 February 2025 as there were no compelling reasons to justify his continued incarceration.\n\nOn 10 March 2025, High Court Judge JusticeGibson Mandazabegan hearing Mhlangas bail appeal, whereFungai Nyahunzvi, a law officer intheNational Prosecuting Authority(NPA) made a shocking move of filing an application seeking referral of Mhlangas appeal to the High Courts Anti-Corruption Court (ACC) from the regular Bail Court; andalso sought apostponement of the matter pending the referral of the matter to the ACC.\n\nIn his application, Nyahunzvi argued that Mhlangas matter was placed in an ACC at Harare Magistrates Court and practice therefore dictates that the bail appeal in the High Court should be placed in the ACC Division of the High Court.\n\nHowever, Mhikeobjected and opposed Nyahunzvis applications and argued that there is nothing corruption-related in the charge being faced by Mhlanga.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Mandaza dismissed Nyahunzvis application and ruledthat the ordinary Bail Court wascompetent to hear Mhlangas bail appeal.\n\nJustice Mandaza then postponedhearing of the bail appeal to12 March 2025 to allow the NPA to file its response to Mhlangas bid for freedom.\n\nOn 12 March 2025, Justice Mandaza postponed hearing of Mhlangas bail appeal to allow himself to make a determinationon the senior journalists request to be furnished with additional information such as the electronic and video evidence, which prosecutors claim incriminate Mhlanga in the commission of the offence of allegedly transmitting data messages inciting violence as defined in section 164 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act.\n\nOn 17 March 2025, Justice Mandaza resumed hearing of Mhlangas bail appeal and first ruled that the High Court will not view the relevant video, which constitutes the basis of the states case against Mhlanga, because it is not part of the record of proceedings in the Harare Magistrates Court and indicated that he would be guided only by the content of what transpired in the lower court.\n\nAfterwards, Mhike submitted arguments in support of Mhlangas bail appeal and asked the High Court to set free the senior journalist while Nyahunzvi opposed the appeal and insisted that the media practitioner should remain holed up in prison and stand trial from jail.\n\nJustice Mandaza then reserved his judgment on Mhlangas bail appeal and indicated that he will advise all concerned parties in the matter when his verdict would be ready.\n\n",

She stated:\n\nFor a long time, the opposition has been dominant in Glen View South, but they have failed to deliver. The Members of Parliament we have had over the years did not report back to the people; they remained silent while we faced numerous challenges like cholera outbreaks, poor roads, and a lack of development.\n\nHowever, reports from local voters and opposition figures suggest a more troubling side to the ZANU PF campaign. Allegations of vote buying have surfaced, with claims that party supporters are being offered money, food, and promises of development in exchange for votes. Additionally, there are reports of ZANU PF officials intimidating voters, pressuring them to support Tawomhera or face repercussions.\n\nIn one instance, a local resident, speaking anonymously, revealed:\n\nWe are being pressured to attend ZANU PF rallies, and if you dont show up, people start talking about your loyalty to the party. Some are even offering cash to people who say they will vote for them. Its becoming very clear that the election isnt just about ideas, its about who can pay the most and intimidate the hardest.\n\nThe opposition has condemned these tactics, claiming that they undermine the democratic process. As the election date draws closer, the issue of vote buying and voter intimidation looms large over the by-election, raising questions about the integrity of the race and the fairness of the competition.\n\n",
