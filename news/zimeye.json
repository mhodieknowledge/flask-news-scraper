In Gutu Ward 6, a woman living with a disability was forcibly removed from her land by a traditional leader, exposing the vulnerabilities of marginalized residents. Additionally, in Gutu Ward 24, nurses at a medical facility were harassed and intimidated for accepting donated blankets without Zanu PF approval, demonstrating interference in professional and humanitarian activities.\n\nThe report notes that such violations affected a total of 2,531 individuals across Masvingo in October alone, including 1,360 women and 1,171 men. Among them, 58 women and 51 men were persons with disabilities.\n\nIn October 2025, ZPP documented a total of 116 human rights violations across the country, affecting 2,531 individuals, reads part of the report. The violations recorded included gross abuses such as forced displacements, hate-motivated violence, threats, and physical assault.\n\nThe report further highlighted broader infringements on civil liberties, noting that victims faced restrictions on freedom of assembly and association, curtailment of freedom of expression, unjustified arrests, and unequal access to government aid and essential social services.\n\nThe attack on the Mwenezi resident underscores the risks faced by citizens who express political opinions that diverge from the ruling partys interests. ZPP has called for urgent measures to protect individuals from politically motivated attacks and to uphold human rights across Masvingo and the rest of Zimbabwe.\n\nZanu PF HQ\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri President Emmerson Mnangagwas public endorsement of controversial businessman Wicknell Chivayo has sparked widespread outrage, with many Zimbabweans questioning the motives behind the lavish donation of 21 vehicles to the ZANU-PF Womens League.\n\nAt the handover ceremony on Friday, 5 December, Mnangagwa hailed Chivayo as a patriotic businessman, celebrating his role in supplying luxury vehicles to strengthen ZANU-PF structures. The president confirmed that the Womens League received six Toyota Land Cruiser 300 Series VXR vehicles for the top six leadership positions, alongside ten Toyota Hilux GD6 Double Cab vehicles. He claimed the vehicles would enhance grassroots mobilisation efforts across the ten provinces.\n\nMnangagwa also revealed that the Womens League had been given a substantial cash injection, saying: In addition, the Womens League received US$500,000, to be distributed equally across the 10 provinces to support various Party development and empowerment initiatives.\n\nThe president extended the praise to the Young Women 4ED, announcing: I also handed over five (5) Toyota Hilux GD6 Double Cabs to the Young Women 4ED The Young Women 4ED also received US$100,000 to support their activities in mobilising the youth.\n\nBut outside the ZANU-PF bubble, critics view the spectacle as yet another illustration of a ruling party strengthening its political machinery through questionable benefactors while ignoring the suffering of ordinary citizens. Many argue that the so-called empowerment programmes are exclusive partisan projects disguised as national development.\n\nMnangagwa heavily credited Chivayo for the donations, saying: These donations have been made possible through the generous support of a young patriotic businessman, Mr Wicknell Chivayo, whose philanthropy and charitable commitment to National development are exceptional. He added that Chivayos actions reflect the true spirit of our national philosophy that Nyika Inovakwa Nevene Vayo.\n\nHowever, analysts say this praise paints a distorted picture. Chivayos long-standing reputation for opaque deals and incomplete state-funded projects raises serious questions about the origin of his newfound generosity. Critics argue that the presidents effusive endorsement appears politically motivated and signals a deepening reliance on wealthy loyalists to shore up ZANU-PF power.\n\nWith hospitals lacking basic drugs, civil servants underpaid, and millions struggling with poverty, many Zimbabweans see the celebration of Chivayos donations as a troubling symbol of a government more focused on partisan survival than national wellbeing.\n\nMnangagwa and Chivayo\n\n",

She warned: We are the Womens League and we are very effective. If you oppose us you will be in trouble. We will knock you out if you challenge us. We are saying 2030 is unstoppable.\n\nHer remarks came at the same event where Mnangagwa praised businessman Wicknell Chivayo for donating a fleet of vehicles and large sums of money to ZANU-PF structures  a development that has drawn heavy scrutiny from the public.\n\nAt the handover ceremony held on 5 December, Mnangagwa celebrated Chivayo as a patriotic businessman, crediting him for providing 21 vehicles to the Womens League.

The president said: I also handed over five Toyota Hilux GD6 Double Cabs to the Young Women 4ED The Young Women 4ED also received US$100,000 to support their activities in mobilising the youth.\n\nCritics argue that such donations serve to strengthen partisan structures rather than advancing national development. Many Zimbabweans believe the ruling party is increasingly reliant on politically connected businessmen while basic services continue to collapse nationwide.\n\nDespite public backlash, Mnangagwa repeatedly applauded Chivayos involvement, stating: These donations have been made possible through the generous support of a young patriotic businessman, Mr Wicknell Chivayo, whose philanthropy and charitable commitment to national development are exceptional. He added that Chivayos conduct reflects the true spirit of our national philosophy that Nyika Inovakwa Nevene Vayo.\n\nAnalysts, however, say the praise ignores Chivayos controversial business record, pointing out his history of unfulfilled state contracts and opaque dealings. They argue the presidents enthusiastic endorsement suggests a tightening alliance between ZANU-PF leadership and wealthy loyalists.\n\nWith the public health sector in crisis, civil servants struggling on poor salaries, and millions facing daily hardship, the visible luxury and political posturing have only intensified anger  especially after Chinomomas aggressive declaration that dissenters will be knocked out.\n\nMabel Chinomoma with Emmerson Mnangagwa\n\n",

The decision responds to Swedens wider foreign policy priorities, including emerging security and defence challenges in our neighbourhood.\n\nIt is also connected to the implementation of the Swedish Governments Reform Agenda for development cooperation, which aims to sharpen the focus of Swedens development cooperation and reduce the number of bilateral development cooperation strategies.\n\nOther countries that are affected in Africa include Liberia, Mozambique and Tanzania.\n\nThe decision is not connected to any specific events or developments in Zimbabwe.\n\nSince the Embassys primary mission is closely linked to the Swedish development cooperation, the need for a permanent diplomatic presence has been reduced. The decision, therefore, also entails that the Swedish Embassy in Harare will close.\n\nZimbabwe remains an important partner for Sweden. Our historic relations are strong and marked by strong people-to-people ties.\n\nThese ties create opportunities for continued collaboration between actors in Sweden and in Zimbabwe, even if the form for these collaborations may change.\n\nThe historic and diverse collaborations between our countries represent a stable base on which to build our continued partnership.\n\nSweden seeks to have continued positive diplomatic relations with Zimbabwe with an increased focus on trade, investments and sustainable growth.\n\nThe Swedish government particularly sees opportunities to continue our collaboration on sustainable mining, environment and climate and democracy and human rights.\n\nSweden remains engaged through political dialogue and economic ties. Support to Zimbabwe also comes through Swedens contributions to the multilateral system and organisations working in the country, as well as through the EUs development cooperation. Support can also come through Swedens thematic and regional development cooperation strategies.\n\nThe Swedish Foreign Ministry, Business Sweden and other parts of Team Sweden will continue to support Swedish companies that are active in the Zimbabwe market.\n\n",
