            "content": "Chipinge Mt Selinda High School in rural Chipinge has embraced a bold new chapter in education, commissioning a new school bus and installing Starlink satellite internet, signalling a transformative shift in rural learning.\n\nAt a colourful ceremony attended by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, the United Church of Christ in Zimbabwe (UCCZ), parents, alumni, and students, at the weekend, school head Mr. Phineas Mundeta described the dual investment as a historic transformation for the school and its surrounding community.\n\nThis is not just a bus  its a vehicle for dreams, for access, and for visibility, he said, adding that the improved transport will allow students to access academic competitions, career expos, and field trips previously out of reach.\n\nMt Selinda has shown consistent academic improvement, with Mr. Mundeta noting a steady rise in pass rates since 2019.\n\nThe schools excellence in science education has earned it recognition as the Chipinge district STEM hub and recipient of the Ministrys Permanent Secretarys Merit Award for discipline and academic performance.\n\nAdding to the schools modernization is the installation of high-speed Starlink internet. This development opens unprecedented digital learning opportunities for both learners and educators. Students can now access virtual lessons, research portals, coding platforms, and online academic content, while teachers benefit from global training resources and professional networks.\n\nThis connection ends the digital exclusion of our learners, said Mr. FOS Bandama, Education Secretary for UCCZ. It means global libraries, virtual science labs, and collaboration across borders.\n\nCommunity leaders and development practitioners hailed the initiative as a model for rural schools nationwide.\n\nMr. Claris Madhuku, an alumnus and director of the Platform for Youth and Community Development (PYCD), said the move represents a strategic effort to bridge Zimbabwes digital divide.\n\nIf scaled up, this can transform the future of thousands of rural learners. Digital literacy is now foundational for participation in the 21st-century economy, he said.\n\nThe development supports Zimbabwes Vision 2030 and the Ministrys digital learning strategy, which aims to ensure equitable access to education through ICT integration.\n\nGuest speaker Professor Lovemore Madhuku, also an alumnus, urged students to aim high, crediting his own academic journeybeginning as one of the first A-level students at Mt Selinda in 1985to the schools formative influence.\n\nSource-Vemuganga Community Radio\n\n",

His second came from a swift Chelsea counterattack, calmly slotted home to seal the Blues place in Sundays final, where they will face either Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nThough elated with the result, Pedro admitted it was an emotionally complex moment to knock out the club that nurtured him.\n\nIm happy to score my first goal, but also I know this tournament is very important for them, he told reporters after the match. I cant just say sorry, but I have to be professional. I play for Chelsea. They pay me to score goals. And today I was happy to score.\n\nFluminense, the last South American side in the competition, saw their campaign ended by one of their own. Pedro, who came through their youth academy and made 25 league appearances for the Rio de Janeiro side in 2019, moved to England that same year  first joining Watford, then Brighton, and now Chelsea.\n\nFluminense had high hopes after reaching the quarterfinals and previously appearing in the 2023 Club World Cup final under the tournaments former format. But on this night, it was a homegrown talent now wearing blue who shattered their dreams.\n\nChelsea now eye a historic moment in Sundays final, with Joo Pedro quickly becoming a hero among Blues fans  and a heartbreaker for Fluminense faithful.\n\n",

A petty or fleeting quarrel is never carried into battle as comrades wade into battle. The stakes are so high. They pale at the prospect of supreme sacrifice.\n\nFraming the relationship in wartime rhetoric, Mutsvangwa added: Tiffs have no place in gunfire being exchanged in anger with the enemy. Your comrade is, after all, your keeper.\n\nHe further claimed, I have had the opportunity to know and grow with both President Mnangagwa and VP Chiwenga for over five decades. According to Mutsvangwa, the two leaders have stood together through national threats and continue to focus on developmental projects like road infrastructure and agriculture.\n\nBut observers remain unconvinced. With reports of infighting, succession battles, and growing friction between rival camps within Zanu PF, Mutsvangwas insistence on harmony has only deepened speculation that all is not well.\n\nThe louder the denials, the deeper the cracks, one political analyst remarked. Mutsvangwa sounds less like a spokesperson and more like a man trying to hold a collapsing structure together with slogans.\n\nAs internal power games escalate ahead of the partys future leadership contests, Mutsvangwas desperate appeal for unity may be less about reality  and more about damage control.\n\n",

Its an ideal arrangement for the city, Mafume said. We need to think outside the box. The President directed us to enter into this agreement, and we obliged.\n\nCritics, however, say the awarding of the multimillion-dollar deal to a politically connected individualwithout open biddingundermines both transparency and the autonomy of the city council.\n\nThis is nothing more than state capture at municipal level, said a city official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The mayor is openly admitting that he acted on presidential orders. What happened to procurement laws?\n\nPaul Tungwarara, a known business ally of Mnangagwa and influential figure within the ruling elite, has previously been linked to several high-value state-linked projects, often under murky circumstances. His latest involvement has ignited allegations of favoritism and disregard for procurement regulations.\n\nWhile Mafume insists the partnership will bring much-needed investment to a dilapidated facility, residents and civic watchdogs are questioning why the deal bypassed public scrutiny.\n\nWe deserve better. These backdoor deals rob the city of accountability, said Patience Sibanda, a youth sports coordinator. City Sports Centre belongs to the people, not politicians.\n\nAs Harare grapples with deteriorating infrastructure and a public outcry over corruption, the City Sports Centre deal has become yet another flashpoint in the broader debate over governance, influence, and impunity in Zimbabwe.\n\n",
