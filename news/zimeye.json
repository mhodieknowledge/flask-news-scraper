According to sources, Chiefs are evaluating their options for a new striker and Dube has emerged as a promising candidate.\n\nThe club is evaluating the realistic chances of signing a striker, and as things stand, Prince (Dube) looks the most promising option, an unnamed source revealed. With Dubes impressive performance in the Tanzanian Premier League, where he tops the scoring chart with eleven goals, Chiefs are keen to bring him on board.\n\nDubes experience in the South African Premier Soccer League, having previously played for SuperSport United, makes him an attractive option for Chiefs. The club had also considered other strikers, including Michael Olunga and Fiston Mayele, but Dube appears to be the most viable option at present.\n\n",

            "content": "Fire extinguishers are an important safety tool to have in your vehicle, but proper storage and maintenance are crucial to ensuring their effectiveness in an emergency. Here are some key tips to keep your fire extinguisher in top condition and ready for use.\n\nFirst and foremost, never expose your fire extinguisher to direct sunlight.\n\nProlonged exposure to the suns rays can lead to dangerous conditions, potentially causing the extinguisher to explode, which could result in harm or damage to your vehicle.\n\nAlways store it in a cool, dry place to ensure safety.\n\nIt is equally important to store your fire extinguisher in an accessible spot inside your vehicle. Avoid keeping it in the boot, as this could prevent you from accessing it quickly in the event of a fire. During a car fire, the vehicles electronic components may fail, causing the boot to become locked. This would make it difficult or impossible to reach your extinguisher. Instead, store it under your car seat or in the glove compartment where it can be quickly retrieved.\n\nIn addition to proper storage, regular checks are vital. Always verify the expiration date on your fire extinguisher. If the extinguisher is past its expiration date and is refillable, take it to a recognized agent to have it refilled, often at a lower cost than the original purchase price.\n\nRemember, keeping a fire extinguisher in your vehicle is an essential safety measure that can save lives in an emergency. By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your fire extinguisher remains effective when you need it most.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

However, what they encountered was anything but a technological revolution.\n\nWe traveled all the way from the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Poland to see the so-called invention, said Arjan Gottmer, a spokesman for the investor group. But when we got there, we found nothing. No tests were allowed, no working prototypes, and no proof that any of the paid-for machines had ever been delivered.\n\nEmpty Promises, Vanishing FundsAccording to the investors, Chikumbutso and his team engaged in repeated stalling tactics, promising test drives of the self-powering vehicles only to cancel at the last minute.

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nAs Zimbabwe hurtles towards the 2030 presidential election, the government has intensified its surveillance on activists, opposition leaders, and journalists.\n\nThe move is seen as a concerted effort to muzzle dissenting voices and maintain a tight grip on power.\n\nThe ruling partys social media activists have been orchestrating a campaign of hate speech and incitement against prominent opposition figures, including former Zengeza MP Job Sikhala, Gift Ostallos Siziba, and Peter Mutasa, the former president of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU).\n\nThese individuals have been vocal in their rejection of the proposed constitutional amendment that would allow President Mnangagwa to seek a third term.\n\nActivists and journalists across the country are being trailed by suspected state security agents, and many have reported incidents of harassment and intimidation. The regime is seeking to silence critics and potential protest leaders, and the blessing of war veterans leaders is being sought to legitimize the crackdown.\n\nThe recent arrest of prominent journalist Blessed Mhlanga, who has been in detention for 9 days, has raised concerns about the states intentions. Mhlangas arrest is seen as a warning shot to the media and civil society, and has sent a chilling message about the consequences of speaking truth to power.\n\nAs anticipation for protests rises, the state is monitoring activists, and the Minister of Information, Publicity, and Broadcasting Services, Jefferson Muswere, has warned against any attempts to destabilize the country.\n\nThe government has accused activists and the opposition of seeking to incite violence and undermine the authority of the state.\n\nHowever, human rights defenders and opposition leaders argue that the governments actions are a clear attempt to suppress dissent and maintain a grip on power. They point to the proposed constitutional amendment as a clear indication of the governments intention to subvert the democratic process and cling to power.\n\nThe surge in surveillance has a chilling effect on freedom of expression and assembly, as individuals become wary of being monitored and potentially targeted by the state.\n\nThe use of advanced surveillance capabilities, including digital surveillance, has increased the potential for the state to spy on its citizens and further clamp down on free speech.\n\nAs Zimbabwe teeters on the brink of a major political crisis, the international community is watching with bated breath.\n\nThe situation demands a concerted effort from regional and international actors to press for the respect of human rights, the rule of law, and democratic principles.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has subtly expressed his intention to remain in office beyond 2028, after instructing Politburo members to uphold conference resolutions that pave the way for his extended rule.\n\nSpeaking at a Politburo meeting in Harare on Wednesday, Mnangagwa emphasized the importance of unity and discipline within the party.\n\nWe must expose and reject those who engage in political grandstanding, along with those who support them, Mnangagwa asserted, stressing that any actions aimed at creating discord will not be tolerated.\n\nThe conference resolutions, which Mnangagwa has endorsed, propose extending his term in office beyond 2028.\n\nThis move would require constitutional amendments to take effect.\n\nMnangagwa reminded members to adhere to the values and principles of ZANU PF, both individually and collectively, and to follow the partys line without exception. We must follow the correct line of the Party, without exception, he emphasized.\n\nThe President also highlighted the importance of remembering the sacrifices of ZANU PFs fallen heroes and heroines, emphasizing the qualities of loyalty, patriotism, and service to the cause. Persistence, consistency, loyalty, patriotism, and sacrifice define our service to the Party and are the core of true comradeship and heroism, he noted.\n\nIn conclusion, Mnangagwa stressed the need for ZANU PF to maintain unity and discipline, referencing the partys Constitution as a critical guideline. The continued implementation of our Conference decisions, policies, and programs must reflect the partys commitment to progressive nation-building, he emphasized.\n\n",
