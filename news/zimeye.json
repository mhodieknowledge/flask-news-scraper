            "content": "By Farai D Hove | ZimEye | Harare, Zimbabwe  February 11, 2025In a move signaling further political consolidation, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has dismissed Apollonia Munzverengwi from her position as Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution in Mashonaland East Province and replaced her with Itayi Ndudzo, a figure linked to the influential Rushwaya family.\n\nThe announcement was formalized through a press statement issued by Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet, Dr. Martin Rushwaya, on February 11, 2025. The statement confirmed that Munzverengwi was removed in terms of Section 108(1a) of the Constitution, while Ndudzos appointment was carried out under Section 104 Subsection (1) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe.\n\nThis development has sparked speculation about internal power struggles within the ruling ZANU-PF party, particularly between Mnangagwa and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga. Munzverengwi, who is reportedly a relative of Chiwenga, is seen as a casualty of the ongoing political realignments within the party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ndudzo, the new Minister, has close ties to the Rushwaya family, known to be relatives of President Mnangagwa. This appointment further solidifies the Rushwaya influence within the government, following other high-profile appointments and controversies involving members of the family.\n\nPolitical Implications\n\nMunzverengwis dismissal comes at a time when ZANU-PF factional battles are intensifying. Mnangagwa, who is reportedly eyeing a third term despite internal opposition, appears to be strengthening his grip on power by purging Chiwenga-linked officials and replacing them with his loyalists.\n\nObservers say the move is also strategic ahead of the 2028 elections, as Mnangagwa seeks to consolidate his authority and neutralize potential challengers within ZANU-PF. Chiwenga, who led the 2017 military coup that ousted Robert Mugabe, has long been rumored to harbor presidential ambitions, and any influence he retains in key provinces could pose a threat to Mnangagwas long-term plans.\n\nMnangagwas Growing Influence in Mashonaland East\n\nMashonaland East is a key province in Zimbabwes political landscape, serving as a traditional stronghold for ZANU-PF. The replacement of Munzverengwi with Ndudzo suggests Mnangagwa wants absolute control over the region, ensuring that his allies dominate structures ahead of the next electoral cycle.\n\nWith Dr. Martin Rushwayaanother Mnangagwa loyalisthandling key administrative functions, the latest reshuffle further strengthens the presidents inner circle.\n\nMnangagwas decision to fire a Chiwenga ally and replace her with a Rushwaya-linked official is a clear indication of the ongoing political realignments within Zimbabwes ruling party. Whether this marks the beginning of a broader cabinet reshuffle or a targeted move against Chiwengas influence remains to be seen.\n\nHowever, one thing is certain: Mnangagwa is tightening his grip on power, and any oppositioninternal or externalwill likely face similar purges as Zimbabwe inches closer to the next major elections.-ZimEye\n\n",

            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda- Vice President Constantino Chiwenga has suffered a significant setback after President Emmerson Mnangagwa dismissed his relative from government on Tuesday.\n\nMashonaland East Provincial Affairs Minister, Apollonia Munzverengwi, was fired just a day after public clashes erupted between Mnangagwa and Chiwengas supporters at the National Heroes Acre.\n\nLegal practitioner Itayi Ndudzo swiftly replaced her.\n\nMunzverengwi, a well-known ally of Chiwenga, played a crucial role in mobilizing support for the vice president, who is widely believed to be positioning himself for a challenge against Mnangagwa ahead of the next ZANU PF elective congress.\n\nGovernment insiders suggest that Munangagwas decision to axe Munzverengwi is part of a broader strategy to weaken Chiwengas influence, particularly in Mashonaland Eastan influential province in ZANU PFs power struggles.\n\nThe move mirrors previous purges that targeted military-backed figures who had helped Mnangagwa seize power from Robert Mugabe in the 2017 coup.\n\nWhile the official statement on Munzverengwis dismissal cites constitutional provisions, political analysts argue that Mnangagwa is consolidating his grip on power amid speculation that Chiwenga may challenge him before the 2028 elections.\n\nThe vice president has recently maintained a low public profile, further fueling rumours of a deepening rift between the two leaders.\n\n",

The teacher had been experiencing depression and had requested a six-month leave of absence in December, but returned to school just 20 days later after being deemed fit to work .\n\nWhats particularly alarming is that the teacher had displayed violent behavior just days before the stabbing, including putting another teacher in a headlock. Education officials had visited the school that morning to investigate the altercation, but no action was taken to prevent the tragedy.\n\nSouth Koreas acting president, Choi Sang-mok, has ordered an investigation into the case and urged authorities to take measures to prevent such incidents in the future. The school was closed on Tuesday, with locals laying flowers and tributes at the gate.\n\nThis incident has raised concerns about school safety in South Korea, which is generally considered a safe country with strict gun control laws. However, recent years have seen a rise in high-profile crimes, including stabbings .\n\n",

            "content": "FULL TEXT: Mr. Speaker Sir, I rise on a point of national interest to draw the attention of this august house to the passing on of President Sam Nujoma, a titan of Pan-Africanism and a champion of Africas liberation, whose unwavering support for Zimbabwes liberation struggle will forever be etched in our nations history. As the last of the frontline states leaders to pass on, his demise marks the end of an era in both Namibian and African history.\n\nPresident Nujomas lifelong work embodied the principles of Pan-Africanism, seeking to promote solidarity and cooperation among African people. Through his leadership of SWAPO, he spearheaded Namibias struggle for independence, inspiring a generation of Africans to resist colonialism, apartheid, and neo-colonialism. His commitment to Pan-Africanism was shaped by his encounters with other African luminaries like Kwame Nkrumah, Patrice Lumumba, and Gamal Abdel Nasser.\n\nHere in Zimbabwe, we remember Nujomas steadfast support for our liberation struggle. We recall how he stood in solidarity with us during our independence celebrations in 1980, even as he continued to battle for Namibias freedom. In June 1981, Zimbabwe hosted a Namibia Solidarity Week, featuring mass rallies led by President Nujoma, further solidifying the bonds of Pan-African solidarity between our nations.\n\nAs we reflect on Nujomas legacy, we acknowledge his significant contributions to the development of Pan-African thought. He played a crucial role in forming the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and promoting regional integration through the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Nujomas tireless efforts earned him numerous accolades, including the Lenin Peace Prize, the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize, and the Ho Chi Minh Peace Prize.\n\nAs we mourn the passing of this African icon, we draw inspiration from his life. Nujomas dedication to African liberation, his commitment to Pan-Africanism, and his pursuit of justice and equality are a testament to his enduring legacy. As Zimbabweans, particularly the younger generation, we can learn valuable lessons from Nujomas life about solidarity, perseverance, and sacrifice in pursuit of a united, empowered, and just Africa.\n\nIn light of these immense contributions, I propose that this House impress upon the Executive to declare a day of national mourning in Zimbabwe to honor the life and legacy of Sam Nujoma.\n\n",
