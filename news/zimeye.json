The stop came after a disagreement over the fare.\n\nBaba Tiara had boarded the kombi at Koala Meats bus stop and offered a 20 ZiG noteroughly equivalent to 50 US centsfor the trip. However, the driver demanded a US$1 fare. When the two failed to reach a compromise, Dhokwani ordered him off the vehicle.\n\nMoments after the kombi resumed its journey, it collided head-on with the haulage truck that had veered into its lane, killing Dhokwani and 16 others.\n\nIn an emotional interview withH-Metro, Baba Tiara described witnessing the crash after stepping off the vehicle.\n\nThe driver wasnt speeding. But just after I got off, the haulage truck crossed into his lane and hit the kombi. I saw it all  it was devastating,he said.\n\nI cant stop blaming myself. Maybe if I had the money, the kombi wouldnt have stopped, and it would have passed that point before the truck came. Ndichirikurwadziwa zvakanyanya uye nekuzvipa mhosva (Im still deeply pained and blaming myself).\n\nThe victims of the crash ranged in age from three to 63. The youngest was Shantel Jere, aged just three, while the oldest was Mary Nyambiri, 63.Among the deceased was the kombi driver, Dhokwani, whom colleagues described as disciplined and responsible.\n\nSolomon Swikiro, popularly known as Solo, a rank marshal at Harare Central Police Station, paid tribute to Dhokwani.\n\nHe wasnt one of those reckless drivers. He didnt drink, wasnt violent, and was always focused. Weve lost a good man  one of the best drivers on the route,said Solo.\n\nNational police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi, said investigations into the crash are ongoing.\n\nPolice are conducting comprehensive investigations to establish the full circumstances of the accident. We urge all motorists to exercise caution, ensure their vehicles are roadworthy, and always prioritise safety,he said.\n\nAs the nation mourns, a chilling thought lingers  a disagreement over 50 cents may have sealed the fate of 17 lives.\n\n",

            "content": "By Court Correspondent | ZimEye | Edmund Kudzayi Challenges $100,000 Defamation Judgment in Shocking High Court Affidavit\n\nHARARE  24 July 2025  In a dramatic legal development, journalist and political commentator Edmund Kudzayi has filed a bombshell founding affidavit at the High Court of Zimbabwe, seeking the rescission of a US$100,000 default judgment awarded to lawyer and opposition politician Fadzayi Mahere in a defamation case.\n\nKudzayis application, filed under Case No. HC ../25 and received on 24 July 2025 by the High Courts Civil Division, alleges manifest injustice, fraudulent resuscitation, and abuse of court process by Mahere and her legal team. He claims the judgment was improperly obtained through deception and procedural manipulation.\n\nKey Allegations:\n\nOn 10 July 2025, this Honourable Court granted a default judgment against me and in favour of the Respondent for the payment of USD100,000 in the matter Fadzayi Mahere v Edmund Kudzayi HC3060/22, Kudzayi confirms in the affidavit.\n\nKudzayi, represented by Messrs Gunje Legal Practice, says he was never in wilful default and argues that he had a valid defence to the defamation claim. He also contends that Mahere revived a dormant and twice-struck-off matter by misleading the court.\n\nThe matter had been twice struck off the court roll due to lack of prosecution and its resuscitation was based on a misrepresentation to the Court by Respondent and her legal practitioner.\n\nDenied Entry to Court\n\nKudzayi further reveals that he was physically present at the High Court on 24 March 2025 but was obstructed by security from entering the courtroom, resulting in his defence being struck off without representation:\n\nI was obstructed from attending the hearing by High Court security even though I was in the High Court building My defence was struck out and the matter placed on the unopposed roll without my knowledge.\n\nHe accuses the Respondent of snatching a judgment despite being aware that he was not in default and had actively participated in the matter from the outset.\n\nExtraordinary Damages and Manifest Injustice\n\nKudzayi brands the USD100,000 award as an unprecedented windfall not grounded in Zimbabwean legal precedent:\n\nNo court in Zimbabwe would award the quantum of damages awarded to the Respondent as it is so extraordinary as to constitute a manifest injustice.\n\nHe cites previous defamation rulings, arguing the award is drastically out of step with local jurisprudence:\n\nAn award of USD100,000.00 in defamation damages is out of the ordinary in this jurisdiction The highest award thus far granted is USD18,000.00.\n\nAlleged Affair with Married Man at the Core\n\nKudzayi maintains that his original statements, which led to the defamation suit, were truthful and made in the public interest. He claims Mahere had an extramarital affair with Mr. Tinashe Murapata and says his reporting was aimed at highlighting the ethical fitness of a public figure:\n\nThe Respondents case is that it is defamatory that I published the truth that she had an affair with Mr. Tinashe Murapata, a married man. My defence is that it is in the public interest to report on the unethical conduct of one who wishes to be a national leader.\n\nHe asserts that only three peopleMahere, Mr. Murapata, and Murapatas former wifecan confirm the truth, with the latter listed as a key defence witness:\n\nOne of my chief witnesses is the former wife of Mr. Murapata, the man with whom Respondent had an adulterous affair.\n\nCourt Misled, Judicial Integrity Undermined\n\nKudzayi accuses Mahere of abusing her status as an officer of the court:\n\nFraud does more than merely compromise a legal proceeding; it annihilates it These proceedings are void ab initio.\n\nHe further alleges that she deliberately misled the judge by bypassing a roundtable engagement and falsely claiming urgency due to Kudzayis supposed lack of cooperation.\n\nShe deprived me of the very engagement she had claimed was a prerequisite, contradicting her own justification and undermining the integrity of the process.\n\nAppeal to Justice\n\nIn a concluding plea to the court, Kudzayi states:\n\nThe application manifestly has merit. It should not be opposed. Respondent snatched at a judgment. She should not have done so.\n\nHe argues the matter must be properly ventilated through a full trial and cross-examination, warning that the court risks setting a dangerous precedent if it allows the judgment to stand.\n\nThis is a developing story. ZimEye will continue to follow proceedings in the High Court.\n\n",

The electoral process, ZIFA said, will be conducted in strict compliance with the ZIFA Statutes and the newly adopted ZIFA Electoral Code (2024).\n\nThe PSL elections will decide a new five-member board, which includes the chairperson, vice-chairperson, and three executive committee members. Meanwhile, the ZWSL will elect a chairperson, vice-chairperson, and five board members to spearhead the growth of the womens game.\n\nThe battle for the PSL chairpersons post is a high-stakes affair, with four seasoned football administrators throwing their hats into the ring. These include former Dynamos chairman and current Simba Bhora official Isaiah Mupfurutsa, Masimba Chihowa of Manica Diamonds, Dumisani Siwale of FC Platinum, and Leonard Musariri of Ngezi Platinum.\n\nIn a rare development, Highlanders chairman Kenneth Mhlophe is running unopposed and will automatically assume the position of vice-chairperson of the PSL board.\n\nAnalysts believe the outcome of the elections will have far-reaching implications for the game in Zimbabwe, especially at a time when the Premier Soccer League faces pressure to reform and modernize.\n\nThis is more than just a football electionits a power struggle for the soul of the domestic game, said a football insider. Each candidate represents a different approach to administration, and the choices made on Friday could either steady the ship or deepen the leadership crisis.\n\nWith no clear frontrunner and competing club loyalties in play, Fridays elections promise to be a tense and potentially transformative moment in Zimbabwean football.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dr Trywell Muzerengi\n\nDeworming is a vital component of livestock and poultry management, yet it is often overlooked by many farmers. Understanding the importance of controlling internal parasites is key to improving animal health, productivity, and profitability.\n\nInternal parasites such as worms compete with animals for nutrients. When animals are infested, the feed provided ends up benefiting the parasites more than the animals themselves. This leads to poor growth, reduced production, and in severe cases, death.\n\nSo why do we deworm our animals and poultry?The primary reason is to control internal parasites so that animals and birds can fully utilise the feed given to them. A well-fed animal with a parasite-free gut is healthier, grows faster, and produces better milk, meat, or eggs.\n\nHow Often Should Deworming Be Done?\n\nEach animal species requires deworming at specific intervals:\n\nCattle should be dewormed twice a year  once before the rainy season and again after the rainy season.\n\nPigs need to be dewormed every three months, or soon after weaning from the sows.\n\nGoats should be dewormed every three months.\n\nChickens also require deworming every three months to prevent parasite build-up in the flock.\n\nImportant Tips for Effective Deworming\n\nAlways use broad-spectrum dewormers that can control all types of internal parasites, not just selective ones.\n\nRotate deworming drugs occasionally to prevent resistance.\n\nMaintain good hygiene and proper feeding practices to reduce the risk of re-infestation.\n\nBy keeping animals parasite-free, farmers not only improve the welfare of their livestock and poultry but also enhance their overall farm productivity. Regular deworming is a simple, cost-effective practice that pays big dividends in animal performance and farmer income.\n\nInstagram: lasmuzagro1\n\nLinkedIn: Lasmuz Agro\n\n[emailprotected]\n\n",

Mathematics and Physics are universal languages. Changing the medium of instruction wont help learners grasp the conceptsit will only confuse them further.\n\nThe educationist said emphasis should be placed on better teaching tools and qualified personnel, rather than experimenting with language shifts in technical fields.\n\nIf learners are struggling, the answer is not to change the language of the formulas. Instead, we must improve teacher training and invest in learning materials. You dont fix comprehension issues by altering the mediumyou improve capacity.\n\nCritics also argue that shifting technical education to local languages risks isolating Zimbabwean learners from global academic and scientific communities, where English remains the dominant language of instruction and research.\n\nThe government has yet to issue a public statement clarifying the scope or implementation plan for the proposal.\n\n",
