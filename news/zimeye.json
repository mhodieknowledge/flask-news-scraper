            "content": "By A Correspondent Vice President Constantino Chiwenga has assumed the role of Acting President following President Emmerson Mnangagwas trip to Eswatini, where he is officiating at the Kingdoms 57th International Trade Fair and attending the Umhlanga Reed Dance ceremony.\n\nMnangagwa, who arrived in Eswatini over the weekend, used the visit to strengthen bilateral ties, stressing the importance of cooperation in agriculture, tourism, trade, education, science, innovation, and technology. He also encouraged Eswatinis citizens to visit and invest in Zimbabwe, reiterating his now-familiar mantra:Zimbabwe is open for business.\n\nThe President further called on Africans to take pride in their heritage and to push for reforms in global institutions such as the United Nations, while thanking Eswatini for its consistent support in calling for the removal of Western sanctions on Zimbabwe. King Mswati III, in turn, applauded Zimbabwes Vision 2030 and development initiatives, promising that Eswatini would learn from Zimbabwes experiences.\n\nAlthough Mnangagwas trip is an ordinary diplomatic assignment, Chiwengas assumption of presidential powers rekindles memories of Zimbabwes unresolved succession battles within Zanu PF. The ruling party has been plagued by factionalism for over two decades, largely rooted in the question of who should lead after long-serving figures.\n\nDuring Robert Mugabes final years, Zanu PF was split between theLacoste faction, loyal to Mnangagwa, and theG40 faction, fronted by Grace Mugabe and younger party elites. That power struggle culminated in the 2017 military coup, which saw Chiwengathen commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forcesplaying a decisive role in removing Mugabe and installing Mnangagwa as President.\n\nChiwenga, widely seen as the kingmaker of 2017, was initially regarded as the natural successor to Mnangagwa. However, once in power, Mnangagwa consolidated control by sidelining military influence in politics and strengthening his civilian allies. This created an undercurrent of mistrust between the two leaders.\n\nThe unresolved tension resurfaced in the lead-up to the 2023 elections, when whispers of succession battles began to circulate again. Reports suggested that Chiwengas military-backed faction still harbored ambitions of taking over the presidency, while Mnangagwa moved to amend party and national constitutions to potentially extend his stay in power beyond 2028.\n\nThough routine, every instance of Chiwenga stepping in as Acting President is viewed through the lens of Zanu PFs succession politics. His assumption of authority underscores the delicate balance within the ruling party, where leadership transitions remain a source of anxiety and intrigue.\n\nFor many Zimbabweans, the unresolved rivalry between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga represents the continuation of a decades-long pattern: leadership struggles within Zanu PF overshadowing the pressing national crises of economic decline, unemployment, and political repression\n\n",

            "content": "By Dr. Masimba Mavaza |  As we remember the African icon, Cde Robert Mugabe, we must also acknowledge the team that worked alongside him. It is impossible to speak of Mugabe without mentioning Cde Innocent D. Tizora, a man who tirelessly served behind the scenes.\n\nInnocent Dzapasi Tizora, a Zimbabwean politician, was the former Principal Director of State Residences. He was relieved of his duties in January 2018 by President Emmerson Mnangagwa and succeeded by Douglas Tapfuma, a Midlands Central Committee member in the ZANU-PF party. Such was the weight of Tizoras position that his departure unsettled State House, as many of his predecessors had been dismissed, with some even arrested and imprisoned. Tizora dedicated himself fully to both government and country. During the September 2018 reshuffle, he was reassigned by President Mnangagwa.\n\nCde Tizora attended Kutama Mission School. As a senior staffer in the Presidents Office, he managed state residences under the Mugabe administration and was listed under the thematic group Senior Civil Servants. Though the nation may be quick to forget him, Tizora remains one of the finest Principal Directors to have ever served at State House.\n\nHowever, today, our focus is on the icon himselfCde Robert Mugabe.\n\nThe blood of Zimbabwes heroes flows beneath our freedom, reminding us that every celebration and every fruit of liberty was watered by their sacrifice. This legacy will fade if we fail to remind one another. It is our duty to keep alive the memory of those who secured our independence.\n\nRobert Mugabe (19242019), leader of Zimbabwe from independence in 1980, was one of Africas longest-serving and most admired figures in the earlier part of his rule. Trained as a teacher, he taught at several schools before moving to Ghana, where he furthered his profession and met the beloved First Lady, Sally Mugabe.\n\nHe endured 11 years as a political prisoner under Ian Smiths Rhodesian regime before escaping Zimbabwe in a bread truck driven by Moven Mahachilater Minister of Defencewho tragically died in a car accident in Nyanga. With the help of Cde Sekuru Rekai Tangwena Simboti, Mugabe entered Mozambique through Nyanga, soon becoming leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). He played a crucial role in the 1979 Lancaster House Agreement, which paved the way for Zimbabwes independence.\n\nMugabe became the countrys first elected Prime Minister and later President. He initially promoted reconciliation with the white minority and unity among liberation comrades. He was the third Prime Minister of the countryafter Ian Smith of Rhodesia and Bishop Abel Muzorewa of Zimbabwe Rhodesiaand the second President of independent Zimbabwe, following Canaan Sodhindo Banana.\n\nMugabe spearheaded the controversial land redistribution program, aimed at empowering black Zimbabweans by taking land from commercial farmers. This policy drew economic sanctions from the West. Despite mounting pressure, Mugabe agreed to a power-sharing deal with the opposition in the 2000s, later describing the period as disastrous. He ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years until stepping down in 2017.\n\nBorn on February 21, 1924, at Katuma Mission (now Zvimba), Mugabe was the son of Gabriel Matibili, a carpenter from Nyasaland (now Malawi), and Bona, a Shona woman. After graduating from St. Francis Xavier College in 1945, he spent 15 years teaching in Rhodesia and Ghana, while also pursuing studies at Fort Hare University in South Africa. In Ghana, he married Sally Hayfron, his first wife.\n\nIn 1960, Mugabe joined the pro-independence National Democratic Party as publicity secretary. After its ban, the party re-formed as the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU). Mugabe, however, left in 1963 to co-found ZANU, which became his lifelong political home.\n\nWhen ZANU was banned in 1964, Mugabe was imprisoned. While incarcerated, he earned several degrees by correspondence and educated fellow inmates. Upon his release in 1974, he went into exile in Zambia and Mozambique, where he consolidated control of ZANUs political and military structures.\n\nThe Lancaster House Agreement of 1979 secured independence. After ZANUs electoral victory in 1980, Mugabe extended a hand of reconciliation to the white minority. However, tensions with ZAPU escalated, leading to violent conflict in Matabeleland between 1982 and 1987. Thousands of civilians were killed by Mugabes North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade. Yet, peace was eventually restored through the Unity Accord, merging ZANU and ZAPU into ZANU-PF.\n\nIn the 1990s, Mugabe was reelected twice. Following Sallys death, he married Grace Mugabe. In 1998, he deployed troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo, seeking to resist neo-colonialism.\n\nIn 2000, he held a referendum to expand presidential powers and legalize land seizures. For the first time, he was defeated. Soon after, the MDC was formed, and land invasions accelerated, causing economic collapse and hyperinflation.\n\nIn 2008, after losing the parliamentary majority, Mugabe was forced into a unity government with MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai. In 2017, he resigned under pressure from impeachment, succeeded by his longtime ally, Cde Dr. Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nPresident Mugabe passed away on September 6, 2019, at the age of 95.\n\nMugabe gave his life to something greater than himselfour freedom. This nation will remain free only so long as it is the home of the brave. His legacy is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example.\n\nA true hero does not simply order men into battle; he stands among them. Mugabes courage gave meaning to sacrifice. His memory, like the mellow rays of the setting sun, rests tenderly upon our hearts.\n\nOur heroes were real. They breathed, they felt, and they lived in this land we call Zimbabwe. The legacy of Mugabe reminds us of their sacrifice and courage. His name encouraged generations, and his memory will continue to inspire.\n\nHistory is the memory of a people. Without memory, humanity loses its place. Zimbabwe, therefore, has engraved Mugabes nameand those of other heroesdeep in our collective heart. Since his passing, his presence has never truly left us.\n\nCde Robert Gabriel Mugabe will always be missed.\n\n",

            "content": "MASVINGO  When bulldozers rolled into Mushandike, Masvingo province, in early 2024, the life that 42-year-old Esther Mativenga had painstakingly built was reduced to rubble within minutes.\n\nIt is like a thief in the night stole everything, she said, her voice breaking. This was not just a house; it was our future. We poured everything we had into it, believing sabhukus word.\n\nMativengas ordeal is part of a growing national crisis in Zimbabwe: the illegal allocation and sale of land by some traditional leaders  known as sabhukus. From Masvingo to Matabeleland, desperate families are being uprooted, defrauded, and left homeless after buying plots that carry no legal standing.\n\nA Nationwide Pattern of Loss\n\nWhile the Mushandike demolitions grabbed headlines, similar tragedies are playing out across the country:\n\nIn Mushandike, carpenter John Mbava lost a newly built four-room house. They took away more than bricks and mortar. They took away our hope, he said.\n\nIn Seke, 49-year-old Jotamu Ruwona paid nearly US$3 000 per hectare to his sabhuku. He later discovered the allocations were fraudulent and that the proceeds were allegedly shared with local officials as kickbacks.\n\nLegal Reality: No Title Deeds, No Rights\n\nLegal experts stress that these transactions are null from the outset. Lawyer Miriam Tose Majome explains:\n\nCommunal land cannot be sold. Under Section 3 of the Communal Lands Act, all land is vested in the President. Section 8 prohibits any sales or transfers without proper authority. Only rural district councils, after consultation with traditional leaders, can allocate land. Chiefs and headmen have no power to sell.\n\nDespite these provisions, many sabhukus issue stamped letters that mimic official RDC documents, creating a false impression of legitimacy. Some buyers never even receive written proof, only verbal promises after payment.\n\nGovernment Crackdown\n\nAuthorities have moved to stem the crisis. Between January and mid-February 2024, Operation No to Land Barons and Illegal Settlements led to 3 775 arrests, with nearly a thousand convictions.\n\nLands Minister Anxious Masuka warned:\n\nIt is a crime to occupy rural State land without authority. All illegal occupiers should vacate immediately or face prosecution.\n\nLocal Government Minister Daniel Garwe reinforced:\n\nChiefs must follow the Constitution and the Communal Lands Act. No land should be sold through sabhuku deals.\n\nA Crisis Driven by Demand\n\nAnalysts say Zimbabwes acute demand for land around growth points and peri-urban areas is fuelling the illegal trade. Cheap prices, ease of purchase, and lack of awareness make rural and peri-urban families vulnerable.\n\nThe result is haphazard, unplanned settlements  modern houses tucked among traditional huts  destabilising communities and straining local authorities.\n\nFor victims like Mativenga, the governments warnings and arrests bring little comfort.\n\nWe trusted our leaders. Now we have nothing, she said quietly, staring at the rubble that was once her family home.- state media\n\n",

            "content": "Comment By Tobbius Hamunkoyo- LLB| As a lawyer who has taken time to carefully study, understand, and expose the lies surrounding the so-called $11 million saga, I am compelled to set the record straight. The Patriotic Front (PF) and its mouthpieces, including Emmanuel Mwamba, have gone out of their way to distort facts in order to mislead the Zambian people.\n\nThey claim it is impossible to withdraw such an amount from Turkey, but this is nothing more than a smokescreen designed to cover up corruption that unfolded here at home. The Malanji case was never about armored planes carrying sacks of dollars out of Europe. It was about unexplained wealth and suspicious transactions within Zambia, backed by hard evidence presented in our courts by the National Prosecution Authority (NPA).\n\nThe record of evidence is clear. The National Prosecution Authority (NPA) demonstrated that of the US$7.1 million allocated for property purchases in Turkey, only US$1.1 million was accounted for, while US$4.6 million vanished into unexplained withdrawals, where did it go?. Soon after his return, Joseph Malanji began making massive deposits into Zambian banks.In October 2020, he deposited K10 million in K2 million tranches. In December 2020, he casually walked into the bank with US$204,500 and US$100,000 in cash. By March 2021, he was depositing US$100,000 at a time, and on 31 December 2020, he purchased houses in Silverest Gardens worth US$50,000, paid entirely in cash. These were not theoretical transfers, they were concrete domestic transactions and Emmanuel Mwamba is aware about this despite hiding behind a lot of PF pages to distort the truth.\n\nThe investigations further revealed the quick conversion of these funds into luxury assets. Malanji acquired two helicopters, a Bell 430 and a Bell 206, both traced, frozen, and eventually repatriated to Zambia as proceeds of crime. Several properties purchased under suspicious circumstances were also seized. These are not the figments of PFs imagination or Mwambas propaganda; they are material assets, identified, recovered, and presented before court of competent jurisdiction as part of the prosecutions case.\n\nPFs $11 million lie narrative deliberately omits one key fact, government-to-government transfers do exist, but they must strictly comply with the Public Finance Management Act. This is why former Treasury Secretary Fredson Yamba was convicted, for unlawfully authorising transfers to the Turkey mission outside prescribed financial procedures. So yes, governments can transfer money under special circumstances, but not in violation of the law. PFs attempt to use this argument as a shield for corruption is both dishonest and insulting to Zambians.\n\nI repeat, I have taken time, as a lawyer, to examine this case and expose the truth. Emmanuel Mwamba and PF have tried to confuse the people with half-truths and lies as usual, but the facts remain facts. The corruption was here at home, the money was deposited here, the assets were bought here, and the courts acted on evidence, not speculation. Zambians deserve better than leaders who insult their intelligence with diversions. The $11 million diversion is a failed attempt to rewrite history, and the truth about Malanjis unexplained wealth cannot be erased.\n\n",
