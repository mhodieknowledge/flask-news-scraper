            "content": "By Mandla Dlamini | As Zimbabwe slowly rolls into the new year we take time to look at those who worked very hard for Zimbabwe in their different ways. It is sad to note tha these undung heroes have worked so hard for their country but they have not been rewarded. This shows us that ZANU PF will never recognise those who hard for it. It is a party which works people and reward those who do not work. In closing this year we look at few people who sacrificed their lives for Zimbabwe and ZANU PF and CCC buy were kicked right in the face.The behaviour of ZANU PF against those who work hard for it exposes Mnangagwas ungrateful character and his discrimination against those who are not from his province.\n\nThis is a lesson to all those who support blindly, some will be gaining and get rewarded while hardworking cadres are completely ignored. On behalf of progressive and hardworking Zimbabweans I would like to say Thank you for all the hard work you put in daily! Know that it is recognized and greatly appreciated by Zimbabwe even though ZANU PF led government will never appreciate or even to say thank you. Thank you for stepping in and saving the day in this difficult times where you have carried the Zimbabwean story. So glad we have you as a Zimbabwean upright men and women. Thanks for being so dedicated and hard-working!Putting your country on the map is an incremental part of your everyday life.A man who has fought so hard for Justice and defending the human rights and yet not recognised by his party the CCC this year is Mr Tawanda Dzvokora. Many people know him as Chief Svosve. Dzvokoras voice has become a pain in the ears of the ruling party. Dzvokora has highlighted the plight of Zimbabweans in any platform. He has singularly taken Mnangagwa to task. Dzvokora has continued to be the lone voice in the wilderness. Unfortunately no one has recognised him for the work he has done. He is our 2025 opposition fighter of the year. It is a pity that even his leader Chamisa jumped the ship and left Dzvokora sinking it.There are many Zimbabweans who have tried to point out the plight of Zimbabweans. Their efforts though not recognised by their country the world has been made aware of the events in Zimbabwe. There some like Advocate Masiye, Masotcha, and many in South Africa. We havesome strong criticsof Mnangagwas regime like Sherpard Yuda, Patson Muzuwa and many others. But we recognise Mr Dzvokora chief Svosve.While we look at the opposition we can not ignore those in ZANU PF who worked very hard for Zimbabwe and for ZANU PF but have not been recognised by their party.The man who worked tooth and nail in defence of his country,and received total abuse from many Zimbabweans abroad and at home is Dr Masimba Mavaza. Successful people in every field are often said to be blessed with talent or even just lucky. But Masimba Mavaza is fearless defender of ZANU PF. While everyone around him is voicing his concerns against Mnangagwa and his government Dr Masimba Mavaza stands for his party ZANU PF. While I must make it clear that I do not like ZANU PF and I am not happy with Mnangagwa Dr Masimba Mavaza will defend ZANU PF with all his power to an extent that you will end up believing him. Dr Mavaza worked harder than the average person can even imagine to defend ZANU PF and Mnangagwa.Mavaza argues with passion for his party. The commitment he shows for his party is beyond comprehension. Mavaza is known forwaking up earlyand working toward a goal while other people are still in bed, and staying later than everyone else too in defense of his country and party. He applied what is calledOld fashioned hard work. To those who are in doubt about what to think about Zimbabwe must know that Mavaza is an inspiration.Dr MASIMBA MAVAZA had prodigious physical gifts. But as his party ignores him it is hard work that made him a legend in debates and in writing. Dr Mavazas defining characteristic isnt his talent, but having the humility to know he had to work constantly to be the defender of his none caring party. Dr Mavaza is an example of how ZANU PF does not care for you no matter how you fight for it.\n\nDr Mavaza must be a frequent consumer of wake ip products to maintain his frenetic schedule. Many people in the Social Media have said Mavaza has graced social media to turn around the party. He writes two articles a day for several online papers. One would think that he is being paid by ZANU PF but no ZANU PF will never recognise you unless you are related to the senior guys.One social media fighter warned Mavaxa that he is being used by the ruthless ZANU PF. While we admire his passion for his country we take his commitment as a warning to all that You support ZANU PF at your risk. Dr Masimba Mavaza ends this year 2024 as our hard worker on ZANU PF side.It is equally important to state that Mavaza, is the most insulted abused and hated person in Zimbabwe and on Social media.He gets all the cyber bullying and yet his party looks the other side. You join ZANU PF at your own risk. Mavaza continues talking to overseas publications even later at night from home and engages in debates. He goes into the office on Sundays and reads emails from his thousands of followers.While Mnangagwa rewards his sons and cronies Dr Mavaza and those Varakashis toil and scratch wounds of poverty for no reward.The irony of all this is that the hard workers are not rewarded the corrupt ones get everything.I will say well done Dr Mavaza and all those who were behind the scenes.2025 has a lot in store. Come out and lead a crusade to have Zimbabwe a better country again.We acknowledge all the journalists who heralded the plight of Zimbabwe and all who are going to do the same in this coming year.\n\nHave a wonderful 2025.\n\n",

            "content": "The Generational Fight for Freedom: Social, Economic, and Political Challenges Across Eras\n\nStory by Prosper Tiringindi, a Human Rights Defender\n\nZimbabwes history has been shaped by two prominent leadersIan Smith and Emmerson Mnangagwawhose governance periods reflect glaring contradictions. While both leaders are credited with infrastructural development, their tenures are also marked by systemic human rights abuses, political oppression, and unaddressed socio-economic inequalities.\n\nIan Smiths Leadership: A Catalyst for Chimurenga\n\nIan Smith served as Prime Minister of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) from 1964 to 1979, leading a white minority government that unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965. His administration prioritized infrastructure development, creating modern road networks, industrial zones, and efficient urban services. However, these advancements primarily benefited the white minority, leaving the black majority in abject poverty.\n\nSocially, Smiths government enforced segregation through oppressive laws that marginalized black communities, limiting access to quality education, healthcare, and land ownership. Economically, policies favored the minority elite while relegating the black population to poorly paid, exploitative labor in agriculture and mining.\n\nPolitically, Smiths regime was notorious for brutal crackdowns on dissent. Freedoms of speech, assembly, and political organization were heavily suppressed. Opposition to the regime, especially from liberation movements like ZANLA and ZIPRA, was met with violence and detentions. Reflecting on this era, Smith infamously remarked, The more we killed, the happier we were.\n\nThe socio-economic and political injustices under Smith became the rallying point for the Chimurenga liberation war. Black Zimbabweans demanded land redistribution, political representation, and socio-economic equity. The wars success in 1980 heralded the end of white minority rule, yet its promises remain unfulfilled for many.\n\nEmmerson Mnangagwas Leadership: The Betrayal of Liberation Ideals\n\nIn 2017, Emmerson Mnangagwa ascended to power following Robert Mugabes resignation. Touted as a reformer, his presidency initially inspired hope. However, his administration has since faced allegations of corruption, economic mismanagement, and human rights abuses, echoing the authoritarian tendencies of his predecessors.\n\nSocially, Mnangagwas government has failed to address the enduring inequalities inherited from colonial rule. Healthcare and education systems are in decline, with ordinary citizens bearing the brunt of economic hardships. The promise of land redistribution has been marred by corruption, with political elites capturing the best agricultural land.\n\nEconomically, Mnangagwas tenure has been characterized by hyperinflation, currency instability, and high unemployment rates. Despite promises to attract investment, widespread corruption and mismanagement have deterred economic growth. Essential services like water, electricity, and sanitation remain inaccessible to many.\n\nPolitically, Mnangagwa has cracked down on opposition parties, activists, and journalists. Freedom of assembly and speech remains restricted, with protesters frequently arrested or subjected to violence. In March 2024, the United States sanctioned Mnangagwa under the Global Magnitsky program for corruption and human rights abuses.\n\nGenerational Demands: Then and Now\n\nThe demands of the Chimurenga generationland, freedom, and equityresonate with the struggles of todays youth. However, the current generation also grapples with additional challenges:\n\nUnemployment and Poverty: Zimbabwes youth face limited job opportunities, driving many into informal work or migration.\n\nCorruption: Public resources are siphoned off by political elites, denying citizens access to essential services.\n\nLack of Political Voice: State surveillance and repression stifle activism and political participation.\n\nDespite the differences in context, the fight remains the same: an equitable society where citizens enjoy social, economic, and political rights.\n\nAnalysis: Infrastructure Without Rights Is Futile\n\nBoth Ian Smith and Emmerson Mnangagwa presided over periods where infrastructure development was undermined by systemic oppression. Under Smith, infrastructure served a racial minority, fueling the liberation struggle. Under Mnangagwa, infrastructural promises are overshadowed by corruption and repression, leaving the majority in despair.\n\nAs Prosper Tiringindi, a human rights defender, asserts: Infrastructure development is meaningless if citizens are deprived of basic rights. A society cannot thrive under oppression, regardless of its physical advancements.\n\nThe generational fight for freedom in Zimbabwe is far from over, as the current leadership has yet to fulfill the promises of the liberation struggle. The call for justice, equity, and accountability echoes across decades, uniting past and present generations in their quest for a better future.\n\n",

Mliswa, who was recently disqualified from the ZIFA presidential elections, claimed that powerful cartels are using the ZIFA elections as a platform to advance their own interests.\n\nMliswa stated, Its unfortunate that the ZIFA elections have become an arena for cartels to flex their power and influence, redirecting the course of Zimbabwean football for their own benefit.\n\nWhile acknowledging Tagwireis success as a businessman and his potential to be a great sponsor for local teams, Mliswa accused him of misusing his power to manipulate the football sector.\n\nKuda has been an astute businessman and could be a great sponsor, funding and supporting local teams, Mliswa continued. However, he has abused that power to try and influence the entire football sector, using proxies like Magwizi and his company, Sakunda.\n\nMliswa warned that this kind of influence sets a dangerous precedent that could harm the long-term development of Zimbabwean football. He pointed out that while Delta has been involved in local football for years, they have never tried to manipulate the sport for their own private interests or supported specific candidates for office.\n\nKuda Tagwirei is my mzukuru and I will always speak frankly with him, Mliswa added.\n\nThis approach is wrong.
