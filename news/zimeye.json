            "content": "By Business Reporter- Zimbabwes largest retailer, OK Zimbabwe, has shut down five outlets nationwide, citing a harsh trading environment and mounting financial pressures.\n\nThe closures come just weeks after rival retailer N Richards shuttered two stores in Harare, signalling deepening distress in the formal retail sector.\n\nAt the heart of OK Zimbabwes troubles is its inability to restock, with many of its stores running out of essential food items.\n\nSuppliers, wary of local currency payments and unpaid debts, have cut off credit lines.\n\nThe retailer reportedly owes US$17 million and ZiG537 million in outstanding payments, with some suppliers withholding fresh stock until previous debts are cleared.\n\nIn an internal memo, OK Zimbabwe announced it would shut down Robson Manyika, Glen Norah, Kuwadzana Express, Mbare (all in Harare), Chitungwiza Town Centre, and Entumbane (Bulawayo). Another store is set to close in March 2025.\n\nThe closures will result in job losses, with hundreds of employeesmainly low-level stafffacing retrenchment starting March 31, 2025.\n\nAffected workers have been offered severance packages, including one months salary per year served, three months notice pay, and outstanding leave payments.\n\nHowever, sources say it remains unclear whether employees have accepted these terms.\n\nCompany executives attribute the crisis to Zimbabwes volatile economic environment, particularly its currency challenges.\n\nOK Zimbabwe acquired goods on credit in US dollars but is struggling to settle payments due to cash flow constraints.\n\nThe companys woes were exacerbated by last years currency turmoil, which led to the reintroduction of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency in April.\n\nDespite some stabilization, the retailer has yet to recover.\n\nAnother major challenge is competition from informal traders, who have gained a market advantage by offering lower prices, paying cash in US dollars, and avoiding taxes and regulatory costs.\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) has called on President Emmerson Mnangagwa to intervene, warning that continued closures threaten the survival of the formal retail sector.\n\nFormal businesses are struggling against an unfairly competitive informal sector that does not pay taxes. The government must act, CZR president Denford Mutashu said.\n\nOK Zimbabwe has also tied up capital in land acquisitions for future stores, including sites in Mutoko, Southly Park (Harare), Guruve, Kadoma, and Gwerufunds that could have helped stabilize operations.\n\nCEO Maxen Karombo declined to comment when contacted, requesting questions via email but failing to respond.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Daniel Garwe, has warned that the ruling party will soon take decisive action against war veteran Blessing Geza. During a meeting with civil servants in Masvingo on Thursday, Garwe threatened Geza, saying, Blessing Geza ndiBhoki, saka takurova Bhoki tiwone kuti akatumwa nani. Pane akatuma Bhoki kuti ataure zvisina basa, which translates to Blessing Geza is a puppet, so we will deal with him and see who sent him. Someone is controlling him to speak nonsense.\n\nGeza, who is a war veteran, caused a stir last week when he held a press conference attacking senior ZANU PF and government officials, including President Emmerson Mnangagwa. While Geza did not specify who he referred to as his master, speculation remains about the internal factions within the party.\n\nGarwe made it clear to civil servants and ZANU PF supporters gathered at Masvingo Polytechnic that Geza is being manipulated by someone from within the party. Geza is being controlled by a master, and he is going to be jailed over corruption, Garwe said, reinforcing the governments stance against the war veterans allegations and statements.\n\nAdditionally, Garwe took the opportunity to praise U.S. President Donald Trump for his plan to send back 504 Zimbabweans who are reportedly illegally staying in the USA.\n\nGarwe expressed approval of the move, saying, Let them come back home, and added that these individuals were among those attacking Mnangagwa on social media.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a move that has sparked mixed reactions, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has named a new law school after himself, further solidifying his presence in Zimbabwes political and educational landscape. The E.D. Mnangagwa Law School, currently under construction at Midlands State University, is set to be one of the premier institutions for legal education in the region once completed.\n\nThe project is 65% finished and is expected to be ready by August.\n\nDuring a recent tour of the site, Hon. Ministers Owen Ncube and Jenfan Muswere praised the progress of the development, which will feature four key expansions.\n\nThis is a showcase of the progress we are making under the visionary leadership of President Mnangagwa, said Ncube, highlighting the schools state-of-the-art facilities, including a moot court and a comprehensive library resource center.\n\nThe law school is part of Mnangagwas broader agenda to strengthen Zimbabwes legal education and contribute to the countrys long-term goals, as outlined in Resolution number 1. This is a clear demonstration of our commitment to educational advancement and legal reform, Muswere noted during the tour.\n\nWhile the law school is seen as a positive step forward for Zimbabwes educational infrastructure, some critics argue that naming such a significant institution after himself sends a message that Mnangagwa is unwilling to cede power anytime soon.\n\nHis historical contributions to Zimbabwes legal framework, coupled with the school bearing his name, have led to concerns about the growing centralization of power.\n\n",
