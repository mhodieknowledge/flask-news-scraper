            "content": "ByShowbiz Reporter-Veteran bassist Clancy Mbirimi has  died.\n\nThe news of Mbirimis death was first announced on socil media by famous music producer Clive Mono Mukundu.\n\nHis death is a painful loss to the countrys cultural landscape and a stark reminder of how quickly our musical giants are disappearing.\n\nMbirimi was one of Zimbabwes longest-serving and most respected musicians, known for his calm demeanour, deep musical knowledge, and unmatched command of the bass guitar.\n\nA stalwart of the golden era of Zimbabwean music, Mbirimis career spanned decades, during which he played in and collaborated with several iconic bands, including the legendaryHarare Mambos.\n\nFormed in the early 1970s, the Harare Mambos were one of the most influential bands of post-independence Zimbabwe, renowned for their jazz-infused Afro-pop sound and crisp arrangements.\n\nLed by the charismatic vocalist and guitarist Green Jangano, the groups music became a fixture on local radio and in live venues across the country.\n\nClancy Mbirimis melodic and rhythmic basslines were central to the groups sound, giving groove and depth to timeless songs that blended township jazz, rhumba, and traditional Zimbabwean sounds.\n\nMbirimi also had a long-standing musical relationship with Steve Dhongi Makoni, one of Zimbabwes most loved musical humorists and acoustic storytellers.\n\nTheir collaboration went beyond stage performances, Mbirimi provided musical direction and bass accompaniment for many of Makonis performances and studio recordings.\n\nTheir synergy was a joy to behold, with Clancys musical sensitivity perfectly complementing Steves sharp wit and lyrical prowess.\n\nAside from performing, Mbirimi was also a music producer who worked with various record labels, contributing to the growth and development of emerging Zimbabwean talent. He played a behind-the-scenes but pivotal role in the careers of many musicians.\n\nMono Mukundu posted: In my book,Following the Melody, I recount on page 145 how Clancy was the first to notice my production potential.\n\nHe encouraged veteran producer Elias Msakwa to consider me for a role as a music produceran opportunity that proved to be a turning point in my life. I owe him a great deal.\n\nWe also collaborated on several music projects over the years, and in 1999, Clancy and I were part of theRevival Ministries Praise and Worship Team, where his basslines once again anchored soulful worship sessions that moved congregations deeply.\n\nClancy Mbirimis death is more than the passing of a musicianit is the burning down of a wealthy library of Zimbabwean musical memory and knowledge. He was a gentle giant whose quiet contributions helped shape the sound of generations.\n\nMay his soul rest in eternal peace.\n\n",

            "content": "ByA CorrespondentZanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa and his wife, Womens Affairs Minister Monica Mutsvangwa, have suffered a significant political setback after their preferred candidate, Mercy Sacco, lost for the second time in the race for the Manicaland Womens League chair.\n\nDorothy Mabika, backed by Womens League boss Mabel Chinomona, secured a decisive victory in the rerun held in Mutare on Sunday, garnering 23 votes against Saccos 16. The result has been hailed as a win for Chinomonas faction and a major blow to the Mutsvangwasparticularly Monica, who had personally lobbied for Saccos candidacy.\n\nZanu PF National Political Commissar Munyaradzi Machacha, who presided over the election, declared it peaceful and successful, with the outcome now awaiting Politburo endorsement. Mabika pledged to work for unity and womens empowerment, while observers noted her triumph was also symbolic of deeper shifts in party power dynamics.\n\nThe election was a repeat of the April 6 vote, which had already seen Mabika trounce Sacco in a reported 291 landslide. That outcome was later nullified under pressure from the Mutsvangwa-aligned camp, triggering Sundays rerun. Despite these efforts, Mabika prevailed againthis time under stricter party oversight.\n\nA confirmation memo from Chinomonacopied to top officials including Secretary-General Obert Mpofu and the defeated Saccohas since formalised Mabikas appointment as the substantive chairwoman for the province.\n\nThis double loss underscores the waning influence of the Mutsvangwas in Manicaland, a province once considered one of their key strongholds. Also hit hard by the defeat is Zanu PFs legal affairs secretary and Mutsvangwa ally,Patrick Chinamasa, who had reportedly backed Sacco behind the scenes.\n\nReacting to the initial outcome, Christopher Mutsvangwa launched an attack on Information Minister Jenfan Muswere, accusing him of announcing Mabikas initial win prematurely and violating party protocol. In a furious letter, then, Mutsvangwa complained that only his office had the authority to speak for the partyexposing his desperation to control the narrative.\n\nBut insiders say the outrage masked a more personal defeat: a collapse of the Mutsvangwa factions grip in a critical province ahead of Zanu PFs next elective congress. This is less about procedure and more about the politics of survival, a senior party official said. The Mutsvangwas have been outmaneuvered.\n\n",

According to the group, the initiative spans all 10 provinces and is meant to support small traders.\n\nThis milestone will boost informal businesses, drive economic growth, and empower vendors to build a brighter future for their families and communities, read a post from Varakashi4ED.\n\nBut observers and analysts are not buying it.\n\nThis is clearly a political stunt, said a political analyst based in Bulawayo. You dont address years of neglect with a sudden cash splash unless your true motive is votes, not empowerment.\n\nMany citizens see the timing of the payoutmonths before anticipated electionsas suspect. With the informal sector long ignored in budget allocations, the abrupt handout has left many questioning whether the funds serve the people or the ruling partys survival.\n\nTheyve ignored us all along, said a vendor in Chitungwiza. Now that elections are near, they show up with money? Its not about us, its about their power.\n\nCritics argue that real support would involve legal recognition, access to credit, market infrastructure, and protection from police harassmentnot sporadic, pre-election windfalls.\n\nWhile the US$200,000 may bring short-term relief to some traders, it has reignited accusations that Mnangagwas administration is using state resources to secure political loyalty, rather than developing lasting solutions for Zimbabwes economic woes.\n\n",

The discovery has raised more questions than answers, with some community members expressing doubt over whether Yingi took his own life or if foul play may have been involved.\n\nIts hard to believe he would just take his life over an affair, said one local resident who requested anonymity. Theres more to this story than were being told.\n\nPolice have not yet released an official statement regarding the cause of death, and investigations are reportedly ongoing.\n\nYingis death has cast a dark cloud over the local Zanu PF structures, where he was known as a loyal party cadre and community mobilizer. Local leaders have called for calm and urged residents to allow the police to conduct a full investigation.\n\nThe community now awaits clarity as speculation continues to swirl over what really happened in the final hours of the former councillors life.\n\n",
