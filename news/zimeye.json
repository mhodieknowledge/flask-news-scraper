            "content": "By A Correspondent| The High court has set free Timothy Chiminya, a traditional leader, who had spent more than one month in prison after he was arrested and charged for allegedly undermining authority of or insulting President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nChiminya, who was arrested by some Zimbabwe Republic Police officers on 16 December 2024 and charged with undermining authority of or insulting the president as defined in section 33(2)(a)(ii), had languished in prison after he was denied bail on Wednesday 8 January 2025 by Harare Magistrate Sheunesu Matova, who ruled that he is a security threat and did not deserve to be released from prison as he had dethroned some traditional leaders, who were installed by President Mnangagwa and that some subjects of the Chiefs, who were removed, were bound to fight the Chiefs, whom he had installed.\n\nThis compelled Chiminyas lawyer Gift Mtisi of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, to file an appeal against Magistrate Matovas decision at Harare High Court on Tuesday 7 January 2025, seeking his release from detention on bail.\n\nOn Friday 31 January 2025, High Court Judge Justice Faith Mushure upheld Chiminyas appeal and set aside Magistrate Matovas decision denying the traditional leader bail.\n\nIn granting bail to Chiminya, Justice Mushure ordered him to pay US$200 or its ZiG equivalent as bail surety and restricted him to a 25 kilometre travel radius from Harare Central Police Station until his matter is finalised.\n\nThe Judge also ordered Chiminya to report twice every week on Mondays and Fridays at Harare Central Police Station until his matter is finalised including surrendering his passport with the Clerk of Court at Harare Magistrates Court.\n\nThe traditional leader was also ordered not to interfere with state witnesses or investigations and to continue residing at his given residential address until his matter gets finalised.\n\nChiminya returns to court on 5 March 2025.\n\n",

            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda-VicePresidentConstantino Chiwenga officially returned to his position as the countrys second-in-command on Wednesday following the return of President Emmerson Mnangagwa from his month-long leave.\n\nChiwenga had been serving as Acting President for the past 10 days, having taken over from his co-deputy, Kembo Mohadi, who held the role for 19 days.\n\nChiwengas brief tenure as Acting President reignited long-standing tensions within Zanu PF, particularly between himself and Mnangagwas loyalists.\n\nOver the years, the rivalry between the two has deepened, dating back to the 2017 coup that ousted Robert Mugabe.\n\nWhile the military played a pivotal role in installing Mnangagwa as President, Chiwenga, then the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) commander, was widely perceived as the real architect of the power shift.\n\nSince then, factional battles within Zanu PF have intensified, with Chiwengas camp angling for succession in2028when Mnangagwais expectedto step down.\n\nDuring his recent stint at the helm, Chiwenga did notshy away from flexinghis political muscle, issuing thinly veiled threats to Mnangagwas inner circle.\n\nAddressing his supporters, he warned Mnangagwas loyalists, whom he derisively referred to asZvigananda(bootlickers), that their time was running out.\n\nHe further suggested that some of them could face jail time when he ascends to the presidency in 2028.\n\nThis bold declaration sent shockwaves through Mnangagwas camp, as itwas perceivedas a direct challenge to the sitting Presidents authority.\n\nDespite the evident friction, Presidential spokesperson George Charamba downplayed any tensions upon Mnangagwas return.\n\nIn his statement, Charamba avoided addressing the political undercurrents, focusinginsteadon economic matters.\n\nThe President is now officially back from his leave, and as you may know, there have been certain economic developments in the past few weeks. Remember, he had to break his leave last week to chair a meeting that focused on economic developments in the country. His major focus will now be on the economy, and some major decisions will be made in that regard, Charamba stated.\n\nMnangagwas return also coincides with his upcoming diplomatic engagements.\n\nHeis setto lead a Southern African Development Community (SADC) delegation to Tanzania later this week for an extraordinary joint meeting with the East African Community (EAC) to discuss the security situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\nWhile these international responsibilities take precedence, analysts argue that Mnangagwa will also have toturn his attention tothe growing rift with Chiwenga and the internal power struggles that could shape Zimbabwes political future.\n\n",

The continued job losses and business closures are a direct result of economic policies that prioritize the satisfaction of foreign institutions over the real needs of Zimbabweans.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncubes obsession with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank is misguided and detrimental to our economic sovereignty. The Bretton Woods institutions have never been the saviors of Afrika; instead, they have systematically trapped us in a cycle of debt, structural adjustment programs (SAPs), and economic stagnation. Their so-called solutions have never worked for Afrika, and they never will because their interests are not aligned with ours.\n\nA Pan-Afrikan Call for Economic Independence\n\nAfrikas liberation struggle was never just about political independenceit was about total economic emancipation. The same revolutionary spirit that drove the land reform program in Zimbabwe must now be applied to economic governance. Just as we reclaimed our land from settler-colonialists, we must now reclaim our economy from foreign manipulation and neo-colonial control.\n\nFor decades, Afrika has been subjected to economic theories that do not take into account the realities of our societies. We have been told to liberalize markets, privatize state assets, and peg our currencies to foreign benchmarksall while our industries collapse, our youth remain unemployed, and our natural resources are looted by foreign corporations.\n\nIt is time to reject these bookish economic theories that serve the interests of global capital while destroying our local economies. We need to shift towards organic, homegrown economic solutions that empower the people, build strong industries, and create sustainable wealth.\n\nA New Economic Path for Zimbabwe and Afrika\n\nInstead of wasting time in endless IMF meetings, Mthuli Ncube should be meeting with local business leaders, industrialists, trade unions, and economic thinkers who understand Zimbabwes realities. Our solutions must be centered on:\n\nConclusion\n\nWe can no longer afford to be dictated to by institutions whose sole purpose is to maintain the economic subjugation of Afrika. Just as we fought for our land, we must now fight for our economic independence. It is time for Zimbabwe and Afrika to chart their own economic destiny, free from the shackles of neo-colonialism and predatory capitalism.\n\nWe call upon the government of Zimbabwe to prioritize the needs of its people over the demands of the IMF and World Bank. Our economic future lies in our own handsnot in boardrooms in Washington or Brussels. We must think Afrikan, act Afrikan, and build Afrikan solutions for Afrikan challenges.\n\nFor a truly independent Zimbabwe, for a sovereign Afrika!\n\nIssued by:Linda Tsungirirai MasariraPresident  Labour Economists and Afrikan Democrats (LEAD)\n\n",
