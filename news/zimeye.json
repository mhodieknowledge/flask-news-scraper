According to Y2K Entertainment, the artist was expected to perform alongside a lineup of top Zimbabwean acts, but he allegedly refused to board his flight despite checking in at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport on April 18.\n\nOrganisers say they were forced to make costly last-minute arrangements to replace the artist, leading to significant financial losses and major disruptions to the event.\n\nIn response, Silent Killer has dismissed the lawsuit and expressed his readiness to defend himself in court, maintaining that he will address the matter through proper legal channels.\n\n",

Im not speaking out because Im bitter about no longer being at the clubI have a good job that provides for my family. What Im bitter about is how the team has been mismanaged under the current leadership.\n\nMonya emphasized that his passion for Dynamos runs deep and that his criticism stems from love for the club. Serving Dynamos came with sacrifices. Some of us are now living with disabilities because of our time on the pitch, and we are still owed money which we havent even demanded backout of respect for the badge.\n\nHe accused Marriott of ignoring warnings and surrounding himself with unsuitable personnel. During my time at the club, I consistently raised concerns about his leadership. I told him that appointing the wrong people for the wrong reasons would destroy the team. Instead of addressing the issues, I was framed and pushed out.\n\nThe former player also took issue with Marriotts alleged hostility towards club legends. The way he mistreats former players makes you question whether he ever truly played for Dynamos. Just look at how he treated Richard Chihoro (MHDSRIP), a man who stood by him for over 40 years. That speaks volumes about his character.\n\nCalling for a new era of openness, he concluded, We want accountability and transparency, not empty promises. Our concerns are legitimate, and we wont be silenced.\n\nDynamos is more than just a teamits family. All we want is to see it evolve, grow, and thrive, not remain trapped in stagnation.\n\n",

            "content": "The Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) has approached the High Court seeking an order declaring some provisions of the Private Voluntary Organisations (PVO) Amendment Act unconstitutional and to have them annulled.\n\nAccording to ZLHR, some of these provisions arbitrarily criminalize legitimate and critical development and human rights activities, while imposing excessive regulations on PVOs.\n\nIn an application filed on May 16, ZLHR contended that the PVO Amendment Act, which was enacted and published in the Government Gazette on April 11, 2025, represents a significant infringement on the rights of its members, as the organization is an independent entity established by law.\n\nZLHR opines that the impugned amendments contained in the PVO Amendment Act constitute unconstitutional over-regulation, over legislation and criminalisation of innocent important charitable, developmental and human rights work.\n\nThe organisation further argues that the PVO Amendment Act violates various constitutional rights, including the freedom of assembly and association outlined in section 58(1), freedom of expression under section 61, the right to administrative justice guaranteed by sections 68(1) and (2), the right to a fair hearing protected by section 69(1), (2), and (3), and section 71, which safeguards property rights. ZLHR also claims that the problematic provisions of the PVO Amendment Act are vague, poorly drafted, and grant arbitrary powers, resulting in over-regulation of PVOs.\n\nThe PVO Amendment Act centralises arbitrary power in the hands of the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare and the Registrars office, leading to excessive executive interference in the internal operations of PVOs, the organisation said in its application.\n\nIt said these provisions effectively empower the Executive to control PVOs and deregister those deemed undesirable on unclear grounds.\n\nIn light of these concerns, ZLHR seeks a High Court order of constitutional invalidity for sections 4, 5 as read with section 9(5), sections 6, 13A, 14, and 21 of the Private Voluntary Organisations Act (as amended by the PVO Amendment Act) to be declared ultra vires the Constitution and subsequently set aside.\n\nThe order will be subject to confirmation by the Constitutional Court in accordance with section 175(1) of the Constitution, and that any constitutional invalidity ruling issued will be suspended for 12 months following confirmation by the Constitutional Court to allow the respondents time to amend the contested legislation for constitutional compliance.\n\n",
