He shared:\n\nOn April 15, 2024, I contacted the University of Alberta once again, two years after my initial request to have Nigeria added to the list of countries exempted from the English language test. While Nigeria was eventually included on that list, I used the opportunity to advocate for the addition of Ghana, Zimbabwe, and other English-speaking African countries. I am happy to see that Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Kenya have now been added to the list of countries exempt from the English proficiency test at the University of Alberta.\n\nDr. Igbalajobi also thanked colleagues, including Elmond Bandauko from Zimbabwe, for their support in the advocacy that began in 2022.\n\nThe University of Alberta lists Zimbabwe as an under-recognized English-speaking country for graduate admissions. According to the universitys official page:\n\nApplicants from these countries are exempt from providing further English language proficiency documentation.\n\nFor details, visitUniversityofAlbertaAdmissions.\n\nZimbabwes recognitionon this listhighlights the nations long-standing tradition of prioritizing education, even amid economic and political challenges. The country boasts one of the highest literacy rates in Africa, a legacy of its post-independence emphasis on universal education.\n\nZimbabweans academic performance internationally reflects this resilience and commitment to education.\n\nThe exemption marks a milestone for Zimbabwean students aspiring to pursue higher education in Canada, removing a significant barrier and validating their educational foundation.\n\nZimEye\n\n",

            "content": "Very well. Good evening. We are now live from the official page of Venncio Mondlane. I hope the lighting and sound conditions are perfect for you at home watching this program. But surely, many of you were caught off guard, by surprise. So, I would like everyone connected to this page at the moment to share it with at least 30 people, 30 groups, 30 relatives, 30 friends, or 30 colleagues. And especially share it in groups. We have many groups out there, especially WhatsApp groups, which are very common these days, as well as Facebook, Instagram, and Hex (Twitter) groups. Share it via email, regular messagesthere are many ways for more people to follow this live session.\n\nVery well. What are we going to do? Well, if youve just joined, youre now on the official page of Venans and Molhar, the largest Facebook page of a politician from the Portuguese-speaking African countries (PALOP). So youre on the right page, the right platform, to have a little conversation today. This will be a very short live session because I will announce today when the real live session will take place.\n\nAlright, production, do we have comments already? How many people are live with us right now? Approximately 30,000? Wow! In such a short time, we already have 15,000 people live. Very well. Since todays live session is very short, lets go straight to the point.\n\nFor those of you just connecting now, I ask that you share this live link with at least 30 people, 30 groups, 30 friends, colleagues, or relatives. Okay? May God bless Mozambique, bless each Mozambican, and let the great light that God promised to bring to Mozambique shine brightly, turning this nation into a great one. We thank and praise the Lord. Amen.\n\nFriends, what do we have today? First, if youll allow me, I want to deeply thank the Mozambicans who have been out on the streets demonstrating since Monday, clearly showing that they remain firm and determined in standing for electoral truth, justice, and integrity. They represent the true Mozambiquenot a fake Mozambique, not a copied Mozambique, but the original and genuine Mozambique we all dream of for the future. I extend my deep solidarity, open heart, and a strong embrace to those on the streets.\n\nTo all the families who lost loved oneschildren, parentsbrutally massacred by the Rapid Intervention Unit (UIR) or the Defense and Security Forces, I send a heartfelt embrace. Today, we witnessed an inaugurationnot of the elected candidate but of the one appointed by the Constitutional Councilwhich was nothing short of a theatrical performance, a circus-like spectacle. It was supposed to be open to the public, but it was completely militarized, with police aggression against women, including my mother, who was brutally attacked by the UIR today.\n\nThe images are now going viral worldwide, showing incredible brutality. This is not the kind of country we want for our future. We are fighting for a peaceful, honest, and just Mozambiquea nation where the police protect rather than oppress, educate rather than kill. This is the Mozambique we aspire to leave for our children and grandchildren.\n\nThe inauguration of the Constitutional Councils appointee felt more like a funeral at a cemetery than a festive celebration. Everything was militarized, closed off, and filled with fear and threats. In stark contrast, when I was inaugurated on January 9, it was in an open, public space, close to the people, celebrating with everyone freely. What we witnessed today was a sad, restricted, and oppressive event.\n\nHowever, today, I mainly wanted to share with you that Ive gained a new student. My career as a teacher has proven successful. Listening to the governance plans of this police-appointed candidate, I realized that 95% of his measures are copied from my campaign proposalsideas he plagiarized, down to the punctuation. Yet, none of my anti-corruption measures were included. This proves that he plans to maintain the same fraudulent system, starting with a Constitutional Council that international observers have already deemed illegitimate.\n\nWe are now faced with a government led by someone who cannot form a sentence without reading from notes, a government built on imitation and fraud.\n\nDespite this, on Friday at 3 PM, I will host a live session on this page to outline governance measures for the first 100 days of my elected mandate. These measures will guide both the public and private sectors and show the path Mozambique must follow. I encourage everyone to join this session. Even the candidate inaugurated today should take notes.\n\nThank you to all Mozambicans. May Gods blessings embrace our nation. See you on Friday at 3 PM on the official page and YouTube channel of Venncia Mouro. A warm hug to all. Goodbye!\n\n",

            "content": "By Farai D Hove |In a development that further confirms long-standing suspicions that Sengezo Tshabangu has always been an undercover agent for ZANU PF, Zimbabwes state-ownedHeraldnewspaper has bestowed upon him the title of Leader of the Opposition. This extraordinary move has left opposition supporters outraged and questioning Tshabangus loyalties, given his notorious history of covering up election-related violence and murders orchestrated by President Emmerson Mnangagwas regime.\n\nTshabangus ZANU PF Ties Exposed\n\nTshabangus controversial role as Mnangagwas loyal operative dates back to 2008, during Zimbabwes blood-stained election period. He has been implicated in concealing the regimes brutal post-election violence, including incidents where Mnangagwa himself admitted deploying soldiers to crush dissent and alter election outcomes.\n\nOne of the most damning incidents occurred on December 4, 2023, when investigative journalist Simba Chikanza caught Tshabangu red-handed at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, allegedly orchestrating a cover-up operation for ZANU PF following the murder of Bishop Tapfumaneyi Masaya. This brazen act reinforced what many had long suspected: Tshabangu was not merely a ZANU PF collaborator but a key player in protecting the regime from accountability for its atrocities.\n\nHeralds Unprecedented Move\n\nIn its article, theHeraldportrayed Tshabangu as a bridge-builder, applauding his engagement with ZANU PF as fostering a healthy democracy. The state propaganda mouthpiece conveniently omitted Tshabangus well-documented involvement in shielding Mnangagwa from the fallout of politically motivated killings, instead framing him as a mature opposition leader committed to advancing national development.\n\nTheHeraldeven quoted Tshabangu defending his overt collaboration with Mnangagwa, stating, It is certainly strange reasoning to suggest that an opposition which engages with the ruling party is selling out. This statement has sparked widespread criticism, with opposition activists labeling Tshabangu a Trojan horse in their midst.\n\nTshabangus Loyalty to Mnangagwa: A Long-Running Affair\n\nTshabangus allegiance to Mnangagwa is well-documented. During the 2018 Motlanthe Commission hearings, tasked with investigating post-election violence, Tshabangu delivered a surreal defense of Mnangagwa, describing him as lovely and portraying him as a victim of state conspiracies.\n\nIn 2008, political violence erupted due to disputed elections, and the army and state agents were at the forefront of killing people, Tshabangu said. Yet in 2017, when our lovely Mnangagwa, now the President, was almost killed with ice cream in Gwanda, where were these state agents? President Mnangagwa wants things done professionally; this is why he put this Commission in place.\n\nCritics were quick to point out the absurdity of Tshabangus testimony, given that Mnangagwa himself publicly admitted deploying soldiers to suppress protests, resulting in numerous deaths. Tshabangus remarks were viewed as part of a broader strategy to sanitize the Presidents image while demonizing internal dissent within ZANU PF.\n\nOpposition in Crisis\n\nThe CCC, Zimbabwes main opposition party, now faces a serious credibility crisis with Tshabangu at the center of controversy. While CCC activists accuse him of betraying the partys cause, Tshabangu continues to defend his interactions with Mnangagwas government, claiming they are necessary for national progress.\n\nHowever, many believe Tshabangus collaboration with ZANU PF goes far beyond mere political engagement. From his involvement in election-related violence cover-ups to his role in shaping narratives that absolve Mnangagwa of blame, Tshabangu has consistently acted as an extension of the ruling partys machinery.\n\nA Troubling Legacy\n\nTshabangus elevation by theHeraldunderscores the depth of ZANU PFs infiltration of opposition politics. For years, Tshabangu has shielded Mnangagwas regime from scrutiny, earning his place as a trusted agent within the ruling party. His new title as Leader of the Opposition is seen by many as the culmination of his covert mission to weaken Zimbabwes democratic institutions from within.\n\nAs Zimbabweans process this latest twist, the question remains: how long can Tshabangu continue to masquerade as an opposition figure while serving the interests of ZANU PF? For those who have lost loved ones to political violence, theHeraldsdeclaration is a chilling reminder of the regimes ability to manipulate and subvert even its supposed adversaries.\n\n",

            "content": "Statement on the Motion to Amend Term Limits for Presidential, Parliamentary, and Local Government Officials\n\n15 January 2025As Labour Economists and Afrikan Democrats (LEAD), we have consistently advocated for governance reforms that reflect the unique cultural, historical, and societal realities of Zimbabwe. The proposed motion to amend term limits in the Constitution provides an opportunity to rethink and redefine our governance system to better serve the needs of Zimbabweans and foster an egalitarian society. It is time for us Zimbabweans to have an honest dialogue about governance systems that truly work for us as a nation, free from external impositions.Western democracy, with its emphasis on elections and rigid term limits, is a foreign concept that was imposed on African nations through donor-funded constitutional processes. These processes often fail to capture the aspirations of the people, instead reflecting the interests of external stakeholders and civil society organizations funded by these donors. It is no wonder that these systems have resulted in cycles of political instability, economic stagnation, and societal polarization.Zimbabwe must chart a new path, one that is informed by the principles of Pan-Afrikanism, Afrocentric governance, and inclusive development. Countries such as China, Japan, and Russia have implemented governance systems that prioritize continuity, long-term planning, and cultural relevance. Zimbabwe can and must explore alternatives that work for its people, rather than clinging to systems that do not align with our realities.The Necessity of Public EngagementAny changes to the governance system, including term extensions, must be informed by the will of the people. Public engagement is not merely a formality but a necessity for building trust and ensuring inclusivity. LEAD calls for a national dialogue that engages communities at all levels, rural and urban, youth and elders, workers and entrepreneurs to collectively decide on a governance system that reflects their aspirations.This dialogue should include:Nationwide ConsultationsTown hall meetings, focus groups, and surveys to gather the views of diverse communities.Educational CampaignsInitiatives to inform citizens about the implications of term extensions and alternative governance models.Stakeholder ParticipationInclusion of traditional leaders, religious groups, labor unions, youth organizations, and other civic groups to ensure all voices are heard.A Clear Roadmap for Term ExtensionsIf term extensions are to be considered, they must be part of a broader roadmap that addresses:National Development GoalsClear benchmarks for economic growth, social equity, and infrastructure development linked to extended leadership terms.Checks and BalancesMechanisms to prevent abuse of power, such as periodic performance reviews and citizen oversight bodies.Accountability FrameworksTransparent processes to ensure that extended terms are used to benefit the nation, not entrench individual power.Exploring Alternative Governance SystemsLEAD believes that Zimbabwe can draw inspiration from governance models that prioritize cultural alignment, inclusivity, and long-term development:\n\n",

            "content": "Sports Correspondent\n\nThe Premier League saw several unexpected results over the weekend, with Chelsea and Manchester City being held to draws by Bournemouth and Brentford, respectively.\n\nAt the City Ground, Nottingham Forest secured a hard-fought 1-1 draw against Liverpool, thanks to Chris Woods 13th Premier League goal of the season. Woods impressive form has him just one goal shy of his seasonal best in the competition.\n\nMeanwhile, Chelseas struggles continued as they dropped points for the fifth consecutive time, being held to a 2-2 draw by Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge. Cole Palmers impressive performance was a bright spot for the Blues, as he became the first Chelsea player since Eden Hazard to reach 20 goals and assists in the Premier League in consecutive seasons.\n\nWest Ham United, under new manager Graham Potter, secured a comfortable 3-2 win over Fulham, with the Hammers scoring with both of their first two shots in the Premier League under Potters tenure.\n\nThe biggest upset of the weekend, however, came at the Gtech Community Stadium, where Brentford came from behind to draw 2-2 with reigning champions Manchester City. The result marked the first time this season that City have failed to win consecutive league games.\n\nAs the Premier League season heats up, these unexpected results have thrown the title race wide open, with several teams still in contention.\n\n",
