He believes that de-dollarization is the best route to gain control over monetary policy and drive economic growth.\n\nThe plan to remove the US dollar could lead to market instability, decreased investor confidence, and increased volatility in the stock exchange. The transition could also lead to higher inflation if not managed properly, and Zimbabwe has experienced high inflation in the past.\n\nWhile the governments plan to transition to a domestic monetary system may have good intentions, it is crucial to address the concerns and challenges associated with de-dollarization to avoid potential risks and instability.\n\nThe RBZ needs to refine the timeline and implementation details, build adequate foreign exchange reserves, and ensure policy consistency to make the transition successful.\n\n",

Always a pleasure paying a courtesy call on the President and First Lady.\n\nThe post quickly went viral, with many questioning the purpose of Chivayos visit and whether it involved business, politics, or both.\n\nWhile Chivayo appeared relaxed and upbeat in the photo, the Office of the President of Kenya has not issued any statement on the matter, leaving room for speculation.\n\nPolitical analysts noted that the optics of the meeting could raise eyebrows in both Zimbabwe and Kenya, given Chivayos history of controversial dealings.\n\nFor now, the details of his courtesy call remain a mystery.\n\n",

As a public figure and role model, your actions carry weight far beyond your personal circle. What example are you setting for the young Zimbabwean youths who look up to you? What message are you sending to a nation that takes pride in its ambassadors abroad? What image are you painting of Zimbabwe to the international community?\n\nHe continued:\n\nFurthermore, such cussing insults directed at our President are wholly unacceptable and cannot be condoned under any circumstances. The Office of the President is a symbol of our nations unity, sovereignty, and dignity. To demean it through vulgar language is to undermine the respect that every Zimbabwean should uphold, both at home and abroad. Our country deserves to be represented with honour, discipline, and unwavering patriotism at all times.\n\nJay Israel Senior added:\n\nDear Zimbabweans  never insult the highest office of the land. Themba Gorimbo is a sellout and a puppet of the colonial masters bankrolling him to insult the President and government of Zimbabwe. It is true that I told Themba Gorimbo he will never set foot in Zimbabwe or South Africa as long as he continues his open campaign of vulgar insults against the President of Zimbabwe. This is not a threat, but a stand for the dignity of our Head of State and the lawful order of our nation.\n\nHe further explained:\n\nThemba has, on numerous occasions, used obscene and degrading language to describe the President, a conduct which I have documented and forwarded in full to the relevant authorities. This matter is now in the hands of those empowered to uphold our laws. Let it be known: Zimbabwe has freedom of speech, but not freedom of insults. Section 33 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23] makes it a criminal offence to publicly insult, undermine, or make abusive statements about the President or the office of the President. These provisions exist not to silence political debate, but to safeguard the dignity of our highest office and the sovereignty of our state.\n\nHe continued with a caution to the public:\n\nIf this kind of behaviour is not addressed by the law, it will embolden others to believe that vulgar attacks on our leaders are acceptable. That is how nations lose respect for themselves and for the very institutions that guarantee their stability. To all Zimbabweans: criticism is your right. Insults are a crime. Patriotism means disagreeing with dignity, not dragging your own nations image into the mud for entertainment or foreign applause. The dignity of Zimbabwes President, Government, and sovereignty will be defended without fear or favour, at all costs.\n\nHowever, Gorimbo responded:\n\nThis guy threatened me and my family in and out of Zimbabwe. If anything happens to me or any of my family memberseven a distant cousinyou will be held liable. Now that your threats are received, I take them seriously. Better be informed that even if any of my relatives cough, its on you, as we will be on high alert. I spoke and represented myself, not anybody elses family members.\n\nGorimbo continued:\n\nThe President is pictured with such a human, which raises questions Wonder what kind of pastors these people are.\n\n",

Their reserved arrival stood in stark contrast to the cordial handshakes, smiles, and brief chats that marked the arrivals of other high-profile figures.\n\nFormer Defence Minister Sydney Sekeramayi, ZANU PF stalwart Patrick Chinamasa, Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume, State Security minister Lovemore Matuke, Senate President Mabel Chinomona, National Assembly Speaker Jacob Mudenda, and Zanu PF Harare provincial chairperson Goodwills Masimirembwa were among the many who made the customary rounds to acknowledge colleagues in the VIP section.\n\nTagwirei, a close ally of President Emmerson Mnangagwa and a central figure in various political and business controversies, sat quietly at the far end of the tent, receiving greetings from other officials.\n\nThe incident comes amid swirling political undercurrents within ZANU PF, where factional alignments and succession debates are intensifying ahead of the partys 2027 leadership race. Mutsvangwa is reportedly opposed to the recent elevation of fuel mogul Kudakwashe Tagwirei into the ZANU PF Central Committee  a move widely speculated to be part of President Mnangagwas calculated plan to position Tagwirei as his preferred successor in 2028.\n\n",
