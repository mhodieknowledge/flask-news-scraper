            "content": "By Political Reporter-Disgrantled Former Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) Director-General Happyton Bonyongwe has released a book.\n\nThe Robert Mugabe hitmans project titledOne Among Many: My Contribution to the Zimbabwean Storyhas sparked a heated debate about its intent and authenticity.\n\nBonyongwe,who wasdisplaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa alongside his boss Mugabe in the November 2017 coup, has chosen to tell his side of the story, offering what some describe as an unprecedented glimpse into the inner workings of a regime known for its brutality.\n\nThe book, priced at USD 56steep by Zimbabwean standardshas drawn praise for its depth, candour, and emotional resonance.\n\nAmong the books supporters isMunyaradzi Hwengwere, a media entrepreneur who, in a glowing Facebook post, Monday hailed it as a candid, honest, and balanced narrative.\n\nHwengwere lauded Bonyongwes writing for its childlike innocence and ability to inspire empathy through personal details despite admitting that the early chapters drag.\n\nHowever, his effusive endorsement has raised eyebrows, with some questioning whether it reflects an attempt to rehabilitate the public image of a man who played a central role in the countrys repressive state machinery.\n\nBonyongwes tenure as CIO Director-General coincided with some of the most repressive years in the countrys history.\n\nUnder Mugabes leadership, the CIO was notorious for its role in silencing dissent, often through extrajudicial killings, abductions, and intimidation.\n\nHuman rights groups have long documented the CIOs alleged complicity in political violence, mainly targeting opposition activists and civil society leaders.\n\nCritics argue that Bonyongwe cannot dissociate himself from the atrocities committed by the CIO during his watch.\n\nWhile his memoir isbeing marketedas a candid reflection, sceptics question whether it confronts the agencys dark legacy or skirts responsibility in favour of self-exoneration.\n\nHwengweres lavish praise for Bonyongwes book adds another layer of intrigue.\n\nA former Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) CEO and rumoured CIO operative, Hwengweres endorsement has fueled speculation about a coordinated effort to sanitise the past actions of those linked to Zimbabwes oppressive apparatus.\n\nIs this an honest critique of a literary work, or is it an attempt to rewrite history for a man who has much to answer for? one commentator questioned on social media. Another added, Hwengweres glowing review conveniently ignores the lives destroyed by the CIO under Bonyongwe. This reeks of a PR exercise.\n\nThe books defenders argue that Bonyongwes willingness to share personal struggles and agonies signals a genuine attempt to humanise himself and his experiences.\n\nThey claim his story offers valuable lessons on leadership, resilience, and the complexities of governance in a country as polarised as Zimbabwe.\n\nHowever, detractors counter that the memoirs timing and promotional strategy suggest a calculated move to rehabilitate Bonyongwes image in post-Mugabe Zimbabwe.\n\nAs a former top official in a repressive regime, they argue, Bonyongwe has a vested interest in shaping how history remembers him.\n\nHwengweres suggestion that the book couldbe adaptedinto a movie is not far-fetched.\n\nThe narrativesteeped in power, intrigue, and personal strugglehas all the makings of a political thriller.\n\nYet, the question remains: will it be a balanced portrayal of history or a one-sided tale that glosses over inconvenient truths?\n\n",

Opposition leader Venncio Mondlane, who came second, has called for nationwide demonstrations, deepening the countrys political crisis.\n\nConstitutional Council Addresses Election Complaints\n\nEarlier today, the Constitutional Council, led by President Lucia Ribeiro, addressed the nation to explain delays in validating the election results, citing an overwhelming number of complaints and discrepancies.\n\nThe city of Beira at the moment!Similarly, other cities in Tete are under tension.#MozambiqueElections#MozambiqueProtestspic.twitter.com/zgK1Fll0tr\n\nRibeiro outlined key issues raised during the election, including discrepancies in voter numbers and procedural flaws, which have fueled accusations of fraud. Notably, civil society organizations refused to cooperate fully, citing fears of legitimizing a process they described as compromised.\n\nRibeiro also highlighted an appeal from the opposition Podemos party, which sought to annul diaspora votes in Zimbabwe due to alleged irregularities. The appeal, submitted on November 20, 2024, was rejected by the National Elections Commission (CNE) for lack of evidence and failure to meet procedural requirements.\n\nRomoza Quelimane interprovincial transport terminal, Zambzia province pic.twitter.com/ylTIHXoVp6\n\nRevised Election Results\n\nDespite the controversies, the Constitutional Council officially declared Daniel Chapo the winner, reducing his margin of victory from 71% to 65%. Opposition candidate Venncio Mondlanes share of the vote increased slightly to 24%. The Council attributed these adjustments to ongoing scrutiny of voter data but maintained the legitimacy of the results.\n\nProtests and Unrest\n\nMondlane, currently in exile, has called for a nationwide shutdown and protests against what he described as a deeply compromised election process. On Monday, protesters in Maputo and other cities burned tyres, barricaded roads, and clashed with police, who responded with tear gas.\n\nThe unrest has turned parts of Maputo into ghost towns, with roads empty and businesses shuttered. The protests echo the violent demonstrations that broke out in October when preliminary results were announced, resulting in multiple fatalities.\n\nOpposition and Civil Society Reaction\n\nMondlane continues to allege widespread electoral fraud, calling the results illegitimate. In a weekend social media post, he warned of a new popular uprising if the election outcome was not overturned.\n\nCivil society groups, meanwhile, have maintained a stance of non-cooperation with the electoral process. Observers refused to share reports of the election, citing concerns of being implicated in fraud, further straining the credibility of the outcome.\n\nInternational and Domestic Implications\n\nThe ongoing unrest has raised concerns within the region and among international observers, many of whom have expressed worries about Mozambiques democratic trajectory. The contested election and subsequent protests risk destabilizing the country, with fears of prolonged unrest if a resolution is not reached.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe Constitutional Council has pledged transparency in addressing each complaint and appeal, but the path forward remains fraught with uncertainty. With civil society and the opposition questioning the legitimacy of the process, the government faces mounting pressure to address grievances and restore public trust.\n\nAs the protests continue, Mozambique stands at a critical juncture, with the potential for further violence looming unless meaningful dialogue and reforms are initiated-ZimEye\n\n",

            "content": "Bulawayo, Zimbabwe  Police have issued a stern warning to residents following a tragic case of mob justice in Lobengula suburb that resulted in the death of a man accused of theft. Authorities have arrested two suspects, Advice Dibula (36) and Khulekelani Mhlanga (43), in connection with the incident, which occurred in the early hours of December 21, 2024.\n\nThe deceased, whose identity remains unknown, was allegedly part of a group of four men accused of assaulting and robbing Dibula of his Samsung A23 mobile phone and earphones. The incident escalated when Dibula and Mhlanga retaliated, fatally attacking the alleged thief.\n\nBulawayo deputy police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Nomalanga Msebele urged the public to refrain from taking the law into their own hands, emphasizing the need to report crimes to the nearest police station.\n\nTaking the law into ones hands often leads to tragic outcomes. Criminal matters should be handled by the police to prevent unnecessary loss of life, said Assistant Inspector Msebele in a statement.\n\nDetails of the Incident\n\nAccording to police reports:\n\nThe deceased and his three companions assaulted Dibula and his friends near Lobengula West suburb.\n\nThe group forcibly took Dibulas phone and earphones during the attack.\n\nDibula and Mhlanga retaliated, resulting in severe injuries to the deceased.\n\nThe injured man was taken to Mpilo Hospital, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.\n\nThe suspects were arrested shortly after the incident and remain in police custody.\n\nLegal Context and Case Law on Mob Justice\n\nThis incident highlights the dangers of mob justice, a recurring issue in many communities. The law requires due process and the presumption of innocence for all accused individuals. Below are five key legal precedents emphasizing the illegality of mob justice:\n\n1.S v. Nyirenda (1989)\n\nIn this case, the court condemned mob justice after a group of villagers assaulted a suspected thief, leading to his death. The court ruled that no individual or group has the right to mete out punishment outside the confines of the law.\n\n2.Moyo v. The State (1994)\n\nA group attacked a man they suspected of livestock theft, resulting in severe injuries. The Supreme Court ruled that mob actions undermine the rule of law and emphasized that only the judiciary can administer justice.\n\n3.S v. Chokuda (2001)\n\nThe court convicted individuals involved in a mob beating that led to a suspects death. The judge noted that mob justice not only violates the rights of the accused but also jeopardizes community safety by escalating violence.\n\n4.S v. Banda (2008)\n\nThis case involved the killing of a suspected burglar by neighborhood watch members. The court ruled that even those intending to protect their community must act within the law, stating that vigilantism cannot replace lawful law enforcement.\n\n5.Mutasa v. The State (2017)\n\nIn this case, a mob fatally attacked a suspected thief. The court stressed the need for restraint and urged communities to work with law enforcement rather than resort to extrajudicial measures, describing mob justice as a violation of the fundamental principles of justice.\n\nPolice Appeal to the Public\n\nAssistant Inspector Msebele reiterated the importance of allowing law enforcement to handle criminal matters. We urge residents to remain calm and report any apprehended suspects to the nearest police station. Mob justice only leads to unnecessary tragedies, as witnessed in this case, she said.\n\nThe police are continuing their investigations and have urged anyone with information about the incident or the deceaseds identity to come forward.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nMob justice not only undermines the rule of law but often results in irreversible tragedies. This case serves as a stark reminder of the importance of allowing due process to take its course, as communities work alongside law enforcement to address crime. ZIANA\n\n",

            "content": "Bindura, Zimbabwe  Authorities are investigating a daring armed robbery at a Bindura mine where eight unidentified suspects made away with gold-loaded carbon valued at US $36,000.\n\nThe incident occurred on December 22, 2024, when the suspects, armed with a rifle, attacked a security guard on duty before breaking into the carbon room and stealing eleven 50-kilogram bags of gold-loaded carbon. The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) confirmed the robbery in a statement on X (formerly Twitter), urging anyone with information to report to their nearest police station.\n\nGold-loaded carbon, while appearing unremarkable, is a critical element in the gold extraction process. It is used to trap and hold gold particles from dissolved ore, making it an efficient and cost-effective method of recovering the precious metal. The stolen carbon holds significant value as it contains gold that can be refined into its pure form.\n\nDetails of the Incident\n\nAccording to the ZRP, the suspects executed the heist after overpowering the security guard, leaving them unharmed but shaken. The gang then gained access to the carbon room, where they stole the gold-laden material, which is essential in gold recovery operations.\n\nAuthorities have launched a manhunt for the suspects and are appealing to the public for information. Anyone with information to report at any nearest Police Station, the ZRP stated.\n\nUnderstanding the Value of Gold-Loaded Carbon\n\nGold-loaded carbon is a crucial intermediary in the gold mining process, often utilized in methods like Carbon-in-Leach (CIL) or Carbon-in-Pulp (CIP) to efficiently extract gold from ore. The porous nature of the carbon allows it to capture and hold tiny particles of gold, which can later be recovered and refined.\n\nThe stolen gold-loaded carbon can yield significant quantities of refined gold, making it a lucrative target for criminals.\n\nAppeal to the Public\n\nThe ZRP is calling on individuals with information about the robbery or those who notice suspicious activity related to gold-loaded carbon to come forward. The stolen material, while not immediately recognizable as valuable to the untrained eye, is an essential asset in gold recovery operations.\n\nAuthorities are intensifying their investigation and increasing patrols in mining regions to prevent further incidents of this nature.\n\nThis robbery highlights the growing risks facing mining operations and the critical need for enhanced security measures to protect valuable resources in the sector.- Ziana\n\n",

            "content": "The much-anticipated Winky D DiBigman event held on December 21, 2024, in Birmingham promised a night of electrifying entertainment, and it deliveredthough not without a few areas for improvement. The evening kicked off smoothly, with organized entry lines for VIP and general attendees, efficient security, and ample bars spread across two floors. The DJs set the tone with stellar performances, energizing the crowd before Quonfuzed and the Gaffa himself, Winky D, took center stage.\n\nWhile the crowd was only about 70% capacity, the energy was palpable as fans lit up the floor with phone lights, capturing the legendary artists set that ran from 1:36 AM to 3:33 AM. Yet, beyond the music, this event underscored the recurring challenges faced by Zimbabwean music events in the diaspora.\n\nFrom long bar queues and a lack of female representation among artists and DJs to the absence of innovative stage performances, the event highlighted areas that need urgent attention to keep the music scene fresh and inclusive. Despite these criticisms, the night served as a fitting year-end celebration, driven by Winky Ds unmatched artistry and the dedication of fans and promoters alike.\n\nThis review by Mr Smooth calls on eventorganizers to embrace diversity, elevate stage experiences, and prioritize fan engagement to ensure Zimbabwean music events reach their full potential on the global stage. As Mr. Smooth aptly puts it, We need more inclusivity, creativity, and innovation to truly honor the rich tapestry of Zimbabwean talent.\n\nFULL TEXT: REVIEW OF THE Winky D DiBigman event Birmingham 21/12/24- LIVE REVIEW 23/12/24 7 pm UK TIMEThe event was advertised for 10 PM and doors opened at 10 and all sailed well with security control very good 2 queues one for VIP and the other one normal . The VIP had 2 bars and the downstairs had 3 \n\nDJ was on point on his time and came MC @janief who was on point and replaced by @mc Taliban. There was also if correct about 2 or more DJs . These DJs were on set for set swapping till about or just after 12 am when Qounfuzed came open up and he did his stint followed by another MC dj compo \n\n0136 enter the Gaffa and he woed the crowd song after song till 0333 he left .Generally I can say there was a good crowd but wasnt full maybe 70% full . You can just imagine the Gaffa has his fans as the downstairs floor was full of phone lights for photos.\n\nThe turnout was better and generally a good event mixed ages . A good event to close the year-Good job for promoters advertising more on tick tok and instagram. Also good to know and notice the promoters were good following the timeline as much as they can and was good see a few of them on the floor-\n\nOn vendor for food Heart of Africa and they had food stalls both floors and food  quality and hygiene and customer service is flawless these would recommend if you see them and a variety of different dishes .\n\nMR SMOOTH REVIEW1-Venue was generally clean but toilets and general inside is poor and some lighting was out.2-service at the bar was taking north of 30 minutes waiting as there was only 3 staff on each bar and very busy.3-The flier was not fully informative on who was performing and no timeline on Artists performance-4-Once again no FEMALE line up on artists-DJs and MCs5-no upcoming or local talent involved-6-Winky D is an incredible artist but the event lacked stage excitement and surprise could say compare to the recent Chris Brown was full of innovation- dancing and captivating on fans both on the event or watching-7- lack of meet and greet with fans and seems.an appear disappear act always-Fans needs shown some love back once in a while.\n\nMR SMOOTH RECONMENDATIONS1-advertising has to be done on all platforms and time promoters start coming on the front or someone who can continuously give updates as fans lack information LIVE NOT POSTS !2- on stage -a stage performance manager has to be approved for each event different artist to make it interesting3-Everyone working for an event should do a live engagement with fans so we know you coming this includes artists and am comparing to Chris Brown also 50 cent and Mary J. Bligewho are coming June next year but personally promote all platforms themselves \n\nMy review is that we are regressing and happy fill up our events with Zimbabweans majority one area- I have hardly seen any Ndebele people on our events and the only white Artist I seen is Gemma Griffiths despite that there are loads in ZIM.\n\nThe recycling of same artists is becoming monotonous- abhorrent and boring WE NEED MORE FEMALES AND MORE DIVERSITY ON MCS DJS AS most washed out no diversity and hogging everything not giving any other upcoming a chance to progress aso the people you say are the big guys actually killing our music industry-\n\nOn the other hand despite Mr Smooth supporting all events and real constructive criticism- I WON AN AWARD FOR BEING A MENTAL HEALTH CHAMPION thanks to Zuwa Re. NONE OF THESE PROMOTERS AND THE CREW OF DJS AND MCS CONGRATULATED ME MAYBE JEALOUS OR INNA CULT OF LOYALTY TO HONESTY AND COWBOY PACT \n\nAll I know is my quest for improvement is there and am glad to say some of the promoters now respect what I do yet no credit yet but will not stop but will keep rising-\n\nOn Events  Promoters need to have managers or consultants who advise them as they take everything on their own hence a lot of mistakes/\n\nStall food prices on events are extortionate passed to fans due to promoters charging over 150O for a table so vendors will need recourse their money . An onboard review needs done and capped.\n\nTHANK YOU TO ALL THE FANS WHO CAME TO ATTEND GOD BLESS YOU .\n\nI know am loved and hated but with my experience on events would welcome any promoter or subordinates come do a live with me or can come to their page talk constructively how we need improvement-\n\nToo many events piled on same dates upcoming and no surprise same line up DJs and MCs ALL MALE and ARTISTS line up all MALE \n\nWHERE IZ OUR FEMALE ARTISTS????Yebolady Ipapo SisonkeNtsu MachokotoZimfest LiveLadyzim PageStatus 100 PromotionsChichi MadodaShe Millionaire Ladies Business ExpoIcmf ZimbabweTamy MoyoWinkyD Gaffa FansZimlinkupZimCanada realitiesBusi MhlangaPelagia MutakeChihera Nisha MusaThemba The Honourable Tanyah TsotsiClara and Kate musicTholakele Ruteno NgcoboOur Care Home  Gain Healthcare Vatete YeuBrian Marlon KaswaSheila Bvuurr-GaynorearGROUND AFRICATilder Live ZimZimEyeEzra Tshisa SibandaLatria BluesDJ MelDJ Sanchez africaEmpres TrishaKikky BadassShashlChipaz PromotionsFeli Nandi ChipendoTapiwanache ChdukaAll Zimbabweans in UKKiller T\n\n",

            "content": "AN OPINION\n\nTHIRD TERM AGENDA\n\nBy Reason Wafawarova\n\nThe nefarious claim that there is such a thing as a ZANU PF Bulawayo Conference Resolution endorsing a Third Term for President ED Mnangagwa is playing the fandango dance with facts.\n\nIt is based on a farrago of confusion created by the puerile exuberance of vainglorious verbosity by the likes of Cde Christopher Mutsvangwa and adopted for magnification by isolated political desperados like Supa Mandiwanzira; and this has created a phantasmagoria of conflicting images of an imaginary illusory visionary leader being raucously pushed into office against his will by a mesmerised populace  itself a dreamland illusion around an unassuming President whose departure is most certainly the most awaited for thing ever to happen to Zimbabwean humanity.\n\nCde Mutsvangwa is a sophistical rhetorician often inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity, most of the time drawing at the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument, certainly providing to his listeners more comical entertainment than information.\n\nHe just told us that he was the indisputable arbiter of intellectual excellence at the war rear in Mozambique when he joined in the middle of the armed struggle in 1975, and his academic accolade was dropping out of university to join the village herdboys in fighting down the colonial empire.\n\nLet me not digress. All that happened in Bulawayo is Obert Mpofu calling Goodwills Masimirembwa to greet delegates on behalf of Harare Province. Masimirembwa then added to his slogan 2030 VaMnangagwa vanenge vachipo! The chant was then repeated by provincial chairpersons from Mashonaland East, Mashonaland West, Masvingo, Matebeleland North, Matebeleland South and the Midlands.\n\nIt is this comical sloganeering drama that is being elevated to the level of a conference resolution, clearly taking ordinary ZANU PF members who did not attend the conference for manipulable fools.\n\nThere was no unanimity in Bulawayo, and that is why Patrick Chinamasa cleared the air by saying the matter of a third term did not arise because it essentially was a national referendum matter, not a partisan agenda.\n\nHave a good day fellow Zimbabweans as we watch this foolishly organised choreography celebrated by its inner circle foot soldiers as a complex political strategy  mooted by half drunk half a dozen men at a certain farm in KweKwe some time in 2023.\n\nKwedu Classics\n\nYour story our story\n\nReason Wafawarova\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has made a significant shift in his stance on Robert Mugabes role in Zimbabwes liberation war. Previously, Mnangagwa had downplayed Mugabes contributions, but on Sunday, he acknowledged the late leaders efforts in promoting national unity.\n\nMnangagwas change of heart was evident in his speech commemorating the 37th anniversary of the Unity Accord, a landmark agreement signed by Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo that paved the way for peace, stability, and unity in Zimbabwe. Mnangagwa recognized the significance of this accord, calling it a cornerstone of Zimbabwes national identity and progress .\n\nIn his address, Mnangagwa emphasized the importance of unity, urging Zimbabweans to reject division, tribalism, and self-hate. He also highlighted the governments efforts to translate the principles of unity into tangible progress through grassroots development, land empowerment initiatives, and the pursuit of Vision 2030.\n\nThis shift in Mnangagwas stance may be seen as an attempt to heal old wounds and promote national unity, especially on the anniversary of the Unity Accord.\n\n",
