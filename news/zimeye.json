            "content": "By Dr Masimba Mavaza | ZANU PF is currently navigating a tumultuous period, marked by internal power struggles and controversies. The partys future hangs in the balance, with several factors influencing its trajectory. This is not the first time internal squabbles have threatened to tear the party apart.\n\nThe key challenges and dynamics in the party can be overcome. However, the situation on the ground is creating factional tensions. There is a notable rift between President Emmerson Mnangagwa and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, with disagreements over issues such as corruption and the role of influential businesspeople (zvigananda). People are asking: how can the party be set against itself by people flashing money? This has sparked unprecedented interest in Zimbabwean politics from the international community. The dogs are coming out, and party faithfuls are asking: Who let the dogs out?\n\nAt the centre of this tension is the question of leadership and succession. Questions surround President Mnangagwas potential term extension beyond 2028, with some party members pushing for a 2030 agendasparking debates about succession and leadership.\n\nCorruption and business influence have added fuel to the already raging fire. Controversies involve business figures such as Kudakwashe Tagwirei and Wicknell Chivayo, with accusations of using wealth and political connections to influence party dynamics. The streets are abuzz with questions like: Why is Chivayo given public access to presidential phones? Are our national secrets safe in the hands of Chivayo, who publicly boasts that akachibata kuti dzvi?\n\nThe party spokespersons position has not been very clear and resembles a water fountain giving hot and cold water at once. ZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa has criticized Chiwengas stance on certain businesspeople, framing it as a distraction from the partys empowerment initiatives and economic successes. Mutsvangwa emphasizes the partys democratic processes and the upcoming congress in 2027 as pivotal for determining leadershipeffectively telling Vice President Chiwenga to wait for the congress. His words bring back memories of President Mugabe telling President Mnangagwa to wait for the congress. This was not to be.\n\nLooking at the situation on the ground, an uncertain outlook emerges. Given these internal conflicts and external pressures, ZANU PFs future is unclear. Yet the party is strong and has faced many crises before. In fact, the party often thrives in volatile situations.\n\nSerious Factors to Watch 2027 Congress: The party congress will be a critical moment for determining leadership and direction. Economic Performance: ZANU PF must deliver positive economic results to remain relevant. Zimbabwes economic challenges and the partys handling of them will impact public perception and support. Internal Cohesion: President Mnangagwas diplomatic acumen will be vital to managing factional tensions and maintaining unity. We must avoid selfishness and be patriotic for the sake of our party and our country.\n\nThe recent shake-up in ZANU PFs Politburo, where President Emmerson Mnangagwa reassigned rolesincluding Jacob Mudenda taking over as Treasurer General from Dr. Obert Mpofuhas been explicitly confirmed in available reports. Earlier reports indicated that Jacob Mudenda moved from Legal Affairs to Treasurer General, replacing Patrick Chinamasa, who shifted to Legal Affairs. Now the cat is out of the bag and screaming loud.\n\nKey Aspects of the MoveJacob Mudenda is a seasoned politician and current Speaker of the National Assembly, with a longstanding association with ZANU PF and historical ties to Robert Mugabe. His experience and background make him fit for any office. A lawyer with a notable career, he has been involved in politics since Zimbabwes independence and weathered controversies such as the Willowgate scandal.\n\nImplications of the ReshuffleSuch moves often reflect internal power dynamics and alignments within ZANU PF, potentially signaling shifts in influence or attempts to manage factional tensions. These changes may also reflect efforts to balance power or address succession questions.\n\nLeadership and Succession: President Mnangagwas decisions on appointments can impact perceptions of his leadership and potential stability within the party.\n\nEconomic and Political Context: Zimbabwe faces major economic challenges; internal party dynamics can influence governance approaches and policy directions.\n\nKey Figures Involved in This Reassignment Jacob Mudenda: Experienced politician and current Speaker, with significant roles in ZANU PF. Dr Obert Mpofu: Formerly held a Politburo role, though specifics of his demotion arent detailed in available reports.\n\nProfile: Dr Obert Moses MpofuObert Moses Mpofu is a prominent Zimbabwean politician affiliated with ZANU PF, born on October 12, 1951. He has had a long and varied career in government, holding several key ministerial positions.\n\nKey Roles and Positions Ministerial Portfolios: Mpofu has served as Minister of Home Affairs (20172018), Minister of Macro-Economic Planning and Investment Promotion, Minister of Industry and International Trade, Minister of Mines and Mining Development, and Minister of Transport and Infrastructure Development. He was Governor of Matabeleland North Province from 2000 to 2008. Parliamentary Career: Mpofu was first elected to Parliament in 1980 and has represented various constituencies, including Bubi-Umguza.\n\nNotable Actions and Policies Price Freeze and Peoples Shops (2007): Mpofu implemented a price freeze on basic commodities and initiated peoples shops aimed at selling products at affordable prices. Look East Policy: He promoted trade between Zimbabwe and China, aligning with the governments Look East policy.\n\nDr Mpofu was placed on the United States sanctions list in 2003.\n\nEducation and BackgroundDr Mpofu holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Delhi, an MPS (Masters in Policy Studies) from the University of Zimbabwe, and a PhD in Policy Studies from the Zimbabwe Open University. He is believed to be one of the earliest ZPRA guerrillas trained for the Zimbabwean liberation struggle, crossing into Zambia in 1967.\n\nDr Mpofus removal from President Mnangagwas cabinet in September 2018 marked a significant change in his political trajectory.\n\nPolitical Dynamics and Human RightsInternal ZANU PF tensions are, in a sense, healthy for any political party, and the party has always come out strong. Factional struggles and controversies surrounding figures like Kudakwashe Tagwirei, and the interactions between President Mnangagwa and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, are not new and should not cause panic. Efforts are being made to tackle complex corruption cases with new strategies, and fighting corruption will not break the party.\n\nOutlook and ChallengesZimbabwe faces significant hurdles, including economic difficulties, political tensions, and social challenges. Whether the country will pull through depends on various factors, including government policies, international relations, economic management, and addressing internal political dynamics and human rights concerns.\n\nWe need to come together as a party and shun factionalism. We should unite and make ZANU PF proud again. ZANU PF will always sail through these storms. Enemies of ZANU PF must smile and forgetour party will not be destroyed. It may look shaken, but we are strong in our special way.\n\nZANU PF is the people, and the people are ZANU PF. It is now time for you and me to unite. Zimbabwe is the only country we can call ours in the whole world.\n\nGod bless Zimbabwe.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent President Emmerson Mnangagwa has cancelled his scheduled trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly amid rising fears that his closest allies could face arrest in his absence, as Zanu PFs succession wars spiral into a dangerous new phase.\n\nAccording to security sources, the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) strongly advised Mnangagwa against travelling, warning that Vice-President Constantino Chiwengas faction had intensified its push to have several of the Presidents allies arrested on corruption charges.\n\nCIO briefings reportedly cautioned that Mnangagwas absence could expose his camp to crippling blows from within both the ruling party and the state security apparatus.\n\nAt the centre of the escalating tensions is a damning anti-corruption dossier presented by Chiwenga to senior security and party officials.\n\nThe dossier names powerful businessmen linked to Mnangagwa, including fuel tycoon Kudakwashe Tagwirei, controversial businessman Wicknell Chivayo, and gold dealer Scott Sakupwanya, accusing them of looting billions of dollars through state contracts and opaque deals.\n\nTagwirei, in particular, has long been viewed as Mnangagwas closest financial backer and potential successor, while Chivayo and Sakupwanya have become symbols of Zanu PFs patronage economy, flaunting their wealth in public and bankrolling party activities.\n\nChiwengas dossier calls for their arrest as part of a broader clean-up campaign, a move insiders say is intended to weaken Mnangagwas faction ahead of the next Zanu PF elective congress.\n\nMnangagwa, however, has moved swiftly to shield his allies, blocking any arrests and reshuffling the party leadership to consolidate his grip.\n\nThe most dramatic move was the demotion of Zanu PF secretary-general Obert Mpofu, a long-time Chiwenga ally, who was pushed into the largely ceremonial role of Secretary for ICT.\n\nIn his place, Mnangagwa installed loyalist Jacob Mudenda, the Speaker of Parliament, ensuring tighter control over party structures.\n\nOther key changes confirmed by Zanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa include:\n\nThese changes not only sidelined Chiwengas allies but also strengthened Mnangagwas control over the partys legal, financial, and organisational machinery.\n\nThe rift between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga represents a dramatic reversal of fortunes.\n\nIn 2017, the two men worked hand-in-glove to topple the late Robert Mugabe, with Chiwenga, then commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, playing a decisive role in Operation Restore Legacy.\n\nBack then, it was Mugabes attempt to purge Mnangagwa and elevate Grace Mugabe that triggered the military intervention.\n\nToday, the roles appear reversed. Mnangagwa is now systematically sidelining Chiwengas loyalists, sparking fears that the militarystill seen as sympathetic to Chiwengacould once again intervene in politics.\n\nAnalysts warn that Mnangagwas hardline tactics may backfire.\n\nThe sidelining of Mpofu, a heavyweight in Matabeleland, risks alienating regional power blocs, while any attempt to shield Tagwirei, Chivayo, and Sakupwanya could deepen public anger over corruption.\n\nThe once-muted succession debate has now exploded into open confrontation, with Chiwenga demanding accountability and Mnangagwa shielding his financiers.\n\nThe fallout threatens to destabilise both Zanu PF and the wider state, reviving the spectre of factional battles that in 2017 culminated in a military coup.\n\n",

            "content": "The following is a late night interview with one of the May 2025 petitioners to the military, Cde Gifford Gomwe.\n\nINTERVIEWER (Simba Chikanza):Lets begin with this reshuffle. What exactly has happened, and what does it mean for Obert Mpofu?\n\nINTERVIEWEE:The post of Secretary General has always been seen as part of the Presidium in ZANU PF. Traditionally, the Presidium includes: The President, The two Vice Presidents, The National Chairman, and The Secretary General.\n\nMNANGAGWA FIRES VP CHIWENGA LINKED MPOFUhttps://t.co/52cKGLqtlS\n\nSo, removing Obert Mpofu from the Secretary General post and assigning him to a lower rolespecifically, the ICT department, which ranks somewhere around number 16 in party structuresis clearly a demotion.\n\nINTERVIEWER:Whats the significance of who was promoted?\n\nINTERVIEWEE:Some of those who were promoted are aligned with the 2030 Agenda cliquethe faction thats pushing for President Mnangagwas continued rule until 2030 or beyond.\n\nAlso worth noting: Obert Mpofu previously laid out the rules and procedures that must be followed for someone to be called into a Central Committee position. In this case, whats happening seems more like strategic internal purging, not procedural alignment.\n\nMoving Obert Mpofu to ICT is not only a demotionit suggests that he has lost significant influence. Its almost like hes being sidelined entirely.\n\nINTERVIEWER:And what about Patrick Chinamasa?\n\nINTERVIEWEE:Chinamasa was removed from Legal Affairs and placed in charge of Finance as the new Treasurer General. This means he now controls the partys finances.\n\nThis move is critical because it gives pro-Mnangagwa loyalists the financial muscle to fund internal agendas, especially heading towards 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, Ziyambi Ziyambi, previously in charge of ICT, now moves into Legal Affairs. Thats a significant shift tooit puts him in a powerful position where he can handle disciplinary issues, internal disputes, and possibly manipulate rules to favour the dominant faction.\n\nINTERVIEWER:So just to be clear, what youre saying isChinamasas move is strategic, and Ziyambis move too?\n\nINTERVIEWEE:Yes. These are not just administrative changes. They are strategic deployments aimed at consolidating Mnangagwas grip on both the party and the state machinery.\n\nMeanwhile, the demotion of Obert Mpofu is clearly a retaliationlikely for siding with Vice President Chiwenga. Just last week, Chiwenga demanded the arrest of certain ZANU PF members over corruption.\n\nInstead of taking that path, Mnangagwa has reshuffled the deck, removing perceived threats and empowering his loyalists. Its a direct blow to those who are calling out corruption within the party.\n\nINTERVIEWER:So when does this reshuffle take effect?\n\nINTERVIEWEE:The letter itself says the changes are effective immediately. Whether the individuals have been informed directly or not, the announcement on ZANU PFs official Facebook pageposted about two hours agomakes it official.\n\nAs it stands, Jacob Mudenda is now the Secretary General.\n\nINTERVIEWER:So can we now say Mnangagwa has fully consolidated power?\n\nINTERVIEWEE:I wouldnt go as far as saying he has total power forever, but this move is definitely an exercise of his constitutional authority to reshuffle the Politburo.\n\nHes clearly asserting dominance over the party structures, but whether this will last depends on how the broader party base reacts.\n\nINTERVIEWER:Lets turn to the petition you submitted to the Zimbabwe Defence Forces in May. Is this reshuffle a response to that petition?\n\nINTERVIEWEE:That petition, submitted on 21 May 2025, called for military intervention under Section 212 due to rising signs of state capture. We wanted the Defence Forces to restore constitutional order and ensure corrupt individuals were brought to justice.\n\nChiwenga even publicly called him out for corruption. So this reshuffle might be a partial response to that pressure.\n\nINTERVIEWER:And do you believe this is a state-forced hand moment?\n\nINTERVIEWEE:Yes, in a way. What weve seen today could be the start of real action. The petition demanded accountability, and if reshuffles like this continue, we might see justice prevail.\n\nWe are still watching closely. We want criminals arrested and corrupt structures dismantled. If theres a commission being formed to investigate furtheras some reports suggestthen we might be heading in the right direction.\n\nINTERVIEWER:One final question: do we know what dossier Christopher Mutsvangwa referred to yesterday?\n\nINTERVIEWEE:Yes. Mutsvangwa dismissed it, saying it came from unknown sources. But I believe that Vice President Chiwenga wouldnt speak publicly on corruption without solid intelligence.\n\nHes a seasoned, well-briefed man. If he named names, it means investigations were done. We should take his accusations seriously. That dossier may not be public, but its effects are already visibleas shown by todays reshuffle.\n\nINTERVIEWER:Thank you very much for your time. Over 1,400 people are tuned in right now.\n\n",

Once allies during the 2017 coup that toppled Robert Mugabe, the two men are now bitter rivals, each positioning himself and his allies for control of the state after Mnangagwa.\n\nFor Chiwenga, who played a decisive role in bringing Mnangagwa to power, the systematic sidelining of his loyalists represents both personal frustration and political humiliation.\n\nZanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa confirmed further Politburo changes that consolidate Mnangagwas grip:\n\nThese changes cement Mnangagwas control over key strategic levers within Zanu PF while further isolating Chiwengas allies.

            "content": "By A Correspondent President Emmerson Mnangagwa has dramatically weakened Vice-President Constantino Chiwengas influence in Zanu PF by firing the partys secretary-general, Obert Mpofu, one of Chiwengas key allies, and replacing him with his own loyalist, Jacob Mudenda, the Speaker of Parliament.\n\nMpofu has been demoted to the marginal position of Secretary for ICTa move widely interpreted as a calculated strike by Mnangagwa to paralyse Chiwengas power base in the ruling partys escalating succession wars.\n\nThe shake-up comes amid fierce factional rivalries inside Zanu PF, reminiscent of the turbulence that preceded the ouster of Robert Mugabe in November 2017. At the centre of the conflict is the unresolved question of who will succeed Mnangagwa, now in his eighties. Chiwenga, the former commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces who orchestrated the 2017 coup that propelled Mnangagwa to power, is seen as his natural rival.\n\nTensions between the two camps have intensified in recent weeks. Chiwenga reportedly handed party leaders a damning dossier accusing Mnangagwas allies of looting billions of dollars, with particular attention on businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei, regarded as Mnangagwas preferred successor. The allegations rattled the party elite, further deepening mistrust.\n\nFaced with these threats, Mnangagwa abruptly cancelled his trip to the United Nations General Assembly in New York after security briefings warned that his allies risked arrest in his absence. The Central Intelligence Organisation reportedly cautioned him that leaving the country could expose his camp to crippling attacks from within.\n\nBy moving against Mpofu, Mnangagwa has signalled his determination to neutralise Chiwengas camp. Analysts say this reshuffle mirrors the high-stakes manoeuvring of 2017, when Mugabe was deposed after failing to manage internal succession disputes. Unlike then, however, Mnangagwa and Chiwenga are now bitter opponents rather than allies.\n\nZanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa confirmed a broader Politburo reshuffle that further entrenches Mnangagwas dominance:\n\nThe restructuring isolates Chiwengas allies while placing Mnangagwas loyalists in strategic roles. However, it also highlights Zanu PFs fragile unity. Mpofu, long seen as a heavyweight from Matabeleland, may not take kindly to his demotion, and the move risks widening cracks in the party.\n\nMore significantly, the purge underscores how dangerously the succession struggle has escalated. By paralysing Chiwengas camp, Mnangagwa may have won a roundbut at the cost of further destabilising both Zanu PF and the countrys political future.\n\n",

            "content": "Zimbabwe find themselves in a tough Group B pool at AFCON 2025 alongside continental giants Egypt, South Africa, and Angola. Like any other pool, this one requires some smart planning, discipline, and game plan if the Warriors want to go beyond the group stage. The official program has been released with Zimbabwe taking on Egypt on 22 Dec, Angola (26 Dec), and South Africa (29 Dec).\n\nThe Warriors go into the tournament as underdogs, but upsets are the order of the day in tournaments like this. If you are a bettor,follow AFCON on SportyTraderand be sure to make smart choices by using verified sportsbooks.\n\nHere are five achievable, high-impact means in which Zimbabwe can survive  even prosper  in a challenging AFCON group.\n\n1)Build defensive compactness\n\nA compact team defending balances out the advantage of individual talent against great individual talent like Egypt and South Africa. Michael Nees, coach of the team, must focus on a 4-2-3-1/4-4-2 diamond that maintains a short distance between lines, makes opponents sideways, and restricts space between midfield and defence. The deep but organized defense minimizes the likelihood of individual errors turning into objectives, particularly valuable in the case of the team where the creative players can take advantage of the openings. In the tournament format where the best two and the best third-placed team proceed, one or two clean sheets or low-drawing games would save Zimbabwe by far.\n\n2) Turn set pieces into goalscoring opportunities\n\nBig tournaments have low-variance opportunities, set pieces. Zimbabwe ought to practice quick corners, cluttered near posts, and practice free-kick strategies in camp. Having fewer unguarded opportunities against better sides, the ability to turn around corners or out of a free kick may be the distinction between a draw and a triumph. Similarly, the zonal/man-mark hybrid systems and dedicated aerial leader are useful in defending set pieces to avoid giving up cheap goals.\n\n3) Bring on board seasoned leaders to stabilize the ship\n\nThe qualification process in Zimbabwe has also witnessed the reintegration of veterans into the fold, with the likes of Marvellous Nakamba and Khama Billiat being brought into the mix to bring experience and calm to big matches. The possession of Nakamba as a central midfielder with a shielding presence and leading role can also be important in ensuring shape and speed against bigger names; Billiat offers a counterattacking option. Trusting these leaders to guide the standards in training and to calm down the young players on a matchday will not be wasted.\n\n4) Choose quick, compact transitions as an alternative to possession\n\nZimbabwe must take less possession and concentrate on swift, decisive movements when compared with technically superior teams. It refers to disciplined central midfielders who grab the ball and pass off quickly to wingers or forwards. The coaches must select attackers who make smart channels and presses. One clinical counterattack in the second half and a 0-0 result at half-time can be a dream result for an underdog.\n\n5) Control player fitness\n\nAFCON occurs during a tight timetable, and the Moroccan climate and transportation may drain energy. Rotation is not only about resting players; it is about the tactical adjustments. Play one formation which best suits a defensive shell (such as vs Egypt), and another a little more aggressive; here against Angola, where there could be more acreage. Rely on sports science information to make decisions regarding who plays and who to use off the bench. Intelligent replacements, like the introduction of a wide player after 60 minutes when the game is a draw or a defensive midfielder to finish off a draw, will earn points.\n\nMatchday tactical checklist\n\n     Begin with a defensively small profile, particularly against Egypt and South Africa.\n\n     Give priority to corners and free-kick openings in set-pieces.\n\n     Screen the back four using Nakamba (or the assigned anchor) and recycle possession.\n\n     Exploit weaknesses of target opponents on the flanks by crossing early.\n\n     Maintain discipline: group progression rules imply that a loss of points through suspensions could be disastrous.\n\nMental strength\n\nYou have to be as mentally tough to live through a rough group as you are tactical. The Warriors should promote a mentality of one match at a time, focus on their ability to fight back after a loss, and hold penalty-practice and last-minute conditions drills. The common denominator in teams that advance from tricky groups is that they tend to maintain faith, cash in on minute details (a set piece, a referees decision, a late substitute), and fail to collapse under pressure.\n\nShould Zimbabwe heed the above blueprint and become disciplined defensively, set-piece killers, seasoned leaders on the field, shrewd transitions, and rotate carefully, then they will not be just surviving in Group B, but will be quite difficult to beat, and will have a good shot at making it through to the knockout stage.\n\n",
