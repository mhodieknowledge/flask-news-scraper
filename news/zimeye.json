The slide comes after months without competitive action, their last match being in February during an unsuccessful Africa Womens Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifying campaign.\n\nOn the African stage, Zimbabwe now sits 21st, a far cry from their more competitive days, while newly crowned African champions Nigeria continue to dominate the continent. Globally, Spain remains firmly at the top of the rankings.\n\nThe decline has raised alarm among supporters and analysts, who fear the once-proud team is struggling to remain relevant in both regional and international football.\n\n",

I have removed names to protect the identity of the family but hope that the Government and in particular the Minister of Health will move quickly to address this disastrous situation.\n\nXYZ was discharged as an out patient on ABC day.\n\nThe staff are very dedicated and have a lot they have to deal with and do so professionally however they do drop the ball and had forgotten to give XYZ his amoxycillan . With the numbers they are dealing with it is to be expected. They know each of the inmates by name which is a feat on its own.\n\nThe place is as clean as they can keep it and inmates help mopping sweeping taking the laundry (blankets are non existent and very near their end ) and bringing the cooked mealie meal.\n\nThe water seems to be there out of the taps. However the toilets are a huge concern  the inmates shoes are soaked in urine and I believe poop on the floor. I wonder if the system is blocked.\n\nThe medication is there we just had to go purchase the one.\n\nLice is terrible.\n\nWe are broken. XYZ is broken. Ingutsheni staff are amazing but oh my goodness please do yourself a favour and go see Khumalo ward soonest\n\nThere should be 70 to 90 in the ward but there are over 200. And they keep coming. Our doctors and nurses are dealing with a pandemic.\n\nPlease pop down and save our Bulawayo citizens, families and addicts.\n\nUnfortunately my jurisdiction as Mayor does not extend to Government Hospitals. All I can do is plead with the authorities to address this catastrophe. I have been to Ingutsheni since taking office and can confirm that the conditions are simply ghastly  this is a living hell right within our City.\n\n",

While officially described as a step toward empowering youth with digital defense skills, many critics warn this is a state-driven effort to expand surveillance and tighten control over internet and social media activities.\n\nICT Minister Tatenda Mavetera announced the initiative on Thursday, calling it a proud moment for Zimbabwe and describing the programme as groundbreaking.\n\nHowever, the training has sparked fears that these recruitsdubbed varakashiwill serve as government-aligned footsoldiers tasked with policing online expression and dissent.\n\nMavetera said the programme will equip youth to become ethical hackers, cybersecurity analysts, and guardians of our digital future. Yet, Zimbabwes record of suppressing dissent raises doubts about whether these guardians will protect citizens or enforce censorship.\n\nThe minister also highlighted scholarships provided through partnerships with Cyberus and Komib Foundation, aimed at youth across the SADC region. We are also offering an initial 160 scholarships for youth across the SADC region, opening doors to a global industry set to exceed USD 200 billion, he said. Critics question how many will benefit and suspect the bulk of trainees will be co-opted into state surveillance roles.\n\nMavetera insisted the programme is about building a Zimbabwe that doesnt just consume technology but leads it, and called on young Zimbabweans and SADC youth to step up, get trained, and shape the future with us. For many observers, however, this future is one of increased government monitoring and digital control rather than genuine empowerment.\n\n",

            "content": "Court Orders Premier Inn Disruptor, @DMwonzora to Pay $176K to Workers\n\nBy Dorrothy Moyo | ZimEye |  8 August 2025\n\nBarely a year after a viral incident in which he was filmed berating UK hotel staff (video below) while boasting that he owns  my own political party, MDC-T President Douglas Togarasei Mwonzora has been dealt a crushing legal blow. The Harare Labour Court has ordered the Movement for Democratic Change  T (MDC-T) to pay US$176,465 (or ZiG equivalent at the official bank rate) to 14 former employees for unpaid salaries, notice pay, and compensation for loss of employment.\n\nThe ruling, delivered on 5 August 2025 by Government Arbitrator Mercy Dare, gives Mwonzora and his party just 30 days to settle the debt or face the seizure of MDC-T property.\n\nDire Finances and Mounting Defeats\n\nThis latest judgment follows humiliating defeats in recent by-elections, including Epworth council, and a failure to field candidates elsewhere.\n\nIt also happens at a time a UK police case awaits him over violent disturbances at Premier Inn Banbury, Oxford on 28 Sept 2024.\n\nMwonzoras party is reportedly struggling to cover even the most basic operational costs  including water and electricity bills  at its headquarters, Morgan Richard Tsvangirai House (formerly Harvest House). In a controversial move to raise cash, Mwonzora has begun renting out parts of the building to small businesses, effectively turning the partys offices into a network of tuckshops.\n\nThis financial strain mirrors the 2023 harmonized elections debacle, when Mwonzora failed to pay nomination fees to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), resulting in MDC-T being locked out of the parliamentary race entirely. While the party received political funding up to 2022, workers claim those funds were never used to clear salary arrears or maintain operations.\n\nCase Background\n\nThe 14 claimants  drawn from Harare, Masvingo, and other provinces  accused MDC-T of abruptly stopping their salaries without termination notices. Some were placed on indefinite suspensions without proper disciplinary hearings. Arbitrator Dare ruled that the suspensions were unlawful and null and void, finding that MDC-T had violated both procedural and substantive fairness under SI 15 of 2006 and the Labour Act [Chapter 28:01].\n\nThe arbitrator concluded that the non-payment of salaries amounted to repudiation of contract by the employer, not the employees, and ordered full settlement of arrears, notice pay, and damages.\n\nPayout Breakdown\n\nThe award specifies the following compensation per claimant:1.Matthew Dondo  $18,9002.Francis Machimbidzofa  $12,5003.Gertrude Muchakare  $10,7504.Everisto Chisi  $11,2505.Samson Njovo  $8,5506.Fungai Gumbu  $10,3507.Trust Phiri  $15,1258.Wallace Chibikira  $31,2009.Godfrey Ushe  $13,16010.Peter Chigaba  $15,50011.Pilani Ngoniye  $9,90012.Joshua Chanyau  $5,85013.Josiah Nyapfumbi  $7,05014.Victor Chidende  $6,380\n\nTotal: $176,465\n\nHypocrisy on Workers Rights?\n\nWhile MDC-T publicly claims to champion labour rights, the ruling paints a damning picture of a party unwilling to uphold those principles for its own employees. The arbitrator noted that the party was represented by Mwonzora and Associates but failed to provide wage records, disciplinary documentation, or any lawful justification for withholding salaries.\n\nLabour experts warn that if the award is not honoured within 30 days, sheriffs could move in to attach MDC-T assets, further crippling the partys already weakened organisational structure.\n\n",

Incompetence is a dischargeable offence, the circular states, warning that teachers responsible for persistent poor results may face dismissal.\n\nThis disciplinary action is part of a broader effort to raise academic standards in the district, where some schools have struggled to meet even basic examination benchmarks.\n\nThe circular, addressed to all secondary school principals in Bulilima, demands accountability for ongoing poor performance. It states:\n\nSchools with zero pass rates over the past five years include Zenzele (Heritage Studies; Geography; Combined Science; Mathematics), Ntunungwe (Mathematics), Mzwanyana (Agriculture; Commerce; English; Combined Science), Mazwaligwe (Agriculture; Geography), Maqhekeni (Mathematics), Madlambudzi (Combined Science), Himago (Mathematics), Matjinge (Mathematics), and Siyaphambili (Mathematics).\n\nHeads of these schools must review pupils answer scripts and submit detailed reports attached to the subject marks schedule. Any teacher who records a 0% pass rate this year will be charged with incompetence, which will lead to dismissal. For the past five years, teachers in these subjects have consistently scored 0%, and this can no longer be tolerated.\n\nThe Ministrys firm stance underscores its commitment to improving education outcomes and holding educators accountable for their performance.\n\n",

Despite official claims, Zimbabwe continues to grapple with unresolved debt arrears, economic instability, and political repression that hinder genuine partnership with the EU and broader international community.\n\nAmbassador von Kirchmann praised the progress made in building bridges and fostering cooperation, focusing on trade fairs and business forums as signs of success. But these events appear more symbolic than substantive, masking the persistent challenges Zimbabwe faces in securing sustainable economic growth and financial support.\n\nThe ambassador acknowledged ongoing discussions about debt clearance, yet concrete progress remains elusive. Without resolving these core issues, Zimbabwes prospects for sovereign lending and deeper engagement with global institutions remain bleak.\n\nMnangagwas emphasis on public relations victories seems designed to attract foreign investment and improve Zimbabwes international image, even as systemic problems persist at home.\n\nCritics contend that these diplomatic efforts amount to little more than a public relations stunt, failing to address the root causes of Zimbabwes isolation and economic woes.\n\nIn truth, the bright smiles and optimistic trade figures showcased during Mnangagwas tenure do not fully reflect the continuing hardships faced by ordinary Zimbabweans, nor the complex political dynamics that complicate genuine reform.\n\nAs Zimbabwe looks to the future, it remains to be seen whether Mnangagwas diplomatic charm offensive will translate into real progressor simply remain a carefully crafted performance aimed at international audiences.\n\n",
