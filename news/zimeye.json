            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a move sparking mixed reactions, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has named a new law school after himself, reinforcing his influence in both Zimbabwes political and educational sectors. The E.D. Mnangagwa Law School, currently under construction at Midlands State University, is poised to become a premier institution for legal education in the region once completed.\n\nAt 65% completion, the school is expected to be operational by August.\n\nDuring a recent site visit, Hon. Ministers Owen Ncube and Jenfan Muswere commended the progress of the project, which will include several key expansions. This is a showcase of the progress we are making under the visionary leadership of President Mnangagwa, Ncube stated, emphasizing the schools state-of-the-art facilities, including a moot court and an extensive library resource center.\n\nThe law school is part of Mnangagwas larger strategy to strengthen Zimbabwes legal education and support the countrys long-term goals, as outlined in Resolution Number 1. This is a clear demonstration of our commitment to educational advancement and legal reform, Muswere added during the tour.\n\nWhile the law school is viewed as a positive step forward for Zimbabwes educational infrastructure, critics argue that naming the institution after himself may signal Mnangagwas unwillingness to relinquish power. His involvement in shaping Zimbabwes legal framework, coupled with the law school bearing his name, has raised concerns about the growing centralization of authority.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZimbabwes economic crisis continues to worsen, and Finance and Investment Promotion Minister Mthuli Ncubes recent remarks about the role of the informal sector offer little hope for resolution.\n\nNcube placed blame on the informal sector for the difficulties supermarkets are facing, claiming it is the competition from the informal sector that is exacerbating the situation. However, this explanation fails to address the deeper systemic issues at play.\n\nIn a statement released on Friday, Ncube argued that the economic troubles stem from informal traders who are bypassing formal retail channels. Since the beginning of 2023, some manufacturers have been opting to supply their goods directly to customers and informal retailers, bypassing wholesalers and retailers, he said. According to Ncube, this practice has put formal businesses in direct competition with the informal sector, which operates outside of formal regulations, including taxes and labour laws. This, he asserts, has led to the closure of some supermarkets and stores.\n\nHowever, while Ncubes comments focus heavily on the informal sector, they overlook the internal failures of formal businesses. He acknowledged that poor management and poor corporate governance have contributed to the struggles of some large retail chains, leading to business closures. This raises the question: is it fair to solely blame informal traders for the crisis when formal businesses are also facing significant challenges due to mismanagement?\n\nNcubes statements come in the context of a worsening economic situation in Zimbabwe, where rising inflation, high unemployment, and unsustainable living costs continue to drive many businesses and individuals toward the informal economy. Despite efforts by the government to tackle the issue, such as the introduction of a 5% withholding tax on unregistered micro and small enterprises (MSMEs) and a reduction in the VAT registration threshold, the informal sector remains a substantial force in the economy.\n\nTo address the impact of informal trading, Ncube outlined measures in the 2024 Mid-Term Budget and the 2025 National Budget, including the mandatory use of Point-of-Sale (POS) machines by all informal traders and a crackdown on goods deemed smuggled. While these measures may contribute to improving compliance, they fail to address the underlying issues facing both formal and informal sectors. In his statement, Ncube also proposed additional actions, such as leveling the playing field between formal and informal businesses and enforcing collaboration between Local Authorities and Central Government in the licensing and enforcement processes.\n\nYet, the central issue remains unaddressed: the governments failure to create an environment where formal businesses can thrive, and where the informal economy is better integrated into the national economy rather than treated as a scapegoat.\n\nResearch and consultations indicate that some of the reasons formal businesses are experiencing distress include competition from the informal sector, poor management, and poor corporate governance, Ncube said. Yet, the constant focus on competition from the informal sector diverts attention from the real need for a comprehensive economic overhaul.\n\nThe governments proposals include enforcing international best practices for tax compliance, strengthening enforcement through a Domestic Interagency Enforcement Team, and introducing additional incentives to support local industry. However, these measures might not be enough to tackle the root causes of Zimbabwes ongoing economic crisis.\n\nIn conclusion, while Mthuli Ncube has proposed several steps aimed at formalizing the informal sector and promoting tax compliance, the economic crisis in Zimbabwe cannot be solved by simply blaming the informal economy. A more holistic approach is neededone that addresses poor governance, supports business growth in both the formal and informal sectors, and ultimately creates a sustainable economic environment for all Zimbabweans. As the country moves toward Vision 2030, it is clear that without deeper structural reforms, the crisis will persist.\n\nMinister Mthuli Ncubes focus on external factors, while important, misses the bigger picture, and its time for a shift in focus toward real economic solutions.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe financial struggles in Zimbabwe continue to worsen as the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe (CBZ) reportedly retrenches a significant number of employees. A leaked internal memorandum reveals the depth of the banks ongoing restructuring efforts, although it stops short of directly stating the scale of the layoffs.\n\nAccording to reports, employees affected by the retrenchment received their termination letters via email. The leaked information circular, dated February 1, 2025, sheds light on the banks approach to handling the situation, though it remains vague about the exact number of job cuts.\n\nThe circular, which was addressed to all staff members, reads: As we approach the final stage of the Papillon Restructuring Project, we would like to take a moment to acknowledge all staff for your commitment to the process. We appreciate your patience during this time of transition. Change is not easy, and we recognise the impact this might have had on each of you.\n\nThe banks communication also emphasizes the uncertainty facing employees, stating that by end of day today, each staff member will receive a letter through email outlining the outcome of this exercise. This indicates that employees were informed of their individual situations through the email distribution, with little room for in-person communication or direct discussion.\n\nThe bank assured its employees that support will be available to help navigate the transition, but it remains unclear what specific assistance will be provided. The circular also notes that more information will be forthcoming: We will be providing additional information during the month of February 2025, though this raises questions about the long-term plans and the future of the workforce.\n\nIn the face of Zimbabwes deepening economic crisis, CBZs move to reduce its workforce aligns with a broader trend seen in various industries across the country, where companies are struggling to stay afloat amid hyperinflation, currency instability, and a lack of foreign investment.\n\nFor now, the bank has urged staff members to reach out to their HR Business Partner for any further inquiries, but many employees are left grappling with the uncertainty of their job security.\n\nAs the restructuring process unfolds, the full impact on the banks operations and the broader economy remains to be seen. In the meantime, Zimbabweans continue to face mounting challenges as the countrys economic crisis intensifies.\n\n",

            "content": "Dynamos F.C.: The True Founder vs. The Legal Victory of Bernard Marriot Lusengo\n\nBy A Correspondent | The identity of Dynamos F.C.s true founder has been a point of contention in Zimbabwean football for years. Sam Dauya is widely recognized as the founder of Dynamos in 1963, having played a pivotal role in the clubs establishment. However, Bernard Marriot Lusengo, a long-time club administrator, has long claimed authority over the club, culminating in a bitter legal battle over Dynamos shareholding and governance.\n\nRecently, after a three-year-long court battle, Marriot was acquitted on charges of fraud related to acquiring a 51% shareholding in Dynamos. While his legal victory secured his control over the club, it does not change the fundamental factSam Dauya remains the rightful founder of Dynamos F.C.\n\nThis article delves into the origins of Dynamos, the legal dispute, and why history must not be rewritten.\n\nSam Dauya: The True Founder of Dynamos F.C.\n\nIn 1963, Sam Dauya formed Dynamos F.C. as a response to racial discrimination in Zimbabwean football. Black players were marginalized, and the disbanding of two black clubsSalisbury City and Salisbury Unitedleft talented players without a team. Dauya stepped up and:Drafted the clubs constitutionDesigned the Dynamos emblemBrought together players from the disbanded teamsLed the club into organized competition\n\nHis efforts laid the foundation for what would become Zimbabwes most successful football club.\n\nWhere Was Bernard Marriot in 1963?\n\nWhile Marriot has claimed to be part of the clubs formation, theres one simple historical fact that contradicts thishe was only 15 years old at the time. Born in 1948, he was too young to have played a leading role in forming a professional football club.\n\nDynamos was built by established players and administrators, with Sam Dauya at the helm. Marriot may have been a young follower of the team, but claiming to be a founding member is a distortion of history.\n\nMarriots Legal Victory: What It Means\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Harare magistrate Yeukai Dzuda ruled in favor of Bernard Marriot Lusengo, clearing him of fraud charges related to his acquisition of 51% shareholding in Dynamos. The case had dragged on for over three years, with two key complainantsDavid George and Ernest Kambapassing away before the verdict.\n\nKey Findings from the Court Judgment1.The Complainants Did Not Qualify as Founding MembersMagistrate Dzuda ruled that the complainants (Leslie Gwindi, Eric Mvududu, and others) were not part of the original Dynamos players of 1963.None of the complainants played for Dynamos during its formation in 1963, Dzuda stated.Since they did not qualify under the clubs 1963 constitution as founding members, their claim to shares was legally weak.2.The Court Did Not Find Evidence of Fraud Against MarriotThe State did not tender evidence to prove a charge of fraud against the accused person, therefore he is found not guilty and acquitted, ruled Dzuda.The court rejected the claim that Marriot had illegally allocated shares to non-original members.3.The 1963 Constitution Had Been RepealedMarriot successfully argued that the 1963 Dynamos constitution was repealed at a general assembly, and the club has since been run under its Articles of Association.This meant that the 1963 constitutionwhich gave every founding member one sharewas no longer valid in the courts eyes.4.The 2005 Supreme Court Ruling Was Not EnforcedThe complainants tried to use a 2005 Supreme Court order by Justice Luke Malaba, which directed Dynamos to revert to the 1963 constitution.However, the court found that this ruling was never fully implemented, allowing Marriot to maintain control over the club.5.Marriot Was the Only Recognized Surviving FounderMarriot claimed in court that he was the last surviving original member of Dynamos from 1963.With no strong legal opposition, the court accepted his position as the de facto leader of the club.\n\nDoes Marriots Legal Win Make Him the Founder of Dynamos?\n\nAbsolutely not. Winning a legal case does not change historical facts.\n\nWhile Marriot emerged victorious in court, this does not mean he founded Dynamos. The ruling focused on shareholding and governance issues, not on the clubs historical origins.\n\nLegal Victory  Historical TruthThe court did not declare Marriot as the founder.The ruling was based on legal technicalities, not historical accuracy.Sam Dauyas contribution remains undisputed in football history.\n\nThe Controversy Behind Marriots Control\n\nDespite his legal win, Marriots leadership has been marred by allegations of power grabs and questionable governance.He was accused of allocating shares illegally in 2017 and removing former members from the clubs administration.His opponents accused him of running Dynamos as a personal empire rather than a community-based club.There were allegations of him defying a High Court order and blocking legitimate stakeholders from participating in club governance.\n\nWhile Marriot walked out of court a free man, his legacy remains controversial among Dynamos divided fanbase.\n\nPreserving the True History of Dynamos F.C.\n\nThe verdict does not change the truthSam Dauya is the real founder of Dynamos.Sam Dauya established Dynamos F.C. in 1963.He drafted the clubs constitution and assembled its first squad.He provided a platform for black Zimbabwean footballers during colonial rule.Bernard Marriot was just 15 years old in 1963 and did not play a leading role.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nFootball history should be based on facts, not legal victories. While Marriot remains a key figure in the clubs modern-day administration, his control over Dynamos should not erase Sam Dauyas contributions.\n\nWhile Bernard Marriot Lusengo has successfully defended his legal position as the majority shareholder of Dynamos, he is not its founder. The court ruling does not rewrite historySam Dauya remains the man who built Dynamos from the ground up in 1963.\n\nDespite the legal triumph, the controversy surrounding Marriots leadership continues, and many within the Dynamos community question the legitimacy of his control.\n\nAs football fans, we must ensure that the true history of Dynamos F.C. is preserved and honored. No legal battle, court ruling, or administrative takeover can change the fact that Dynamos Football Club exists today because of Sam Dauyas vision, leadership, and determination.- ZimEye\n\n",
