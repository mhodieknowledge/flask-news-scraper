            "content": "Harare Officials Question Water Infrastructure Deal Awarded to Helcraw Electrical Projects\n\nHarare, Zimbabwe  January 18, 2025\n\nHarare City Council officials have raised serious concerns over the governments selection of Helcraw Electrical Projects for a major water infrastructure contract, citing doubts about the companys financial and technical capacity. The Zimbabwe Independent has learned that these concerns were brought up during a series of meetings with the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works this week.\n\nHelcraw Electrical Projects, linked to Zanu PF legislator Farai Jere, has partnered with Chinese firm Hangzhou Laison Technology to establish a new water treatment plant, supply prepaid water meters, and replace sections of the citys aging pipe network. However, Harare officials have questioned the companys suitability for the multimillion-dollar project, given its unsuccessful bid to supply water meters in a US$2 million tender in 2023.\n\nLack of Due Diligence\n\nOn January 12, city officials, including acting water director Richard Kunyadini, attended a meeting at Makombe Building to discuss Helcraws selection. According to a senior government official, the discussions focused on whether Helcraw had the capacity to finance and implement the project.\n\nThe meeting emphasised the need for due diligence on Helcraw Electrical Projects. Concerns were raised about their financial and technical capacity to undertake the project and the lack of proof of funding, the source said.\n\nThe deal has also sparked criticism over its alleged lack of transparency. Helcraw reportedly signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the government without undergoing a formal tender process.\n\nCosts and Scope of the Project\n\nConfidential documents reviewed by the Independent reveal that Helcraw will:\n\nSupply prepaid meters for 350,000 properties at a cost of US$96 million.\n\nReplace 100 kilometers of pipe network valued at US$23 million.\n\nDespite the magnitude of the project, officials at the meeting reportedly agreed that such an initiative could not be undertaken by a single firm, raising further doubts about Helcraws ability to deliver.\n\nResponses from Key Stakeholders\n\nFarai Jere, linked to Helcraw, declined to comment over the phone and requested a meeting with the publication next week. Acting water director Kunyadini referred questions to Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume, who defended the deal but acknowledged that no concerns were raised in his presence during the signing ceremony.\n\nI am in Russia. I attended the meetings to sign agreements. Not one person questioned their capacity in my presence, Mafume said.\n\nLocal Government Minister Daniel Garwe and Engineer Edmore Njoma, who also attended the meeting, did not respond to inquiries at the time of publication.\n\nBroader Concerns\n\nThis development comes as Harare battles a worsening water crisis, with aging infrastructure and inadequate resources affecting supply. Critics warn that awarding such a large-scale project without thorough scrutiny risks further mismanagement of public funds.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) is reportedly being pressured to intervene and investigate the tender process. For now, the fate of the project remains uncertain as debates over Helcraws capacity and transparency intensify.\n\n",

The accused persons, whose identities have not been disclosed, were apprehended after a sting operation organized by ZACC investigators.\n\nThe incident began on January 7, 2025, when the accused persons arrested the taxi driver for illegally operating in the Mutare Central Business District (CBD). They demanded a bribe of USD 90 to release his vehicle. Unable to pay the amount, the driver requested that they accompany him to his employers residence to collect the money.\n\nThe Clever Ruse\n\nInstead of driving to his employers home, the driver went to ZACC offices under the guise of collecting the money. Upon arrival, he parked outside the gate while the accused waited under a tree nearby. Inside the ZACC offices, the driver reported the bribery attempt, prompting officials to set up a trap.\n\nThe accused persons had disappeared by the time ZACC officers prepared the sting. However, the driver, now accompanied by an investigator posing as his employer, proceeded to the CBD to meet the accused.\n\nThe Sting Operation\n\nThe accused reappeared when the driver parked in the CBD. They entered his vehicle, accused him of deception, and reiterated their demand for a bribe. ZACC investigators, working undercover, negotiated the bribe down to USD 20. The accused then instructed the driver to head to the civic center, where they would collect the money.\n\nAs reinforcement officers moved in, the accused dropped the cash and attempted to flee the scene. Their escape was short-lived as they were quickly apprehended by ZACC officials.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nThe accused were granted bail and are scheduled to appear in court on January 25, 2025.\n\nThis incident highlights the ongoing fight against corruption in Zimbabwe, with citizens increasingly cooperating with anti-corruption authorities to expose malpractice.\n\n",

Nearly two weeks after its disappearance, authorities are yet to locate the truck, valued stock, or the individuals responsible for its delivery.\n\nThe vehicle, which went missing on January 4, was carrying:\n\n400 bags of 50kg Urea fertilizer\n\n30 bags of 10kg sunflower seeds\n\n100 bottles of 200ml Imidacloprid chemicals\n\nThe truck was last seen leaving the Tsholotsho Grain Marketing Board (GMB) depot under the supervision of extension officer Ms. Kwanele Dube, GMB contract employee Mr. Langton Ncube, and police officer Abisinjo Mpofu. None of the three have been seen or heard from since.\n\nDispatch Irregularities\n\nInvestigations revealed a troubling detail: the stock was not signed off in the provisional dispatcher book at the GMB depot because the book was reportedly full. This gap in protocol has raised questions about procedural compliance and the potential for internal collusion.\n\nMatabeleland North Acting Director of Local Government Services, Mr. Tapiwa Zivovoi, confirmed the lack of progress in the case. We have not been informed of any arrests nor recovery of the truck and its inputs, he said, calling for urgent action to address the situation.\n\nCID Steps In\n\nThe mysterious disappearance is now under the scrutiny of detectives from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID). Sources close to the investigation describe the case as highly sensitive, given the implications for the Presidential Input Scheme, which is a cornerstone of Zimbabwes efforts to bolster agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods.\n\nConcerns Over Accountability\n\nThis incident has sparked outrage and concern among local farmers in Ward Seven, who rely on these inputs to sustain their livelihoods. This is devastating. We were counting on this support to start the planting season, said one farmer.\n\nThe disappearance also raises broader concerns about accountability and the security of public resources. Calls are growing for a thorough overhaul of procedures surrounding the distribution and monitoring of government input programs.\n\nThe Presidential Input Scheme, championed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, is a flagship initiative designed to provide smallholder farmers with seeds and fertilizers to enhance food security. This theft represents a significant blow to the programs objectives.\n\nAuthorities have urged anyone with information to come forward as investigations continue. For now, the fate of the missing truck and its contents remains shrouded in mystery.\n\n",

            "content": "High Court Reserves Judgment on Magayas ZIFA Presidential Bid Challenge\n\nBy Court Correspondent | ZimEye | Harare  High Court judge Justice Tawanda Chitapi has reserved his judgment until Thursday in the case involving Walter Magaya, the founder of Yadah Stars, who is contesting his disqualification from running for the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) presidency.\n\nMagayas disqualification stems from his failure to produce an O-Level certificate or its equivalent, as required by the ZIFA constitution. Represented by renowned lawyer Thabani Mpofu, Magaya argues that the disqualification is unjustified.\n\nArguments from Magayas Legal Team\n\nMpofu described the matter as simple and straightforward, emphasizing that the ZIFA constitution only requires a minimum qualification of O-Level or its equivalent.\n\nIf a qualification issued by a university exceeds the standard of an O-Level, this application ought to succeed, Mpofu argued.\n\nHe accused ZIFA of failing to provide adequate reasons for Magayas disqualification, stating, The respondents are aware they need to justify their decision but have not demonstrated that the documents submitted by Magaya fail to meet the required qualifications.\n\nMpofu also stressed that failing to produce an O-Level certificate does not necessarily mean Magaya does not possess one, adding, The process allows time to comply and contest discrepancies in documentation.\n\nZIFAs Defense\n\nZIFA, represented by Professor Lovemore Madhuku, dismissed Magayas application as baseless and argued that it was improperly brought before the High Court. Madhuku maintained that ZIFA, as a private non-profit organization, is not subject to judicial review under administrative law.\n\nZIFA is not an administrative body. It is a private organization, and its decisions cannot be reviewed by this court, Madhuku submitted. He further argued that Magayas failure to produce an O-Level certificate disqualifies him outright, stating, The primary requirement is O-Level or its equivalent. Diplomas or higher qualifications cannot substitute this minimum standard.\n\nSharp Exchanges in Court\n\nMadhuku criticized Magayas legal approach, stating that his argument undermined the clear requirements of the ZIFA constitution. You cannot skip foundational requirements, just like you cannot start at Grade 4 without completing ECD, Madhuku quipped.\n\nHe also challenged Magayas claims of equivalence, asserting, If Magaya had an O-Level, he would have attached it to his application. The absence of this document speaks volumes.\n\nThe Verdict Awaits\n\nJustice Chitapi reserved judgment after hearing submissions from both parties. The outcome of this case could set a precedent for the interpretation of qualifications in sports governance in Zimbabwe. Should Magaya succeed, it may lead to a broader discussion on the alignment of ZIFAs electoral requirements with international best practices.\n\nFor now, all eyes remain on the High Court as it prepares to deliver its ruling on this contentious matter.\n\n",
