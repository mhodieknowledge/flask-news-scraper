            "content": "Brief speech by Abigail Mupambi on Monday | ZimEye | We left town at around five. I was driving, with Nadia and other colleagues, whom I dropped off in town. I was the one who dropped Nadia at her gate. I was also the one speaking with her as she entered the house because she was sharing that there was no electricity. You know how general conversations go.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, Nadia tried to reach out to me, but I did not pick up. I proceeded to my place. Later on, a colleague called me, asking, Are you safe? I was confused, wondering what kind of question that was. They had received a hint about Nadiain a crying mode.\n\nAt around 10 PM, I checked only the text messages, and by half past 7 PM, we started sensing that something could be wrong. We tried to call multiple numbers, even those of her sisters who stayed with her, but none were going through.\n\nBy 5 AM the next morning, I was at Nadias place. Thats when I learned from her kids that their mother had arrived home the previous day at around 6:30 PM. Upon arrival, she had a conversation with them. They told her that people had come earlier in the afternoon, looking for her. One of the kids had not gone to school due to feeling unwell, and the visitors had been asking questions: What time does your mom come back? Where does she work? Other particulars about her.\n\nImmediately after this conversation, towards 7 PM, Nadia left to lock the gate. That was the last time she was seen. From that very evening until yesterday, when she was found dumped in a field, she had been missing. This was very unusual.\n\nWe later learned that on that same Wednesday, while we were at court, a CID officer was spotted at a certain place around noon. As procedures were ongoing, there were reports of a CID visit to Nadias house. The officer later confirmed the visit but denied any involvement in her disappearance.\n\nNadias mysterious disappearance led to a national outcry. It is unheard of that an individual can simply go missingespecially on the very same day they were in court, negotiating in the afternoon, only to disappear by nightfall.\n\nThis incident reminds us of the critical role of the rule of law in our country. We strongly feel that personal security is being tampered with. The will of individuals is being manipulated by those in positions of power. Some individuals, wearing the jackets of political parties, are using their influence to suppress the weaker members of society.\n\nWhy has there been such an outcry around Matiza and Marapira? I came across a statement from Director Marapira, who, with all due respect, said, Please dont involve me. I was shocked. I think no one is accusing Director Marapira directly, but he is indeed a key player in this matter.\n\nFrom the very beginning, he facilitated the arrival of an individual whom we still believe to be a thugsomeone who has caused us great pain. We strongly believe that this individual is hiding behind political connections, which he is even abusing.\n\nTwo days ago, during the search for Nadia, we were shocked to learn that, for the first time, Matiza showed up at the Green River project. He had never visited before. Yet, during Nadias disappearance, he appeared at the project, taking pictures and posting them on social media in a celebratory manner. That behavior is not only uncalled for but primitive.\n\nThis is the true character of Matiza, and it must be exposed. As the women of Zimbabwe, we refuse to accept this. We are prepared to go all the way to defend the position of women, the principle of proper economic empowerment, and the transition to real economic development.\n\nOur President is working hard every day to lead the nation toward economic transformation. Yet, there are individuals who want to hide behind political parties to manipulate the system. Let me offer free advice to political leaders: these individuals are undermining the resolutions of their own parties.\n\nI personally attended the ZANU-PF resolutions in Zambia last year. Nowhere did I see a resolution that permits: The abduction of people, The seizure of other peoples businesses, The suppression of justice.\n\nSo why is an individual trying to politicize what is clearly an economic disputeone that stems from a business transaction? There is no ZANU-PF resolution that endorses such criminal behavior.\n\nAs such, we call upon the leadership of ZANU-PF and other political parties to take a stand. This issue is not unique to one party; it has been happening across the board. We urge political leaders to help root out such individuals and let them face justice. No one should be allowed to hide behind a party jacket.\n\nZANU-PF is one thing. Matiza is another. Marapira is another. I am an individual.\n\nWe were disappointed to see certain groups defending actions they dont even understand. Green River is a project that started years ago. It does not belong to Matiza. It does not belong to an individual who sneaked in through the back door.\n\nIf he genuinely contributed, we are always open to discussing his role in a proper manner. But we will not allow individuals to take advantage of the system to undermine justice.\n\n",

            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda-Vice, President Constantino Chiwenga is under increasing pressure as President Emmerson Mnangagwa moves to consolidate his grip on power by purging key allies of the former military commander from Zanu PF.\n\nLast week, the ruling party expelled eight members, including outspoken war veteran Blessed Geza, who has publicly challenged Mnangagwa to step down.\n\nAmong the high-profile casualties of the purge are Harare province political commissar Kudakwashe Damson, Zanu PF Gutu East MP Benjamin Ganyiwa, and former Harare South MP Godfrey Gomwe.\n\nThe internal purge signals an escalation of long-running tensions between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga, which date back to the 2017 military coup that ousted long-time ruler Robert Mugabe.\n\nAt the time, Chiwenga, then the commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, played a pivotal role in installing Mnangagwa as president, with the expectation that he would be a key power broker.\n\nHowever, relations between the two men have since soured, with Chiwengas ambitions to succeed Mnangagwa clashing with the presidents determination to extend his rule beyond 2028.\n\nGeza, a known Chiwenga ally, has emerged as one of the most vocal critics of Mnangagwas leadership, openly calling for his resignation.\n\nHis expulsion from Zanu PF underscores Mnangagwas strategy of silencing dissent within party ranks, particularly among those aligned with the former military faction that brought him to power.\n\nZanu PF Manicaland political commissar Albert Nyakuedzwa warned that the recent expulsions were just the beginning, revealing that more party members were set to face the axe.\n\nAddressing a gathering at a Zanu PF Makoni district coordinating committee meeting in Rusape on Sunday, Nyakuedzwa insisted that internal party discipline was paramount.\n\nOther provinces have written recommendations to the national disciplinary committee on the people who should be fired from the party, and you saw some have already been dismissed, he said.\n\nNyakuedzwa also announced a controversial move to tighten surveillance over party members online activities, stating that all Zanu PF-affiliated social media groups must be registered with the party.\n\nWe do not need people who attack our leaders. We have seen members using social media to insult our leadership. As Manicaland province, we have decided that all party groups should be officially registered so that we know who to approach if there are more incidents of indiscipline, he added.\n\nThe latest crackdown comes as Mnangagwa pushes ahead with his contentious 2030 agenda, a party resolution aimed at extending his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit.\n\nWhile Mnangagwas camp insists the agenda is not up for debate, it has faced quiet resistance from some within Zanu PF, particularly from Chiwengas allies, who view it as a direct threat to their political ambitions.\n\nAddressing the same gathering, newly appointed Makoni district coordinating committee (DCC) chairperson Kudzai Chipangawho rose to prominence for organizing the infamous One Million Man March in support of Mugabe before his oustercalled for unity in the party, warning against internal divisions.We do not want divisions in the party. Those who are fanning divisions, you are warned, he declared.\n\nThe latest purges add another layer to the long-running power struggle between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga. After the 2017 coup, Chiwenga was widely expected to succeed Mnangagwa, but the president has methodically sidelined his deputy, reshuffling military and intelligence structures to dilute Chiwengas influence.\n\nIn 2020, Mnangagwa orchestrated a major shake-up in the military and security apparatus, replacing key figures seen as loyal to Chiwenga.\n\nTensions between the two escalated further during the 2023 elections, when factions aligned to Chiwenga reportedly opposed Mnangagwas re-election bid behind the scenes.\n\nDespite presenting a united front publicly, insiders say the two camps have been locked in a cold war over the future leadership of Zanu PF.\n\nWith the latest purges, Mnangagwa appears determined to neutralise any lingering threats to his grip on power, setting the stage for an intensifying battle over Zimbabwes political future.\n\n",

            "content": "Overloading buses to the point where passengers are standing is becoming an increasing safety hazard. While it may be a common practice, this situation poses serious risks to passengers and needs to be addressed by authorities.\n\nOne of the main dangers of overcrowded buses is the excessive weight that is placed on the vehicle.\n\nWhen a bus is overloaded, it becomes harder for the driver to maintain control, especially when navigating sharp turns or sudden stops. In the event the driver is forced to apply the emergency brake, passengers who are standing are at risk of falling and sustaining injuries due to the lack of support.\n\nMoreover, standing passengers are more vulnerable to accidents in the event of sudden maneuvers.\n\nThey lack the security of a seat belt or a steady handrail, making them more likely to be thrown off balance and potentially hurt in an accident. The possibility of injury only increases when buses are traveling at high speeds or during congested traffic conditions.\n\nThe safety of passengers should always be a priority, and overloading buses compromises this fundamental principle. Passengers deserve a safe and secure journey, and it is crucial for bus operators and regulatory authorities to enforce strict guidelines on vehicle capacity to prevent overloading.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, authorities should consider increasing inspections of public transportation systems and impose fines for overloading violations. Moreover, bus companies must adhere to regulated passenger limits and ensure that all safety protocols are followed to protect the well-being of those traveling.\n\nIn conclusion, the practice of overloading buses is not only illegal but extremely dangerous. It is essential for both passengers and authorities to recognize the risks involved and work together to prioritize safety in public transport.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

Zanu PF has begun holding its own victory celebration rallies, mimicking the style that was once unique to the MDC.\n\nOn Saturday, Zanu PF Masvingo Provincial Chairperson Robson Mavhenyengwa took the opportunity to claim that the concept of victory rallies was in fact the brainchild of President Mnangagwa. We are unrolling celebration rallies across the country. Here in Masvingo, we have lined up a number of victory celebration rallies.\n\nThis is part of our efforts to salute our esteemed voters, Mavhenyengwa stated, drawing attention to the partys new strategy.\n\nThis appropriation of Tsvangirais idea has raised eyebrows, with critics pointing out that it is an attempt by Mnangagwa to co-opt a successful political tactic for his own purposes.\n\nWhile Mnangagwas Zanu PF has embraced the rallies, the move has been seen as a way to secure loyalty and further entrench the presidents influence over the party, especially as tensions within Zanu PF continue to simmer.\n\n",

Some argue that Zanu PFs decision to back Tawomhera is not about the candidates merit but a calculated attempt to strengthen the partys foothold in the region, which has traditionally been a stronghold for opposition parties.\n\nWhile the ruling party has made its position clear, the opposition has yet to announce its candidate for the by-election. This delay has left many speculating about the political dynamics in the area, as Zanu PF aims to make inroads into the constituency, which has historically leaned toward the opposition.\n\nThe upcoming by-election to replace the late Grandmore Hakata is expected to be a closely watched contest, with all eyes on how the political landscape in Glen View South will shift in the coming weeks.\n\n",
