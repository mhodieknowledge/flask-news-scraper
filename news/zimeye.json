            "content": "The Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), led by Professor Welshman Ncube, has suspended the membership of Sengezo Tshabangu just hours after the High Court reversed his controversial removal of Karenyi Konye and others from Parliaments Standing Rules Committee.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, CCC acting president Professor Ncube announced the suspension of Tshabangu, stating that the decision was made in light of recent events.\n\nTshabangus suspension is pending a disciplinary hearing, which will be conducted in accordance with the partys internal processes, said CCC presidential spokesperson, Kurauone Chihwayi.\n\nThe drama within the party intensified when Tshabangus actions were overruled by the High Court, which reversed his decision to remove Konye and others from their committee positions. The move has sparked a series of conflicts, which have further deepened the political crisis within the opposition.\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, tensions within the CCC took a dramatic turn when the partys leader, Advocate Nelson Chamisa, announced his departure from the formation, citing heavy infiltration.\n\nThis latest move to suspend Tshabangu signals the continued infighting within the CCC as it grapples with internal divisions. The crisis appears to be escalating, leaving the partys future uncertain as it faces mounting internal and external pressures.\n\n",

            "content": "US- The incoming Donald Trump Republican administration has blocked millions of dollars in taxpayer funds allocated by the outgoing Biden administration for LGBTQI initiatives in Zimbabwe.\n\nRepublican House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Brian Mast (R., Fla.) criticised the proposals in a letter addressed to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) administrator Samantha Power.\n\nMasts letter, underscores growing Republican frustration with what they view as ideologically driven foreign aid programs.In recent weeks, my office has been made aware of hundreds of millions of dollars of proposed obligations for initiatives that offer no clear national security benefit to the U.S. or its allies, Mast wrote.\n\nAmong the targeted programs were efforts to combat climate change in the Middle East and promote LGBTQI awareness in Zimbabwe, a southern African country with a deeply entrenched anti-gay stance and a history of criminalising same-sex relationships.\n\nMasts letter reflects his intent to block these expenditures, citing the recent midterm elections as evidence that Americans demand more accountability in government spending.\n\nThe American people sent a clear message in November that they will no longer tolerate uncontrolled spending on programs that are incompatible with the United States interests abroad, Mast wrote. As their representative, I cannot, in good faith, allow you to spend millions of dollars to combat climate change in the war-torn Middle East or fund LGBTQI awareness in Zimbabwe  both of which are among your recent proposals.\n\nZimbabwes government and society are notoriously hostile to LGBTQI rights, with same-sex relationships criminalised and public discourse often rife with homophobic rhetoric.\n\nCritics argue that such initiatives risk backlash that could endanger local activists and alienate an already resistant population.\n\nThese concerns are compounded by Zimbabwes historical ties to the U.S., which are predominantly rooted in diplomatic and economic partnerships rather than progressive social reform.\n\nLeveraging long-standing congressional precedent, Mast vowed to put the funds on hold to prevent the outgoing administration from finalising the expenditures.\n\nHe highlighted plans to reassess such programs under the incoming Trump administration, which is expected to prioritise more conservative foreign policy and aid strategies.\n\nIn defense of its policies, the State Department maintained that the initiatives align with long-standing bipartisan goals.\n\nThe policies and current spending of the administration align with bipartisan foreign policy and national security goals that span many administrations  such as advancing democracy and human rights, protecting and ensuring access to natural resources, and increasing access to education and innovation, a spokesperson told National Review.\n\nHowever, Mast has doubled down on his broader critique of Biden-era foreign aid, releasing a December report detailing the State Departments use of taxpayer dollars for progressive programs.\n\nThese included hosting drag shows in Ecuador, facilitating illegal migrants navigation of the U.S. asylum system, and even domestic censorship efforts targeting conservative media.\n\nSource-National Review/ZimEye\n\n",
