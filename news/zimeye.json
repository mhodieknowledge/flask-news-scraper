            "content": "By A Correspondent The recent expulsion of war veteran and outspoken former Zanu PF official Blessed Geza has dealt a heavy blow to the ruling partys support base in Mashonaland West, with internal restructuring exercises revealing growing discontent and dwindling grassroots participation.\n\nZanu PF iscurrentlyconducting a cell verification exercise in Makonde, Hurungwe, and Sanyati districts to prepare for the co-option of new central committee members.\n\nHowever, the process has been marred by poor attendance, internal divisions, and unresolved tensions dating back to the 2023 general elections.\n\nIn Sanyati, the expulsion of Gezawho openly called for the removal of President Emmerson Mnangagwahas left a vacuum and stirred divisions.\n\nGeza, a respected war veteran, gained notoriety for criticizing Mnangagwas leadership, accusing him of betraying the values of the liberation struggle and presiding over a corrupt, authoritarian regime.\n\nHis bold stance, which resonated with sections of disgruntled war veterans and party loyalists, ultimately cost him his position in the party.\n\nThe leadership contest to replace Geza has drawn figures such as Mines Deputy Minister Polite Kambamura, businessman Jimaya Muduvuri, and Kudakwashe Nduya.\n\nHowever, insiders say the infighting and lack of cohesion have severely disrupted the partys organizational momentum in the area.\n\nIn Hurungwe, another power struggle is unfolding between Reuben Marumahoko and Ability Gandawa, both vying to replace the imprisoned former Deputy Finance Minister Terrence Mukupe.\n\nIn Makonde, Phineas Makumbe, Tommy Mwanza, Simba Ziyambi, and Locadia Gwatiare competingto succeed Kindness Paradza, now a commissioner at the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission.\n\nMeanwhile, there will be no co-option in Chinhoyi to replace controversial businessman Mike Chimombe, who remains in remand prison facing fraud-related charges.\n\nSources within the party said the cell verification process is progressing at a snails pace.\n\nSome areas, such as Bumi Hills, reportedly recorded zero attendance, while others, including Cheuchi in Mhangura, attracted as few as eight people.\n\nWard 4 in Chinhoyi had the highest turnout with 550 people.\n\nIn a letter seen byNewsDay, provincial chairperson Mary Mliswa-Chikoka acknowledged the challenges facing the process. We noted low attendance, which indicateseitherpoor communication or poor planning.\n\nIn both cases, the work will be redone to ensure no one is left out, she wrote. Some absences were due to unresolved issues with sitting MPs. This is unfortunate, but this process is about the party and its structures; therefore, it must proceed.\n\nMliswa-Chikoka also reprimanded officials inChegutudistrict, accusing them of undermining the verification exercise. Worse still, some attempted to incite disunity and rebellion against this vital exercise. Let this be a clear warning to the Chegutu administrative leadership that thisbehaviouris unacceptable and will not be tolerated at all, she said.\n\nMashonaland West was once a stronghold of Zanu PF during the late former President Robert Mugabes reign.\n\nHowever, since the 2017 coup that ousted Mugabe and installed Mnangagwa, internal fractures have widened, and support in the province has weakened, now made more apparent by the fallout from Gezas ouster and the turmoil gripping the partys grassroots.\n\n",

            "content": "By Investigations Correspondent | Johannesburg, 25 June 2025  A legal bombshell has erupted in the Masiwa Wellington (alias Nyokayemabhunu) case, as Malalhela & Co. Attorneys, the firm representing him, has released a series of damning statements exposing YouTuber and Uebert Angel associate Pardon Gambakwe for playing a deeply conflicted and potentially unlawful role in the ongoing saga.\n\nIn a series of formal legal letters dated between May and June 2025, the firm reveals that:\n\nThe attorneys confirm that Mr. Pardon Gambakwe personally approached and instructed them to take on the case of Wellington Masiwajust days after he had, on 20 March 2025, publicly made statements falsely alleging Masiwas ties to military activities and misrepresented his finances. These public statements, made on Gambakwes platforms, contributed to a cascade of events culminating in Masiwas detention on 13 April.\n\nThe implication is severe: the same individual who triggered public suspicion and media framing of Masiwa was secretly directing his legal defense, thereby breaching ethical boundaries and contaminating the legal process.\n\nMalalhela & Co.s letter further admits that Gambakwe has ensured that the lawyers are safe, attending court, and present. Legal observers are questioning how a civilian, who claims to be a journalist and YouTuber, is providing security for lawyers in a high-profile case unless he is involved in some form of state-linked or intelligence function.\n\nThis revelation has sparked fears that Gambakwe may be operating as a double agentpublicly claiming to support justice and human rights while operating behind the scenes in state security or political interests aligned with Uebert Angel and the Zimbabwean regime.\n\nAlready Gambakwe has played multiple roles including a dodgy housing scheme that left many homelesshttps://www.facebook.com/share/1AY4Xtwaxy/?mibextid=wwXIfr\n\nThe attorneys confirm they received R20,175 from Mr. Gambakwe, but note that they have no reconciliation or control over how much in total he collected from the public. All other funds Gambakwe may have solicited are not registered through the trust account and remain undocumented.\n\nThis lack of transparency has led to suspicions of possible fund misappropriation and fraud, as the law firm strictly reiterated: Do not pay funds to any individual or unauthorized collector.\n\nThe firm raised alarm over other individuals not mandated by them soliciting public funds under the pretense of helping Masiwa. Only two verified payments were receivedone from Gambakwe and the other from an associate, Godwin Zivavose, who introduced Advocate Cheryl Sjberg.\n\nThe rest of the funds, if collected, have not been declared, tracked, or deposited into the law firms official account.\n\nThe final shocking development is that Zimbabwean lawyer Chrispen Machingura, who initially stepped forward to assist Masiwa, was later pushed out of the case. The law firm confirms Machingura is no longer part of the legal team and is not authorized to act further.\n\nLegal sources suspect Gambakwes influence was instrumental in sidelining Machingura, a known independent actor, in favor of a more pliable legal framework tied to South African networks and intelligence-linked figures. This aligns with a broader effort to control the Masiwa case narrative and legal trajectory.\n\nCase Now Under Cloud of Compromised Integrity\n\nThe public is now being warned to stop sending funds to any individual other than the law firms trust account. The revelations raise critical questions about infiltration, manipulation, and fund misappropriation in the name of activism and justice.\n\nMasiwa Wellington, the man at the center of this controversy, remains under legal pressurewhile the YouTuber who once framed him appears entangled in both his prosecution and defense.\n\nGambakwe was contacted for comment.\n\nEarlier in May 2025, Gambakwe admitted that he potentially misrepresented the incarcerated activist, and during a phonecall with ZimEye that was broadcast, he admitted and saying he would look into rectifying over statements he uttered on 20 March that directly implicate Wellington Masiwa on many things including an urgent plea for political financing due to coffers that were dwindling.\n\nBut later on 29 May, Gambakwe issued a contrary statement this time saying, he refuses to address his statements. He said he did not at all plant words into Masiwas mouth. He added saying this is because according to him, Masiwa already R1million in his bank account. (Click to read and listen to him speaking \n\nPardon Gambakwe says: I didnt plant words into Nyokas mouth or do money laundering, because Nyoka already had R1 Million in his account on 20 March. https://www.zimeye.net/2025/05/29/pardon-gambakwe-says-i-didnt-plant-words-into-nyokas-mouth-or-do-money-laundering-because-nyoka-already-had-r1-million-in-his-account-on-20-march/. )\n\nThe development comes at a time many in the civil society accused him as a ChiGananda, a corrupt person, bent on chopping other peoples money and lives.\n\nActivism against the government inenge iribusiness inokuwanisayi mari isu tichifunga kuti murikurwira ruzhinji with utmost good faith, said X user @ChazingwaThree.\n\nMudzingwa announces totoputitsa mari! to chop Nyokayemabhunus money while he languishes in prison.In these leaked audios, the jailed South Africa based ZANU PF activist Wellington Masiwa (popularly known as Nyokayemabhunu), is discussed by a group comprising his colleagues.pic.twitter.com/sbM98cc8jY\n\nA previous housing scheme Gambakwe ran in 2023, left many people homeless and demanding their refunds alleging they were scammed by him (watch videohttps://www.facebook.com/share/1AY4Xtwaxy/?mibextid=wwXIfr. )\n\nHuman rights monitors have called for a full inquiry into Gambakwes role, the alleged intelligence connections, and the integrity of the legal proceedings.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\n",

The applicants argued that the former president deserves a dignified and unified funeral, in line with both African tradition and his status as a former head of state.\n\nIn a surprising development during the hearing, legal representatives for the first to seventh respondents formally undertook not to proceed with the funeral or burial, saying they had received instructions to allow the legal process to unfold.\n\n Court Acknowledges Public Interest\n\nThe court acknowledged the deep grief and national emotion surrounding the matter and noted that the public has a legitimate interest in how the proceedings unfold. The legal teams on both sides were praised for engaging constructively and agreeing on a structured way forward.\n\nA statement submitted in support of the application emphasized the importance of cultural dignity:\n\nAs Africans, we believe the deceased should be laid to rest respectfully and in a manner that unites the family and nation  not divides it.\n\n Terms of the Court Order\n\nThe court issued the following directions:1. The respondents may not proceed with the funeral or burial of the late President until the finalisation of the main application.2. Any party wishing to intervene in the matter must file papers by 18 July 2025.3. The applicant must file an amended notice of motion and supporting affidavit by 4 July 2025.4. The respondents are to file opposing affidavits by 11 July 2025.5. Both sides are to file their heads of argument, chronologies, and lists of authorities by 18 and 24 July, respectively.6. A joint practice note and chronology must be submitted by 25 July 2025.7. The matter will be heard in full as a special motion on 4 August 2025.8. Electronic service of all documents is permitted.9. The costs of the urgent application are reserved and will be determined during the main hearing.10. Only the first to seventh respondents are allowed to visit or inspect the body, or permit others to do so.\n\n What This Means\n\nPresident Lungu died on 5 June 2025, but his remains are now effectively under legal protection, as the court steps in to resolve growing tensions over who has the right to determine his final resting place.\n\nThe case has sparked widespread discussion across Zambia and the diaspora, with supporters of the former president insisting on full respect for his legacy and the familys wishes.\n\nThe legal outcome in South Africa could also influence how similar cross-border burial disputes involving political figures are handled in the future.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Long known for his deep pockets and behind-the-scenes influence in both state contracts and party funding, Tagwirei is increasingly stepping into the limelight.\n\nThough he has not formally declared any presidential ambitions, insiders suggest his rapid rise through party structurescoupled with his alignment with Mnangagwacould be part of a broader succession strategy within the ruling party.\n\nWhether he is positioning himself as a future presidential contender or simply consolidating his influence within ZANU PF, one thing is clear: Tagwirei is no longer just the man behind the sceneshes now part of the machinery steering Zimbabwes political direction.\n\n",
