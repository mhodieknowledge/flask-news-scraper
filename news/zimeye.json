            "content": "ZANU PF Supporters Reject Mnangagwa Term Extension, Back Chiwenga for 2028 Presidency\n\nBy A Correspondent | ZimEye | A faction of ZANU PF supporters has publicly rejected efforts to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas term to 2030, declaring their unwavering support for Vice President General Constantino Chiwenga as the partys future leader.\n\nThe controversy erupted following a leaked clip from the state broadcaster ZBC, in which Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi was seen instructing party members to align themselves with a narrative exonerating President Mnangagwa from being behind the contentious term-extension proposal. In the clip, Ziyambi can be heard saying:\n\nWhen you are asked, you must say we are the ones who came up with the call to lengthen President Mnangagwas term even myself when I shall meet him, I shall sound like he has no clue about it.\n\nThe video sparked outrage among ZANU PF supporters and members who accused Ziyambi of misleading the nation. In a strongly-worded statement, a group of party members dismissed the ministers claims as legendary lies and asserted that there had been no consultation within ZANU PF structures on the proposed term extension.\n\nEmmerson Mnangagwas @CNN promise to step down in 2028, even if the people would love me to the heel, I will still go away | 2025 STATUS @ZANUPF_Official  @nickmangwana   @amanpourpic.twitter.com/BCXaeeXlQc\n\nNo Agreement on Term Extension\n\nThe group emphasized that the partys main wingsMain Wing, Womens League, War Veterans, and Youth Winghad never deliberated or agreed to a term extension for Mnangagwa. They demanded evidence of such discussions, saying:\n\nWhere did we agree as ZANU PF people from the grassroots structures on coming up with this term extension resolution? Dont lie to us. It never happened.\n\nCiting the partys commitment to upholding the Zimbabwean constitution, the statement further rejected the notion of compromising democratic principles for political convenience.\n\nChiwenga Is the Future\n\nIn a decisive declaration, the group announced its support for Vice President General Constantino Chiwenga as the partys preferred candidate for the 2028 presidential race. The statement read:\n\nNext President is Rt Gen Vice President Chiwenga come 2028, and the rest is cheap propaganda.\n\nChiwenga, a key figure in the military intervention that brought Mnangagwa to power in 2017, is seen by some as a natural successor within ZANU PF ranks. The supporters rallied around him with slogans likeFamba Chiwenga Fambaand#GoreReGudoGuru(Year of the Mighty Baboon).\n\nParty in Turmoil\n\nThe development reveals deep divisions within ZANU PF as it grapples with questions over leadership succession and internal cohesion. Analysts say the public dissent highlights growing dissatisfaction with Mnangagwas leadership amid economic challenges and waning grassroots support.\n\nEfforts to reach Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi and ZANU PF spokespersons for comment were unsuccessful at the time of publication.\n\nThe next few weeks are expected to test ZANU PFs ability to navigate internal disagreements while maintaining a united front. For now, the battle lines appear drawn between those backing Mnangagwas extended rule and those who see Chiwenga as the partys future leader. ZimEye\n\n",
