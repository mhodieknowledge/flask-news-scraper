With just a few matches remaining, the result puts Eddie Howes men firmly on course for a coveted Champions League spot next season.\n\nBarnes, who came off the bench to devastating effect, scored twice within 30 minutes, sandwiching goals from Tonali and Guimares that showcased Newcastles dominance in midfield and attacking intent.\n\nThe Magpies form has been surging in recent weeks, and this landmark win further cements their reputation as serious contenders among Englands elite.\n\n",

The match is expected to draw large crowds, not just from Norton but also from surrounding areas, as fans flock to witness the debut of Premiership football at the revamped venue.\n\nThe development is seen as a boost for decentralising top-tier football, which has traditionally been concentrated in major cities like Harare and Bulawayo. It also provides MWOS with a true home advantage, having previously been forced to host matches away from Norton.\n\nLocal authorities and football stakeholders have praised the decision, saying it will not only elevate the profile of Norton but also inspire local talent and stimulate economic activity around the stadium.\n\nMore updates will follow as the big day approaches.\n\n",

Whether youre driving to the corner store or embarking on a cross-country journey, fastening your seatbelt should be second nature.\n\nIts Not OptionalIts the LawSeatbelt use is mandated by law in many countries, including Zimbabwe, and failure to comply can result in fines, license penalties, or worseserious injury or death. Statistics consistently show that seatbelts significantly reduce the risk of fatal injuries during car accidents.\n\nEvery Trip CountsNo Matter the DistanceMany people tend to neglect seatbelts on short trips, believing that the lower speed or familiar roads make them safe. But research proves otherwise. Most accidents occur within a short radius of a persons home. That means even a quick drive without a seatbelt could turn deadly.\n\nProtect the Little OnesChildren must be properly secured in age-appropriate car seats or booster seats every time they travel. These safety devices are specifically designed to protect young passengers, whose bodies are more vulnerable during collisions. As the campaign says: Children should be buckled on child booster seats. No exceptions.\n\nClick It Every TripMaking seatbelt use a habit is a small action with life-saving results. Every time you enter a vehicle, take a moment to buckle upand ensure everyone else does, too.\n\nIts Simple: Click It and Stay SafeRoad safety begins with you. The seatbelt is your first line of defense against the unexpected. So next time you get into a vehicle, remember: its not just about avoiding a ticketits about coming home alive.\n\nBuckle up.

            "content": "By A Correspondent | ZimEye| The High Court has nullified Sengezo Tshabangus expulsion from the Welshman Ncube-led Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC).\n\nTshabangu, who gained prominence after declaring himself the partys secretary general, was expelled earlier this year for removing several leaders from their parliamentary roles and appointing his own selections. A disciplinary committee, comprising Sesel Zvidzayi, Concillia Chinanzvavana, Gilbert Kagodora, and Shephered Mushonga, was established and subsequently expelled him from the party.\n\nTshabangu challenged the decision, filing a High Court application arguing that the disciplinary committee lacked authority because its members terms had expired. The judge ruled in his favor, noting that there was no valid opposition to his application. Welshman Ncube failed to provide proof of written authority from the respondent to depose the opposing affidavit, Justice Mary Zimba Dube stated, striking out the opposing affidavit and declaring the application unopposed.\n\nThe court further ruled that the terms of office for the first to fourth respondents and the main organs elected on 26 May 2019 expired on 27 May 2024, rendering their continued hold on office unlawful. The judge elaborated: Despite being made aware of the shortcomings in the resolution, no response or corrective action was forthcoming from the respondent. With no authority to defend this application, the opposing affidavit is struck out, rendering the application unopposed.\n\nConsequently, the court declined to address the respondents preliminary points or consider the defense on its merits, stating, The matter ends here. The judge declared the entire disciplinary process, including the committees meeting on 12 February 2025 at 60A Hibiscus Road, Lochnivar, Southerton, Harare, to address allegations of misconduct against Tshabangu, null and void, and set it aside.\n\nStatement on the Ruling by Judge President Dube in the Matter: Sengezo Tshabangu v Citizens Coalition for Change\n\n12 April 2025\n\nThe Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) notes the ruling delivered by Judge President Dube granting the order sought by Mr. Sengezo Tshabangu. We respectfully disagree with the judgment, which we strongly believe is not only fundamentally flawed but brings the name of the country into disrepute.\n\nAs a party, we maintain that we have a strong and compelling case. We believe the ruling is both legally and morally unsound, and we are determined to challenge it using all available legal avenues. To this end, we have instructed our lawyers to immediately appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nWe want to assure our members, supporters, and the people of Zimbabwe that the CCC remains steadfast and united. This judgment does not define our legitimacy, nor does it derail our mission to bring about democratic change and accountable leadership in our country.\n\nThe CCC was formed by the people, and no court ruling can erase that truth. We continue to stand on the side of justice, constitutionalism, and the sovereign will of Zimbabweans.\n\nWe urge our supporters to remain calm, resolute, and focused. Let us continue to organize, mobilize, and defend the democratic space peacefully and courageously. We are confident that the Supreme Court will deliver a ruling grounded in law, reason, and fairness.\n\nThe struggle continues, and we remain unwavering in our fight for a better Zimbabwe.\n\nFor and on behalf of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC)\n\nHon. Willias Madzimure (CCC Party Spokesperson)\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nFormer MDC stalwart and current political commentator Obert Chaurura Gutu has sparked controversy with his assertion that Zimbabwes opposition is no longer a serious political force.\n\nSpeaking over the weekend, Gutu boldly declared that credible opposition politics in Zimbabwe effectively ended with the death of former MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai in 2018.\n\nIm on record stating that serious & focused opposition politics in Zimbabwe died & was buried with Morgan Richard Tsvangirai at Humanikwa Village, Buhera, in February 2018, Gutu said. Zvimwe zvese izvi zvatiri kuvona kunongova kutungana kwembudzi chandiko. Childish skulduggery. Smoke & mirrors. Deception & utter nonsense. Maybe Zimbabwe will one day in the future have a serious opposition again, kwete these Tom & Jerry skits that were currently witnessing.\n\nHis remarks, which many see as dismissive and provocative, have drawn criticism from opposition figures and citizens alike, particularly supporters of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), the countrys leading opposition party.\n\nFormer CCC Youth Assembly spokesperson Stephen Sarkozy Chuma was quick to respond, dismissing Gutus comments as out of touch with the political climate in Zimbabwe.\n\nGutu is the one who is divorced from the reality on the ground, Chuma said. Every citizen is not happy with Mr Emmerson Mnangagwas administration. People are suffering, the economy is in shambles, and the ruling party continues to ignore the plight of ordinary Zimbabweans. The opposition remains relevant because it represents the frustrations and hopes of the people.\n\nChuma added that Gutus statements appear designed to undermine the growing public discontent with the government and distract from the oppositions ongoing efforts to push for democratic reforms.\n\nWhile Gutus comments have reignited debate around the state of Zimbabwes opposition, many observers say the countrys political landscape remains dynamic, with civil society, youth movements, and reform-minded politicians continuing to demand accountability and change.\n\n",

No medicine. No dignity. No hope.\n\nTatenda didnt just die from illness he died from a government that steals from the sick, that celebrates the rich while the poor perish.\n\nHe is a victim of roads that are not even car-worthy roads that break bodies and wreck lives.

A nation where the journey kills you and the destination buries you.\n\nLet this be a warning to those who are being handed posh cars as rewards for silence  if you crash on these roads, your death is guaranteed. Because the ambulances wont come. The hospitals wont help. The money meant to save your life is buying your car instead. And the rest is being siphoned to foreign bank accounts by cowards in suits who call themselves leaders.\n\nMeanwhile, the vultures in Parliament  from both ZANU PF and the makeshift opposition  sit fat and quiet.

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nTension and speculation are gripping parts of Masvingo Province after revelations that the man who died during a ceremony hosted by First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa was not the legitimate Chief Nyajena, but allegedly a politically appointed imposter.\n\nAccording to ZANU PF insiders, the late Tungamirai, who collapsed and died at the Rupike Irrigation Scheme event, had been hand-picked by President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration to pose as Chief Nyajena, bypassing traditional protocols. A senior party source revealed, The real Chief Nyajena is alive. Tungamirai was a political imposition, not the rightful heir to the Nyajena chieftaincy. This was done out of political favoritism, and now it has backfired in a very public and spiritual way.\n\nThe legitimate Chief Nyajena has come forward to clarify the situation, saying, I am alive and well. I have been receiving condolence messages from people who think I am the one who died. This has caused distress in my community and among my relatives.\n\nThe incident has sparked spiritual unease among locals, who believe the death is a result of violating traditional norms. The Nyajena chieftaincy belongs to the Moyo totem, the same royal lineage as the legendary King Munhumutapa, and is regarded with deep reverence in traditional structures.\n\nDisturbing Claims Surrounding Tungamirai Family\n\nReports suggest that two other family members, previously imposed as Chief Nyajena under questionable circumstances, also died under mysterious conditions.\n\nA traditional elder from the area noted, These arent coincidences. The chieftaincy is sacred. If the proper rituals and ancestral blessings are not followed, there are spiritual consequences. You cant just impose someone into a position that is spiritually governed.\n\nThe incident has reignited debate about political interference in traditional leadership and the importance of respecting cultural customs in Zimbabwe.\n\n",
