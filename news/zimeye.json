            "content": "By A Correspondent- At least 15 people have died, and 785 households mostly in the Midlands Provincehave been ravaged by unrelenting rains in Zimbabwe.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa hails from the same province.\n\nThe devastation, spanning multiple provinces since September last year, has also severely impacted infrastructure, with 118 schools and 13 health facilities damaged, leaving communities vulnerable and services disrupted.\n\nThe Midlands bears the brunt, with 433 households affected, followed by Manicaland (181), Masvingo (46), and Matabeleland North (47).\n\nAmong the hardest-hit facilities is Muponjane Primary School in Zvishavane, where a powerful January 11 storm caused significant damage, exacerbating classroom shortages.\n\nRepair costs are estimated at $8,120, highlighting the financial strain on local institutions.\n\nTwo men remain stranded in Runde River as water levels rise dangerously, prompting urgent rescue missions.\n\nMeanwhile, artisanal miners have faced fatal disasters. In Hwedza, three miners perished in a mine shaft collapse on December 27, with bodies retrieved a week later.\n\nA similar tragedy struck in Mberengwa last Thursday, claiming two lives, while in Mudzi District, three miners remain trapped underground, despite a 24-hour rescue operation led by police, army, and emergency officials.\n\nFlash floods have compounded the crisis, inundating homes in Mbare, Harare, on January 8, underscoring the citys persistent drainage problems.\n\nIn Mashonaland Central, a January 7 storm devastated Avonda Farm, displacing 11 households. Emergency reliefrice, tinned beef, and sanitizershas been distributed, but the response highlights the broader gaps in disaster preparedness.\n\nZimbabwes vulnerabilities to natural disasters have been laid bare, with insufficient infrastructure, poor planning, and stretched resources leaving communities at risk.\n\nAs heavy rains continue, more lives and livelihoods hang in the balance.\n\nWithout comprehensive disaster management reforms, these tragedies may persist, deepening the cycle of destruction and loss.\n\n",

            "content": "By Business Reporter | ZimEye |As the world rapidly evolves into the era of artificial intelligence (AI), job and business opportunities in AI-related fields are booming in the UK and other Western nations. From AI research and development to quantum computing and applications in various industries, a wealth of opportunities has emerged for individuals and businesses alike. Billionaire entrepreneur Strive Masiyiwa is encouraging the global community, particularly Africans, to engage with this wave of innovation by following leaders like Dr. James Manyika.\n\nDr. Manyika, a Zimbabwean-born tech visionary, currently serves as Senior Vice President of Research, Technology, and Society at Google-Alphabet. His work spans advanced AI innovations, quantum computing, and exploring how AI intersects with society. Masiyiwas recent Facebook post highlighted Manyikas inspiring journey and his contributions to global AI advancements, urging others to recognize and learn from great African leaders like him.\n\nMasiyiwas #ShoutOut is part of a broader initiative to spotlight African scientists, researchers, academics, and innovators on the global stage. In his post, he emphasized the importance of celebrating African talent outside traditional areas like politics, sports, and music, focusing instead on the hidden trailblazers driving global progress in science and technology.\n\nAI Job Growth in the UK and Beyond\n\nThe UK, a global leader in AI innovation, has seen an exponential rise in job openings in AI-related fields. These include roles in machine learning, data analysis, robotics, and quantum computing. With companies like Google DeepMind based in the UK, opportunities for skilled professionals and entrepreneurs to contribute to cutting-edge projects have never been more abundant.\n\nThe Western AI ecosystem offers roles ranging from research scientists and software engineers to product managers focusing on AI solutions. Many organizations are also seeking partnerships with startups, creating fertile ground for entrepreneurs to launch AI-driven ventures.\n\nAfrican Representation in AI\n\nMasiyiwas call to action resonates at a time when global AI development requires diverse perspectives to ensure inclusive growth. He pointed out that Manyikas first foray into AI was a paper on neural networks, written while studying in Zimbabwea testament to Africas potential to produce world-class talent.\n\nMasiyiwas broader message is clear: there is an untapped pool of African talent with the ability to lead in global technology advancements. His vision includes not only celebrating existing leaders like Manyika but also inspiring young Africans to explore opportunities in AI and related fields.\n\nMasiyiwas Digital Inclusion Announcement\n\nMasiyiwa is set to make a significant announcement about digital inclusion at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 21, 2025. While details remain under wraps, he hinted that the initiative would focus on expanding access to technology and empowering underrepresented communities, potentially opening up more opportunities for African participation in global technology development.\n\nEncouragement to Act\n\nMasiyiwas message also challenges individuals to look inward, highlighting that the next tech pioneer could be anyone willing to embrace curiosity and perseverance. His post reflects his belief in the power of education, mentorship, and collaboration to unlock opportunities in the AI sector.\n\nThe billionaires commitment to nurturing African talent and promoting digital inclusion comes at a pivotal moment. As the world embraces the AI revolution, the need for diverse perspectives and global collaboration has never been more urgent.\n\nFor those inspired by Dr. Manyikas story, the time to act is now. Whether through upskilling, entrepreneurial ventures, or joining AI-driven organizations, the opportunities are vast for those ready to take the leap.\n\n#AIRevolution #GlobalInclusion #TechLeadership\n\n",

We have the numbers to ensure a smooth implementation of our party resolutions. We must remain united, maintain discipline, and be mindful of our social media use, Ziyambi said.\n\nHe highlighted the presidents initiatives benefiting ordinary citizens, including solving the land issue through title deed issuance. This development comes as ZANU PF intensifies efforts to achieve Mnangagwas 2030 vision, with other provinces like Midlands also reaffirming their commitment to the agenda .\n\n",

The move aims to improve the appearance of its cities, but it has sparked widespread outrage among animal rights activists.\n\nAccording to reports, Morocco already kills around 300,000 street dogs every year. However, the practice has intensified since FIFA announced Morocco as a co-host for the 2030 tournament.

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Zanu PF leader, Emmerson Mnangagwa, five years ago reportedly plotted to remain in office beyond his constitutionally mandated term in 2028, as revealed in a resurfaced video clip.\n\nIn the video, Mnangagwa boldly states: 2030 Ndinenge Ndichipo (In 2030, I will still be here), which many have interpreted as a clear indication that he had long been planning to extend his presidency.\n\nHis declaration has sparked concerns over his intentions to bypass the countrys constitutional limits, which restrict the president to two terms in office.\n\nThe video footage suggests that Mnangagwas desire to remain in power is not a recent development, but rather a plan he has been nurturing for years. In the clip, he confidently asserts, 2030 Ndinenge Ndichipo, implying that he intended to either amend or sidestep constitutional provisions to extend his rule.\n\nIn recent months, Zanu PF has ramped up its push for the postponement of elections until 2030, further intensifying fears that Mnangagwa may be maneuvering to extend his term beyond 2028.\n\nThe calls for a delay are seen by many as part of a broader strategy to secure Mnangagwas continued hold on power, potentially leading to a violation of Zimbabwes constitution.\n\nOpposition groups and legal experts have criticized the move, labeling it as an attempt to undermine democratic principles. The presidents statement from five years ago now makes sense, given the partys calls for election delays, said one opposition leader.\n\nThis is not just about securing political advantage, but also about manipulating constitutional processes for personal gain.\n\nAs political tensions rise, Mnangagwas supporters argue that such measures are necessary to maintain political stability and continue pursuing long-term development goals, but critics warn that this could erode trust in the countrys democratic institutions.\n\nWith the 2030 deadline approaching, all eyes are on Mnangagwa and Zanu PFs next moves as they continue to push for changes that could extend his rule far beyond the original constitutional limits.\n\n",

Bongani Khuphe, affectionately known asMperi Wegumbo Gulu,was a prominent Campaign Champion for CCC during the recent 2023 harmonised elections, fervently supporting Senator Solani Moyo and parliamentary candidate Bekezela Maplanka.\n\nFollowing a severe road traffic accident, Khuphe urgently requires $3,000 to undergo a second surgery after complications arose from the first procedure. Despite Khuphes tireless efforts in favor of the CCC, the partys support has been woefully inadequate since the elections, during which Moyo was elected Senator while Maplanka lost her seat to Dingimuzi Phuti.\n\nIn the six months since the accident, fundraising initiatives have only managed to collect a meager $500, leaving Khuphe in a desperate situation. His relative, Kudzani Khuphe, expressed profound disappointment in the partys lack of support. We have a WhatsApp group for donations, yet only $500 has been raised in over six months. What hurts the most is that party officials, including elected ones, have not contributed a single cent, Kudzani lamented.\n\nHe pointed out the irony of Senator Moyo exiting the donation group without contributing while Maplanka has been seen providing assistance to wealthier individuals. Nja Emnyama, wake eli mugroup but wakabuda esatjidza ne tjimwe. Maplanka towa kuyi she is donating things to already rich people but akuna kene lubhatso gwa akasa kumwe wabo, Kudzani stated, highlighting the stark contrast between the support received by Khuphe and that given to others by the partys officials.\n\nAttempts to reach Senator Solani Moyo for comment were unsuccessful, and Bekezela Maplankas phone was unreachable. Ironically, Maplanka was reportedly seen donating goods at Solusi University last week, raising questions about her priorities and commitment to those who stood by her during the election campaign.\n\nKhuphe has been a crucial figure in mobilizing support for the CCC, even showcasing Kalanga poetry during numerous rallies addressed by party leader Nelson Chamisa across Bulilima. In an interview, he confided that he is struggling to gather the necessary funds, saying that trusted friends have been disappearing into thin air.\n\nI am appealing to well-wishers to help me with donations for my surgery as I am in extreme pain. Those who wish to help can contact me at +263 78 347 5211, Khuphe urgently requested.\n\nAs the days pass, the threat of amputation looms ever closer for Khuphe, while Senator Solani Moyo remains in Parliament, seemingly oblivious to the plight of a once-loyal supporter championing the 2030 vision.\n\n",
