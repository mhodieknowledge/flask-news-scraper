            "content": "Sports Correspondent\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola has admitted that there are multiple underlying factors contributing to his teams poor results, beyond just injuries.\n\nCity suffered another defeat in the Premier League on Saturday, losing 2-1 to Aston Villa. Guardiolas side had a difficult start, conceding an early goal from Jhon Duran, and Villa extended their lead in the second half with a goal from Morgan Rogers. Phil Fodens stoppage-time goal was only a consolation.\n\nThe loss saw Manchester City drop to sixth place in the league, now nine points behind leaders Liverpool.\n\nGuardiola reflected on the performance, saying, Of course, there are more reasons. We concede goals we didnt concede in the past, and were not scoring the goals we used to. Football isnt about one single reason; there are many small factors at play.\n\nHe continued, Aston Villa are performing well in both the Champions League and Premier League. Its a tough place to visit. Last season, we won the Premier League, but we lost here.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Guardiola expressed confidence in his team, adding, We must remain positive. I have immense trust in these players. Some have incredible pride and a strong desire to succeed. We need to find a way, step by step, to turn things around.\n\n",

            "content": "Mozambique: Daniel Chapo declared as the President of Mozambique with approximately 65% of the vote.\n\nBy A Correspondent | ZimEye | \nMaputo, Mozambique  Monday, December 23, 2024\nMozambiques Constitutional Council addressed the nation today, offering explanations for the delays in validating the results of the recent general elections, citing an overwhelming number of complaints and discrepancies. The Council, led by President Lucia Ribeiro, provided detailed responses to each complaint and appeal, shedding light on the contentious issues surrounding the electoral process.\n\n\nElection Complaints and Irregularities\n\nLucia Ribeiro began by outlining the context of the elections, including the total number of registered voters and the turnout rates. She acknowledged discrepancies in voter numbers, which opposition parties and civil society groups have flagged as potential indicators of fraud. Notably, civil society observers refused to share their reports, citing fears of being implicated in what they described as a fraudulent process.\n\nSubsequently, on November 20, 2024, one appeal from the Podemos party was submitted to the National Elections Commission (CNE), invoking the annulment of presidential election results in the diaspora in the Republic of Zimbabwe for alleged irregularities. The request in question was rejected due to lack of evidence and failure to meet procedural requirements, said Ribeiro.\n\nOpposition Concerns and Civil Society Stance\n\nThe opposition has been vocal in its criticism of the election process, with multiple appeals submitted to the Constitutional Council. The President of the Council described the content of these appeals as varied but largely focused on discrepancies in voter data and procedural flaws.\n\nAdding to the complexity, civil society organizations have refused to cooperate fully, arguing that they do not want to legitimize what they perceive as a flawed election process. This refusal has further strained the credibility of the electoral outcome.\n\nElection Results Announced\n\nAmid the controversies, the Constitutional Council officially declared Daniel Chapo as the President of Mozambique with approximately 65% of the vote. This figure marks a decrease from earlier projections, which had placed his support at 70%. The adjustment in numbers was attributed to ongoing scrutiny of voter data.\n\n\n\nCalls for Shutdown and Growing Tensions\n\nCommunicating hours before the announcement, opposition candidate Venncio Mondlane called for a nationwide five-day shutdown starting Monday. He urged citizens to protest what he described as a deeply compromised election process. The call for action has sparked concerns over potential unrest in the days ahead.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs Mozambique grapples with the aftermath of its contentious election, the Constitutional Council has pledged to provide clarity on each complaint and appeal. However, with civil societys refusal to engage and the opposition mobilizing public protests, the path forward remains uncertain.\n\nThe nation now waits to see how the government and opposition will navigate this critical juncture in Mozambiques democratic journey.- ZimEye\n\nSubsequently, on 20 Nov 2024, 1 resource from the Podemos party entered the CNE, invoking the annulment of presidential elections results in the diaspora in the Republic of Zimbabwe for alleged irregularities, the request in question was rejected due to impunity and lack of priorpic.twitter.com/S9LT8rN8sL\n\n",

Yet for Mary Chiwenga, the former wife of Zimbabwes Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, this season carries a heavy weight. Mary is facing the Christmas without her children, who are spending the holiday with their unforgiving father.\n\nMary is now perceived by many as a helpless woman grappling with a life of emotional and psychological distress under the weight of her husbands political authority. While Vice President Chiwenga stands tall in the public eye, his wifes narrative unfolds in the whispers of the streets and the concerned tones of local activists, where discussions grow around her deteriorating circumstances.\n\nEven some churches are saying people must pray for Mary who continue to suffer in the hands of his ruthless exhusband. Some are even calling for for help as she is agonizing.\n\nThis separation has ignited discussions within womens organizations and local churches, expressing solidarity with Mary while criticizing the system that has led to her current grief.\n\nDespite her efforts, she has been unable to see her children, who are currently in the custody of her powerful and politically connected husband.\n\nHer arm and leg was amputed this year but his unforgiving husband continue to cause more pain by denying her acesss to her kids.\n\nThe couples marriage has been marred by controversy, with Mary Chiwenga alleging abuse and mistreatment.\n\nChiwengas plight has sparked widespread sympathy. Many have taken to social media to express their support for her, using hashtags such as #JusticeForMaryChiwenga.\n\nSome members of the community have been vocal about their disappointment in Vice President Chiwenga, calling for him to engage more constructively with Mary and to prioritize the well-being of their children.\n\nChildren deserve stability and love from both parents, asserts a representative from a certain women organisation who refused to be mentioned. During these holidays, they should not be caught in political games but rather be surrounded by love.\n\nThis collective voice adds to a growing sentiment among activists calling for greater accountability among public figures in relation to their familial duties.\n\n",

Another added, Hwengweres glowing review conveniently ignores the lives destroyed by the CIO under Bonyongwe. This reeks of a PR exercise.\n\nThe books defenders argue that Bonyongwes willingness to share personal struggles and agonies signals a genuine attempt to humanise himself and his experiences.\n\nThey claim his story offers valuable lessons on leadership, resilience, and the complexities of governance in a country as polarised as Zimbabwe.\n\nHowever, detractors counter that the memoirs timing and promotional strategy suggest a calculated move to rehabilitate Bonyongwes image in post-Mugabe Zimbabwe.\n\nAs a former top official in a repressive regime, they argue, Bonyongwe has a vested interest in shaping how history remembers him.\n\nHwengweres suggestion that the book couldbe adaptedinto a movie is not far-fetched.\n\nThe narrativesteeped in power, intrigue, and personal strugglehas all the makings of a political thriller.\n\nYet, the question remains: will it be a balanced portrayal of history or a one-sided tale that glosses over inconvenient truths?\n\n",
