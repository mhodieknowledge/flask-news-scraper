The announcement of his hero status was met with widespread praise from family, colleagues, and former collaborators, who gathered to pay their respects to a man hailed as a dedicated public servant and media professional.\n\nHis son,Mr Christmas Goredema, expressed the familys appreciation for the national recognition:\n\nWe want to thank the President for conferring our father with a liberation hero status. It gives us comfort as a family to know that our father played a pivotal role in the countrys history. He was a caring father who was also dedicated to his work.\n\nChegutu East MP and ZANU PF Deputy Political Commissar  Webster Shamudescribed Goredema as a patriot and urged the younger generation to carry forward the mission of economic emancipation.\n\nPeople like Cde Goredema and other departed heroes fought for the independence of this nation. The onus is now on the youth to be disciplined and take the nation forward. We worked with Cde Goredema at ZBC to push our own Zimbabwean agenda.\n\nGoredema is also remembered for his long service atRadio 3 (now Power FM), where he worked as a presenter and producer between 1979 and 1983, before moving to theNational Museums and Monuments of Zimbabwe (NMMZ)in 1984. There, he served asPrincipal Public Relations Officeruntil 2018, playing a key role in theNational Heroes Burial Process.

            "content": "By A Correspondent Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube has inadvertently lifted the lid on the staggering scale of looting and financial opacity surrounding President Emmerson Mnangagwas government, revealing that the controversial Trabablas Interchange in Harare cost Zimbabweans a jaw-dropping US$114 millionfar beyond the originally stated US$88 million.\n\nUnder parliamentary pressure, Ncube was forced to provide a detailed account of how the project, previously known as the Mbudzi Roundabout, ballooned in cost. The new revelations have reinforced allegations of inflated tenders, unapproved expenditures, and deep-rooted corruption within Mnangagwas inner circle.\n\nInitially, government reports claimed the interchange was funded by an US$88 million loan from Fossil Mines (Pvt) Ltdan entity with reported ties to Mnangagwas alliescombined with allocations from Zimbabwes International Monetary Fund (IMF) Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). The loan, signed on December 6, 2021, carried an interest rate of LIBOR plus 5% per annum under the Public Debt Management Act.\n\nHowever, MPs from across the aisle, including Descent Bajila (Citizens Coalition for Change), grilled Ncube over unexplained budget escalations and demanded clarity on the projects true cost. What emerged was an admission that, in addition to the US$88 million, Treasury spent another US$26 milliontaken from Zimbabwes SDRsraising the final price tag to US$114 million.\n\nPressed for details, Ncube offered vague justifications, citing unforeseen project variations such as the relocation of affected residents and additional infrastructure components like 12 new bridges. He claimed US$65.5 million went toward core civil works, including storm drainage, road signs, erosion protection, and foundational structures.\n\nYet MPs were left unconvinced. Prosper Mutseyami (Chikanga) challenged the logic behind the so-called variations, arguing that such major cost escalations should have required fresh parliamentary approval.\n\nMore troubling, Mbizo MP Coborn Madzivanyika exposed contradictions in Ncubes statements. The US$26 million, originally described as a down payment, was now being repositioned as a budget overruneffectively masking an illegal overspend. Madzivanyika questioned how the Finance Ministry had unilaterally extended itself beyond Parliaments approved borrowing threshold.\n\nIn response, Ncube claimed sweeping powers under the Public Finance Management Act, insisting he did not need to return to Parliament for further authorisationan assertion critics say signals a dangerous erosion of legislative oversight under Mnangagwas watch.\n\nThe saga surrounding the Trabablas Interchangesymbolically renamed by critics to reflect the chaos of Zimbabwes governancehas become a glaring emblem of elite plunder, shady financing, and the Mnangagwa administrations disregard for accountability.\n\nAs public outrage grows over deteriorating public services, economic stagnation, and runaway inflation, the US$114 million Trabablas project is being seen not as a symbol of progress, but as a monument to state-sanctioned looting.\n\nAsk ChatGPT\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nHARARE  President Emmerson Mnangagwa has donated US$100,000 in cash to the Zimbabwe national rugby team, the Sables, ahead of their Africa Cup semi-final against Kenya this Sunday.\n\nThe gesture, made at a State House ceremony on Thursday, comes with bold promises of government supportbut many Zimbabweans are questioning whether its genuine backing for sport or just another calculated political performance.\n\nBe assured that the nation is supporting you, Mnangagwa told the Zimbabwe Rugby Union delegation.\n\nThe Government will continue to support you, and I, your President, am confident in your dedication and sporting abilities.\n\nHe went further: Go out there and make Zimbabwe proud. I have prepared monetary tokens to assist you in your preparations.\n\nBut away from the polished speeches and photo ops, the donation has sparked debateif not outright anger. Why, many ask, is such a large sum being handed to a single sports team while hospitals remain under-equipped, teachers are underpaid, and civil servants struggle to survive on wages eroded by inflation?\n\nObservers point out that the president has been largely absent on issues affecting everyday Zimbabweans, yet has found timeand cashfor a well-timed donation with guaranteed media attention.\n\nTheres always money for a photo opportunity, said one Harare resident. But when nurses ask for gloves or families beg for clean water, theres no budget.\n\nOthers are also questioning the source of the money. Is it public money being used for political branding? Or is the president so personally flush with cash that he can casually pull out US$100,000 while the rest of the country sinks deeper into economic distress?\n\nThe Sables are defending champions of the Africa Cup, and a win on Sunday would place them one game away from qualifying for the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia. But the fear is that the team may now be caught in the middle of a political gameused as pawns to project a caring image of leadership ahead of future elections.\n\nWhile support for national sport is welcome, critics argue that this kind of ad hoc, high-profile handout lacks vision. Theres no national rugby development plan. No sustained investment in facilities. No funding for rural teams or forgotten sporting disciplines. Just cash, cameras, and carefully crafted quotes.\n\nFor the players, the focus remains on qualifying for the World Cup. But for many Zimbabweans, Mnangagwas donation rings hollowanother performance by a leader whose priorities appear more about optics than outcomes.\n\nIn a country with collapsing infrastructure, deepening poverty, and mounting unrest, the presidents US$100,000 gesture feels less like leadershipand more like a headline stunt.\n\n",

Demonstrating humility and respect, he sat on the ground, embodying the spirit of Ubuntu.\n\nHowever, party insiders have alleged that Zanu PF offered cash and various freebies to Chief Tshovani in exchange for his political backing, a move widely condemned as a blatant violation of constitutional provisions governing traditional authorities.\n\nWhen asked about these allegations, Mavhenyengwa dismissed the bribery claims, stating, Our presence here is about unity and progress for the community. We respect the role of our traditional leaders and seek their moral support, not through inducements but through shared goals.\n\nDespite these denials, the controversy raises concerns about the politicization of traditional leadership and the fairness of the electoral process in Chiredzi East.\n\n",
