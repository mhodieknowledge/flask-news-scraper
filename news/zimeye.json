Being around children and seeing people come and go reminds us that we are still part of the world outside. Thisprogrammemeans a lot, he said.\n\nHis wife, Rejoice Moyo, said the visit allowed the family to reconnect and discuss important matters,bringing her relief.\n\nSuperintendent Ishmael Madzimbamuto, Officer-in-Charge at Gwanda Prison, said theprogrammereceived a strong response, with around 100 visitors received daily.

Dr. Obert Mpofu, hereby advises all members of the postponement of the Politburo meeting announced for Friday 2nd May 2025. The meeting will be heldon a later dateto be advised, read the statement.\n\nNo explanation was given at the time.\n\nHowever, it later emerged that the decision coincided with the sudden scheduling of the burial of national hero Air Vice Marshal (Rtd) WinnieMandeya, who passed away on Monday, April 28.\n\nThe burial, held on Friday at the National Heroes Acre, caught many by surprise  not only for itstiming,butfor the speed at which preparations were made,effectivelyoverridingwhat had been billed as a key Politburo session.\n\nMandeya, a respected liberation war veteran and long-serving military officer, had only been declared a national hero on Wednesday evening.\n\nGovernment sources say her burial date was not initially fixed for Friday, raising questions about whether the event was used as a pretext to cancel the high-stakes Politburo gathering.\n\nThe sudden cancellation has fueledrumoursof serious behind-the-scenes wrangling within the party.\n\nWith no clear explanationprovided, insiders suspect the meeting was shelved due to unresolved tensions over critical issues  including succession dynamics, power consolidation, and realignments within the Central Committee and Politburo.\n\nThe Politburo is the highest decision-making body in Zanu PF outside of Congress, and it plays a crucial role in determining national policy direction and internal party strategy.\n\nSources had anticipated heated discussions over recent electoral performance critiques, growing grassroots dissatisfaction, and President Mnangagwas reported succession plans.\n\nThe postponement, coupled with the rushed burial ofMandeya, has led some political analysts to conclude that the party may be struggling to maintain internal cohesion amid rising factionalism.\n\nThere is no doubt the Politburo meeting was set to be contentious, said one political commentator. Cancelling it infavourof a hastily-arranged burial for a hero who died four days earlier suggests the leadership needed to defuse a looming confrontation  or at least buy time.\n\n",

He explained that the absence of tithes has left him unable to reference a standard contribution amount, compelling him to draw on anecdotes from secular figures in Zimbabwes economy.\n\nProphet Wutaunashe threatens to attack Britain with flood and earthquake after losing tithe money.By A Correspondent | ZimEye | Descending into religious-hate-speech against the country he has visited, Family Of God Church founder Prophet Andrew Wutaunashe, yesterday expressedpic.twitter.com/VvcmusnVnw\n\nThe development comes at a time when the preacher has also revealed that his church has split up in Botswana, following another damning scandal that erupted soon after he demanded a brand new car from church-folk. (Video).\n\nOpen your eyes. Hallelujah, open your minds, become aggressive. One of the things were seeing in Zimbabwe is people with no relationship with God playing with money. Amen. And people get angry and say, They stole that money, whenever they see someone with wealth, Wutaunashe, who was religiously initiated into the TB Joshua cults in the late 1970s, told his congregation. \n\nDont fool yourself into thinking it was all stolen. Yes, some stealI know that. But there are many in Zimbabwe who have real moneynot in a suitcase, but in a room, stacks of cash halfway up the wall. And its not stolen; theyre selling gold every week. Amen.\n\nHe continued, I mean, whats the goal? Youre here, working for a month, and I dont even know your take-homebecause most of you dont tithe, anyway, you understand? If you did, I could calculate. But look: someone back in Zimbabwe, in that economy, is walking with his people, in awe. Someone like you. Every week. And when he has a little money, he comes back from where they sell it with USD 100,000in one week!\n\nThe prophets remarks have stirred debate among his followers. Some interpret his sermon as a plea for renewed financial commitment, while others view it as an attempt to shame congregants into giving. His references to Zimbabwes gold trade and wealth accumulation have also sparked skepticism, given the economic challenges facing that nation and the disconnect with his UK-based audience.\n\nWutaunashes church, once a focal point for Zimbabwean expatriates in Leeds, has seen declining attendance in recent years, a trend some link to his past controversies. It remains unclear whether his latest appeal will inspire a return to tithing, but for now, the prophet relies on distant examples to underscore his message.\n\nZimEye observed the man addressing a house stashed with congregants who are well known business and various professionals based in West Yorkshire, as they sat in between empty chairs for over 7 hours on Saturday.\n\nHe later descended into hate speech against the UK, threatening the country he has visited with destruction.\n\nHe stated as follows:\n\nAmen. But I wanted you to understanddont wait for thefires to come. You hear people screaming and praying, shouting hallelujah when the fires are already at their door. Amen.\n\nhttps://x.com/zimeye/status/1918993967263154658?s=46\n\nAnd I know sometimes we depend on little countries like this one to come and hide. But this country is a dangerous place. The problem with this countryyesterday, when I was with Bishop Majonga, he showed me a bridge. When I was here last time, I said, Lets pray against the pestilence of the last days. Remember? The next day, there were floods in Leeds.\n\nIn case you dont know where Leeds isThats where we are right now. So Bishop Majonga told me, Gods telling me to move to the left lane. And you know those bridges that are above your head, the ones you pass under? The water was reaching the top. Thats what hes sayingthis island can disappear in one day.\n\nJust one serious flood,and youll find pieces of Britain washing up in South Africa.\n\nDont have false security.The UK is not our fortress. It is not our refuge. God is our refuge.\n\nWutaunashes campaign against UK is not the first, and in 2021, he publicly told the Archbishop Of Canterbury that the British Govt has no conscience for the poor.\n\nCommenting over this, news analyst Howard Nyoni stated as follows-\n\nHoward Nyoni: When a man lives in Zimbabwe, comes to the UK, and then makes a negative statement about the UKits not a godly act. Why threaten a country that has done you no wrong? He should be focusing on Zimbabwe. What exactly has the UK done to him for him to wish it a flood or some catastrophic event?\n\nFrankly, theres no point in him continuing as a preacher or as a so-called man of God if he spreads negativity like this. A preacher should bring hope, not doom. What connection do floods have with the UK in this context? Again I ask: what has the UK done to deserve such statements?\n\nInterviewer: He claims to have accurately prophesied a flood that affected a bridge in Leeds. Doesnt that at least lend some credibility to what hes saying now?\n\nNyoni:\n\nLook, even if he mentioned a specific bridge in Leeds and says it happened, I dont buy it. I know him as a false prophet. Whatever he utters will never truly come to pass. Hes using biblical languagesurebut floods are not unique to the UK. The Bible itself states that in the last days, floods will occur everywhere: Zimbabwe, the UK, America, Pakistan, Australiayou name it. This is not exclusive to his prophetic insight.\n\nFloods are a global phenomenon. Theyre not tied to one mans spiritual authority or his supposed powers.\n\nInterviewer: Are you saying he has an agenda behind these declarations? Or are you simply calling him out for being false?\n\nNyoni: In conclusion, most preachers who push a negative narrative about the UK do so because they fundamentally dislike it. Let me be blunt: Satan himself hates the UK. Why? Because in the UK, theres freedomfreedom of speech, freedom of expression, real democracy. Elections here are transparent. Things are open in a way they are not in Zimbabwe.\n\nSo when someone like Andrewthis so-called prophetstarts attacking the UK, its not just about weather events. He has a negative agenda. He knows that Zimbabweans in the UK are exposing his dirty tricks. Thats his real issue.  ZimEye\n\n",
