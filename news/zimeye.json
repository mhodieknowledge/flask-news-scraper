The decision was made following accusations of indiscipline and going against the partys constitution.\n\nZANU PF Politburo member Ziyambi Ziyambi addressed the media following the meeting, claiming that the leadership within the party remains solid and united. He further emphasized the commitment of the presidium, which includes President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Vice Presidents Kembo Mohadi and General (Retired) Constantino Chiwenga. Ziyambi rejected claims of internal conflict, asserting that the trio has never been involved in any form of discord.\n\nThe leadership is solid, Ziyambi said. President Mnangagwa and his two Vice Presidents are united beyond measure. There has never been a day when they engaged in any form of conflict or tension.\n\nZiyambi also took aim at those he described as rogue elements, such as Geza, who, according to him, sought to represent their personal opinions as the official stance of the party leadership.

We are also calling for the stripping of his Central Committee position, as his actions go against what the party expects from its leaders.\n\nZANU PFs Deputy Political Commissar Webster Shamu also spoke on the importance of adhering to the partys constitution, noting that the decision to expel Geza was not taken lightly.\n\nWe are a party of principle and ideology, and we must follow our constitution.

The closure is reportedly linked to the temporary suspension of US funding for Africa, a development that has sent shockwaves through the community.\n\nIn an official public notice released on Wednesday, the New Start Centre confirmed the closure.\n\nThe announcement has left many individuals who rely on the centres services uncertain about their next steps, particularly those who are due for antiretroviral treatment (ART) or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) refills.\n\nThese treatments are vital for individuals living with HIV, and the disruption has raised alarms over the potential health consequences.\n\nA New Start Centre employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expressed frustration at the situation, saying, Its not looking good, our clients are stranded. We have to wait and see, our hands are tied.\n\nThe closure comes at a time when global health initiatives are facing increasing financial constraints, particularly due to the temporary withdrawal of US funding for African health programs.\n\nThis funding, which supports a variety of health services across the continent, has been crucial in providing care and treatment for people living with HIV and AIDS.\n\nThe closure of the Masvingo office raises concerns about the broader impact on the regions public health efforts, with many people now left to seek alternative care from local health facilities. However, there is uncertainty about whether these facilities are equipped to handle the increased demand.\n\nWhile the New Start Centre has assured the public that assistance can be sought from nearby health facilities, the employees statement reveals the frustration and confusion felt by both staff and clients during this difficult time.\n\nFor now, the future of the Masvingo office remains unclear, and many are left hoping for a swift resolution to ensure that those in need of critical health services do not fall through the cracks.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nMalawis President Lazarus Chakwera has directed the Malawi Defence Force (MDF) to begin preparations for the withdrawal of its troops from the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) following the recent deaths of three soldiers in combat.\n\nThe Malawian troops are part of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC), a regional initiative established to assist the country in combating armed insurgents. The mission was extended by SADC towards the end of 2024.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, February 5, the Government of Malawi confirmed the plans to withdraw its troops from the DRC. The statement read:\n\nPresident Chakwera has ordered the MDF (Malawi Defense Force) commander to begin preparations for the withdrawal of Malawian troops to honour the declaration of a ceasefire by the warring parties there and to pave the way for their planned negotiations towards a lasting peace.\n\nMalawis Information Minister, Moses Kunkuyu, told the BBC Newsday programme that the planned withdrawal was made in good faith. He added that a meeting of southern African leaders held last week in Tanzania, alongside the Africa Energy Summit, resulted in a resolution calling for a ceasefire from all parties involved in the conflict. This decision was made to create space for peaceful negotiations. Kunkuyu explained:\n\nIt is pursuant to that agreement that the president of Malawi has seen it fit to contribute to the peace-building effort by withdrawing troops from the region so that there is that peaceful negotiation.\n\nThough the withdrawal date has not been specified, Kunkuyu indicated that only the operational aspects remained to be finalized.\n\nHe also mentioned that the decision had been communicated to both the president of the DRC and the Southern African bloc.\n\nThe Malawian president has been under pressure to pull out the countrys forces following the deaths of peacekeepers. Similarly, South Africa has faced calls for troop withdrawal, but President Cyril Ramaphosa has pledged to keep South African troops in the DRC, as they are part of the SAMIDRC mission, which has set operational timelines and an end date.\n\nMalawi, Tanzania, and South Africa have all lost soldiers in the ongoing conflict in the DRC, particularly during clashes with the M23 rebel group in the eastern region.\n\nIn related developments, a rebel alliance, including M23 fighters, declared a ceasefire on Tuesday for humanitarian reasons.\n\n",

The message claims that MPs have been given $150,000, new vehicles, free import duty for cars, serviced residential stands, and increased salaries as part of a broader political strategy leading up to 2030.\n\nThe message further suggests that these perks were designed to secure loyalty, particularly among opposition MPs, hinting at a move to consolidate political power ahead of the next major elections.\n\nAdditionally, the message references prominent businessman Wicknell Chivayo, alleging that he is involved in distributing financial incentives to politicians. The phrase politicians wanofa ne cash (politicians are drowning in money) underscores the perception of a cash-fueled political landscape.\n\nWhile these claims remain unverified, they have sparked public outcry, with concerns about corruption, governance ethics, and political co-optation. As Zimbabwe continues to grapple with economic challenges, revelations of such large sums of money being channeled towards MPs could fuel further debate on government priorities.\n\nAwaiting Official Response\n\nThere has been no official government response to these allegations yet. However, if confirmed, this development could have far-reaching implications for Zimbabwes political dynamics leading up to 2030.\n\nStay tuned as we continue to follow this developing story.\n\n",
