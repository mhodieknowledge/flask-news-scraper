            "content": "By A Correspondent-President EmmersonMnangagwa reversedthe suspension of prominent G40-linked figure Shadreck Mashayamombe andordereda probe into what he described as illegal and factional expulsions within the ruling party.\n\nSources who attended the politburo meeting held last week saidthat Mnangagwa was incensed by what he called clandestine suspensions of party members without due process, accusing unnamed individuals of acting likeenemies of the party.\n\nThe development comes amid growing tensions within the partys provincial structures, particularly in Harare and Masvingo, ahead of internal elections set for next year.\n\nShadreck Mashayamombe, once a prominent figure in the Generation 40 (G40) faction that backed former First Lady Grace Mugabe and opposed Mnangagwas ascendancy in 2017, had been suspended by the Harare provincial leadership led by Godwills Masimirembwa.\n\nG40 was a powerful Zanu PF faction that emerged in the latter years of the Mugabe era. It was composed of younger, urban-based politicians loyal to Mugabe and his wife, Grace,whothey saw as his successor. The faction clashed with Mnangagwas Lacoste faction,made up largelyof liberation war veterans and military-aligned figures. The rivalry culminated in the 2017 military-assisted coup that ousted Robert Mugabe and catapulted Mnangagwa to power, leading to the purging and exile of many G40 leaders, including Saviour Kasukuwere, Jonathan Moyo, and Patrick Zhuwao.\n\nMashayamombe, a former Harare South MP, wasamong thosesidelined but remained politically active. His re-emergence and Mnangagwas intervention signal a possible softening of stance toward some G40 elements, at least those willing to toe the current leaderships line.\n\nAccording to Zanu PFs constitution, Mashayamombes status as a cell member means any disciplinary process against him should have been initiated at the branch level. However, the provincial leadership allegedly bypassed these internal procedures.\n\nThe President demanded an investigation into who orchestrated these suspensions, said a senior politburo member. He emphasized that Mashayamombe brings value to the party and should not be a victim of factional rumours.\n\nSources suggest Masimirembwa viewed Mashayamombe as a threat in the upcoming provincial elections, and the suspension was part of a broader strategy to neutralize political rivals.\n\nMasimirembwa could not be reached for comment.\n\nMnangagwa also reversed the expulsion of two members from Masvingo province, underscoring his disapproval of internal purges.\n\nAt a press conference following the politburo meeting, Zanu PF national spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa confirmed the Presidents strong stance on unity and due process.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa was very stern on the issue of expulsions. He believes this could destroy the party, Mutsvangwa said.\n\nHe does not tolerate clandestine suspensions and expulsions. Zanu PF is a revolutionary party rooted in the people, guided by the principle of leaving no one and no place behind.\n\nMutsvangwa added that the party will now favour reprimands over expulsionsin a bidto foster internal healing and avoid further divisions.\n\nRather than removing members, the party opted for reprimands where necessary. This reflects the Presidents leadership style  focused on strengthening the party from within, Mutsvangwa said.\n\nWith next years provincial elections drawing closer, Mnangagwas move appears to be a calculated effort to consolidate unity within Zanu PF and rein in rogue elements within the provincial structures. However, observers note that the re-admission of G40-linked figures could spark renewed tensions within the deeply factionalised party.\n\n",

            "content": "ANALYSIS: How Much More of Zimbabwes Land Was Bartered in Mnangagwas Latest Belarus Visit?\n\nBy Correspondent | ZimEye | 12 May 2025\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwas latest state visit to Belarus, as proudly announced on his official page, rekindles memories of controversial land-for-deals diplomacy that has defined much of his foreign policy in recent years. While the post paints a picture of deepened collaboration between Zimbabwe and Belarus, many Zimbabweans are asking a sharper question: what did Mnangagwa give away this time?\n\nThe 2019 Precedent: Buses for a Province\n\nIn 2019, Mnangagwas government struck a deal with Belarus in which an estimated 700 ZUPCO buses were delivered  in return for land allocations reportedly equivalent to the size of Mutare. While officials claimed it was a development partnership, insiders and land rights experts widely condemned the deal as a monumental betrayal of national assets for short-term optics.\n\nIt didnt stop there. In the same period, Mnangagwa infamously offered U.S. President Donald Trump a chunk of Victoria Falls ancestral land  a gesture that had no economic logic and reeked of desperation for foreign approval.\n\nCarbon Credits or Carbon Crimes?\n\nIn the years since, thousands more hectares have been leased or granted to Gulf-based firms under the label of carbon credit projects  schemes that critics argue are nothing more than disguised land grabs. These arrangements often operate without parliamentary approval or transparency, placing critical ecological and cultural zones under foreign control for decades.\n\nThe Al Jazeera Sting\n\nIn 2021, Mnangagwa was exposed in the Al Jazeera Gold Mafia investigation where he and his associates nearly traded more of Victoria Falls for vague promises from undercover journalists posing as investors. That attempt, halted only by media exposure, highlighted a worrying pattern: land for loyalty, land for illusions of investment, land for nothing.\n\nWhat Did Minsk Get This Time?\n\nWhile no official figures have yet been released from the current Belarus visit, the pattern is too familiar to ignore. Based on previous transactions  such as the 700 buses exchanged for land  one might reasonably estimate that another 10,000 to 20,000 hectares could have quietly changed hands behind closed doors in Minsk.\n\nThats nearly twice the size of Harare. At an estimated commercial land value of US$3,000 per hectare (a conservative figure in Victoria Falls or eastern Zimbabwe), this means a potential transfer of assets worth US$3060 million could have occurred  in return for yet another token infrastructure promise, like tractors or fire engines.\n\nA Country for Sale?\n\nThe optics of Mnangagwas photo-op in Minsk are clear: smiling faces, waving flags, and words like collaboration. But behind the curtains, Zimbabweans must ask: what price is their land paying for these trips? In a nation where poverty is deepening and services are collapsing, the giveaway of ancestral and national lands to foreign interests  often for peanuts  is not collaboration. Its surrender.\n\nThe true cost of this visit may only be known years from now  when generations find they have no land left to call their own.\n\nA History of Controversial Land Deals\n\n1. 2019 Belarus Deal:\n\nIn 2019, Mnangagwas administration reportedly transferred land equivalent to the size of Mutareapproximately 16,700 hectaresto Belarus in exchange for 700 ZUPCO buses. However, reports indicate that many of these buses have since broken down, raising questions about the value and sustainability of the deal.\n\n2. Victoria Falls Offer to Trump:\n\nMnangagwa publicly offered land near Victoria Falls to then-U.S. President Donald Trump for the construction of a golf course, aiming to attract foreign investment. This move was met with criticism, as it involved offering a national park area rich in wildlife to a foreign leader.\n\n3. Carbon Credit Agreements:\n\nIn 2023, Zimbabwe entered into a deal with UAE-based company Blue Carbon, granting them conservation rights over 7.5 million hectares of forest landabout 20% of the countrys landmassfor carbon credit projects. While the deal was touted to bring in $1.5 billion, concerns have been raised about the lack of transparency and the actual benefits to local communities.\n\n4. Al Jazeeras 2021 Investigation:\n\nAn undercover investigation by ZimEye and Al Jazeera in 2021 revealed that Mnangagwas ambassador-at-large, Uebert Angel, offered to facilitate the laundering of millions of dollars through gold smuggling schemes. The investigation highlighted the potential for high-level corruption and misuse of national resources.\n\nEstimating the Impact of the Latest Belarus Visit\n\nWhile specific details of the recent Belarus visit remain undisclosed, historical patterns suggest the possibility of further land concessions. If we consider the 2019 deal as a benchmarkwhere approximately 16,700 hectares were exchanged for busesit is plausible that similar or larger tracts of land could have been involved in the latest agreements.\n\nAssuming a conservative estimate of 20,000 hectares at an average land value of $3,000 per hectare, the potential value of land exchanged could be around $60 million. However, without transparency and official disclosures, the exact figures remain speculative.\n\nVisualizing the Land Allocations\n\nTo better understand the scale and distribution of these land deals, the following map provides a visual representation:\n\nNote: The map illustrates Zimbabwes geographical layout, including major cities and regions. Specific land deal locations are not marked due to the lack of publicly available detailed information.\n\nThe recurring theme of trading significant portions of Zimbabwes land for foreign investments with questionable returns raises concerns about the long-term implications for national sovereignty and economic stability. As these deals often lack transparency and public consultation, there is a growing need for accountability and scrutiny to ensure that the nations resources are managed in the best interest of its citizens.\n\nFor further reading and detailed reports on these issues, consider the following sources:\n\nWould you like a more detailed breakdown or analysis of any specific aspect of these deals?\n\n",
