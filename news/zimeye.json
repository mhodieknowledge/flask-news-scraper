OverUS$18,000was paid, yet the actual work was completed by local contractorKainos Mupiwa, who never received a cent.\n\nThe scam extended toChiedza Clinic, where the officials diverted plumbing materials worthUS$3,889for personal projects and fraudulently claimed the construction of ablution facilities, costing the council anotherUS$6,075.\n\nTo make matters worse, they processed anUS$8,501 purchase orderfor building materials from a company linked to one of the accused  but nothing was delivered. In total, Hurungwe RDC lostUS$47,266.21, none of which has been recovered.\n\nPrivate Company Boss Also JailedMarloshac Investments directorMarvin Matizawas convicted on two counts of fraud and sentenced to36 yearsin prison.\n\nSecond Fraud Scheme UncoveredIn a separate case, Mupamaonde and Makama were also found guilty alongsideAnstand Investments (Pvt) LtddirectorBatsirayi Nyamayarofor defrauding the council ofUS$17,990earmarked for theChehoko Causeway Bridge. The project was eventually completed by Mupiwa with community help, but he received onlyUS$1,450from the diverted funds.\n\nThe trio was jailed for18 years each, with three years suspended on good behavior, and finedUS$5,000each. The company received the same fine, with the court authorizing property seizures if payment is not made.\n\nWhile Kalavina was acquitted in the Chehoko case, he was convicted on charges related to theKaspikiri BridgeandChiedza Clinicprojects.\n\nCouncil Moves to Restore OrderFollowing the scandal, the council has appointedRemigio Makuwerere, its social services officer, as acting CEO. Hurungwe RDC remains Zimbabwes second-largest rural district after Makoni in Manicaland\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nA bizarre incident unfolded at State House in Bulawayo when a Police Protection Unit (PPU) officer accidentally shot himself in the knee while on duty, sparking a courtroom battle over whether negligence or faulty equipment was to blame.\n\nThe officer, Dubani Munkuli (36), appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Challenge Mahembe facing charges of negligently discharging a firearm. He pleaded not guilty, arguing through his lawyer that the weapon might have fired due to poor maintenance rather than carelessness.\n\nWe do not know the service history of this pistol. It could have misfired on its own, and that should not be considered negligence on my clients part, the defence lawyer told the court.\n\nHowever, a state ballistic expert dismissed that theory, stating: A gun cannot fire by itself. It requires someone to engage the trigger mechanism.\n\nCourt proceedings revealed that the incident occurred on May 15 around 11:20 pm while Munkuli was on duty with colleague Simbarashe Manombe. The officer reportedly stood up to go to the toilet while holding his CZ pistol with both hands. In the process, a round went off, striking him in the knee.\n\nThe defence pressed the expert on whether the weapons maintenance history could have contributed to the mishap. Although the expert admitted he had no record of when the gun was last serviced, he maintained that a trigger pull was necessary for discharge.\n\nMunkuli was remanded out of custody and is expected back in court on August 25 for the continuation of his trial.\n\nThe incident has triggered widespread debate in Bulawayo, with some residents mocking the mishap, saying, Instead of stopping criminals, the cop stopped himself. Others raised concerns about neglected firearms in service, warning that poor maintenance could pose a serious risk to law enforcement officers.\n\n",

            "content": "By Showbiz Reporter-Afro-fusion superstar Jah Prayzah has reignited debate after making a surprise return to his signature military attire during a family show at Jongwe Corner in Hatfield on August 10.\n\nThe award-winning musician, real name Mukudzeyi Mukombe, stunned fans when he walked onto the stage in full camouflage  a look that once defined his career but later became a source of controversy. His bold fashion comeback immediately set social media alight, with admirers praising his courage while critics questioned his renewed embrace of military symbolism.\n\nJah Prayzahs connection with the army dates back nearly a decade. His band,Third Generation, has long been associated with the military touch  a brand identity inspired by his collaborations with the Zimbabwe Defence Forces. He was even appointed as the official goodwill ambassador of the Zimbabwe National Army, cementing his reputation as a musician whose artistry intersected with state power.\n\nThis partnership reached its peak in 2017 with the release of the chart-topping hitKutonga Kwaro. The song, with its heavy military undertones, became the unofficial anthem of the coup that ousted the late President Robert Mugabe and installed Emmerson Mnangagwa. At rallies and victory celebrations, Zanu PF and the military adopted the track as a soundtrack of the Second Republic.\n\nHowever,Kutonga Kwarosoon turned into a political albatross for Jah Prayzah. While fans initially embraced the anthems infectious rhythm, many later accused him of being co-opted by the junta to legitimise the coup. Reports later emerged that elements within military intelligence had influenced the songs creation, scripting lyrics that glorified Mnangagwa  known by his Shumba totem, celebrated in the track  as the incoming leader.\n\nFor years afterward, Jah Prayzah struggled to shake off the perception that he was the militarys musician of choice. His camouflage attire, once seen as creative branding, became politically loaded, particularly as the army and Zanu PF faced accusations of human rights abuses, brutal crackdowns on dissent, and violent repression of opposition activists. The association cost him part of his urban youth following, who viewed him as a symbol of complicity in state excesses.\n\nIn response, Jah Prayzah deliberately abandoned the camouflage look, adopting a more neutral stage persona while expanding his sound to appeal to broader audiences across Africa. His collaborations with Tanzanian, Nigerian, and South African stars allowed him to rebrand as a continental act, distancing himself from the politics of Harare.\n\nNow, with his return to military gear, questions are once again being asked. Is this merely an artistic throwback to his earlier brand, or does it signal renewed ties with the establishment? For many Zimbabweans, Jah Prayzah remains caught between his musical genius and the political baggage of being remembered as the soundtrack of a coup.\n\n",
