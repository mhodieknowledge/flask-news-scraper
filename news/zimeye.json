But instead of building bridges, Rungani was tasked with breaking spirits.\n\nIn Mashonaland East, he orchestrated mass beatings, abductions, and killings of MDC supporterspersonally directing torture sessions and re-education camps known aspungwes.\n\nHis actions were part of a nationwide scorched-earth campaign coordinated by the Joint Operations Command (JOC), the shadowy military cabal thathijackedZimbabweselectoral process under the guise of defending national sovereignty.\n\nState media, however, glossed over this dark historyreportingonlythat Rungani died at Mbuya Dorcas Hospital and praising his role in military engineering.\n\nNo mentionwas madeof the blood on his hands.\n\nBorn in Bikita, Masvingo province, Rungani was one of several senior commanders who turned villages into killing fields.\n\nHe operated alongside a terrifying cast of military men: Major General Engelbert Rugeje (Masvingo), Brigadier General David Sigauke (Mashonaland West), Brigadier General Douglas Nyikayaramba (Manicaland), Air Vice Marshal Abu Basutu (Matabeleland South), Air Vice Marshal Henry Muchena (Harare), Brigadier General Sibusiso Moyo (Midlands), Brigadier General Sibangumuzi Khumalo (Matabeleland North), Brigadier General Etherton Shungu (Mashonaland Central), Colonel Chris Sibanda (Bulawayo), and Air Commodore Mike Tichafa Karakadzai (Harare).\n\nTogether, backed by the Central Intelligence Organisation and more than 80,000 youth militia, they launched a nationwide campaign of violence that ultimately forced Tsvangirai to withdraw from the run-off.\n\nThis campaign was not only politicalit wasdeeply personal, systematic, and savage.\n\nIt left hundreds dead, thousands injured or raped, and entire communitiestraumatised.\n\nWhileRunganisdeath closes one chapter, it reopens anothera chapterof unanswered questions and unhealed wounds.\n\nIt reminds Zimbabweans that the men who destroyed democracy and violated the people have neverbeen broughtto justice.\n\nRunganisname, like those of his fellow commanders, may now appear in the National Heroes Acrebut in the hearts of many Zimbabweans, itis etchedin infamy.\n\n",

The message was clear and has reached home.\n\nGeza says the shutdown was necessary due to President Mnangagwas failure in governance, citing mental unfitness to lead and presiding over what he called monumental corruption that has crippled the countrys public services.\n\nMnangagwa is now mentally unfit to govern the country, Geza stated. He has destroyed the delivery of social services through rampant corruption. The entire system is broken.\n\nHe assured supporters that something is being done right now to ensure that Mnangagwa goes, suggesting that both civilians and sympathetic elements within the security forces are aligned in pushing for change. Action is being taken, he added. Things are happening as we speak.\n\nResponding to images of people moving around in city centers, Geza dismissed them as staged attempts by the state to undermine the impact of the stay-away protest. Some were bused from far and beyond to give the impression that the stay-away has failed, he said. Dont be discouragedmentally and emotionally, the nation is on shutdown.\n\nHe also accused the government of manipulating public perception. Mnangagwa sent buses to places like Muzarabani and Zvishavane to fill the towns and deceive the nation into thinking everything is normal, he claimed.\n\nGeza emphasized that the shutdown was intended to be peaceful. We never called for violence, he said. The Mnangagwas sent their people to commit acts of violence so they could blame us. We distance ourselves from those acts.\n\nHe expressed dismay at reports linking figures like former CCC MP Amos Chibaya to the shutdown planning. We never sent them to do any organizing of the shutdown. We are shocked where they are getting that.\n\nCalling for continued unity and resilience, Geza urged the public to stay the course. The Mnangagwas and their Zviganandas are going soon. Remain in shutdown mode. Emotionally, mentally, and physically, we are already there.\n\nHe ended by promising to keep Zimbabweans informed: I shall continue to speak with you. I will update you on the progress of our shutdown. Remain strong, family of Zimbabwe.\n\nThe government is yet to issue a formal response to Gezas renewed call for continued shutdown action.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nMASVINGO  Minister of State for Masvingo Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Ezra Chadzamira, is under fire for attending the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) in Bulawayo while his home province battles a worsening crisis marked by unemployment, poor infrastructure, and critical shortages in the health sector.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Chadzamira was seen touring the ZANU-PF exhibition stand at the ZITF, engaging with party departments and praising exhibitors for what he called impressive innovation. His visit was positioned as part of the governments push to promote Zimbabwes open for business agenda.\n\nHowever, his presence in Bulawayo has drawn sharp criticism from observers and local residents who say the Minister is ignoring pressing issues back home.\n\nIts a case of misplaced priorities, said a Masvingo-based civic activist who preferred to remain anonymous. We have clinics with no medication, roads that are death traps, and thousands of youths without jobs, yet our Provincial Minister finds it more important to take selfies at an exhibition stand.\n\nMany argue that while economic promotion is important, leadership should be rooted in addressing local challenges before seeking international investment.\n\nHe should fix Masvingo before promoting investment to outsiders, said a vendor in Mucheke. Who wants to invest in a province where roads are impassable and hospitals cant even treat minor injuries?\n\nChadzamira, who has remained silent on the criticism so far, lauded the ZITF as a powerful platform to showcase the countrys economic vision and achievements.\n\nBut for some Masvingo residents, that vision feels like a distant dream.\n\nWhat achievements is he talking about? asked a teacher in Zaka. The only thing thats functioning in Masvingo is political rhetoric.\n\nAs the 65th edition of the ZITF continues to attract both local and international businesses, the backlash at home highlights the growing disconnect between state officials and the day-to-day realities of ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nHARARE  War veteran Blessed Runesu Geza, known to his followers as Comrade Bombshell, has vowed that the national shutdown will continue, claiming it has already sent a powerful message to the Zimbabwean government and security forces.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday evening marking the third day of the shutdown, Geza declared the action a historic success and insisted that momentum is building toward the removal of President Emmerson Mnangagwa from power.\n\nToday is day three of our historic shutdown, which so far has been a success, Geza said.\n\nWe have demonstrated to the Mnangagwa regime that enough is enough. The message was clear and has reached home.\n\nGeza alleges the shutdown was necessary due to President Mnangagwas failure in governance, citing mental unfitness to lead and presiding over what he called monumental corruption that has crippled the countrys public services.\n\nMnangagwa is now mentally unfit to govern the country, Geza stated. He has destroyed the delivery of social services through rampant corruption. The entire system is broken.\n\nHe assured supporters that something is being done right now to ensure that Mnangagwa goes, suggesting that both civilians and sympathetic elements within the security forces are aligned in pushing for change. Action is being taken, he added. Things are happening as we speak.\n\nResponding to images of people moving around in city centers, Geza dismissed them as staged attempts by the state to undermine the impact of the stay-away protest. Some were bused from far and beyond to give the impression that the stay-away has failed, he said. Dont be discouragedmentally and emotionally, the nation is on shutdown.\n\nHe also accused the government of manipulating public perception. Mnangagwa sent buses to places like Muzarabani and Zvishavane to fill the towns and deceive the nation into thinking everything is normal, he claimed.\n\nGeza emphasized that the shutdown was intended to be peaceful. We never called for violence, he said. The Mnangagwas sent their people to commit acts of violence so they could blame us. We distance ourselves from those acts.\n\nHe expressed dismay at reports linking figures like former CCC MP Amos Chibaya to the shutdown planning. We never sent them to do any organizing of the shutdown. We are shocked where they are getting that.\n\nCalling for continued unity and resilience, Geza urged the public to stay the course. The Mnangagwas and their Zviganandas are going soon. Remain in shutdown mode. Emotionally, mentally, and physically, we are already there.\n\nHe ended by promising to keep Zimbabweans informed: I shall continue to speak with you. I will update you on the progress of our shutdown. Remain strong, family of Zimbabwe.\n\nThe government has yet to issue a formal response to Gezas renewed call for continued shutdown action.\n\n",
