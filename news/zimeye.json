            "content": "By Political Reporter  Zanu PF has suspended one of its Masvingo heavyweights, Roy Bhila, in a move seen as part of the escalating power struggle between President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputy, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nBhila, the Zanu PF Masvingo provincial finance secretary, was suspended this week after rejecting the partys ED2030 Agenda.\n\nHis dissent became public when he criticised fellow party members for grabbing land during a Chiredzi council meeting, aligning himself with growing discontent in the province.\n\nMasvingo Province, long considered a Chiwenga stronghold, has witnessed increased factional tensions, particularly as pro-Mnangagwa officials consolidate power.\n\nProminent among them is Masvingo Provincial Minister Ezra Chadzamira, a staunch supporter of the ED2030 Agenda, who has been implicated in controversial land grabs in Chiredzi and surrounding areas.\n\nBhilas opposition to these practices has set him apart from the faction aligned with Mnangagwa.\n\nIn the last election, Bhila had previously campaigned for Mnangagwa, which made his suspension a significant blow to the Presidents claims of unity within Zanu PF.\n\nObservers suggest this disciplinary action underscores Mnangagwas efforts to purge Chiwenga allies as he seeks to tighten his grip on the party ahead of the next Zanu PF elective congress.\n\nThis development is the latest in a series of moves reflecting the deepening rift between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga.\n\nThe power struggle, which has defined much of the post-Mugabe era, has seen both camps employing political manoeuvres to undermine each other, with provincial party structures often serving as battlegrounds.\n\n",

The statement read:\n\nPUBLIC NOTICE:NOTICE TO ALL CHURCHES\n\nThe Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) wishes to inform all churches about an upcoming Stakeholder Engagement. This forum aims to address tax compliance across all applicable tax categories, as part of ZIMRAs commitment to transparency and compliance support.

According to ZIMRA:\n\nExempt IncomeThe following types of income are exempt from income tax:  Donations, Tithes, Offerings, and Contributions: Income received or accrued from donations, tithes, offerings, or contributions made by members or benefactors of the church or its institutions.\n\nHowever, the notice clarified that income generated from trading activities would be subject to taxation.

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa once again found himself taking over ministerial duties typically performed by other officials. On Thursday, the President traveled from Harare to Shurugwi to officiate at the commissioning of the newly upgraded Shurugwi-Mhandamabwe Road. Ordinarily, such a task would fall under the purview of the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development, but Mnangagwas involvement raises questions about the role of the Minister in overseeing infrastructure projects.\n\nAt the event, President Mnangagwa spoke about the importance of infrastructure development, stating that the country will continue to score major milestones in infrastructure development, by harnessing deliberate policies enunciated by the Second Republic. He emphasized that such projects are central to the vision of the current administration, which has focused heavily on improving Zimbabwes national road network.\n\nThe Shurugwi-Mhandamabwe Road, which had been in poor condition for years, has been transformed into a modern, multi-million dollar road. The project, which involved widening the road and other extensive upgrades, is expected to alleviate traffic congestion and improve connectivity. Notably, this road links the Beitbridge Border Post with towns like Gweru and Kwekwe, offering a new route that avoids the previously winding path through Masvingo.\n\nMnangagwa was pleased to highlight the significance of the roads completion for the Midlands province, commenting, Look at the development which is there now, in the 40s we would say there is one secondary school in one district. Im very happy that this development was registered under the Second Republic. He further noted his pride in the ongoing progress, emphasizing the trajectory of the countrys infrastructure under his administration.\n\nAs Mnangagwa continues to step into roles beyond his presidential duties, one might wonder about the specific responsibilities of the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development. Why is the President personally handling tasks traditionally managed by other cabinet members, such as the commissioning of a key infrastructure project?\n\n",
