            "original_content": "By A Correspondent\n\nOpposition leader, Advocate Nelson Chamisa, has hit back at President Emmerson Mnangagwas efforts to drag him into the controversial land allocation issues at Harare City Council.\n\nBelow is Advocate Chamisas full response:\n\nOn Monday, I was summoned to testify before (Rtd) Justice Maphosa Cheda at the Harare City Commission inquiry, a forum established by President Mnangagwa.\n\nWhile I hold serious reservations about the legitimacy and impartiality of this Commission, I agreed to attend out of courtesy and in my capacity as an advocate for justice, and as someone committed to upholding the rule of law.\n\nThe Commission sought my response to allegations purportedly made by a councillor who allegedly connected my name with the regularisation process at the Harare City Council. These claims suggest my involvement in what has now become a major controversy within the citys land allocation system.\n\nI was quick to clarify that I have no involvement in such matters. I am not a member of the city council, nor am I part of local government. I hold no position in municipal affairs, and the Urban Councils Act clearly dictates that local governance decisions are made within the council framework, not by outside individuals or political parties.\n\nAt the hearing, an audio recording was played, allegedly featuring a councillor mentioning my name in connection with these issues. The recording, however, was poorly presented and of questionable authenticity, having been played from a mobile phone. Its reliability was therefore highly suspect, raising serious doubts about its credibility.\n\nDespite the flaws in the presentation, I responded in good faith, hoping to avoid further discrediting the Commission. Let me be clear: I do not recognize the councillor in question, nor do I acknowledge the credibility of the claims made. Interestingly, the same recording also mentioned Mr Mnangagwas name, yet I was the one called to testify. I pointed out that if my name was being invoked based on this dubious audio, surely the same should apply to Mr Mnangagwa, whose name was also mentioned.\n\nThis situation highlights a fundamental legal principle: he who alleges must provide evidence. It is a grave injustice to summon individuals based on unproven allegations without substantiating claims with factual evidence.\n\nAs a human rights advocate, I must also condemn the widespread destruction of homes in Harare. The practice of bulldozing peoples homes is not only illegal but morally indefensible. It is a direct violation of basic human rights, and it represents a complete failure of leadership. This is not governance, it is a cruel and inhumane attack on the vulnerable.\n\nThis is not the first time such a commission has been used as a diversion. In 2018, following the disputed national elections, Mr. Mnangagwa established the Motlanthe Commission. I was summoned before it on a matter that had no direct bearing on me. Now, in 2023, the same strategy seems to be playing out again, with me being dragged into issues that are far beyond my control or responsibility.\n\nThis is not the way to address the countrys real challenges. The crisis we face cannot be solved by targeting innocent people through orchestrated inquiries. What is needed is real accountability and a genuine effort to confront the systemic issues at the heart of this corruption.\n\nThe root causes of the crisiscorruption, maladministration, and gross incompetenceare undermining our cities, towns, and the nation as a whole. These systemic failures must be confronted, and those responsible must be held accountable. Local governance has become an arena for incompetence and impunity, and it is time to end the cycle of failure. The true culprits, including those at the highest levels of government, must answer for their role in this crisis.\n\n",
