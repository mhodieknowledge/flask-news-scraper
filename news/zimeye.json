As the party faces a deep internal divide, one faction aligns with President Mnangagwas bid for a third term, while another vehemently opposes it, creating an atmosphere of political tension.\n\nMuchinguri-Kashiris trip, officially to attend the Defence Ministers Conclave in India, appears to serve as more than just a diplomatic mission. The Conclave, running until February 15, is expected to discuss global defence and security issues of mutual interest. While these topics are crucial, the timing suggests there might be a hidden agenda behind her visit.\n\nHer bilateral meetings with Indian officials, including her Indian counterpart, could provide a cover for behind-the-scenes political maneuvering. Could she be securing support for Mnangagwas third term ambitions? Or is this a move to strengthen her own position in the party as factions vie for influence? Given the high stakes within Zanu PF, her presence in India could signal more than just a routine diplomatic engagement.\n\nAs Muchinguri-Kashiri attends the conclave, her actions and the outcomes of her meetings will undoubtedly be scrutinized in the context of Zimbabwes ongoing political turbulence.\n\n",

            "content": "Harare, Zimbabwe  President Emmerson Mnangagwa suffered a major embarrassment at the National Heroes Acre, as his small group of supporters was overpowered by the voices of a massive crowd singing in opposition, exposing deep divisions within the ruling Zanu PF party.\n\nThe chaotic scenes, which unfolded two days ago, sent shockwaves across Zimbabwe, further highlighting the growing discontent with Mnangagwas leadership. This comes at a time when his handful of backers remain unhinged, pushing for an indefinite extension of his presidency beyond constitutional limits.\n\nMnangagwas Backers Demand Eternal Rule Amidst Growing Resistance\n\nLeading the call for Mnangagwas continued rule is Zanu PF Secretary for War Veterans, Douglas Mahiya, who issued threats against fellow war veterans who oppose extending Mnangagwas presidency. Mahiya directly warned those challenging the Zanu PF leaders rule, stating that they could be stopped from speaking indefinitely.\n\nHis comments were seemingly directed at Blessed Runesu Geza and his faction of war veterans, who have been vocal in their opposition to Mnangagwas leadership, citing corruption, nepotism, and economic collapse as reasons why the president should step down.\n\nA Party in Crisis: Mnangagwas Supporters Threaten Opponents\n\nSpeaking at a war veterans gathering in Bulawayo, Mahiya shockingly suggested that, under different leadership, Zanu PF could have declared a state of emergency and suspended elections indefinitely, effectively turning Zimbabwe into a dictatorship.\n\nWe were sanctioned by the West. Thats a sign that we are in a war. When a country has sanctions, when people are in a war, they can stop going for elections and declare a state of emergency, Mahiya stated, arguing that Mnangagwa had been too lenient by allowing elections to continue.\n\nMahiya justified extending Mnangagwas term, arguing that Western sanctions constituted a war situation, which, under a different leader, could have led to the suspension of democracy.\n\nHad Mnangagwa not been a principled leader, the ruling party could have declared a state of emergency, suspended elections, and ensured his indefinite rule, he said, implying that only death could remove Mnangagwa from power.\n\nMnangagwas Supporters Face Backlash\n\nWhile a small faction within Zanu PF continues to push for Mnangagwas rule beyond 2030, his presence at the National Heroes Acre painted a completely different picture. His supporters were overwhelmed and drowned out by the voices of the majority in attendance, who sang in a manner that embarrassed the Zanu PF leader.\n\nThe incident underscores the deepening fractures within the ruling party, as tensions escalate between those supporting Mnangagwas indefinite rule and those demanding change.\n\nMahiya Issues More Threats: We Will Stop You\n\nIn a chilling statement, Mahiya openly threatened war veterans who refuse to back Mnangagwa, warning that they would face consequences for speaking out.\n\nIf you refuse, we have the right, although forbidden by the law, to act otherwise to stop you indefinitely from saying such things, Mahiya declared, suggesting that dissent would not be tolerated.\n\nHe also dismissed the idea that war veterans had independent political agency, saying:\n\nGoing to Zambia (for training during the liberation struggle) does not give you the power to refuse what the majority want. If you do not follow what people want, your war veteran status is useless.\n\nA Desperate Push for Mnangagwas Extended Rule\n\nMahiya insisted that Mnangagwas leadership should be extended indefinitely, invoking Resolution Number One from the Zanu PF National Peoples Conference in Bulawayo, which endorsed Mnangagwas rule until at least 2030.\n\nThe president will not say what I am saying, but if we take the principle of the revolution that the minority is subordinate to the majority, it means the president has to accept as well what has been said by the people, Mahiya said, implying that Mnangagwa himself must accept an extension to his term.\n\nFactionalism Threatens Zanu PFs Future\n\nMahiya also accused opposing war veterans of working with the opposition to create instability within Zanu PF, warning that the party could lose the next election if internal divisions continue.\n\nThere are different war veteran associations coming up so that during the next elections, Zanu PF loses. They want to divide you so that you disagree with your party and government, he claimed.\n\nHowever, the reality at Heroes Acre two days ago suggests that Mnangagwa is quickly losing control, as the masses no longer align with his leadership, despite the desperate attempts of his inner circle to keep him in power.\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nThe embarrassing scenes at Heroes Acre serve as a clear warning that Mnangagwas grip on power is slipping. While a few die-hard supporters continue to push for his indefinite rule, the public display of resistance signals that his presidency is facing growing rejection, even within Zanu PF.\n\nThe ruling party is now at a crossroadswill they force through an unconstitutional extension of Mnangagwas rule, or will the rising tide of dissent lead to internal collapse and potential leadership change?\n\nWith elections looming and factionalism deepening, one thing is certain: Mnangagwas rule is no longer as secure as it once seemed.\n\n",

            "content": "EXPOSED: Government Forces Vendors to Open Bank Accounts While Million-Dollar Looters Remain Untouched\n\nDouble Standards in Zimbabwes Financial Crackdown?\n\nHarare, Zimbabwe  In a move that has sparked widespread outrage, the Zimbabwean government has issued a directive forcing informal vendors to open bank accounts and adopt Point of Sale (POS) machines for all transactions. This mandate, supposedly aimed at boosting tax compliance and financial transparency, raises critical questions: Why are small-scale traders being aggressively targeted while politically connected individuals implicated in massive corruption scandals remain untouched?\n\nThe hypocrisy is glaring. While vendorswho earn a living selling fruits, vegetables, and second-hand clothesare now required to submit to strict financial regulations, individuals like Wicknell Chivayo, known for flaunting stacks of US dollars and securing multi-million-dollar government contracts without accountability, continue to operate with impunity.\n\nA New Burden on Vendors, A Free Pass for the Elite\n\nAnnounced by Information Minister Dr. Jenfan Muswere, the new policy dictates that all informal traders must open bank accounts upon registration and adopt electronic transactions as part of the formal economy. The government argues that this will improve tax collection, but critics see it as another way to target the struggling poor while the politically connected rich remain untouchable.\n\nCurrently, local authorities are responsible for licensing vendors, but under the new system, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) will play a central role in ensuring compliance with tax laws. A Domestic Inter-agency Team is also being established to crack down on non-compliant vendors, raising fears of harassment and arbitrary arrests.\n\nYet, while vendors are being policed, no such enforcement exists for high-profile figures accused of looting millions from state coffers.\n\nSelective Law Enforcement: Why No Scrutiny for Chivayo and Other Elites?\n\nZimbabweans are still reeling from revelations of high-profile corruption cases, where individuals like Wicknell Chivayo have been linked to controversial multi-million-dollar deals. Chivayo, a known ZANU-PF associate, has publicly flaunted massive wads of cash in a country where ordinary citizens are required to justify deposits as low as US$1,000.\n\nKey Questions the Government Must Answer:1. Why are vendors being forced into formal banking systems while individuals caught on camera counting millions in cash face no financial scrutiny?2. Why are looters of public funds not being investigated under the same financial transparency rules?3. How does forcing vendors to open bank accounts address the real economic crisis caused by corruption and mismanagement?\n\nThe silence from authorities is deafening. Despite past scandals and public outrage, Chivayo and other politically connected elites continue to operate without any requirement to disclose the sources of their massive wealth. Meanwhile, street vendors struggling to make ends meet are being hounded by financial regulations that seem designed to oppress rather than empower.\n\nA War on the Poor?\n\nThis latest move fits into a broader pattern of the Zimbabwean government targeting the most vulnerable members of society while shielding those in power. Instead of addressing real economic issues such as inflation, corruption, and unemployment, authorities have opted to police the informal sector, which provides livelihoods for millions.\n\nExperts warn that forcing vendors into the banking system without addressing the root causes of economic decaycorruption, policy inconsistency, and lack of investor confidencewill only push more people into extreme poverty.\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nWith vendors now required to comply with electronic payment systems and formal banking, enforcement measures will likely lead to increased harassment from police and municipal authorities, who have a long history of cracking down on informal traders.\n\nThe real question is: Will the same energy be applied to investigating and prosecuting those responsible for looting the countrys wealth? If history is any indicator, the answer is a resounding no.\n\nFor now, Zimbabwean vendors must brace for yet another government policy that punishes the poor while protecting the powerful. The fight for justice continues.\n\nHave Your Say:\n\nDo you think the governments policy is fair? Should high-profile individuals like Wicknell Chivayo also be forced to open bank accounts and declare their financial dealings? Share your thoughts!\n\n",

However, Brahim Diaz scored against his former club with a rebound effort, and Jude Bellingham sealed the win with a stoppage-time strike.\n\nMadrids victory was largely due to Citys self-inflicted errors, as they surrendered possession and failed to see out the game.
