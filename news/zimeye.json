Public complaints have been raised over Hopewell Chinonowho recently inspired a colleague of his to attempt to hack Gatwick Airports database on 26 Aug 2024 (documentary in link below), and who created a career out of lying that an NHS expert accusing him offrauds in UK, was sent by the Zim Govt in 2020 to an outfit called Gambakwe, something that never happened. Members of the public have spoken out voicing that a journalist who instructs people to violate airport security like Chinono has been doing since 29 May 2024, will compromise Blessed Mhlangas fight for justice. When Chinonos colleague tried to hack Gatwick Airport database, she was trying to delete one of her names she used to enter UK in 2001, the same year Hopewell Chinono changed his own name from Mukusha in the period he is accused by the NHS expert and other professionals of leading cheque and card raids across UK care homes and using Royal Mail syndicates.\n\nA 2021 article published by his own former employer on the AMH newspapers over Hopewell Chinonos wealth story, exposes him for failing to account for money he boasts of amassing from journalism.\n\nThe most explosive expose related to money he says he used to purchase his first home, which he contradicts his earlier claim that it was of no foreign source but was a @CabsZimbabwe mortgage, a story he has recently changed to say it was in fact UK money in the form of a UK sportscar loan of 50,000 which he says he realised from selling the car and purchased his Chisipite home around 2001-4.\n\nAside all this, members of the public have raised concerns saying Chinono who has seemed to profit the incarceration of several other people, including Job Sikhala, is likely seeking to obtain both cover up and other benefits from Mhlangas struggle, while potentially compromising the case. The discussion was held on \n\nhttps://t.co/UBSsdyGGNa\n\nPolice@PoliceZimbabwesay the Blessed Mhlanga@bbmhlangafamily have disowned Hopewell Chinono@daddyhopesaying he is the one who recently requested to represent him at a time@TrevorNcube@NewsDayZimbabweAMH has its own representatives.

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a tightly contested race, Zanu PFs Tsomondo W. Charamba has emerged victorious in the Norton Ward 3 local authority by-election, defeating independent candidate Paradzayi P. Tanatswa by a narrow margin of just 10 votes.\n\nCharamba received 233 votes, while Tanatswa garnered 222 votes, highlighting the intense competition between the two candidates.\n\nThe by-election, which took place in Ward 3 of Norton, saw a highly engaged electorate, with both candidates vying for support in a race that could serve as a reflection of the broader political climate.\n\nThe close result is a clear indicator of the shifting political dynamics in the area, with independent candidates gaining significant traction against established political parties like Zanu PF.\n\nDespite the narrow victory, Charambas win will be viewed as a testament to Zanu PFs continued strong presence in the area, even as independent candidates begin to make a more noticeable impact.\n\nThe elections close nature suggests that the traditional dominance of political parties may be challenged in the upcoming years, particularly as voters increasingly seek alternatives to the status quo.\n\nFor Tanatswa, the close loss serves as a positive sign of independent candidates growing influence in Zimbabwes political landscape.\n\nWhile he fell short this time, the result reflects a strong showing and an indication that his campaign resonated with a significant portion of the electorate.\n\nHis performance could encourage more independents to contest future elections, particularly in areas where voters feel they are not adequately represented by traditional party structures.\n\nThe results of the Norton Ward 3 by-election raise important questions about the political future of Zimbabwe. With margins this thin, both major political parties and independent candidates will be aware that every vote counts, and the strategies they adopt moving forward will be critical in ensuring success in future electoral contests.\n\nAs the political scene in Zimbabwe continues to evolve, the Norton by-election serves as a reminder of the growing competitiveness in local elections and the potential for independent candidates to increasingly challenge the established political powers.\n\n",

Whether they are crossing at a designated crosswalk or walking along the roadside, they deserve the same respect and attention that drivers give to other vehicles.\n\nSlowing down when approaching a pedestrian crossing isnt just a courtesyits a critical safety measure. Pedestrians have the right of way, and as drivers, its our job to make sure they can cross the road safely.\n\nIf you spot a pedestrian already in the crosswalk, dont hesitate to stop and allow them to finish crossing before proceeding. Its essential to give them the time they need to move safely without rushing or creating a dangerous situation.\n\nIt only takes a few seconds, but it can make all the difference in ensuring that no one gets hurt.\n\nPracticing road courtesy doesnt only apply to pedestrians. As a responsible driver, your actions behind the wheel should always prioritize safety, not just for yourself but for everyone around you. Being aware of pedestrians, staying alert to crossing signals, and yielding when necessary are all parts of safe defensive driving.\n\nUltimately, safety begins with us. Its not enough to drive safely in terms of speed limits and traffic signals; we must also be vigilant and empathetic toward those who might be at greater risk on the roads. So, lets share the road and respect pedestrian rightsby doing so, we can help create a safer, more considerate environment for everyone.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",
