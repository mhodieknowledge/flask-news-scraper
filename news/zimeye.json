            "content": "By Shelton Muchena | Edwin Charinge Ndlovu, a 49-year-old nurse originally from Morningside, Masvingo, is set to embark on an extraordinary occasion as he prepares to receive the prestigious Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) from King Charles at Buckingham Palace on March 29, 2025. His remarkable career within the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK reflects a journey marked by dedication, resilience, and a steadfast commitment to healthcare excellence.\n\nNdlovus educational foundation began at Victoria Primary and Secondary schools before he pursued a three-year mechanical engineering program at Masvingo Technical College. In 1997, he relocated to the UK and, after enrolling at City University of London, transitioned into nursing, starting his career in 2000. Since then, Ndlovu has risen swiftly through the ranks, garnering recognition and respect for his commitment to improving healthcare services.\n\nCurrently, he serves as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Deputy Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at East London NHS Foundation Trust. In this leadership role, Ndlovu oversees a workforce of 7,000 health professionals and manages a substantial budget of 650 million. His influence has been pivotal in championing Quality Improvement (QI) methodologies, reducing violence in healthcare settings, enhancing patient access, and streamlining service efficiency.\n\nThe MBE, one of the UKs highest accolades, comes with several benefits, including networking opportunities, access to corporate purchasing agents, and the privilege for recipients and their children to marry at St. Pauls Cathedral in London. Ndlovus contributions to the healthcare sector have earned him recognition from the UK Government, which announced the award on its official website.\n\nThroughout his career, Ndlovu has played a significant role in successful Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspections and has been instrumental in mental health innovations, workforce equity programs, and pandemic response strategies. His leadership has facilitated major collaborations, including efforts in forensic mental health services and the establishment of Virtual Wards and Urgent Care partnerships.\n\nReflecting on this honor, Ndlovu remarked, This award is a testament to the strength, resilience, and contributions of many Zimbabweans in the diaspora. He joins the ranks of other distinguished MBE holders, including renowned footballers Harry Kane and Stephen Gerrard, as well as celebrated musicians like Adele and Ed Sheeran. The MBE ranks below the Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) and the Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE), standing as a mark of honor for exceptional service to the community.\n\nEdwin Ndlovus journey is not just an individual achievement; it symbolises the potential for success that lies in hard work, commitment, and a spirit of service qualities that resonate deeply within the Zimbabwean community and beyond.- ZimEye\n\n",

            "content": "South Africa- Zimbabweans living under the Zimbabwe Exemption Permits (ZEPs) say their lives have become unbearable as uncertainty surrounding their legal statuscontinues to intensify.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Exemption Permits Holders Association (ZEPHA), which represents affected Zimbabweans, has urged the Zimbabwean government to offer a voluntary return programme, citing the increasingly difficult conditionsfaced bymany of its members in South Africa.\n\nThe ZEPsystem,was meant to regularize the stay of Zimbabweans who had migrated to South Africa for economic and political reasons.\n\nHowever, the South African government has since shifted its stance on ZEPs, repeatedly extending the permit deadlines whilesignalingan eventual termination.\n\nThishas left approximately 178,000 permit holders, including their dependent family members, ina state oflimbo.\n\nA memo sent by ZEPHA toZimbabwesambassador to South Africa, David Hamadziripi, and seen byMoneyWeb, highlights the dire situation facing ZEP holders. The memo states:\n\nZimbabweans are now forced to litigate when they go to hospitals, schools, universities, travel on the roads, and at the workplace.\n\nAs a result, ZEPHA has already initiated a repatriation programme to assist Zimbabweanswillingto return home.\n\nHowever, the associationis callingfor the Zimbabweangovernmentssupport in easing the transition, including helpwithsecuringaccommodation,businessopportunities,and reducing regulatory barriers for returnees.\n\nThe memo further argues that while many South Africans recognize Zimbabweans as hardworking and trustworthy employees, their support does notextend to grantingthem full rights to live dignified lives.\n\nIt reads:\n\nMany South Africans believe that Zimbabweans are hapless ZANU-PF victims useful only for their highly sought-after cheap, efficient, and trustworthy labour. Their assistance for Zimbabwean staff extends only to prolonging exploitation, but not to provide Zimbabweans with the rights required to live full and dignified lives.\n\nAccording to ZEPHA, growing resentment towards Zimbabweans in South Africa has led to increased xenophobic violence.\n\nThe Black majority in South Africa largely blames Zimbabweans for taking jobs, housing, healthcare, and other economic opportunities, leading to the rise of vigilante groups that target Zimbabweans with robbery, assault, and even murderoften without consequences for the perpetrators.\n\nPolitical parties such as the PatrioticAlliance,and ActionSA have been accused of fueling anti-Zimbabwean sentiment, whilegroups like Operation Dudula and Put South Africa First have actively led campaigns against Zimbabwean migrants.\n\nThe memo notes that such attacks intensify during elections and national crises, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing power outages.\n\nOn the other hand, SouthAfricaswhite minority largely attributesZimbabweseconomic collapse toZANU-PFsmismanagement.\n\nThe memo states:\n\nThe white minority blames ZANU-PF for ruining the Zimbabwean economy and forcing its citizens to flee to SA to avoid poverty, political persecution, and maladministration. The mainstream media, which they control, have successfully sold the South African population the idea that Zimbabwe is a failed state that will never recover without them.\n\nZEPHA argues that the abuse of Zimbabweans in South Africa has caused significant psychological and emotional distress within the community. Many Zimbabweans now live in constant fear of deportation, violence, and discrimination. The association maintains that, without intervention, the situation could deteriorate further.\n\n",

The game was tough for both teams, and we struggled to create scoring opportunities.\n\nKaindu cited the teams lack of access to proper training facilities during pre-season as a significant contributing factor to their poor performance. We went without a suitable training ground for nearly a month, which has put us at a disadvantage. Were using these early games to make up for lost time and improve our fitness levels.\n\nDespite the setback, Kaindu remains optimistic about his teams prospects, saying, Theres plenty of room for improvement.

            "content": "Fire extinguishers are an important safety tool to have in your vehicle, but proper storage and maintenance are crucial to ensuring their effectiveness in an emergency. Here are some key tips to keep your fire extinguisher in top condition and ready for use.\n\nFirst and foremost, never expose your fire extinguisher to direct sunlight. Prolonged exposure to the suns rays can lead to dangerous conditions, potentially causing the extinguisher to explode, which could result in harm or damage to your vehicle. Always store it in a cool, dry place to ensure safety.\n\nIt is equally important to store your fire extinguisher in an accessible spot inside your vehicle. Avoid keeping it in the boot, as this could prevent you from accessing it quickly in the event of a fire. During a car fire, the vehicles electronic components may fail, causing the boot to become locked. This would make it difficult or impossible to reach your extinguisher. Instead, store it under your car seat or in the glove compartment where it can be quickly retrieved.\n\nIn addition to proper storage, regular checks are vital. Always verify the expiration date on your fire extinguisher. If the extinguisher is past its expiration date and is refillable, take it to a recognized agent to have it refilled, often at a lower cost than the original purchase price.\n\nRemember, keeping a fire extinguisher in your vehicle is an essential safety measure that can save lives in an emergency. By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your fire extinguisher remains effective when you need it most.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

He pledged $1 million to any prophet, pastor, or traditional healer who could accurately reveal what was in his pocket. This challenge, announced on March 2, 2025, sparked heated debates.\n\n",
