            "content": "By Religion Reporter- Several women have come forward to share their experiences involving a senior ZAOGA pastor who was dismissed amid allegations of engaging in multiple extramarital affairs with married female congregants.\n\nThe said overseer was recently fired after a woman from Rusape reported him to the churchs headquarters in Harare for neglecting the two children they share.\n\nThe scandal deepened when another woman accused him of sexual harassment, claiming he had sent her explicit nude photos.\n\nDuring questioning, the pastor confessed to his misdeeds, leading to his dismissal.\n\nHowever, the case has sparked outrage across the church as more allegations of misconduct surfaced.\n\nThe pastor, who previously pastored at a city-centre church in Bulawayo, allegedly left a trail of misconduct.\n\nSources said several women, including widows, divorcees, and unmarried congregants, have come forward claiming he made inappropriate advances, including late-night visits and sending lewd photos.\n\nDespite these allegations, some cases were suppressed, reportedly due to his support from another named Pastor, who was based in Bulawayo.\n\nThis scandal has reignited longstanding concerns about corruption and immorality within ZAOGAs leadership.\n\nThe church could not be reached for comment.\n\n",

Machana describes the accusations as a malicious attempt to undermine his candidacy and damage his reputation.\n\nAs the highly anticipated ZIFA election approaches on January 25, tensions have risen, with the race described as one of the most closely watched since independence due to the high-profile candidates involved. Efforts to disqualify certain candidates have intensified, creating a contentious atmosphere.\n\nThis week, the ZIFA Ethics Committee, which will review candidates before announcing the final list on December 23, was presented with objections against Machana, popular cleric Walter Magaya, and Northern Region Soccer League chairman Martin Kweza. A letter from K. Mugadzaweta, also sent to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), accused Machana of financial misconduct and fraud related to a forensic audit of ZIFAs finances from December 2018 to November 2021.\n\nIn response, Machana, through his legal team at Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, dismissed the allegations as unfounded and politically timed, noting that the complaints were lodged with ZACC only after the ZIFA election nominations had closed.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has strongly condemned the misuse of social media platforms by Zanu PF members to air the partys internal issues, calling for an immediate halt to the practice.\n\nHis remarks came during the 380th Ordinary Session of the Politburo, held at the Revolutionary Party HQ in Harare on Thursday.\n\nMnangagwa acknowledged that some members of his party had been using social media to expose internal divisions and conflicts, which he described as damaging to the partys unity and reputation.\n\nThis habit of using social media to attack the party must stop with immediate effect, Mnangagwa said firmly. Such behaviour is unacceptable.\n\nThe Zanu PF leader emphasized the importance of maintaining discipline within the party and adhering to its constitution, making it clear that internal disputes should be resolved within the party structures rather than on public platforms.\n\nThose who are doing it, spit on the ground and never do it again, Mnangagwa added, sending a stern message to party members who have been engaging in such behavior. Every party member must adhere to the party constitution.\n\nThe comments come amidst rising tensions within Zanu PF, where internal divisions have been increasingly evident. Social media, often a space for public debate, has become a battleground for party members to express their discontent, contributing to the deepening rift at the top levels of the ruling party.\n\nMnangagwas call to restore discipline within Zanu PF is seen as an effort to regain control over the partys narrative and prevent further damage to its image.\n\nHowever, his statement also raises questions about how the party intends to address the underlying issues fueling such public outbursts.\n\nWith political infighting growing, Mnangagwas warning signals a tough stance on party loyalty and unity in the face of mounting internal challenges.\n\n",
