However, his stay was relatively short-lived, with his exit now paving the way for a return to familiar territory.\n\nReports indicate that the 31-year-old is set to rejoin Moroccan powerhouse Wydad Casablanca on a permanent deal. Lorch previously featured for the North African side earlier in his career, and the move is expected to reignite his career on the continental stage.\n\nWhile Sundowns have yet to reveal the finer details of the transfer, the club thanked Lorch for his contributions and wished him success in his next chapter. For Wydad fans, his homecoming will be seen as a major boost ahead of the new season.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZANU PF Mashonaland East provincial chairman, Daniel Garwe, has sparked controversy by suggesting that President Emmerson Mnangagwas tenure could continue past the scheduled 2028 elections. Speaking to a ZANU PF district coordinating committee on 11 August, Garwe hailed the Presidents Vision 2030 economic blueprint as unstoppable, claiming that no force could derail it.\n\nThere will be no election in 2028, Garwe told party officials, emphasizing that the country would continue to focus on development regardless of political opposition. Were moving towards 2030, building the nation, whether anyone approves or not. Nothing can stop this agenda.\n\nGarwe appeared to take a subtle swipe at Vice-PresidentConstantino Chiwenga, widely seen as Mnangagwas potential successor. Mocking unnamed rivals, he referenced a bizarre traditional ritual, saying: Some think plucking a live black chicken can change the outcomebut the one in charge remains Mnangagwa. Dont waste effort on empty gestures.\n\nExtending Mnangagwas term beyond constitutional limits would require a formal amendment, a move that is expected to face strong opposition from rival political parties and dissenting members within ZANU PF itself.\n\nPublicly, Mnangagwa has maintained that he will step down when his current term concludes in 2028. Behind the scenes, however, party insiders suggest that loyalists are exploring strategies to block Chiwengas rise and promote businessmanKudakwashe Tagwireias party leader during the 2027 congress. Under this plan, Mnangagwa would officially resign, but Tagwirei, installed as vice president, could effectively extend the ruling factions influence until 2030.\n\nThe comments from Garwe have intensified debate about ZANU PFs internal succession dynamics and the potential constitutional and political battles that lie ahead as the country approaches the next election cycle.\n\n",

Unlicensed Medical Practice: Magaya has a documented history of administering unregulated chemicals and performing medical treatments without a license. His conviction in Zimbabwe followed fatal incidents involving toxic substances given to at least 4 members of his congregation.2. Ongoing Money Laundering Schemes: Since 2016, Magaya has operated alleged investment and property share schemes which investigative reports and victim testimonies confirm are fraudulent. Victims have sold property or invested life savings only to find no legitimate shares or assets existed, resulting in widespread financial ruin.\n\nThere are police cases in UK, South Africa and Zimbabwe.3. Sexual Exploitation Allegations: Police statements and Magayas own admissions during prior detentions in Zimbabwe reveal a pattern of grooming women for sexual purposes, followed by out-of-court payoffs to suppress complaints. Complainants have been pressured into signing non-disclosure agreements prepared by his legal team, in exchange for fake compensation promises.4. Outstanding Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) Investigation: Magaya remains a suspect in money laundering and tax evasion cases linked to undeclared foreign transactions dating back to 2017.5. Documented Pattern of Concealment: Multiple international media outlets have reported on Magayas use of deception to mask his true purpose of travel, including nondisclosure of planned commercial or medical activities to immigration and customs officials.\n\nThe continued alleging. His luggage must be searched including that of other travellers on the plane, cause he uses decoys.\n\nMagayas lawyer Emerson Chatambudza was reached for comment.\n\nThis is a developing security situation.\n\n",

Calls for self-reliance are meaningless when citizens are left to navigate unemployment, inflation, and systemic corruption with no support, they say.\n\nWhile the Presidents message emphasizes self-reliance, many young Zimbabweans contend that without addressing entrenched corruption at the highest levels, such appeals remain largely rhetorical, offering little practical guidance on how citizens can survive and thrive amid the ongoing crisis.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn yet another heavily scripted government event dressed up as empowerment, First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa will headline the inaugural three-day Bulawayo Women Investment Conference next month  a gathering critics say risks being more about political branding and Vision 2030 sloganeering than addressing the real economic struggles women face.\n\nThe conference, set for September 3 to 5, is being organised by the Office of the Minister of State for Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution in partnership with the Bulawayo City Council. Organisers claim it will promote economic independence and leadership among women, despite many questioning whether such platforms translate into tangible change on the ground.\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing yesterday, Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube said: I am excited to advise you that the Office of the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Bulawayo Metropolitan Province, in collaboration with the City of Bulawayo, will host the inaugural three-day Bulawayo Women Investment Conference 2025. Through this conference, we aspire to empower women by providing them with the tools, knowledge, and connections necessary to navigate the investment landscape, thereby contributing to the overall economic development of Bulawayo and beyond.\n\nMinister Ncube linked the initiative directly to the governments 2030 targets, saying: As we work towards achieving upper-middle-class income status by 2030, investing in womens economic potential is essential. This conference marks a critical step in building a future where women are equal drivers of our nations prosperity.\n\nThe event will feature sessions on investment strategies, financial literacy, leadership, mentorship, and access to funding. According to Ncube, We also engaged with different women who are into different businesses and in different levels. We strongly believe we can do it as Bulawayo and as people from Zimbabwe, hence we are going to gather from the 3rd to the 5th of September to discuss all those issues.\n\nOrganisers say the conference is informed by international engagements such as the Egyptian Programme and the 27th Arab-African Investment and International Cooperation Summit in Aswan, Egypt. It is also aligned with global frameworks including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the African Unions Agenda 2063, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nDespite the lofty rhetoric, many women in Bulawayo continue to face systemic barriers  from lack of access to capital to the collapse of local industries  with little evidence that high-profile conferences alone will resolve these entrenched challenges.\n\n",

DCC, do you hear? There are no elections. Were going to 2030 building the country, whether they like it or not, shame or no shame, were unstoppable, Garwe said, in what appeared to be a swipe at Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, widely seen as Mnangagwas most likely successor.\n\nGarwe also ridiculed unnamed rivals, alleging that one plucked a live black chicken in a failed bid to gain power, before adding: The one ruling is Mnangagwa Dont kill chickens in vain.\n\nAny extension of Mnangagwas presidency would require constitutional amendments  a move certain to draw fierce opposition both outside and within Zanu PF.\n\nParty insiders told ZimLive that while Mnangagwa has publicly insisted he will leave office when his term ends in 2028, some of his allies are quietly working on a plan to block Chiwengas rise. The reported strategy involves positioning sanctioned business magnate Kudakwashe Tagwirei to take over the party leadership at the Zanu PF congress in 2027.\n\nUnder the proposal, Mnangagwa would step down as scheduled, Tagwirei  by then installed as vice president  would serve out an extended presidential term until 2030. If successful, it would be the first time in Zimbabwes history that a businessman, rather than a career politician or military figure, ascends to the presidency.\n\n",
