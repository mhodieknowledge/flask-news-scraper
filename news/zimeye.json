            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri  Controversial Zanu PF businessman and Central Committee member Kudakwashe Tagwirei has sparked outrage after openly declaring that government tenders should primarily benefit ruling party supporters, whom he described as Zanu PF children.\n\nSpeaking at a Zanu PF Inter-District meeting held on Thursday at Gwanzura Stadium in Highfield, Tagwirei announced a series of highly politicised donations, including US$200,000 pumped into the Presidential Empowerment Revolving Fund. The money will be shared among the Main Wing, War Veterans, Youth League, and Womens League, each receiving US$50,000.\n\nIn a move critics say is designed to entrench Zanu PF patronage, Tagwirei also pledged to finance the construction of five clinics in Harares Zone 2, drill 80 boreholes, and push party members to register companies with PRAZ so they can access state tenders.\n\nTagwirei made his intentions clear, saying: Zanu PF children must benefit from national programmes; we are saying Zanu PF is for everyone.\n\nObservers say the statement exposes long-standing accusations that public resources are distributed on the basis of political loyalty rather than national interest. Community members also warned that such partisan control over tenders and basic services deepens inequality and erodes trust in public institutions.\n\n",

We are sorry to share the sad news that our colleague, Dr Temba Basopo-Moyo, has passed on. Please keep his family in your thoughts and prayers.\n\nA chapel service will be held today at Nyaradzo Funeral Parlour on Herbert Chitepo Avenue at 16:00, followed by burial tomorrow at Glen Forest.\n\nFormerly Nemapare, Dr Basopo Moyo was a respected academic and media expert. At the time of his death, he served as Dean of Information Technology and Multimedia Communications at the Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU), where he played a central role in establishing degree programmes in Information Technology, Software Engineering, Networking, and Multimedia Communications.\n\nHis passing closes a significant chapter in Zimbabwes media history. Dr Basopo Moyo was part of thefirst generation of professional broadcasters who returned home after independence, bringing international training and expertise to transform the Rhodesia Broadcasting Corporation (RBC) into the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC). He returned from training in the United States and became part of a cohort that included:\n\nThey worked alongside distinguished pre-independence broadcasters and liberation-era media cadres such as:\n\nTogether, this diverse group formed the backbone of Zimbabwes national broadcaster in the early 1980s, professionalising news production, expanding African-language programming, and laying the foundations for Radio One, Radio Two (now Radio Zimbabwe), Radio Three (Power FM), and Radio Four (National FM).\n\nDr Basopo Moyo was known for his technical expertise, calm leadership, and commitment to using broadcasting as a nation-building tool at a time when Zimbabwe sought to rebuild after a long liberation struggle. Veteran broadcasterJohn Masuku, who profiled Dr Moyo and his contemporaries in April 2024, noted that their generation brought together skills acquired inside and outside the country during the struggle for freedom, and united around a shared belief in Zimbabwes non-reversible post-colonial development trajectory.\n\nDr Moyos legacy spans public broadcasting, media training, academic leadership, and institution-building. His contribution helped shape generations of journalists, technicians, and media scholars.\n\nZimbabwe has lost a pioneer, a mentor, and a distinguished nation-builder.\n\nMay his soul rest in peace.\n\n",

Responding to the call, Colonel Baloyi-Chiwenga travelled to the musicians home in one of Harares most under-resourced suburbs, where he has lived and worked for years despite living with a severe disability.\n\nResidents said her unannounced visit brought a rare moment of inspiration to the community. The donation of wheelchairs and fuel support is expected to significantly bolster Greatmans self-funded programme, which has already reached hundreds of beneficiaries across the country.\n\nA visibly emotional Greatman expressed deep gratitude following the visit.I never imagined the Second Lady of Zimbabwe would come to my neighbourhood, to my home,he said.She brought the wheelchairs, left money for fuel, and honoured the work we are doing.\n\nColonel Baloyi-Chiwengas engagement drew praise from locals, who described her as a compassionate and hands-on public figure willing to connect directly with communities far from political power. A serving army colonel and accomplished professional, she has in recent months become increasingly visible in advocacy work around disability inclusion and grassroots welfare support.\n\nShe emphasised that her contribution was meant to strengthen an initiative built on resilience, generosity, and service. Her gesture underscored the principle that disability does not erase human potential, and that leadership is demonstrated not only through policy but also through practical acts of care.\n\nFor Greatman, the donation represents far more than equipment  it is a reinforcement of dignity and opportunity for people who have long struggled without assistance.We move with dignity now,he said.Someone from the highest levels of leadership came here and told us we matter.\n\nAcross Zimbabwe, the intervention has been widely received as part of a growing appreciation for practical, community-centred support for vulnerable groups. Colonel Baloyi-Chiwengas visit, many say, is a reminder that meaningful public service is rooted in compassion, presence, and direct engagement with the people.\n\n",
