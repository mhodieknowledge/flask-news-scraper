            "content": "Maputo, Mozambique  Monday, December 23, 2024\n\nOpposition presidential candidate Venncio Mondlane has issued a bold call for a nationwide five-day shutdown from Monday to Friday, urging Mozambicans to reflect on the countrys future. In a live broadcast on his Facebook page, Mondlane made a passionate appeal to citizens, framing the moment as critical in the fight against what he described as a corrupt and oppressive regime.\n\nA Unique Opportunity for Mozambique\n\nThis is not a week for work, declared Mondlane during the broadcast. From today until Friday, let us take this time for deep reflection on the future of our country. Its time to open our eyes. This is a unique opportunity.\n\nMondlane called for citizens to consider the path Mozambique has taken, highlighting concerns over governance, economic stability, and human rights.\n\nEconomic Criticism and Financial Concerns\n\nThe opposition leader also questioned recent government actions, particularly the payment of retroactive salaries to public servants and members of the armed forces. After this, where will your salaries come from? Think wisely and intelligently. Lets not be nave, he said, raising doubts about the countrys financial sustainability.\n\nSharp Criticism of Governance and Corruption\n\nMondlane did not mince words in his condemnation of the current administration, accusing it of fostering a culture of corruption, poor governance, and human rights violations.\n\nLet us see if from the mouth of Lcia Ribeiro [President of the Constitutional Council] will come grenades, explosives, AKM bullets, or tear gas. They will decide if this country continues on the path of dictatorship, assassinations, death squads, corruption, scams, thefts, kidnappings, and abductions, he said. Will we continue to live on crumbs? We are drowning in misery, poor governance, and corruption.\n\nElection Results and Public Discontent\n\nMondlanes remarks come on the heels of the Constitutional Councils announcement declaring Daniel Chapo as the winner of the presidential election with 65% of the vote. The opposition has disputed the results, citing irregularities and discrepancies in the electoral process. Civil society organizations and observers have also voiced concerns, further intensifying public discontent.\n\nNation on Edge\n\nThe call for a shutdown has raised fears of unrest as Mozambique grapples with the aftermath of a contentious election. Mondlanes inflammatory rhetoric and direct criticism of the government are likely to galvanize his supporters but may also deepen divisions within the country.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs the five-day shutdown begins, Mozambique faces an uncertain and potentially volatile week. Citizens, opposition parties, and the government await further developments, including the Constitutional Councils responses to lingering complaints and appeals.\n\nThe nation now stands at a crossroads, with many questioning whether the current leadership can address the mounting challenges or whether it will face intensified resistance from the opposition and the public.\n\n",

Guardiolas side had a difficult start, conceding an early goal from Jhon Duran, and Villa extended their lead in the second half with a goal from Morgan Rogers. Phil Fodens stoppage-time goal was only a consolation.\n\nThe loss saw Manchester City drop to sixth place in the league, now nine points behind leaders Liverpool.\n\nGuardiola reflected on the performance, saying, Of course, there are more reasons. We concede goals we didnt concede in the past, and were not scoring the goals we used to. Football isnt about one single reason; there are many small factors at play.\n\nHe continued, Aston Villa are performing well in both the Champions League and Premier League. Its a tough place to visit. Last season, we won the Premier League, but we lost here.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Guardiola expressed confidence in his team, adding, We must remain positive. I have immense trust in these players. Some have incredible pride and a strong desire to succeed. We need to find a way, step by step, to turn things around.\n\n",

The Council, led by President Lucia Ribeiro, provided detailed responses to each complaint and appeal, shedding light on the contentious issues surrounding the electoral process.\n\n\nElection Complaints and Irregularities\n\nLucia Ribeiro began by outlining the context of the elections, including the total number of registered voters and the turnout rates. She acknowledged discrepancies in voter numbers, which opposition parties and civil society groups have flagged as potential indicators of fraud. Notably, civil society observers refused to share their reports, citing fears of being implicated in what they described as a fraudulent process.\n\nSubsequently, on November 20, 2024, one appeal from the Podemos party was submitted to the National Elections Commission (CNE), invoking the annulment of presidential election results in the diaspora in the Republic of Zimbabwe for alleged irregularities. The request in question was rejected due to lack of evidence and failure to meet procedural requirements, said Ribeiro.\n\nOpposition Concerns and Civil Society Stance\n\nThe opposition has been vocal in its criticism of the election process, with multiple appeals submitted to the Constitutional Council. The President of the Council described the content of these appeals as varied but largely focused on discrepancies in voter data and procedural flaws.\n\nAdding to the complexity, civil society organizations have refused to cooperate fully, arguing that they do not want to legitimize what they perceive as a flawed election process. This refusal has further strained the credibility of the electoral outcome.\n\nElection Results Announced\n\nAmid the controversies, the Constitutional Council officially declared Daniel Chapo as the President of Mozambique with approximately 65% of the vote. This figure marks a decrease from earlier projections, which had placed his support at 70%. The adjustment in numbers was attributed to ongoing scrutiny of voter data.\n\n\n\nCalls for Shutdown and Growing Tensions\n\nCommunicating hours before the announcement, opposition candidate Venncio Mondlane called for a nationwide five-day shutdown starting Monday. He urged citizens to protest what he described as a deeply compromised election process. The call for action has sparked concerns over potential unrest in the days ahead.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs Mozambique grapples with the aftermath of its contentious election, the Constitutional Council has pledged to provide clarity on each complaint and appeal. However, with civil societys refusal to engage and the opposition mobilizing public protests, the path forward remains uncertain.\n\nThe nation now waits to see how the government and opposition will navigate this critical juncture in Mozambiques democratic journey.- ZimEye\n\nSubsequently, on 20 Nov 2024, 1 resource from the Podemos party entered the CNE, invoking the annulment of presidential elections results in the diaspora in the Republic of Zimbabwe for alleged irregularities, the request in question was rejected due to impunity and lack of priorpic.twitter.com/S9LT8rN8sL\n\n",

During these holidays, they should not be caught in political games but rather be surrounded by love.\n\nThis collective voice adds to a growing sentiment among activists calling for greater accountability among public figures in relation to their familial duties.\n\n",
