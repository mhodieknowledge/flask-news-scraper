            "content": "Investigative Report: The Power Struggles Behind Zimbabwes Police Commissioner General Shakeup\n\nBy Investigation Seals | ZimEye |The recent announcement by Zimbabwes government spokesperson Nick Mangwana that Police Commissioner General Godwin Matanga has been retired due to age has sparked a flurry of controversy. His replacement, Deputy Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba, is not only older than Matanga but also carries a complex and controversial history that raises serious questions about governance, political interference, and international manipulation.\n\nThe Official Explanation vs. the Facts\n\nMangwana stated that Matanga, born in 1962, was retired because of his age. Yet, Mutamba, born in 1961, is one year older, making the age rationale implausible. This discrepancy has fueled speculation that Matangas removal was politically motivated, with multiple sources pointing to deep-seated tensions within Zimbabwes ruling ZANU-PF party and allegations of undue influence from First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa.\n\nMutambas Controversial Rise\n\nMutambas rise to the position of Commissioner General has been anything but straightforward. In 2021, he was sanctioned by the U.S. government for alleged cruelty to opposition members. However, ZimEye sources claim this sanctions listing may have been orchestrated as part of a strategic play to position Mutamba for promotion. One insider close to Auxillia Mnangagwa alleged, He secretly threw dirt on himself for mere convenience to get marked by ZANU-PF leadership as a victim of U.S. aggression.\n\nCritics argue that the sanctions, which were unusually targeted at a deputy rather than the commissioner, were intended to discredit Matanga and pave the way for Mutambas ascendancy. Notably, Matanga had just returned from a U.S. trip when the sanctions against Mutamba were announced, further fueling speculation about external interference.\n\nThe First Ladys Influence\n\nAuxillia Mnangagwas role in the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has been under scrutiny. Several sources claim she has been instrumental in orchestrating Mutambas promotion. Reports suggest she has used her influence to protect Mutamba from accountability, including intervening when Matanga attempted to suspend him for controversial actions, such as the firing of officers involved in the arrest of Drax International-linked businessman Delish Nguwaya.\n\nMutambas alleged involvement in collecting money from miners and other activities on behalf of Auxillia Mnangagwa raises additional concerns. Critics argue that his close ties to the First Lady compromise the independence of the ZRP and risk further entrenching corruption.\n\nSecret JOC Emerging.\n\nThe perhaps the most plausible development is covered in an investigation that was done that was concluded with a video call with First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa. This expose shows with undeniable detail that the First Lady, a trained CIO agent, is assembling a new joint operations command, a gang of armed robbers that reports directly to her. This group includes her own brother Paradzayi Kutyauripo, a convicted armed robber who has been appointed Director of all State Residences, and will be doubling as a traditional chief.\n\nThis program if successful will place Auxillia as a powerful First Lady with way stronger powers than her predecessor Grace Mugabe who was disrespected by the military apparatus because she had no state powers under her command. (Watch the full video below)\n\nCIA Involvement?\n\nThe timing and nature of Mutambas sanctions have led to speculation about the involvement of foreign intelligence agencies, particularly the CIA. Some sources suggest the U.S. aimed to destabilize the ZRPs leadership ahead of the 2023 elections by creating divisions between Matanga and Mutamba. While these claims remain unverified, the narrative has gained traction among ZANU-PF loyalists.\n\nNo comment could be obtained from the CIA.\n\nMutambas Denials\n\nWhen contacted by ZimEye, Mutamba denied allegations that he sought Mnangagwas favor for his promotion. However, he did not refute his familial ties to Auxillia Mnangagwa. His response was evasive, and he quickly ended the call when pressed further about his alleged cruelty to opposition members and the reasons behind his U.S. sanctions.\n\nContacted by ZimEye, Mutamba has denied approaching Emmerson Mnangagwa. He expressed shock and asked Simba Chikanza saying, where did you hear that?, before quickly dropping the phone call. He however did not deny that he is related to First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa.\n\nMatangas U.S. Trip: A Turning Point?\n\nMatangas 2021 trip to the U.S. has also come under scrutiny. Rumors suggest he may have met with CIA agents during the visit, a claim Matanga has neither confirmed nor denied. While the purpose of his trip was officially described as attending an international seminar, the timing of subsequent events raises questions about whether he became a target of manipulation by external forces.\n\nWhats at Stake?\n\nThe implications of Mutambas appointment are far-reaching. Critics argue that his leadership could further erode the ZRPs credibility, given his alleged history of corruption and political interference. Others warn that his close ties to the First Family may signal an alarming consolidation of power within ZANU-PF, with the police force becoming an instrument of personal and political agendas.\n\nQuestions That Remain Unanswered1. Why was Matanga truly removed? If age was not the issue, what were the underlying reasons for his dismissal?2. Is Mutambas sanctions listing genuine? Or was it a calculated move to position him for promotion?3. What role does Auxillia Mnangagwa play in ZRP leadership decisions?4. Is the CIA involved? Could foreign powers be manipulating internal ZANU-PF dynamics to achieve broader geopolitical objectives?5. What does this mean for Zimbabwes future? With elections looming, how will these power struggles impact governance and accountability?\n\nThe replacement of Godwin Matanga with Stephen Mutamba as Police Commissioner General has exposed deep divisions and unresolved questions about the interplay of power, corruption, and foreign influence in Zimbabwe. As the dust settles, the stakes for the countrys governance and stability remain high. Transparency and accountability will be critical in ensuring that the ZRP serves the people of Zimbabwe, rather than the interests of a select few.\n\n",

            "content": "Upper Manyame Sub-Catchment Council\n\nBy A Correspondent | ZimEye |A resident has come forward with shocking allegations of corruption and unethical practices at the Upper Manyame Sub-Catchment Council after experiencing frustration while attempting to make a payment for a borehole permit. The incident, which occurred today, has sparked outrage over the alleged abuse of authority and lack of transparency in government-related institutions.\n\nAccording to the complainant, they were denied the ability to swipe their bank card to make the payment without producing a national IDa demand that many feel is excessive and unnecessary. What made the situation more questionable is that paying in USD cash was allowed without any such requirement.\n\nI was told I could only swipe if I produced my ID, yet paying in cash required no such proof, the complainant said. This inconsistency shows clear favoritism towards cash payments, which raises serious questions about financial integrity and transparency.\n\nConcerns Over Transparency\n\nThe complainant noted that a notice was posted at the cash office clearly outlining the ID requirement for swiping, further reinforcing suspicions about deliberate efforts to inconvenience card payments in favor of cash transactions. Why would they make it harder to pay digitally unless theres something fishy happening with cash payments? the complainant asked.\n\nWater Access Crisis\n\nThe allegations are made worse by frustrations over the councils poor service delivery. Despite charging fees for borehole drilling and water usage, the complainant reported that the council does not supply water to their area. Access to water is a basic human right. How can they charge us exorbitant fees and then make the process of paying unnecessarily difficult?\n\nThe situation has reignited anger over the state of water services in Zimbabwe, where residents often bear the cost of drilling their own boreholes while receiving little to no support from local authorities.\n\nCalls for Action\n\nThe complainant is calling on the Government of Zimbabwe and anti-corruption agencies to investigate the alleged misconduct and hold those responsible accountable. This is unacceptable. Financial intelligence authorities must step in, and those involved should face justice. Access to water is a right, not a privilege, they said.\n\nallegations.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\n",

His remains were later recovered from the crocodiles. This incident, along with another case of an 18-year-old boy drowning in prohibited waters at Matobo National Park, has sparked renewed calls for adherence to park rules and safety regulations.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) released a statement addressing the incidents. We wish to remind all visitors into Parks Estates of the importance of adhering to the rules and regulations established to preserve the safety of both individuals and wildlife within our estates, said Tinashe Farawo, ZimParks spokesperson.\n\nOffering condolences to the bereaved families, ZimParks stated, Our condolences to the bereaved families. May their souls rest in peace. These incidents serve as a reminder of the risks associated with failure to follow laid-down rules and regulations within the parks estates.\n\nThe statement further urged visitors to strictly observe designated park visiting hours and to avoid unauthorized activities. We urge members of the public to adhere to the strictly designated park visiting hours (6 AM  6 PM). Always follow the rules and regulations and familiarize yourself with the wildlife present in the area in order to understand the potential dangers they pose, the statement read.\n\nPublic Safety Warning\n\nThe incidents underscore the life-threatening risks of disregarding park regulations.

According to ZIMLIVE, the deal included booking 200 rooms for five days, catering to 200 couplesa move many view as prioritizing financial gain over public interest. Critics argue that this not only denies thousands of Zimbabweans their annual source of solace and celebration but also exposes the power dynamics at play in the country.\n\nPublic Outcry Over Financial Power Abuse\n\nWinky Ds fans, numbering in the thousands, have expressed their outrage over what they describe as a betrayal of public trust and cultural values. For many, his performances are more than just entertainmentthey are a source of comfort and empowerment for Zimbabwes economically and socially downtrodden. The sudden cancellation has left fans feeling robbed of their annual ritual of healing and celebration.\n\nThis is not just about a concert, said one fan. Its about the disregard for ordinary people in favor of financial muscle. Its a disturbing precedent where might trumps right.\n\nMoral Concerns Highlighted\n\nCritics of the saga argue that this incident reflects a broader issue of power imbalance in Zimbabwe. Questions are being raised about the ethical implications of allowing financial power to override principles and commitments. A widely shared concern is that such practices could spill over into other aspects of public life, from the justice system to business ethics, creating a dangerous culture of impunity.\n\nIf someone with money can disrupt this tradition, what stops them from undermining other systems meant to serve the public? a concerned citizen asked. Where do we draw the line?\n\nWinky Ds Silence\n\nWinky D himself has remained tight-lipped about the controversy, leaving his fans to speculate on the reasons behind his absence from this years event. While some are hopeful for a statement or a possible rescheduling of the event, others feel this is a wake-up call for a more equitable and transparent system that prioritizes public interest over private gain.\n\nA Call for Justice\n\nAs public outrage grows, many are calling for accountability from the parties involved. The hope is that this incident will spark a broader conversation about the need for fairness, transparency, and the protection of cultural spaces from undue influence.\n\nFor now, Winky Ds fans are left with disappointment and questions about whether their beloved artist will be allowed to continue providing the solace and inspiration they so desperately seek. The ball is now in the court of HICC, Tagwireyi, and Winky D to address the publics concerns and restore trust in a society where cultural heritage often feels under siege.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent | ZimEye |Barely three years after presenting himself as a voice for the poor during a meeting with Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, Prophet Andrew Wutaunashe, a controversial religious figure aligned with Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, has come under fire for pressuring his Botswana congregants to buy him a car.\n\nSpeaking at a church gathering in Gaborone five days ago, Wutaunashe, described by critics as giant-bellied and advised by doctors to walk for his health, demanded that members of his economically struggling congregation procure a vehicle for him within four months.\n\nBarely 3 years after telling@JustinWelby@churchofenglandthat his UK trip is because he is troubled for the poor, Emmerson Mnangagwas giant-bellied prophet, Andrew Wutaunashe, 5 days ago, demands a car from poor Botswana church members (pictured). The preacher advised byhttps://t.co/uDQbeJ6Q95pic.twitter.com/UXfqzFzfCh\n\nIn his address, Wutaunashe joked with the audience, saying, Say Halleluyah! Praise God! I know all the Bishops love me, so I know that at Easter Camp next year, the Bishops will give me a car Just provoking you, but I really appreciate all Despite his light-hearted tone, the implicit demand has sparked outrage across social and religious circles.\n\nA Troubling Contradiction\n\nThis recent development stands in stark contrast to Wutaunashes claims in November 2021 when he lobbied the Archbishop of Canterbury to support the removal of Western sanctions against Zimbabwe. During his meeting with Justin Welby, Wutaunashe portrayed himself as a champion of the impoverished, blaming sanctions for crippling Zimbabwes economy and exacerbating poverty.\n\nWere actually troubled for the poor, Wutaunashe said at the time, suggesting that sanctions, rather than corruption and mismanagement, were responsible for Zimbabwes dire economic state. However, his demands in Gaborone paint a different picture, with critics accusing him of exploiting the very poor he once claimed to advocate for.\n\nArchbishops Warning Revisited\n\nArchbishop Welbys 2021 response to Wutaunashes plea now carries renewed significance. In his remarks, the Archbishop emphasized that sanctions relief should only benefit the truly disadvantaged and not those involved in corruption. Sanctions relief should be only for the poor who dont steal money that is not theirs, he stated.\n\nWutaunashes actions have reignited debate about the integrity of religious leaders who align themselves with political figures like Mnangagwa.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) has announced that load shedding will soon be a thing of the past, citing the ongoing construction of 13 new power stations that are set to significantly increase the countrys electricity supply.\n\nThese 13 new power stations are either under construction or will be commissioned by 2025, ZESA said in a statement. These are not just plans; they are actual investments. Collectively, they will add 4,600 Megawatts to the grid, which is three times our current maximum demand.\n\nZESA also noted that the surge in power generation may bring new challenges, such as the possibility of surplus electricity that could attract interest from neighboring countries. We may face a situation where other countries are more eager to take advantage of this surplus power, the statement added.\n\nThe authority highlighted the importance of collaboration with the informal sector to fully utilize these resources and assured the public that the issue of load shedding will soon be resolved.\n\n",
