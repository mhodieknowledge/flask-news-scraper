His presence had triggered backlash from opposition figures and war veterans who accused him of selling out and cutting deals in the shadows.\n\nHis reappearance triggered widespread speculation of a political comeback, with critics accusing him of cutting secret deals.\n\nWar veterans and opposition figures were particularly vocal, accusing Mzembi of betrayal.\n\nWhether his return was part of a failed political arrangement or a misjudgment that reopened legal trouble, Mzembis case could now have wider implicationsparticularly for the religious institutions that benefited from his alleged misuse of state assets.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dr Trywell Muzerengi\n\nOyster mushroom farming is fast emerging as one of the most accessible and profitable agribusiness opportunities in Zimbabwe, offering a low-cost, high-value avenue for income generation, food security, and environmental restoration.\n\nUnlike many traditional crops that require expensive inputs, oyster mushrooms are incredibly cheap to grow. You can use locally available crop residues as a growing medium, such as maize stalks, wheat straw, or cotton waste, explains Dr Trywell Muzerengi. This makes the enterprise ideal for rural and urban farmers alike, especially those with limited resources.\n\nZimbabwe currently imports over 80% of its mushroom fruit from South Africa, highlighting a massive gap in the local supply chain and a ripe opportunity for domestic producers.\n\nAnother key advantage is that mushroom farming does not require costly infrastructure. You dont need expensive mushroom houses, Dr Muzerengi adds. You can construct low-cost structures using poles and thatch grass, or even convert existing tobacco barns into mushroom housesespecially in winter.\n\nOyster mushrooms can be grown year-round, giving farmers a continuous production cycle and consistent income potential. Beyond food, mushrooms are in high demand for pharmaceutical applications, including the production of pills and natural health products. Additionally, oyster mushrooms play an important role in land reclamation, particularly on land degraded by mining and cyanidation.\n\nThe Chinese are already taking advantage of Zimbabwes favourable climate to grow mushroom fruits for export, notes Dr Muzerengi. We need to harness this potential ourselves, especially with ready export and local markets.\n\nThe benefits of oyster mushroom farming go beyond economics. It offers a path to self-employment, food nutrition, and value addition opportunities. Entrepreneurs can venture into producing mushroom-based products such as biltong, soaps, and even cosmetics for both local and international markets.\n\nIn a time when traditional farming faces numerous challengesfrom climate change to market instabilityoyster mushroom farming stands out as a resilient, affordable, and scalable solution for individuals and communities looking to grow wealth and sustainability from the soil up.\n\nDr Trywell Muzerengi is an agricultural expert and advocate for sustainable agribusiness innovations in Zimbabwe.\n\nemail:[emailprotected]\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nControversial businessman and ZANU PF ally Kudakwashe Tagwirei has leapt to the defence of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, painting him as a humble and hardworking leader who lives modestly and contributes significantly to the countrys food security.\n\nSpeaking recently in Harare, Tagwirei dismissed critics of the President, insisting that public perception fails to capture the true character of Mnangagwa. He described him as a down-to-earth, accessible leader with strong agricultural credentials and a simple lifestyle.\n\nYou dont know him, thats why you are negative, Tagwirei said. President Mnangagwa owns a moderate house, a sign of simplicity.\n\nIn an unusual attempt to showcase Mnangagwas personal integrity and productivity, Tagwirei claimed the President is an accomplished farmer who annually delivers5,000 tonnes of maizeto the Grain Marketing Board (GMB).\n\nSince 2008, he has yielded over 10 tonnes of farm produce, including soybeans, maize, potatoes, and other crops, Tagwirei added, touting the Presidents farming record as proof of his work ethic and leadership by example.\n\nHe further praised Mnangagwas openness and connection with ordinary citizens.\n\nHe has an open-door policy and talks to people when hes outside. Thats rare among leaders, Tagwirei said.\n\nThe remarks appear to be part of a broader effort to bolster Mnangagwas image amid increasing public dissatisfaction over economic woes, inflation, and concerns over corruption and elite enrichment.\n\nWhile critics often accuse Zimbabwes top leadership of extravagance and detachment from the public, Tagwireis statements aim to paint a contrasting picture: a president who not only leads the country but also tills the land and lives simply.\n\nHowever, the comments are likely to draw mixed reactions, especially given Tagwireis own controversial reputation and links to state contracts and sanctions. Still, his vocal support signals a continued push by the ruling elite to shape Mnangagwas legacy ahead of any future leadership transitions.\n\nWhether the public buys into this narrative of presidential humility remains to be seen.\n\n",

Despite her iconic status, Mai Jilimbas request underscores the lack of structured support for artists and the increasing normalization of public begging by once-revered cultural figures.\n\nCritics say the situation reflects the broader failure of government and cultural institutions to protect and provide for national artists who, in many cases, helped shape Zimbabwes identity through film, theatre, and television.\n\nMeanwhile, Chivayo has not publicly responded to the appeal. Whether or not he grants the request, the actresss plea adds to the growing list of public figures turning to the businessman for financial lifelines in a country where fame often fails to guarantee livelihood.\n\n",

            "content": "By Business Reporter The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has said they were putting measures to curb the shortage of Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG).\n\nThe current scarcity, particularly pronounced in areas outside Harare, has reignited concerns over Zimbabwes long-standing monetary instability, which dates back to the early 2000s.\n\nThe ongoing crisis is rooted in decades of poor economic governance, failed monetary reforms, and public distrust in the financial system.\n\nThese systemic issues have left the country trapped in a cycle of currency collapse, cash shortages, and inflationary pressures.\n\nSince 2000, Zimbabwe has undergone numerous currency changes, each accompanied by promises of stability that failed to materialize.\n\nFrom the infamous Zimbabwean dollaronce rendered worthless by hyperinflationto the US dollar era and the later RTGS dollar experiment, each phase has been plagued by inconsistent policy decisions, political interference in monetary affairs, and lack of confidence in the central bank.\n\nThe introduction of ZiG in April 2024 was the latest attempt to restore stability through a gold-backed currency.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday, RBZ Governor John Mushayavanhusought to calm public anxiety, insisting that there is no shortage of ZiG in the market.\n\nHe said the usage of the local currency has improved significantly in the economy, citing figures that show the value of local currency settlements through the National Payment System jumped fromZiG7.86 billion(26%) in April toZiG56.8 billion(43%) by May 30, 2025.\n\nMushayavanhu explained that as of June 12, total ZiG deposits in the banking sector amounted toZiG16 billion, with overZiG207 millionheld as physical cash by commercial banks. This is sufficient to support daily deposits and withdrawals by the public, he claimed.\n\nHowever, on the ground, the story is different.\n\nLong queues at banks, limited cash at ATMs, and rising complaints from businesses and consumers alike paint a picture of a currency system once again failing to meet everyday needs.\n\nWhile the RBZ says some banks have begun disbursing ZiG through ATMs and others are in the process of reconfiguring their machines, distribution remains patchy and slow.\n\nTo address the crisis, the central bank says it is working closely with financial institutions to scale up the availability of ZiG in both physical and electronic forms.\n\nThe government also believes that current macroeconomic stability and a firm exchange rate will eventually improve public confidence in the currency.\n\nBut critics argue that until deeper structural issues are addressedsuch as rampant corruption, poor fiscal discipline, and opaque policy-makingnew currencies will continue to suffer the same fate.\n\nMany Zimbabweans remain sceptical of the ZiGs long-term viability, viewing it as just another rebranding exercise masking deeper economic rot.\n\nDespite official reassurances, the current cash shortages serve as a sobering reminder that without genuine economic reforms, Zimbabwes monetary challenges are far from over.\n\n",
