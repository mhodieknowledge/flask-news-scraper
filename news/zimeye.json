The purpose of the visit is to assess the situation on the ground and to put in place strategies to curb the diseases spread.\n\nReports indicate that 68 cases have been verified, and the death toll stands at eight, leading to a case fatality rate of 2.4%.\n\n",

            "content": "Overloading buses to the point where passengers are standing is becoming an increasing safety hazard. While it may be a common practice, this situation poses serious risks to passengers and needs to be addressed by authorities.\n\nOne of the main dangers of overcrowded buses is the excessive weight that is placed on the vehicle.\n\nWhen a bus is overloaded, it becomes harder for the driver to maintain control, especially when navigating sharp turns or sudden stops. In the event the driver is forced to apply the emergency brake, passengers who are standing are at risk of falling and sustaining injuries due to the lack of support.\n\nMoreover, standing passengers are more vulnerable to accidents in the event of sudden maneuvers.\n\nThey lack the security of a seat belt or a steady handrail, making them more likely to be thrown off balance and potentially hurt in an accident. The possibility of injury only increases when buses are traveling at high speeds or during congested traffic conditions.\n\nThe safety of passengers should always be a priority, and overloading buses compromises this fundamental principle. Passengers deserve a safe and secure journey, and it is crucial for bus operators and regulatory authorities to enforce strict guidelines on vehicle capacity to prevent overloading.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, authorities should consider increasing inspections of public transportation systems and impose fines for overloading violations. Moreover, bus companies must adhere to regulated passenger limits and ensure that all safety protocols are followed to protect the well-being of those traveling.\n\nIn conclusion, the practice of overloading buses is not only illegal but extremely dangerous. It is essential for both passengers and authorities to recognize the risks involved and work together to prioritize safety in public transport.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has issued a 48-hour ultimatum for local authorities to remove illegal vendors, particularly those operating at night, from undesignated spaces across cities and towns.\n\nThis crackdown, set to be enforced with the aid of law enforcement agencies, has ignited a heated debate.\n\nWhile the government justifies the move as a necessary measure for public health and safety, the deeper issue behind the proliferation of informal markets remains the countrys soaring unemployment rate.\n\nThe question now is whether these severe actions will truly revive the nations struggling economy, or if they will stoke further unrest.\n\nMinister of Local Government and Public Works, Daniel Garwe, expressed concern over what he described as serious health, safety, and security concerns related to the rise in unregulated markets.\n\nHe claimed that these unregulated spaces were not only disrupting registered businesses but were also creating unsanitary conditions that could lead to diseases such as cholera and typhoid. The mushrooming of unregulated marketplaces has disrupted legally registered businesses, Garwe remarked, adding that the expansion of the informal sector was fostering unfair competition and increasing unsanitary conditions.\n\nDespite these claims, Garwes comments fail to address the root cause of the issuethe countrys severe unemployment crisis. With the formal economy failing to provide enough job opportunities, many Zimbabweans, especially the youth, have turned to street vending as their only means of survival. These vendors are not criminals; they are citizens who have been left with no alternative in a deteriorating economy. Its not merely a question of public healthits about the economic desperation that forces people to seek any means of livelihood.\n\nWhats even more telling is the backdrop of fear and insecurity within President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration.\n\nThe governments decision to crack down on street vendors is widely seen as a direct response to rising tensions and growing dissent among the population.\n\nWar veteran Blessed Geza, in particular, has vowed to mobilize protests, threatening to organize public demonstrations against the regime.\n\nThis move by the Mnangagwa regime is seen as an effort to stave off potential unrest.\n\nThe authorities seem increasingly aware that their grip on power is slipping, and Gezas vow to stir protests underscores their growing fear of a popular uprising.\n\nAs the government pushes forward with its plans, the question remains whether these measures will quell the discontent or fuel further opposition.\n\nThe actions against vendors may be a short-term attempt to restore order, but the root causes of the unresteconomic hardship and lack of opportunityremain deeply entrenched.\n\n",

The people of Africa are with you wholeheartedly  being the nucleus of the New Africa.\n\nBenjamin Anyagre Aziginaateeg,CEO, AfriKan Continental Union Consult -ACUC-\n\n",
