            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a move that has sparked significant debate, the government is set to introduce a new bill in Parliament aimed at compelling motorists to pay for Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) licenses.\n\nThis bill is expected to require all vehicle owners to settle their ZBC licenses alongside their vehicle registration, insurance, and other related payments through a unified platform.\n\nA key part of the proposal involves creating a single disc that would serve multiple purposes. According to a ZINARA official, the new initiative is designed to streamline the payment process for motorists, ensuring that they only need to acquire one disc for their vehicle. One Disc for ZBC, ZINARA, & Insurance Paymentsthats the plan, the official stated during a press briefing on Tuesday.\n\nThe proposal has sparked concerns and resistance among Zimbabwes motorists, many of whom have vowed to push back against the enforcement of the radio license payments. Many drivers argue that the current system of licensing is burdensome and unnecessary, particularly given the financial challenges many face in the current economic climate. Critics of the plan are questioning the practicality of adding another layer of payment to the already high costs of vehicle ownership.\n\nWe will not accept paying for a radio license that we dont use, one motorist, who preferred to remain anonymous, expressed during an interview. Its an additional burden on us, and the government should reconsider its stance.\n\nThis new bill is set to be a topic of intense discussion in Parliament, as lawmakers debate its potential impact on Zimbabwean motorists and the countrys media landscape. Supporters argue that the unified disc system will simplify payment procedures and potentially increase revenue for the state-run broadcaster, which has long struggled with funding and operational challenges. ZBC, a key player in the nations media industry, has been calling for increased funding to improve its services.\n\nWhile the bill aims to modernize the payment process, it raises significant concerns about its implementation. Motorists resistance could pose challenges for the government, especially in a country already grappling with high living costs and economic uncertainty.\n\nAs the bill moves closer to Parliament, both the government and citizens will likely engage in further discussions about the feasibility and fairness of this new policy. With motorists vows to resist, the government will need to carefully consider its next steps in enforcing the payment of ZBC licenses.\n\n",

            "content": "Mnangagwa Buries 2030 Debate, Government Responds to Catholic Bishops Concerns\n\nHarare, Zimbabwe  Presidential Spokesperson George Charamba has reaffirmed that President Emmerson Mnangagwa has buried the debate over a 2030 presidential term extension, dismissing it as a dead and buried issue.\n\nThis comes after the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops Conference (ZCBC) released a pastoral letter addressing various national concerns, including presidential term limits, taxation policies, the death penalty, and the countrys debt crisis.\n\nGovernments Response to ZCBC Statement\n\nIn response, Charamba, who also serves as the Deputy Chief Secretary for Presidential Communications, said while the Government appreciates the Churchs role in nation-building and constructive criticism, it finds some of the bishops statements unnecessary, especially regarding the presidential term extension debate.\n\nThe President, some two or so weeks ago, met with editors and made it very clear and in plain language that he has no intention whatsoever of pushing for an extension of his term beyond what is constitutionally provided for, Charamba stated.\n\nHe questioned why the bishops chose to revisit an issue the President has already shut down, emphasizing that even though some party members and citizens may express a desire for an extended term, Mnangagwa himself has rejected the notion.\n\nThe nominee for that extension has to want to have that term extended, isnt it? The President has made it clear that he has no intention of accepting that proposal, Charamba added.\n\nTaxation Reforms Already Underway\n\nBeyond the presidential term extension, Charamba also responded to the bishops concerns about heavy taxation, stating that the Government is already addressing the issue.\n\nThe burden of taxation is receiving attention from the Government. If the Presidents statement at the commencement of the 2025 Cabinet Year did not bring comfort to the bishops, one wonders what would, he said.\n\nHe urged patience, stressing that tax reforms take time due to their impact on national revenue and essential public services.\n\nWe are talking about key basic services which cannot be dispensed with and which have to be funded from the revenues that come from the tax structure, Charamba explained.\n\nHe encouraged the Church to convey a message of hope to citizens rather than focusing on issues already under Government review.\n\nA Call for Collaboration\n\nCharamba acknowledged that institutional reforms are necessary across all sectors but urged the Church to support the ongoing efforts rather than raising concerns about matters already being handled.\n\nSo really, our message to the bishops is to please bear with us, bear with Government as it reforms the tax structure with the ultimate objective of lightening the burden on the citizenry, he concluded.\n\n",

            "content": "Fire extinguishers are an important safety tool to have in your vehicle, but proper storage and maintenance are crucial to ensuring their effectiveness in an emergency. Here are some key tips to keep your fire extinguisher in top condition and ready for use.\n\nFirst and foremost, never expose your fire extinguisher to direct sunlight.\n\nProlonged exposure to the suns rays can lead to dangerous conditions, potentially causing the extinguisher to explode, which could result in harm or damage to your vehicle.\n\nAlways store it in a cool, dry place to ensure safety.\n\nIt is equally important to store your fire extinguisher in an accessible spot inside your vehicle. Avoid keeping it in the boot, as this could prevent you from accessing it quickly in the event of a fire. During a car fire, the vehicles electronic components may fail, causing the boot to become locked. This would make it difficult or impossible to reach your extinguisher. Instead, store it under your car seat or in the glove compartment where it can be quickly retrieved.\n\nIn addition to proper storage, regular checks are vital. Always verify the expiration date on your fire extinguisher. If the extinguisher is past its expiration date and is refillable, take it to a recognized agent to have it refilled, often at a lower cost than the original purchase price.\n\nRemember, keeping a fire extinguisher in your vehicle is an essential safety measure that can save lives in an emergency. By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your fire extinguisher remains effective when you need it most.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

Mwonzora is finished. He betrayed the peoples struggle, an insider revealed.\n\nThe court ruling has dealt a significant blow to Mwonzoras leadership, throwing the party into a state of uncertainty.\n\nWith the order for a fresh congress, the power struggle within the MDC is now front and center, as factions vie for control over the future direction of the party.\n\nMudzuri, who was once seen as a key figure in the MDCs leadership, has now become a central challenger to Mwonzoras position. The ongoing internal divisions are seen as part of a broader power struggle within the opposition party, which has been plagued by leadership disputes in recent years.\n\nSupporters of Mudzuri believe that his leadership is the key to revitalizing the party, while those loyal to Mwonzora view the challenges as part of a destabilizing plot.\n\nMudzuri is seen as the person who can bring order back to the party, unlike Mwonzora who has been accused of losing the peoples trust, another source close to the situation noted.\n\nWith the clock ticking on the six-month deadline for a new congress, the MDC is facing a pivotal moment in its history. How the party navigates this leadership crisis will have profound implications for its future, both in terms of internal unity and its ability to challenge the ruling party. As the power struggle continues, all eyes will be on the MDCs next move as it seeks to chart a new course in Zimbabwes political landscape.\n\n",
