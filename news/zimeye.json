He said, Unity Day is not a Zanu PF initiative but is for the citizens of Zimbabwe.\n\nReflecting on the days significance at the weekend, Chamisa stated, Unity Day reminds us all of the elusive promise of a united and prosperous Zimbabwe! A promise that has been broken by bad governance, toxicity, inequality, mistrust, and injustice.\n\nHe stressed that true unity goes beyond political parties or individuals.\n\nTrue unity is not about the unity of political parties or individuals. It must be the unity of all citizens founded on shared values and mutual ideals, built on love, peace, and shared prosperity, Chamisa added.\n\nChamisa argued that unity should not be a symbolic gesture or limited to one day. Unity must neither be a one-day event nor a concept on paper. Unity must be practiced, palpable, and experienced daily in all facets of life.\n\nLooking ahead, Chamisa envisioned a new and genuine unity for Zimbabwe. In the coming Zimbabwe, there will be new and genuine unity, powered by love and mutual respect, where every Zimbabwean is proud to belong, and their dignity is protected and well treasured.\n\n",

These are not expulsion letters but a directive to halt participation in party programs until disciplinary hearings are conducted, Chiwewe toldTellZim.\n\nBhila faces multiple accusations, including violating the partys constitution, inciting public unrest, and insulting fellow party members.\n\nAccording to the prohibition order, Bhila allegedly used inflammatory language during a public discussion about Chiredzi Town Council operations, urging the council to abandon development projects infavorof contentious alternative areas.\n\nThe document also details instances where Bhila reportedly insulted colleagues, including a female party member and her husband, calling them derogatory names.\n\nFurthermore, Bhilas supporters allegedly attacked other party members during ward rallies, with reports reaching provincial officials.\n\nBhilas history of clashes with the party leadership is well-documented.\n\nIn November 2023, hewas dismissedas Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce after servingforonly three months.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Bhila remains publicly loyal to Mnangagwas leadership.\n\nI follow what the party decides. If it says go, then I will go. I will remain resolute and loyal, supporting the party and President Mnangagwas 2030 agenda, Bhila said whencontacted for comment.\n\nThe Masvingo Provincial leadership has intensified efforts to root out opposition to Mnangagwas controversial 2030 vanenge vachipo slogan, which projects his extended rule.\n\nBrighton Mushekwa, a Zanu PF councillor from Bikita, was recently suspended for refusing to chant the slogan during a meeting.\n\nThe disciplinary measures against Bhila and Ganyiwa appear to signal Mnangagwas determination to consolidate power ahead of the 2028 elections.\n\nAnalysts view these actions as a clear message to Chiwengas allies thatdissent will not be tolerated.\n\n-TellZim\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, Masvingo-based clergyman Prophet Lovemore Chevure has condemned veteran musician Clive Malunga for criticizing President Emmerson Mnangagwas bid for a third term.\n\nThe controversy began after a video surfaced last week in which Malunga, who is also a war veteran, argued that Mnangagwa was not divinely appointed and therefore had no mandate to extend his rule.\n\nYes, I clearly said that Mnangagwa wont see 2030 or even 2026 because he isnt God and wasnt appointed by God to be President of Zimbabwe, Malunga stated.\n\nIn response, Chevure, leader of Prophetic Grace International Church, rebuked Malungas remarks in an interview with a local publication. Chevure invited Malunga to visit his church for instant deliverance.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has every right to rule. The power of life and death lies in your tongue, as the scriptures say. Therefore, the President has every right to say, I can be there and lead even up to 2040,' Chevure asserted.\n\nChevure continued by addressing Malunga directly: As for you, Clive Malunga, you dont have the power to say the president wont be around in 2026. Who are you? Who gave you that authority? Regardless of our political affiliations, we must accept that the current president of Zimbabwe is Emmerson Mnangagwa. Scriptures urge us to respect the authority of our leaders, and by showing disrespect to the President, Malunga has invited a curse on himself and his family.\n\nHe further invited Malunga to his church for deliverance, claiming that if Malunga could not see the progress made under the Second Republic, he was in need of spiritual intervention. The problem with some of our countrymen is that they focus only on the negative side, Chevure said.\n\nChevure also reminded listeners that no one is perfect. You must know that if you are praying for your enemies to die, remember that you, too, are someones enemy, and they might be wishing the same for you. No human has a clean record; we all have offended someone at some point.\n\n",
