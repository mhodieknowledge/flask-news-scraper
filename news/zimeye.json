A red and white peg marks the place now)\n\nWe are supposed to have prepared for the agricultural season, half our fields have been taken over, and the pastures.The said investors, accompanied by armed police, occupied our fields and gardens one night in July 2024.Our fellow villagers were arrested when they went to investigate movements and lights in the fields.Subsequently, four elderly women were arrested as they tried to gain access to their gardens, and another one tried to do land preparation.The matters are still before the courts.The gardens were burnt down, banana plantations and cassava destroyed, including the seasonal crops\n\nIt has become very apparent that your Excellency, ndimi mega muno kwanisa kuti betsera nenhau iyi as no government department according to our understanding, is willing to engage us.\n\nWe remain hopeful that your listening ear will save us.\n\nWe, the displaced villagers of Chasara and Kapere, Ward 11,Magunje Constituency.\n\n",

Priscilla was sweeping the house while the suspect was drinking beer on the veranda. Without warning, he attacked her, he said.\n\nMs Tshumas grandmother, Ms Sibusisiwe Ndlovu, attempted to administer first aid but was unsuccessful.\n\nKhuliso fled the scene immediately after the attack but was apprehended later that day, about seven kilometres from the crime scene.\n\nThe Okapi knife used in the attack was recovered by the police.\n\nChief Supt Thomas said their investigations revealed the suspects criminal history, including his prior conviction for raping the deceased in 2016.\n\nWe arrested the suspect some seven kilometres away from the scene of the crime. Investigations revealed that the suspect is an ex-convict who had been incarcerated for raping the now deceased, he said.\n\nChief Supt Thomas also urged the public to refrain from violence and work towards fostering peace during the festive season.\n\nAs we are still in the middle of the festive season, everyone ought to live in harmony to avoid regrettable situations. We further appeal to members of the public who have information on criminals who fled after committing crimes to notify us, he said.\n\nZPCS spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Meya Khanyezi expressed condolences on behalf of the organisation.\n\nAs Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service, we extend our heartfelt condolences to the Tshuma family and loved ones during this difficult time.Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding this tragic event, and we are committed to ensuring that all necessary actions are taken to bring the culprit to book, she said.Our thoughts are with the Tshuma family and the entire ZPCS family as we seek to find answers and bring justice to those affected.\n\n",

            "content": "The chief executive role is a tough one to fill. From 2020 to 2024, about a quarter of the CEO departures in Africa were involuntary, according to our analysis. The fallout from these dismissals can be staggering: Forced turnover at the top costs shareholders millions of dollars in lost market value annually. Those figures are discouraging for directors with the hard task of anointing CEOsand daunting to any leader aspiring to the C-suite. Many otherwise capable leaders and boards are getting something wrong. The question is, what?\n\nThe knock on most business leaders is that they dont take the long viewthat theyre fixated on achieving short-term goals to lift their pay. So which African CEOs delivered solid results over the long run? Our 2024 list of top performers provides an answer.\n\nIt is worth noting that most of Africas top-performing CEOs arent household names. TheAfricanCEO magazines ranking of CEOs is meant to be a measure of enduring success. We tracked and analysed each CEOs performance starting from day one of his or her tenure. Our goal is to create a list that gets beyond the most recent quarterly or even annual results and truly evaluates long-term performance.\n\nOur ranking is not based exclusively on hard stock market numbers. We looked at total shareholder return, as well as the change in each companys market capitalization. (For more details, see How We Calculated the Ranking.)\n\nWe like that the ranking is based solidly on data and not on reputation or anecdote. Yet it also felt incomplete because it failed to account for the many aspects of leadership that go beyond mere market performance.\n\nIn the long term, social and environmental issues become financial issues. So, we took into account measuring each companys environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. For this, we relied on researching each companys ESG or sustainability report. We now weigh long-term financial results at 80% and ESG performance at 20%.\n\nOur methodology focuses on CEOs who took the reins before 2020 though there are a few exceptions. We analysed the performance of those CEOs as well, using the returns generated from 2020 onward. The decision to add CEOs who began before 2020 also shook up our ranking. About seventy percent of this years top 100 started the job before then, meaning few are new in the CEO role.\n\nAt the AfricanCEO magazine, we continue to experiment with the perfect measure of a CEOs worth, and we look forward to getting our readers input. Are we right to include these critical, but less easily quantifiable, measures?\n\nAre there further ways of fully evaluating companies and their CEOs?\n\nOur view is that, in an era of big data and greater transparency, consumers and investors increasingly want to understand a companys culture and values. They want to analyse its social behaviour, not just its share price. These new measurements will only get better over time.\n\nPeter SaSellu, the publisher and editor of theAfricanCEOmagazineargues that the business of business is longer business. As Peter puts it, I would change that to say the business of business is businessbut with a long-term perspective. And in that calculation, social and environmental issues are critical.\n\nWhats included and how did we do the ranking?\n\nThe 100 CEOs represent 18 nationalities and 100 companies located in 18 African countries. Women represent 15 percent of their male counterparts, which is a significant move towards having more women in leadership or CEO roles in large corporations on the continent.\n\nHowever, many CEOs in Francophone countries often move from country to country, making it difficult to track their progress. We also took into consideration stability on the job or job retention as a CEO. With this, we discovered that Nigerian CEOs last longer on the job or in the CEO position when compared to CEOs in other regions or mostly Francophone countries. Little or Less information is readily available on Francophone country CEOs as to those of the English-speaking CEOs or regions. This posed a major challenge in our analysis.\n\nTo make it an Africa-centred initiative, only CEOs who are of African origin or nationals of African countries are considered, even though non-African or foreign CEOs are heading companies with larger assets in many African markets.\n\nIn conclusion, Nigerian CEOs top the list because they have more available information compared to CEOs from other countries or regions, followed by Kenya and South Africa with more accessible information such as CEO tenure, age, education and qualification, date of appointment, etc.\n\nAbout the African CEO magazines Top 100 CEOs List\n\nThe African CEO magazines Top 100 CEOs in Africa annual list is an initiative to profile the Best-Performing CEOs on the continent. The list is calculated by measuring financial returns during each CEOs entire tenure and factoring in two assessments of each companys environmental, social, and governance practices. Africas Top 100 CEOs initiative will help drive discussion of how society should measure a business leaders performance. The goal of the listing is to help promote discussions in the business environment focusing on leadership, growth/return on investment, ESG, and sustainability across Africa.\n\nThe editorial team considers and priorities CEOs whose companies are listed on a stock exchange because their companies are regulated because they follow strict rules and in some instances, are expected to meet certain reporting standards, such as good corporate governance, sustainability reporting, accounting, and financial reporting, etc. to meet stakeholder and shareholder expectations.\n\nFor more information, please contact Evelyn George atev***********@af****************.comor +1-646-444-8182.

The officer was conducting roadblock duties when a Freightliner Columbia truck, traveling towards Mazowe, evaded the checkpoint and hit him on the head with the trailer. The truck then collided with a stationary Nissan X-Trail vehicle. The officer was pronounced dead upon arrival at Mvurwi Hospital.\n\nIn a separate incident on Monday, another officerwas injuredwhile directing traffic in Masvingo near the Chevron Hotel.\n\nThe officer sustained a swollen heel after being struck by a vehicle whose driver fled the scene.\n\nThe incidents have drawn attention to the widespread perception of police misconduct at roadblocks.\n\nMotorists often accuse ZRP officers of harassment, extortion, and excessive force.\n\nCommon complaints include officers snatching car keys or confiscating drivers licenses to coerce bribes for fabricated or trivialoffenses.\n\nThese actions have fueled public resentment, with many viewing the police as adversaries rather than protectors.\n\nOfficers have also endangered public safety by physically confronting kombi (commuter omnibus) drivers, riskingharm to passengers.\n\nOutgoingCommissioner GeneralGodwin Matanga, who succeeded Augustine Chihuri after the November 2017 coup, admitted early in his tenure that the police had alienated the public.\n\nHe apologised to the nation and pledged to professionalise the forcea promise many believe remains unfulfilled.\n\n",

His hands tremble as he reads the words over and over again, each sentence cutting deeper than the last. Its not just a routine announcementits a dagger, carefully crafted and plunged straight into his back. The man who risked his life and reputation to secure Emmerson Mnangagwas rise to power is now watching his own political future being dismantled in broad daylight.\n\nKembo Mohadiscandal-plagued, derided, and unworthy in the eyes of manyhas been named acting president for a full 20 days. Chiwenga, the architect of the 2017 coup that ousted Robert Mugabe, has been relegated to a mere afterthought, given just 11 days to act before Mnangagwa returns. The letter is a clear signal: Mohadi, Shepherd Bushiris spiritual son and business associate of the controversial Wicknell Chivayo, is the favored one now.\n\nChiwenga slams the letter onto his desk, the sound reverberating in the cold, empty room. The betrayal is unmistakable, and the parallels to 2017 are impossible to ignore. Back then, Robert Mugabe handed power to a deputy in his final daysan ominous move that precipitated his own political demise. Now, Mnangagwa has done the same, leaving Zimbabwe in the hands of a man whose character is steeped in controversy and prophecy.\n\nThe words of Bushiris 2016 prediction come rushing back: Kembo Mohadi will one day wear the crown. Chiwengas stomach churns as he realizes the prophecy is no longer a distant threatits unfolding before his very eyes. His boss, his comrade, the man whose presidency he secured, has turned him into a relic of the past. The mockery is unbearable, but the implications are worse. This is not just about humiliation; its about survival.\n\nThe letter is more than an insultits a declaration of war. Chiwenga knows this move is not accidental. Its deliberate, calculated, and designed to weaken him. He glances at the clock. Time is slipping away. If this is the beginning of the end, he must act swiftly and decisively. The room feels suffocating as he reaches for his phone. Plans must be made. A counterstrike must be executed. The coup-maker now finds himself on the brink of becoming the next casualty of Zimbabwes unrelenting political chessboard.\n\nHararePresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has stirred controversy with his decision to entrust Vice President Kembo Mohadi with the role of acting president during his month-long vacation, bypassing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, who will only assume the role for a brief period afterward. The decision has drawn sharp criticism and intense online debate, with many questioning the suitability of Mohadi for such a significant responsibility.\n\nThe press statement, dated December 30, 2024, outlined Mnangagwas vacation plans and confirmed that Mohadi would lead the country from December 31, 2024, to January 19, 2025. Chiwenga would take over only after Mohadis term ends. This has been interpreted by many as a deliberate sidelining of Chiwenga, who played a pivotal role in orchestrating the 2017 military coup that brought Mnangagwa to power.\n\nSocial media erupted with reactions, including heated exchanges. Prominent political commentator Obey Shava remarked, VP Mohadi has been given 20 days as acting president whilst Chiwenga got 11. I hope Chiwenga will not feel that he has been unfairly treated. I hope he wont think that hes as half as valuable as Mohadi in the eyes of the President. This comment quickly gained traction, sparking debate over the implications of Mnangagwas decision.\n\nIn response to critics, Shava added, The irony of it you might be the right candidate for the word dofo which youve used against me. Go back and read the whole memo and immediately thereafter, beat your chest and say, Ndiri dofo rine dzungu (I am a fool with no sense). His sharp retort highlighted the tensions and divisions the announcement has caused.\n\nMeanwhile, another commenter, Makomborero Shoko, questioned the official memo, asking, Where does it say to 1 February? referring to the end of Chiwengas acting presidency. This reflects broader concerns over the ambiguity and potential manipulation of the timeline in the statement.\n\nKembo Mohadis appointment has drawn sharp criticism due to his controversial past, including his alleged ties to fugitive pastor Shepherd Bushiri and businessman Wicknell Chivayo. How can we entrust the country to a man whose integrity is so questionable? asked Rita Moyo, a civil society activist.\n\nAnalysts believe this decision could further deepen tensions within the ruling ZANU-PF party, with Chiwengas sidelining seen as a significant slight. Chiwenga risked his life and career to bring Mnangagwa to power in 2017. This decision is not just a snub; its a calculated message, said political analyst Tinashe Madondo.\n\nThe weeks ahead will be critical for Zimbabwe as the country watches Mohadis temporary leadership and anticipates Chiwengas brief stint. For now, the controversial decision has cast a shadow over Mnangagwas presidency and raised questions about the future dynamics within Zimbabwes leadership.\n\n",
