            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda-Shackmore Wellington Timburwa, the Zanu PF Member of Parliament for Chegutu West, has been exposed for fraudulently claiming a doctoral degree.\n\nTimburwa, who goes by the name Shacky Timburwa, staged a fake graduation ceremony in 2023, where he posed in academic regalia and declared himself a PhD graduate.\n\nHe took to social media, celebrating what he called the culmination of years of hard work, late nights, and endless research.\n\nHowever, investigations have since revealed that his doctorate is entirely fictitious.\n\nAn investigative news portal, Dug-Up, exposed Timburwas deceit, linking him to a broader scam involving multiple socialites, including a Zimbabwean legislator and Malawian personalities.\n\nOn November 4, 2023, the group participated in an elaborate scheme at the University of South Africa (UNISA), receiving counterfeit degrees.\n\nAlthough they donned graduation gowns and held maroon placards with the word Graduation, UNISA later clarified that it had no record of awarding them any degrees.\n\nThe entire event was a staged fraud designed to lend an air of legitimacy to their fake academic credentials.\n\nUNISA quickly disowned the Malawian recipients of the fraudulent doctorates, but Timburwa seemingly evaded scrutiny despite attending the same event.\n\nSince then, he has continued to use the title Dr. in official engagements, misleading the public and his constituents.\n\nThe issue of fake academic credentials has also entangled other high-profile Zimbabweans, including controversial preacher Walter Magaya.\n\nFacing potential jail time for academic fraud, Magaya is being investigated by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) after allegedly submitting a forged UNISA diploma in his bid to contest the ZIFA presidency and in a High Court challenge.\n\nUNISA has categorically denied that Magaya was ever a student or graduate of the institution.\n\nDespite the scandal, Magayas loyal followers remain unwavering in their support.\n\nDuring a recent church service at his Prophetic Healing and Deliverance (PHD) Ministries in Harare, Magaya broke down in tears, overwhelmed by the solidarity of his congregation.\n\nThey erupted into a song, Siyanai naye Magaya (Leave Magaya alone), demonstrating their allegiance.\n\nWhile Magaya refrained from addressing the allegations, his followers dismissed the accusations as a smear campaign.\n\nThis is not the first time Magaya has faced accusations of fraud.\n\nIn 2016, he was arrested for falsely claiming to have discovered a cure for HIV/AIDS, a claim he later retracted under government pressure.\n\nHis failed housing project also left thousands of congregants stranded, leading to legal battles. His controversial attempt to enter football administration has only fueled further skepticism about his intentions.\n\nZACC has since requested documentation from ZIFA and the High Court to verify Magayas academic claims.\n\nIf convicted of forging qualifications, he could face criminal charges, further damaging his already controversial reputation.\n\nZimbabwe has seen a surge in individuals, particularly politicians and socialites, seeking honorary or outright fake PhDs to bolster their public image.\n\nThe obsession with academic titles reflects deep-seated societal pressures where credentials often translate to power and influence.\n\nWhile genuine academic achievements require years of rigorous study, some opt for shortcuts, acquiring fraudulent degrees to gain prestige and credibility.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nIn a bid to quell dissent among war veterans, particularly outspoken critics like Blessed Geza, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has rolled out a US$1.5 million fund aimed at empowering former freedom fighters. The initiative is seen as a strategic move to silence those opposing his third-term agenda.\n\nThe Presidential War Veterans Fund, part of Mnangagwas broader Leaving No One and No Place Behind philosophy, seeks to recognize and reward the contributions made by war veterans, ex-political prisoners, detainees, restrictees, non-combatant cadres, and war collaborators to Zimbabwes independence and nation-building.\n\nA beneficiary of the fund expressed gratitude, saying, This is unheard of since 1980. We applaud the President for remembering us in such an impactful way. The money will be put to good use and will ensure that every waiver in the constituency benefits and has the chance to start a project or business of their choice.\n\nAnother recipient of the fund added, Im speechless, I never expected to witness this in my old age. The President has done something we never anticipated would happen. I already wanted to start a poultry project, and now I have the chance. I am going to ensure it is a success, and the fund keeps revolving.\n\nThe programme has already been launched in three provinces, and its reach is expected to expand further. Chikomba West legislator, Honourable Tatenda Mavetera, lauded the initiative, emphasizing, The President has shown he is a leader who incorporates everyone for economic development. One cannot deny the work he has done to uplift youths, women, and now war veterans. Im excited about the programmes that are going to be implemented this year through this fund, and whats amazing is how the President has said no interest will be charged to those who will access the fund. What more can you want from our President?\n\nMasvingos Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Honourable Ezra Chadzamira, added, This is a programme that will not only capacitate our veterans but will ensure that they contribute economically to the countrys vision through various initiatives they will implement from the fund. Everyone is set to benefit, and systems are being put in place to ensure transparency and accountability.\n\nThe War Veterans League Secretary, Cde Douglas Mahiya, stated that a Trust would be created for the distribution of the funds across provinces. He also emphasized, The President is a man who walks the talk. He has assured war veterans that they will be capacitated and cushioned against the economic challenges facing the country, and he has lived to his word. Today, Masvingo and Mashonaland Central have received their share, and other provinces will follow suit. The National Executive has approved the Trust that will see them borrowing money, which will be used as collateral.\n\nThis strategic move, intended to ensure loyalty and maintain the support of war veterans, is yet another example of Mnangagwas efforts to consolidate his power and secure his political agenda.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nZAPU President Sibangilizwe Nkomo has issued a stern warning against any attempts by President Emmerson Mnangagwa to extend his tenure beyond 2028, vowing strong resistance from his party.\n\nNkomo emphatically rejected the notion of a coup, but insisted that ZAPU demands fair and transparent elections in 2028, emphasizing that Mnangagwa must step down once his second and final term expires.\n\nSpeaking to the press in Bulawayo recently, Nkomo condemned the current presidents attempts to prolong his rule, calling them the grandfather of all illegalities.\n\nHe asserted: Mnangagwa sneaked into power on the back of a military coup in 2017 and now seeks to extend his rule by staging another coup against the constitution of Zimbabwe. It is a treasonous ambition that no patriotic Zimbabwean should entertain.\n\nNkomo criticized the ruling ZANU PF party, claiming that since Zimbabwes independence in 1980, they have continually taken the countrys citizens for granted. He added, We categorically reject claims that Zimbabweans wish to endure more suffering beyond 2028.\n\nOnly the merchants of death and suffering can agitate for the extension of Mr Mnangagwas presidential term even by a week.\n\nFurthermore, Nkomo called on Zimbabweans to withdraw their consent for Mnangagwas government, stating, We also call on the people of Zimbabwe to withdraw their consent and refuse to be governed by Mr Mnangagwas government beyond 2028.\n\nNkomo promised that ZAPU would take bold action in response to any attempt to extend Mnangagwas rule. Mnangagwas administration will see a side of us they have never witnessed before. We will take the lead in making this country ungovernable as long as there is no electoral mandate from the people.\n\nThe ZAPU leader warned that civil disobedience would be encouraged and further steps to undermine Mnangagwas government would be considered if the regime foolishly chooses to dig in. Nkomo added, His first term, powered by a military coup, and the second one, secured from a stolen mandate in August 2023, have been disastrous enough for the people.\n\nHe criticized Mnangagwas leadership, claiming that there is no vision for Zimbabwes future. There is no iota of evidence to suggest that in 2030, Zimbabwe will provide upper-middle income for ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\n",

            "content": "Justice Minister Responds to Military Threat Against Mnangagwa\n\nBy Special Correspondent | ZimEye | Zimbabwes Justice Minister, Ziyambi Ziyambi, has dismissed claims that he advised President Emmerson Mnangagwa to fire his deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, amid growing political tensions that have now escalated to a military threat to remove Mnangagwa. His remarks come after a leaked viral unofficial press conference featuring a member of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) warning against any move to push Chiwenga out of power.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to ZimEye around 8 PM, Ziyambi strongly denied orchestrating efforts to sideline Chiwenga, dismissing allegations that he instructed ZANU PF structures to threaten the Vice President with crocodile milka euphemism for poison. Its not a crime, but its criminal to lie about what was never discussed, he said, referring to claims that he directed Mnangagwa to pretend ignorance over calls for an unconstitutional amendment to prolong his rule.\n\nHowever, when presented with a video clip from an official ZANU PF meeting where the pronouncements were made, Ziyambi evaded direct answers. Videos never speak about VP, he responded when confronted with footage of himself issuing directives.\n\nAs tensions within ZANU PF mount, concerns have risen over whether Mnangagwa intends to extend his stay in power beyond constitutional limits. When asked whether the constitutional amendment is aimed at eliminating Chiwenga from succession, Ziyambi countered, From where? Congress elects a successor. Has congress sat yet? Who said he [Chiwenga] cannot be elected in 2030?\n\nThe leaked press conference by the ZDF member, now circulating widely, underscores the militarys resistance to any move that would betray the long-standing agreement between war veterans and the ruling party, particularly the so-called Soko naShumba pact. This agreement is believed to outline power-sharing arrangements between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga.\n\nZiyambi further downplayed threats against Chiwenga, insisting that declarations from Mashonaland West leaderswho were caught on video chanting about feeding Chiwenga crocodile milkdid not amount to a political directive. Where did Mash West sing that song? I am not aware of ZANU PF issues being confined to agreements between two people. I thought we go to congress? he argued.\n\nDespite his denials, he was confronted with video evidence showing a Mashonaland West provincial chairperson making statements advocating for Chiwengas poisoning. Shortly after, Ziyambi abruptly terminated the conversation and left the interview at around 8:30 PM.\n\nThe Justice Ministers response does little to ease growing fears of an internal power struggle that has now drawn the attention of Zimbabwes military. With war veterans and army officials reportedly taking a firm stance against any betrayal of their agreement with Chiwenga, the political landscape remains volatile.\n\nFollow ZimEye for more updates.\n\n",
