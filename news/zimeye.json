            "content": "By Investigations Desk | Harare & Moscow Bureau\n\nA photograph of President Emmerson Mnangagwa awkwardly handling a firearm during a foreign ceremony in Belarus has gone viralrekindling longstanding doubts about his liberation war credentials, particularly in light of recent remarks by a respected war veteran.\n\nThe image, taken in what appears to be a ceremonial setting involving Russian officials, shows Mnangagwa gripping an assault rifle with his finger near the trigger, in a crowded room of dignitaries. His posture and orientation of the weapon appear inconsistent with basic firearm safety protocols, raising both security concerns and symbolic questions about the legacy he claims to represent.\n\nA Dangerous GripWhats Wrong with This Image?\n\nExperts and veterans alike have pointed out three glaring violations of standard firearm safety: Finger on the trigger: A basic error for any trained fighter; it breaks Rule #1 of gun safety. Unclear muzzle direction: The barrel isnt pointed toward the ground or a clearly safe zone. Unvetted handling: Theres no visual assurance the weapon was decommissioned or cleared.\n\nThe ceremonial context doesnt negate the optics. In fact, for a head of stateespecially one claiming liberation war credentialssuch visual missteps are symbolic red flags.\n\nKaren Kazingizi: Mnangagwa Never Fought in the Liberation Struggle\n\nThis incident has taken on sharper political meaning following a 2019 press conference bold statement by Cde Karen Kazingizi, a seasoned former guerrilla combatant.\n\nEmmerson Mnangagwa didnt fight in the liberation struggle, Kazingizi recently declared. He was only handpicked by Robert Mugabe to displace and divide real fighters.\n\nHer comment, widely shared across veteran networks, reflects deepening rifts within ZANU PFs liberation war generation, many of whom believe Mnangagwa has falsely projected himself as a wartime field commander when in fact he served in administrative or intelligence-support roles outside the combat zones.\n\nA senior male war veteran advised ZimEye on Sunday saying, It is the shoulder that holds it in position.\n\nYou can not hold a gun like that. The hand will be pushed away or injured.\n\nFreedom Fighter or Political Infiltrator?\n\nMnangagwa has long used the rhetoric of war heroism to fortify his image. His infamous nickname The Crocodile has been marketed as a symbol of wartime resilience. But critics argue it stems more from post-war political maneuvering and internal purges than any battlefield command.\n\nKazingizis statement, now paired with this firearm gaffe, presents a visual metaphor of someone performing the image of a soldierwithout the grounding of real frontline experience.\n\nSymbolism Matters\n\nIn a post-conflict society like Zimbabwe, where legitimacy is still tied to liberation narratives, optics such as this are not benign. Weaponry is sacred in war veteran culturea symbol of sacrifice, discipline, and memory. Mishandling it, especially on a foreign stage, is not just a technical errorits a political affront.\n\nFinal Thought\n\nMnangagwa may have held a gun in Moscow, but questions remain: Did he ever hold one in Chimurenga? Did he ever fire it in the name of Zimbabwes liberationor only in pursuit of power?\n\nThe gun is symbolicbut as veterans like Kazingizi remind the nation, symbols must be earned, not posed with.-ZimEye.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent-President Emmerson Mnangagwa has left Moscow for Belarus following his participation in Russias 80th Victory Day commemorations held at the Kremlins Red Square on Friday. His next stop, Belarus, further signals deepening ties with Eastern European authoritarian states under the guise of economic cooperation.\n\nMnangagwas foreign trips, often kept secret until he lands, continue to drain millions in taxpayers money. The costs of travel for the presidiumincluding chartered jets, accommodation, and delegationsremain undisclosed to Parliament and the public, raising accountability concerns. Critics have labelled him the Airborne President, more seen abroad than solving pressing domestic crises.\n\nIn Moscow, Mnangagwa met President Vladimir Putin to reaffirm Zimbabwes alignment with Russias anti-Western bloc. Putin praised Zimbabwes support in multilateral forums and urged practical implementation of bilateral deals. Mnangagwa, in turn, lauded Russias wartime sacrifices and promised to deepen ties in mining, agriculture, and manufacturing.\n\nHowever, beneath the ceremonial diplomacy lie deeper geopolitical interests. Mnangagwa has adopted Russia and Belarus as models for governancemarked by military dominance, surveillance, and media control. His admiration for Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has led to several opaque deals involving his wife, Auxillia Mnangagwa, including alleged arms-for-minerals arrangements and agricultural machinery acquisitions that bypass parliamentary scrutiny.\n\nZimbabwes trade with Russia reached US$7.4 billion in 2024 against imports worth US$9.5 billion, reflecting a US$2.1 billion trade deficit. While authorities tout export opportunities in citrus, berries, and oilseeds, little benefit trickles down to the average Zimbabwean amid rising inflation and unemployment.\n\nMnangagwas frequent foreign visits, coupled with autocratic influences and non-transparent deals, continue to isolate Zimbabwe from democratic reforms. His governments obsession with global alliances over local development reveals a regime more concerned with elite survival than people-centered progress.\n\n",

The future of Zimbabwe lies in the hands of skilled and innovative young people, he stated.\n\nThe students took the opportunity to raise concerns around mutual recognition of qualifications, government support mechanisms, and access to start-up funding.
