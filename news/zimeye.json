            "content": "Every time you get behind the wheel, youre making a commitmentnot just to reach your destination, but to protect your life and the lives of others on the road. Driving may feel routine, but it is a complex task that demands full attention. Even a momentary lapse in concentration can result in serious, sometimes fatal, consequences.\n\nToday, distracted driving is one of the leading causes of road accidents worldwide. And while most drivers are aware of the dangers, many still engage in risky behaviors without realizing how devastating the consequences can be.\n\nHere are some of the most common distractions that take your focus off the roadand why avoiding them could save lives:\n\n Never Text While Driving\n\nTexting while driving remains one of the most dangerous distractions. When you take your eyes off the road to send or read a message, even for just five seconds, you could travel the length of a football field without seeing whats in front of you. According to road safety experts, You are 23 times more likely to crash if youre texting while driving. No message is worth a lifekeep your phone out of sight and out of mind until youre safely parked.\n\n Dont Eat Behind the Wheel\n\nMany drivers think grabbing a quick bite during their commute is harmless. But eating while driving can be just as dangerous as texting. Holding food, unwrapping packaging, or dealing with spills forces you to take one or both hands off the wheel and diverts your attention. Taking your hand off the wheel to grab that burger can mean the difference between stopping in time and causing a crash, says a road safety spokesperson.\n\n Dont Let the Stereo Steal Your Focus\n\nMusic is a great way to enhance a drivebut fiddling with the stereo, adjusting volume, skipping tracks, or switching playlists can be distracting. If youre focused on your playlist instead of the traffic around you, youre not fully driving, warn experts. Pre-set your music before hitting the road or use voice-activated controls to keep your hands and eyes where they belong.\n\n Never Apply Makeup While Driving\n\nMultitasking while driving is a mythespecially when it involves something as delicate and time-consuming as applying makeup. Not only does it take your eyes off the road, but it also compromises your reaction time. Grooming behind the wheel is shockingly common, yet incredibly dangerous, say authorities. If youre running late, its better to arrive a few minutes behind schedule than not arrive at all.\n\n Dont Let Passengers Distract You\n\nFrom lively conversations to rowdy kids, passengers can be a major source of distraction. While its natural to talk during a drive, drivers must set boundaries. Its okay to ask passengers to keep it down if youre feeling overwhelmedyour main job is to drive safely, driving instructors advise. When dealing with children or upset passengers, its always safest to pull over before addressing the situation.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDriving is not the time to divide your attention. Each of the above distractionsno matter how trivial they may seemcan be deadly when combined with the speed and unpredictability of the road.\n\nRemember: You cant drive safely unless the task has your full attention. Stay alert, stay focused, and arrive alive.\n\nProduced bySafety and Victims Advocacy Foundation (The Gambia)\n\nIn collaboration with The Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nThe Traffic Pulse Newsletter\n\nInstagram : traff.icpulse\n\nX: @TPulsezim\n\nLinkedIn : Traffic Pulse Zim\n\nemail :[emailprotected]\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent | London, UK  June 7, 2024\n\nIt is hard to imagine a more calculated and vile form of theft than what has unfolded at the hands of Mr. Lawrence Mudiwa Charamba, the operator of Luras Care Solution. In a deeply disturbing case echoing the now-infamous Rumbidzai Madiri scandal, Charamba is accused of orchestrating a scam that robbed African jobseekers of over 62,000  not from a multinational corporation or insurance scheme, but from vulnerable individuals scraping together life savings and borrowed funds in the hope of a better life.\n\nThis was not a mere business failure. This was not administrative incompetence. What happened here was the cold, deliberate siphoning of hope from the desperate  an exploitation of trust, urgency, and aspiration by a man who knew exactly what he was doing.\n\nIn February 2024, a group of young Zimbabweans in the UK placed their faith in Charamba, transferring a staggering 62,000 with the expectation of receiving Certificates of Sponsorship (COS) that would secure their future. Instead, they were met with betrayal. Charamba promptly informed them he could not deliver on his promises and offered refunds  a hollow gesture that quickly disintegrated into six weeks of silence, as he absconded to Zimbabwe and became unreachable.\n\nLawrence Charamba\n\nEven upon his return, the deceit continued. Victims were subjected to a barrage of excuses: frozen bank accounts, technical errors, bureaucratic delays. Promises were made and broken repeatedly. Meanwhile, investigations have revealed that Charamba has quietly transferred large sums to Rwanda to invest in a luxury tourism venture. The question must be asked: what kind of man drains thousands from the pockets of the desperate and uses it to bankroll a personal getaway?\n\nThis is not just about theft  it is about betrayal at the most intimate level. These were not faceless transactions. Charamba looked people in the eye, assured them of a future, and then vanished with their dreams.\n\nThis case exposes a deeper, systemic failure  not just in regulatory oversight, but in moral accountability within diasporic networks that are increasingly vulnerable to internal predation. It is one thing to battle the challenges of foreign immigration systems. It is another entirely when the knife comes from your own.\n\nThe silence from Charamba and his company speaks volumes. Not a single public apology. Not a single cent returned. Not a single gesture of remorse.\n\nIt is vital now  for justice, for deterrence, and for basic human decency  that this matter is pursued with the full weight of legal and public scrutiny. Every victim must come forward. Every detail must be exposed. Every stone must be overturned.\n\nLawrence Mudiwa Charambas name must now stand not as a footnote in another COS scam, but as a warning  of what happens when greed disguises itself as opportunity, and when the diaspora eats its own.\n\nContacted for a comment, Charamba promised to refund the money, and asked for time. Give me time to pay up, I will work on it, he said. Over 40 weeks later, there is not a single payment.\n\nIf you are a victim, do not suffer in silence. Report your case. Organise. And let this scandal become a turning point, not just a headline.\n\nBecause 62,000 wasnt just money. It was trust. And that is the most expensive thing you can steal.\n\n",

Alfred Dzobo, 25, was allegedly shot by a security guard during a confrontation between illegal gold panners and mine security personnel.\n\nAccording to Mutare police, the incident occurred when a group of illegal gold panners, armed with catapults, wrenches, and machetes, approached the mines security guards, attempting to form a syndicate. The guards refused, leading to a violent confrontation.\n\nCircumstances are that an open pit at the eastern side of the mine was blasted and three security guards, Bigboy Bishoni (44), Edmore Mukwaya (24) and Obvious Payarira (29) were deployed to guard the pit. A group of illegal gold panners armed with catapults, wrenches and machetes approached the guards intending to form a syndicate with the guards who refused, Mutare police said.\n\nThe situation escalated, and security guard Gabriel Muchiteni fired his gun, fatally shooting Dzobo. Dzobo and his gang regrouped on the next day. They armed themselves with catapults, wrenches and machetes and attacked security guards, Bishoni sustained a swollen face from the attack. Muchiteni realised that his team was being overpowered and fired his gun towards the illegal panners. Dzobo was shot and died on the spot, Mutare police added.\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the safety and security of both mine employees and illegal gold panners in the area. The panners became aggressive, attacked the guards, and disarmed Muchiteni, breaking his pistol and severely assaulting him. They also vandalized office windows, an excavator, and CCTV equipment, and assaulted another employee, Daniel Panganayi, who sustained injuries.\n\n",

We are grateful to His Excellency for implementing people-centered projects in Glen View South, she said during the ceremony.\n\nHowever, the timing and manner of the fund distribution have raised serious questions about electoral fairness. Critics argue that the move undermines democratic processes and is a clear case of voter manipulation.\n\nIts voter bribery, plain and simple, said one opposition spokesperson. You dont need to dress it up as a fund. Youre handing out cash days before people go to vote.\n\nDespite the growing backlash, ZANU PF has defended the initiative as part of ongoing efforts to support grassroots economic empowerment. Party officials maintain that the revolving fund is meant to stimulate community development and uplift small-scale entrepreneurs in the area.\n\nThe controversy adds to the already tense atmosphere surrounding the Glen View South by-election, as observers watch closely to see how the issue will impact voter sentiment and turnout.\n\n",
