            "content": "Sports Correspondent\n\nThe Zimbabwe national football team, also known as the Warriors, has made significant gains in the latest FIFA Rankings, released on Thursday. After a busy international break, the team has climbed five places to reach number 116 globally, their highest position since September 2021.\n\nDuring the recent FIFA international break, the Warriors played two crucial matches against Benin and Nigeria in Group C of the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers. Although they didnt secure any wins, their draws against higher-ranked opponents earned them ten valuable points. The team drew 2-2 with Benin and 1-1 with Nigeria, showcasing their resilience and determination.\n\nThis impressive performance has not only boosted their global ranking but also propelled them to number 30 in Africa, a three-place rise. While Morocco remains the top-ranked team on the continent, the Warriors progress is a promising sign for Zimbabwean football.\n\nGlobally, Argentina continues to hold the top spot in the FIFA Rankings, but the Warriors climb is a notable achievement, especially considering their recent performances against stronger opponents.\n\nWith this momentum, the team is poised to make further gains in the rankings and potentially challenge for a spot in the World Cup.\n\n",

            "content": "By Munacho Gwamanda- President Emmerson Mnangagwa is facing a fresh politicalcrisis,amid revelations that he may have vascular dementia  a condition that, if confirmed, could trigger impeachment proceedings over his fitness to govern.\n\nThe claimswere madeby war veteran and former Zanu PF Central Committee member Blessed Geza, who alleges that Mnangagwas deteriorating mental health has rendered him unfit for office.\n\nGeza argues that under Zimbabwes Constitution,the President can be removedon the grounds of incapacity due to ill health.\n\nDuring the recent inauguration of Lieutenant General Anselem Sanyatwe as Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces at State House, Mnangagwa reportedly failed torecognisehis long-time political ally and Minister of Local Government, July Moyo.\n\nAccording to sources present, the President asked, Who is this man? Where is he from, and what does he do? In a separate incident just days later, Mnangagwa reportedly expressed surprise that the countrys railway system was not operational  an issue that has been a public concern for years.\n\nGeza claims these episodes are symptomatic ofvascular dementia, a progressive cognitive disorder caused by reduced blood flow to the brain.\n\nThe condition affects memory, judgment, reasoning, language, and spatial awareness.\n\nSufferers may also experience confusion, irritability, depression, and problems with balance and coordination.\n\nAccording to Geza, a clique of looters within Mnangagwas inner circleis exploitinghis condition  allegedly manipulating him to sign documents and approve controversial decisions without full awareness of their implications.\n\nHe claims frequent and unusual visits to the Presidents official residenceby senior officialshave raised suspicions that the ailing leader is being used as a rubber stamp by powerful interests.\n\nGeza further revealed thata group of lawmakershasbegun informal discussions on launching impeachment proceedings against Mnangagwa, citing incapacity and dereliction of duty.\n\nIf successful, this would be the first time in Zimbabwes history that a sitting Presidentis removedon medical grounds.\n\nThe health revelations come at a time of renewed tensions within the ruling Zanu PF party, as long-simmering power struggles between Mnangagwa and his deputy,Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, resurface.\n\nThe two men have shared an uneasy alliance since the 2017 military coup that toppled long-time leader Robert Mugabe.\n\nAlthough Chiwenga was instrumental in Mnangagwas rise to power, their relationship has grown increasingly strained, with factional battles often playing out behind closed doors.\n\nChiwenga, who commands significant influence within the military and war veterans circles, has long been viewed as a potential successor  or rival  to Mnangagwa.\n\nHis ambition to lead has been an open secret in party corridors, and many see the current health scare as a political opportunity for him to consolidate his position.\n\nSources within Zanu PF say Mnangagwa hasin recent monthsmoved to sideline Chiwenga loyalists, while simultaneously promoting hisownallies in both the security sector and government ministries.\n\nMnangagwas health crisis also has regional implications.\n\nHe currently serves as Chairperson of theSouthern African Development Community (SADC) a position he assumed in August 2024.\n\nAny instability in Zimbabwes leadership could ripple across the region, especially given the countrys strategic location and historical political volatility.\n\n",

            "content": "When navigating roundabouts or joining a road, its important to be mindful of long vehicles, such as trucks or buses, which may need to use more than one lane to make their turns. These vehicles require additional space and may take a different course than expected to safely maneuver through the area.\n\nTo ensure safety for both yourself and the driver of the long vehicle, stay well back and give them plenty of room. Remember, their size and turning radius mean they need extra space to complete the maneuver without obstruction. By keeping a safe distance and being patient, you help prevent accidents and ensure smoother traffic flow for everyone on the road.\n\nAlways be aware of the needs of larger vehicles, particularly in tight spaces like roundabouts or when merging onto busy roads.

Think bigger. Apply for grants, start yourownresearch initiatives, and transition into academic leadership.\n\nRhodes University Vice-Chancellor,Professor Sizwe Mabizela, reaffirmed theinstitutionscommitment to postdocs, emphasizing their value to the research enterprise.\n\nWe are determined to ensure that youarenot treatedas cheaplabour,but rather as scholars in your own right,he said.Our goal is to help you build strong academic profiles andtransition into tenured roles with ease.\n\nProf Mabizela also promised increased institutional support, structured programs, mentorship, and funding opportunities, acknowledging the often invisible contributions of postdocs.\n\nAt Rhodes, we inspire imagination, awaken curiosity, and nurture creativity. Youhave a chance toshape this culture through your mentorship, collaboration, and scholarship,he said.\n\nPostdoctoral fellowDr. Sixolile Centane, from the Department of Inorganic-Analytical Chemistry, delivered a powerful address raising two pressing concerns: lack ofmentorship in publishingand limitedaccess to funding.\n\nPublishing is essential for career progression, especially for those aiming for lecturing positions,she said.But not all of us had access to academic writing support during our PhDs. We need structured guidance.\n\nShe also highlighted the need for sustainable research funding, travel grants, and support for attending international conferences.\n\nInternational fellows also flagged administrative hurdles such asvisa delaysand banking restrictions.\n\nIn response,Ms Orla Quinlan, Director of Global Engagement, assured participants that these matters werebeing addressedat the institutional level.\n\nThe forum concluded with the election of thePostdoctoral Representative Body, designed to give fellows a voice within the university structure:\n\nDr. Ouma,originally from Kenya, shared her journey of navigating life at Rhodes with little guidance.\n\nWhen I arrived, I felt unanchored  neither student nor staff. I had to figure it out by trial and error,she said.I want future postdocs to have a better, clearer support structure.\n\nTheCentre for Postgraduate Studieshosts thePostdoctoral Networking Forumannually to foster peer connections, encourage research collaboration, and introduce new fellows to available support systems.\n\nThe Centre also runs ongoing academic development programsaimed at empoweringpostgraduates and early-career researchers.\n\n",
