There is real fighting in thewomensleague. Chinomona supports Mabika, while Monica Mutsvangwa supports Sacco. Now Chris [Mutsvangwa] is fighting in hiswifescorner.\n\nObservers sayMutsvangwasletter was less about party discipline and more about protecting hisfamilyswaning political influence.\n\nHis aggressive tone, public rebuke of a cabinet minister, and use of thepartyscommunications machinery have exposed his desperation to maintain relevance.\n\nThis is not just about Muswere,a senior Zanu PF official noted.Chris Mutsvangwa is trying to reassert himself as a power broker in the party. But this was a miscalculated moveand it shows how much he has lost grip.\n\nMuswere, a youthful minister and MP for Makoni, is widely regarded as one of PresidentMnangagwasrising protgs.\n\nHis increasing control over state media narratives suggests a shift in thepresidentsinner circleonethat favors the younger generation over the liberation-era stalwarts like Mutsvangwa.\n\nMuswere is part ofMnangagwasstrategy to build a loyal base,another source added.Mutsvangwa knows this, andhesthreatenedby it.\n\nOnce instrumental in helping Mnangagwa ascend to power during the 2017 coup that deposed Robert Mugabe, ChrisMutsvangwasrelationship with the presidenthas sincedeteriorated.\n\nParty insiders say he now positions himself as a potential successor, leveraging his liberation war credentials and connections among veterans and elites disillusioned withMnangagwasleadership.\n\nRumors of personal history between Monica Mutsvangwa and President Mnangagwalong dismissed as gossiphave resurfaced amid the factional fallout, further fueling speculation about the deep, personal stakes in this battle for influence.\n\nThese are not just political fights,a source said.These are wars rooted in ambition, betrayal, and survival.\n\nAs the party gears up for a potentially explosive elective congress, theMutsvangwasdefeat in Manicaland marks more thanjusta local political setback.\n\nIt signals a broader realignment within Zanu PF, where old alliancesare crumblingandnew power centersare emerging.\n\nWhile Mutsvangwa lashes out to defend hiswifesinterests, Muswere is quietly consolidating his ownand with thepresidentsbacking, he may be unstoppable.\n\nThis is no longer about protocol,the party official concluded.Itsabout who controls the future of Zanu PFandwhosbeing left behind.\n\n",

            "content": "News Analysis | Lets Rescue Our Captured Constitution First: Why Zimbabwes Path to Change Begins With Legal Restoration\n\nBy @Gushaz\n\nIn the flurry of political speeches, revolutionary hashtags, and policy wishlists sweeping across Zimbabwes activist circles, one glaring truth remains sidelined: our constitution is captured, and until it is rescued, nothing else will hold. This isnt just a legal technicality  it is the very root of Zimbabwes multifaceted crisis.\n\nThe Constitution: Broken Backbone of the State\n\nThe 2013 Constitution was a landmark document born out of a painstaking process of negotiation, participation, and hope. It was meant to signify a new dawn  a democratic contract between the state and the people. Instead, what weve witnessed in the years since is the deliberate subversion and manipulation of that contract by a regime intent on entrenching power, shielding impunity, and blocking reform.\n\nWhat use is a constitution if it can be amended to serve the whims of the ruling elite? What value does Section 59 (freedom of assembly) hold when peaceful protesters are met with violence? How can we speak of electoral democracy when institutions meant to oversee fair elections are staffed with partisan actors?\n\nThe constitution today exists only in name. Its spirit has been hollowed out by executive overreach, judicial capture, and legislative paralysis. And therein lies the root cause of every other crisis  economic decay, corruption, public service collapse, and the mass exodus of skilled Zimbabweans.\n\nThe Revolution Needs a Reset  And a Legal Anchor\n\nCalls for radical change are echoing louder by the day. But without constitutional restoration, even the most well-intentioned revolution risks collapsing into chaos or reproducing the same authoritarian tendencies it seeks to dismantle.\n\nIts time to put constitutionalism back at the centre of the national agenda. Lets rescue the constitution first. Not later. Not as an afterthought. Now.\n\nAs activists rightly note, Section 212 of the Constitution empowers the national security services to act in defense of the countrys interests. But how can this be meaningfully invoked if those same institutions are compromised and manipulated?\n\nA revolution without a legal compass is susceptible to fragmentation and repression. A revolution anchored in the constitution, however, can gain moral legitimacy, international solidarity, and sustainable momentum.\n\nGeza Revolution: A Vision Needing Constitutional Grounding\n\nThe Geza Revolution manifesto presents a bold, people-centered roadmap: free education, healthcare reform, economic empowerment, infrastructure rehabilitation, and job creation. These demands are not only desirable  they are essential. But achieving them outside the framework of a functioning, independent legal system will invite instability and abuse.\n\nWe cannot legislate empowerment without a credible parliament. We cannot deliver free maternal care without a judiciary that defends budget transparency. We cannot regulate banking or nationalize mines fairly without laws that protect citizens over cronies.\n\nMomentum Must Be Rekindled  and Redirected\n\nMany revolutionaries today are losing hope  frustrated by the slow pace of change, divided strategies, and fear of repression. But whats missing is not just action; its direction. The movement must coalesce around one non-negotiable demand: constitutional restoration as the precondition for all other reforms.\n\nThis means:\n\nFinal Word: The Fight Is Legal, Moral, and Political\n\nThis is not just about legalism. This is about the soul of Zimbabwes democracy. When the constitution is captured, everything else becomes negotiable  rights, resources, justice, and sovereignty.\n\nSo before we talk about free education or nationalized mines, we must reclaim the document that makes those dreams possible. The fight ahead is risky, but it must be strategic. It must be radical in vision and grounded in law.\n\nLets not just chase revolution for revolutions sake. Lets make this a revolution for restoration. Lets rescue our constitution first  and build everything else on solid ground.\n\nAluta continua. Action, Action, Action.\n\n@Gushaz\n\n",
