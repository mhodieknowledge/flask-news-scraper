            "content": "By Shelton Muchena | ZimEye | General Chiwenga for the first time in 8 years since he became Vice President has appeared in public in a full decorated military uniform, sending a powerful and symbolic message to both his political supporters and rivals.This move is more than a mere fashion choice; it revives his military past and underscores the enduring vital role of the Zimbabwe armed forces in Zimbabwean politics.Ironically today 8 years ago, ED Mnangagwa was sworn in as the President.\n\nChiwenga, who orchestrated and led the 2017 military intervention that ousted Robert Mugabe, formally retired from the Zimbabwe Defence Forces before assuming the vice presidency. Over the years, he has largely presented himself as a statesman in civilian leadership, donning suits or traditional attire at public events. But his decision to reappear in military gear with his ranks marks a striking return to his roots a return that carries deep political weight.\n\nBy wearing military regalia again, Chiwenga is not just invoking his past credentials; he is projecting strength, authority, and continuity. In doing so, he may be signalling to key constituencies including war veterans, high-ranking officers, and ZANU-PF loyalists that he remains a central figure in Zimbabwes power structure. Analysts interpret the gesture as an attempt to reassert his influence, especially in light of growing tensions within the ruling ZANU-PF party. However, they are forgetting that his option to join the political ground doesnt mean he was demoted and is not similar to other motormouth mafikizolos\n\nThis symbolic re-militarisation comes amid a fraught political climate. Chiwenga recently admitted that the 2017 takeover was, in fact, a coup a momentous acknowledgement that challenges the long-standing narrative of a transition rather than a seizure of power. The confession has reignited debate about the militarys role in governance and the legitimacy of the current political order.\n\nFurthermore, his uniform return could also be seen as a warning. In Zimbabwes fraught political landscape, where factional battles within ZANU-PF are intensifying, Chiwengas visual reminder of his military legacy may serve both as reassurance to his supporters and a signal to President Emmerson Mnangagwas camp that he remains a formidable force.\n\nSome see this as part of a broader repositioning strategy. Sources suggest that Chiwenga is cultivating an image that blends his liberation war credentials with modern political ambition. The military uniform still deeply symbolic in Zimbabwe acts as a visual anchor to his origin story as a liberation general, strengthening his standing among war veterans and long-time party loyalists.\n\nYet this bold move also carries risk. A return to military symbolism may stoke fears among his opponents of renewed interventionism or even another coup. Observers warn that such displays could deepen divisions within the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, especially if not universally embraced by the military leadership.\n\nIn the broader context, Chiwengas actions remind Zimbabweans of the fragile balance between military influence and civilian governance. By wearing his uniform once more, he is not only evoking his past he is shaping his political future.\n\nAs Zimbabwe watches closely, one thing is clear: Chiwengas re-emergence in uniform is more than a nostalgic nod to his military days. It is a carefully crafted statement of power, legacy, and ambition and the reverberations could be felt far beyond the barracks.\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri The Emmerson Mnangagwa administration has been forced into an embarrassing policy reversal as the worsening cement crisis  marked by spiralling prices and collapsing supply  pushed authorities to lift long-standing restrictions on external cement supplies, a desperate move critics say exposes the governments failure to manage the economy.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament last week during a session dominated by anger over the near-doubling of cement prices in just two months, Minister of Skills Audit and Development Paul Mavima, representing the Leader of Government Business, admitted the situation had become untenable.He told MPs: This is a matter that the Cabinet discussed yesterday (Tuesday).\n\nCement prices have surged to about US$20 per 50kg bag, up from roughly US$12 in August, placing even basic construction materials beyond the reach of ordinary citizens.\n\nMavima, who is also the MP for Gokwe Sengwa, claimed the crisis was driven by several factors, including surging demand in residential and commercial construction. He explained:The factors are many, but there is also an increase, a boom, in the construction industry, including residential construction and other structures that are going up, which is contributing to this shortage.\n\nIn a revealing admission that local producers could not meet national needs, Mavima added: The Cabinet took a decision yesterday (Tuesday) to open up the importation of cement, and this is supposed to be with immediate effect.\n\nHowever, critics argue the government should have anticipated supply pressures well before the situation reached crisis level.\n\nDeputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Raji Modi also disclosed worrying bottlenecks in the supply system, telling the House that even companies with valid licences were stuck in prolonged border delays.He said the backlogs had created severe disruptions to external supply at a time when domestic shortages were intensifying.\n\nModi further highlighted deep-seated structural problems within Zimbabwes cement industry, including a shortage of clinker  the key raw material  coupled with frequent breakdowns at ageing production plants.\n\nDespite Zimbabwe having an installed production capacity of 2.6 million tonnes per year, actual output remains far below potential due to chronic issues such as power shortages, obsolete machinery and inconsistent operations among key producers.\n\nThe countrys major cement manufacturers  Khayah Cement in Harare, PPC Zimbabwe in Harare and Bulawayo, Sino-Zimbabwe Cement in Gweru and the Chinese-owned Livetouch Cement in Redcliff  have all struggled to stabilise supply amid mounting production challenges.\n\nEconomic analysts say the governments sudden decision to open external cement supplies reflects broader governance failures and a lack of long-term planning. With shortages worsening and prices soaring, many Zimbabweans now view the move as yet another sign that the Mnangagwa regimes economic policies are collapsing under their own weight.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent -The Masvingo Women Rights Advocacy Group (MWRAG) has condemned what it describes as the intimidation, harassment, and unlawful arrests of women vendors in Masvingos Central Business District (CBD), saying the recent police crackdown has left many women traumatised and without a source of income.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 19, 2025, MWRAG Rights Monitors witnessed the violent arrest of a woman vendor outside Trinity Pharmacy, opposite Pick and Pay on Hughes Street. According to the group, several vendorsmostly womenwere forcibly removed from their trading spots without any prior warning. Many lost their stalls and goods, leaving families who depend on vending struggling to survive.\n\nMWRAG stated that women remain the most vulnerable during such operations, noting that they are often targeted more aggressively than their male counterparts. While many men reportedly managed to flee with their goods, women vendors were left exposed to harassment, intimidation, and arrest.\n\nThe organisation urged the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and local law enforcement agencies to respect and protect the rights of all vendors, especially women, during ongoing and future operations. It also called on local councils and government authorities to prioritise women in the allocation of market stalls to prevent further victimisation.\n\nMWRAG emphasised that establishing safe, designated trading spaces is critical to reducing the risk of violence and ensuring that women can work without fear. The group says lasting systemic change is necessary to safeguard womens dignity, economic contributions, and security in the marketplace.\n\nAccording to MWRAG, the situation in Masvingo highlights broader national concerns about the treatment of vulnerable women in informal trading spaces, making urgent accountability and reform essential.\n\n",

            "content": "By Hon Temba Mliswa |\n\nSABHUKUS EYE: How EDs History Should Have Been A Warning Enough\n\nThere was a point when the putschist cabal embedded within Gvt was feverish with excitement that one thought any morning would usher in their wild dreams.\n\nSocial Media was awash with conspiracies about how President Mnangagwa was about to be torpedoed from his seat.\n\nDejected by the increasing impotency of its own manouvres the opposition camp had slowly and surely shifted and taken root within the ZANU PF factional frictions.\n\nThey were rooting for a treasonous uprising that, outside elections, should remove a duly elected leader.\n\nIt was an unsettling scenario how many who peddled themselves as democrats were actually salesman of an illegal project.\n\nThe borderline between criminality and opposition politics had been blurred and to them the end justified the means.\n\nIn that mix boiled the infantile rantings of Sekuru Geza, the conspiracy gossip of Lynne and Ali Naka plus a heap of fake analysts who advanced their wet dreams under the guise of intellectual rigour.\n\nMany who had been operating on the fence for long betrayed themselves with unguarded excitement.\n\nHowever, slowly but surely every other event and day that was projected to usher in the alleged change came and went away with nothing happening.\n\nSekuru Gezas demonstrations popped and fizzled out with a tired lethargy.\n\nThe social media gossip piled up into a heap of nothing while reality revolted.\n\nThe ZANU PF Peoples Conference, itself sold as the focal point that would reveal the brazen power of the macho pseudo-leader hidden in the system, came and went.\n\nThe delegates stamped the resolutions and the party marched on undazzled.\n\nLately, as a final punch of the coffin nails has been EDs military appointments.\n\nThe retirement of General Valerio Sibanda, elevation of Lt General Emmanuel Matatu and appointment of former CIO DDG Asher Tapfumaneyi to the position of Commander ZNA.The Crocodile had entered the base where the conspiracy theorists thought their trump card had power.\n\nThus, after all the frothing and conspiring, nothing happened except the reaffirmation of the power and control that ED has over the party and system.\n\nVery soon it became apparent that nothing was going to happen. It was increasingly evident that the horse bet upon had a fractured leg!\n\nSome retired from the conspiracy newsroom and spouted insults and vile epithets at allies (we see you Ali Naka); others switched off YouTube and pseudo-analsysts scurried around for narratives to massage hurt egos.\n\nRecently a mere delegated trip to the G20 event in South Africa has been mined for political capital, people scurrying around to manufacture statesmanship from glossed over photos.\n\nIts a sorry expedition to salvage whatever debris of ambition they can from an apparently doomed project.\n\nIn the pitiful exercise awkward questions have begun to bob about.\n\nMaybe the expectations were too much for the horse. Did it really have the power as they thought? Maybe it never did. Was it really planning a damning plot that would dazzle the country? Was it ever planning anything?\n\nThe most frustrating conspiracy question for them has been whether there was ever a factional split or it was all a ruse by ED.\n\nThat new hesitation affirms what should have been a warning from long way back.\n\nEDs storied history in Government should have been a warning for his detractors and excitable social media activists.\n\nA Long CV Of Staying Power\n\nThe Presidents history in Government and state power reads like that of very few.\n\nMinister of State for National Security: He was Zimbabwes first National Security Minister from 1980 to 1988, overseeing the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO).\n\nMinister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs: He served in this role twice, from 1988 to 2000 and again from 2013 to 2014.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Assembly: He held the position of Speaker of the Parliament from 2000 to 2005.\n\nMinister of Rural Housing and Social Amenities: Mnangagwa was appointed to this ministry from 2005 to 2009.\n\nMinister of Defence: He served as Defence Minister from 2009 to 2013.\n\nFirst Vice-President: From 2014 until his dismissal in 2017, he was the First Vice-President, serving as Mugabes principal deputy.\n\nEven pedestrian public posts on the internet acknowledge how his deep involvement in the ruling ZANU-PF party and the countrys security apparatus from way back, is a sign of immense abilities.\n\nHow his rivals, enemies and treasonous elements thought they could manufacture an uprising against him successfully is befuddling.\n\nThe lesson was clear from day one but few were ready to accept the reality.\n\nToday many stand naked, vulnerable to whatever will come their way!- Mliswa\n\n",

Maskiri, who has recently diversified into goat-rearing and actively promoted imported Boer Kalahari Red breeds on his social media platforms, is accused of defrauding a US-based Zimbabwean, Tonderai Chisoro, of US$1,500. Police confirmed that none of the money has been recovered.\n\nChisoro told H-Metro that he had reached out to Maskiri intending to purchase goats to expand his familys livestock back home. I sent the money through Mukuru in three separate transactions, he said. But when I asked about the first batch of five goats, Maskiri kept giving excuses. One day he was deep in the rural areas, the next he wasnt answering calls. Eventually, he just disappeared.\n\nWith no goats delivered and no contact, Chisoro enlisted his relatives in Zimbabwe, who reported the matter at Chitungwiza Police Station under case CR559/11/25.\n\nPolice sources disclosed that officers Dulani and Mushaninga orchestrated the sting. Posing as clients planning a birthday party, they contacted Maskiri and negotiated a performance fee of US$300, with the rapper promising to bring fellow musician Tererai Mugwadi.\n\nYesterday afternoon, the officers called again, claiming they had raised a US$200 deposit, and arranged a meeting at Chicken Inn, Unit C junction. Maskiri was immediately arrested upon arrival, leaving onlookers shocked. Even the InDrive driver who brought him demanded his fare as officers took the rapper into custody.\n\nPolice confirmed that investigations are ongoing.\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri  Zanu PF-linked businessman Wicknell Chivayo has come under scrutiny after reportedly spending over US$5 million on birthday donations and celebrations, prompting criticism from citizens who say such displays highlight extreme inequality and political favoritism.\n\nChivayo, described by Zanu PF online activist Cleopas Mukungunugwa as a philanthropic champion, celebrated his birthday by handing out vehicles, buses, and cash to various organizations linked to the ruling party, his church, and womens empowerment initiatives.\n\nAmong the donations were six 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 300 VXR vehicles worth US$1,140,000, ten Toyota Hilux double cabs valued at US$650,000, and five additional Hilux double cabs for the Young Women 4ED initiative, totaling US$325,000. He also donated twelve 75-seater buses, including ten to the Johanne Masowe Chishanu Church and two to local schools, valued at US$2,520,000. Cash donations included US$500,000 to the ZANU PF Womens League and US$100,000 for Young Women 4ED programs, bringing the total value of his birthday generosity to US$5,235,000.\n\nCritics argue that Chivayos largesse is politically motivated. One local observer commented, This is not real philanthropy. Its a show of power to curry favor with Mnangagwas administration and Zanu PF structures. Millions of ordinary Zimbabweans are struggling to put food on the table while these displays of wealth make a mockery of their hardships.\n\nThe lavish birthday celebrations also included ceremonial gifts from members of the Johanne Masowe Chishanu Church, with sheep and other offerings symbolizing Chivayos influence within the community.\n\nAnalysts warn that such public displays of wealth tied closely to political elites deepen inequality and risk alienating citizens. When donations are linked to political loyalty, it undermines genuine empowerment programs, said one civic commentator.\n\nDespite the controversy, Chivayos office has defended the expenditures as acts of generosity, though no independent verification of the donations has been provided.\n\nThe debate over Chivayos birthday spending underscores ongoing tensions in Zimbabwe over wealth concentration, political patronage, and the role of high-profile figures in shaping the countrys socio-political landscape.\n\n",

            "content": "Tinashe Sambiri  Zimbabwean journalist and political commentator Jealousy Mawarire on Friday issued a sharp and uncompromising critique of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, accusing him of inflating development claims while enabling large-scale corruption.\n\nMawarire challenged assertions that Mnangagwa had achieved what former President Robert Mugabe could not, particularly in infrastructure and economic development.\n\nHe said:The claim that ED succeeded in what Mugabe failed is a lie from the pit of hell. Lets take, for instance, infrastructure. Mugabe built the National Sports Stadium, Reserve Bank building, New Government building, Karigamombe, Causeway, and universities in nine provinces, starting with NUST in Bulawayo.\n\nHe argued that many roads credited to Mnangagwa were Mugabe-era projects:The Mutare-Harare-Bulawayo-Plumtree road, in its current state, was built under Mugabe. The Masvingo-Beitbridge road, which ED is resurfacing, was initially done by Mugabe. The Chivhu-Chiredzi highway was done by Mugabe between 1987 and 1989.\n\nMawarire also criticised the emergence of new wealthy figures under Mnangagwas rule:The millionaires you are talking about, the thieves looting Zimbabwe now, cant be compared to real businesspeople who came up during Mugabes time, like Shingai Mutasa, Strive Masiiwa, Nigel Chanakira, and others. Crediting ED for creating millionaires is an insult to our national psyche, a glorification of thievery which can only come from someone of the same ilk.\n\nHe alleged that many major developments under Mnangagwa were actually Mugabe-initiated projects being repurposed for corruption.Yes, there are projects that have been undertaken during EDs time, but if you look closely, these are projects that were brokered by Mugabe before the coup. The new parliament and the airport are good examples. What ED has done is turning such projects into looting schemes by overpricing the projects through proxy contractors who bring suitcases of money every day to his private office in Borrowdale.\n\nMawarire accused Mnangagwas administration of worsening the healthcare crisis:Mugabe built clinics all over the country. ED, through his wife, has made sure there are no painkillers in those clinics and even major referral hospitals. Give us a break. ED is a thief, the worst thing that has happened to Zimbabwe since colonialism.\n\nHis remarks are expected to further intensify debate around corruption, governance, and the contrasting legacies of Mugabe and Mnangagwa.\n\n",

            "content": "Mainini Alice Macheso: When a Hairstyle Ignites a Cultural Debate\n\nBy Dorrothy Moyo | Alick Macheso  Zimbabwes most celebrated sungura legend  has unintentionally walked into a storm of cultural commentary after debuting a tightly-plaited cornrow hairstyle that has seen him mockingly nicknamed Mainini Alice Macheso, a feminised reinterpretation of his name. The style has triggered a spirited debate: is this artistic expression or a betrayal of masculine expectations held by his fanbase?\n\nA Hairstyle That Disrupted Identity\n\nIn Zimbabwean society  like many African cultures  hair is more than just grooming. It carries markers of gender, age, respectability, and social role. When Macheso  long associated with father-figure dignity, smart jackets, moustache maturity, and masculine artistry  appeared with what many fans view as a young-girl-style braid design, the symbolic collision was instant.\n\nSome fans laughed, some celebrated creativity, and some reacted with discomfort, even anger  as if Macheso had violated an unwritten cultural contract.\n\nThe Fans Reactions: From Humour to Backlash\n\nThe comment sections exploded with varied responses. Some poked fun, calling him Mainini Alice or Mainini Cheso, implying a small aunt or feminine persona. Others expressed outright frustration that a cultural icon had adopted a style they associate with female aesthetics.\n\nBut a significant portion defended him, arguing:artists must reinvent themselvesstyle evolution is part of showbizcreativity should not be policed through gender stereotypes\n\nMacheso, they said, has every right to experiment with his image.\n\nA Clash Between Tradition and Modern Artistic Freedom\n\nAt the core of this reaction is a generational divide:older and traditionalist fans expect Macheso to remain the mature, fatherly figure representing stability and manliness.younger and urban-fashion audiences see nothing wrong with men wearing cornrows  from hip-hop artists to footballers worldwide.\n\nMachesos hairstyle becomes a symbol of this cultural tug-of-war:Is masculinity fixed? Or can it evolve?\n\nCelebrity Image vs Public Ownership\n\nPart of Machesos burden is that the public feels collective ownership of him.He is not merely a musician  he is:an institutiona community eldera cross-generational storyteller\n\nSo when he alters his image, the audience reacts as if someone changed something they personally had authority over.\n\nFrom Macheso the Legend to Macheso the Trendsetter?\n\nInterestingly, fashion analysts predict that within weeks, some young men may actually adopt the same hairstyle  not to mock him, but to emulate him.\n\nWhat begins as ridicule often evolves into influence.\n\nMachesos Silence Speaks Loudest\n\nMacheso has not issued any defensive comment  an act that may itself be intentional. By not responding, he allows the hairstyle to speak for itself  and lets society debate its meaning without him mediating.\n\nFINAL TAKE\n\nThis moment is more than humour or gossip  it is a cultural mirror.It exposes:how Zimbabwe defines masculinityhow we treat our iconshow fashion becomes politicalhow celebrity identity becomes communal property\n\nIn the end, whether one loves or hates the hairstyle, one truth remains: Macheso continues to shape culture  not just through music, but through the conversations he sparks just by being himself.\n\n",
