This means that prices, as measured by the all-items ZiG CPI, increased by an average of 32.7% from October 2024 to October 2025.\n\nWhile the agency presents this as a sign of stability, the reality on the ground paints a different picture  prices of basic goods continue to soar, fuel costs are rising, and the cost of living remains unbearable for most Zimbabweans.\n\nZIMSTAT also claimed that inflation in US dollar terms had fallen slightly, standing at 13% in October compared to 13.4% in September.The USD year-on-year inflation rate (annual percentage change) for the month of October 2025 as measured by the all-items USD Consumer Price Index (CPI), was 13%. This means that prices as measured by the all-items USD CPI increased by an average of 13% from October 2024 to October 2025.\n\nHowever, the agency admitted that month-on-month inflation in USD terms had risen to 0.3% in October, up from 0% the previous month.The USD month-on-month food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation rate was 0.2% in October 2025, gaining 0.1 percentage points on the September 2025 rate of 0.1%. The October 2025 USD month-on-month non-food inflation rate was 0.4%, gaining 0.5 percentage points on the September 2025 rate of -0.1%.\n\nFor the ZiG, the month-on-month inflation rate reportedly stood at -0.4%, a figure that seems detached from the reality of rising commodity prices in local markets.The ZiG month-on-month food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation rate was 0.7% in October 2025, gaining 0.5 percentage points on the September 2025 rate of 0.2%. The October 2025 ZiG month-on-month non-food inflation rate was -0.9% shedding 0.4 percentage points on the September 2025 rate of -0.5%.\n\n",

It was hollow and lifeless, to say the very least.\n\nHe criticised the Presidents focus on sanctions, saying: It is common knowledge that all EU sanctions were removed. The only sanctions are on Mnangagwa himself due to corruption. Mnangagwa is on sanctions, Mnangagwa is not Zimbabwe, and Zimbabwe is not Mnangagwa. The sanctions propaganda is now tired.\n\nOn social welfare programs, the MP noted: He spoke of social safety nets; he talked about Pfumbudza and BEAM, saying we are doing well It is common knowledge that the bulk of Pfumbudza is being stolen by Zanu PF. The supposed beneficiaries are getting only a cup. BEAMgovernment owes 92 billion to BEAM. There is nothing on the ground.\n\nMadzivanyika also questioned infrastructure projects: Construction of silos across the countryhow much do those silos cost? The same silos with the same structure were constructed in Zambia and Mozambique. We cant say we are doing well while stealing from the same countries.\n\nHe highlighted the ongoing electricity challenges, saying: We spend the bulk of our time in darkness. He talked about independent power producers they need assurance from government; they need assurance, so we cant expect improvement in the country. Solar accessories are still liable to duty. Make sure solar accessories are duty-free.\n\nThe MP also raised concerns over mining and land degradation: He appeared concerned on paper, saying some miners are degrading our land. It is the President himself, and ZIDA, that allowed mining on our sacred land. They gave the miners authority to mine on sacred land. Mnangagwa is shedding tears on the issue.\n\nOn governance and debt, Madzivanyika said: The President went on to highlight issues of infrastructure. The President is not sincere. For you to do long-term development, Zimbabwe owes 12 billion to international creditors. Structural dialogue platformsgovernment is not interested. Government is negotiating in bad faith. The governance pillar requires government to ensure that there is a free and fair election. Persistent abuse of human rights, detention of political opponentswe will not get funding.\n\nHe further criticised the state of healthcare in the country: The President came to talk about making strides in the health sector. Every Tom, Dick, and Harry can see that there is a serious health crisis. No medication, no vital medicationnot even antibioticsonly a nurse writing a prescription for you. The health system has crumbled beyond reasonable doubt. You will not find ventilators. Go to any rural clinic.\n\nSummarising his view on the SONA, Madzivanyika said: The SONAit was a mere talk show, empty rhetoric, meaningless. So, by and large, the State of the Nation Address did not address anything. Same old rhetoric, purelyit did not inspire confidence, nothing to do with the problems the country is facing.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent-President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Tuesday reportedly ignored security advice to evacuate Parliament during a power outage that plunged the new Mount Hampden building into darkness as he delivered his State of the Nation Address (SONA).\n\nSources within the Presidential security details told ZimEye that Mnangagwa was urged to leave the building for his safety, fearing a possible security threat.\n\nHowever, the 83-year-old leader refused and insisted on completing his address, continuing to read his speech by torchlight.\n\nThe blackout, which occurred near the end of his speech, caused momentary panic among security personnel and government officials. One of the presidents aides was seen holding a flashlight over Mnangagwas notes as he pressed on, a scene captured on camera and widely shared on social media. Power was restored minutes later.\n\nSpeaker of ParliamentJacob Mudendalater apologised to the president, describing the incident as unacceptable and hinting at possible sabotage. We will go beyond what happened and trace the culprits and deal with them accordingly. Those that will be found wanting will regret the day of their existence, Mudenda said.\n\nGovernment spokespersonNdavaningi Mangwanadownplayed the incident, describing it instead as a moment of presidential resilience. Even a power outage couldnt stop a determined President Mnangagwa from fulfilling his constitutional duty. A single torchlight in the dark Parliament became a powerful symbol of his tenacity, Mangwana posted on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThe embarrassing outage has since triggered disciplinary action within the state power utility. According to government insiders, Energy and Power Development Minister July Moyo has ordered the suspension of Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) Managing Director Abel Gurupira, pending investigations.\n\nAlthough ZESA has been blamed for the blackout, government sources revealed that Parliament had deliberately opted to run the event on a hired generator  bypassing ZESAs supply  to avoid a repeat of previous outages. A letter dated October 21, 2025, signed by Acting Clerk of Parliament Nomasonto Audrey Sunga, confirmed that the generator was meant to serve as the primary power source during the SONA.\n\nHowever, the plan backfired when the generator failed around 2:30 PM, and engineers were unable to switch back to ZESA power due to the incorrect configuration of the circuit breaker. Power was manually restored after more than five minutes.\n\nWhile officials publicly insist the blackout was a technical mishap, sources close to ZANU PF say the timing of the incident has fueled renewed speculation about deepening divisions within the ruling party, particularly between President Mnangagwas faction and that of his deputy, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe long-running rivalry between the two men dates back to the 2017 military coup that toppled the lateRobert Mugabe, when Chiwenga, then army commander, played a pivotal role in paving the way for Mnangagwas rise to power. Insiders claim the two had a gentlemans agreement that Mnangagwa would serve two terms before handing over to Chiwenga  a promise Mnangagwa now appears unwilling to honour.\n\nTensions escalated after ZANU PFs 2025 congress endorsed a proposal to extend Mnangagwas rule to 2030 under the partys controversialAgenda 2030plan, effectively blocking Chiwengas succession hopes. Reports suggest that Chiwengas allies in the military and government have faced transfers, demotions, or unexplained dismissals in recent months, as Mnangagwa consolidates his grip on power.\n\nAgainst this tense political backdrop, theParliament blackouthas been interpreted by some insiders as a symbolic  if not deliberate  embarrassment to the president, reflecting the fragility of the ruling partys internal unity.\n\nZimbabwe continues to endure daily power cuts lasting between five and eight hours, blamed on low water levels at Kariba Dam and recurrent breakdowns at thermal stations. The latest Parliament incident has reignited public frustration over governance failures and infrastructure decay, even as officials attempt to portray Mnangagwa as resilient in the face of adversity.\n\nFor many observers, the spectacle of an octogenarian president delivering a State of the Nation Address under torchlight in a multimillion-dollar Parliament building stands as a powerful metaphor  one of a nation struggling in the dark, both literally and politically.\n\n",
