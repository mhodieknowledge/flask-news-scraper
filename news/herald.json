            "content": "Tendai Gukutikwa\n\nMutare Bureau\n\nA PUZZLING case, purportedly linked to the rare Benjamin Button syndrome, has plunged a Watsomba family into unmitigated despair, amid claims that their nine-month-old babys face is undergoing a disturbing transformation, gradually assuming features of an elderly man.\n\nThe anguished parents, Japhet Chinyanga and Rutendo Nyamutata, recounted in an interview, how their baby, born with a healthy and normal appearance, began to exhibit a drastic and bizarre change at five months, as his face started to prematurely wrinkle and take on an unsettling, aged aspect.\n\nIn the beginning, we thought it was just a rash or a skin problem, but as the months went by, his face kept changing. It was like watching our son rapidly aging, said Chinyanga, his voice heavy with emotion.\n\nThe family initially sought medical help, taking their child to Sally Mugabe (Harare) Hospital, where doctors reassured them that the baby was physically well, despite his odd facial changes.\n\nBut as the childs breathing grew laboured and his appetite diminished, the parents grew desperate for answers.\n\nWe went to different hospitals, but they all told us that the baby was fine, yet, he could barely eat. He can only take two spoons of porridge, and this is taking a toll on us as a family because we are seeing our baby transforming into an elderly person in less than a year, said Chinyanga.\n\nWith no clear medical diagnosis, the family turned to traditional healers, and that is when their nightmare deepened.\n\nSeveral healers allegedly told the couple that their babys transformation was not natural, but a result of witchcraft.\n\nOne healer told us that someone had turned our baby into a goblin to torment us. Another said it was our ancestral spirits, angry over something we had not done, and that they wanted appeasement. We are now caught between the world of science and spirit world, and we do not know which way to turn, said Chinyanga.\n\nNyamutata, visibly shaken, wept during the interview.\n\nWe were told that some witches changed our childs face and gave him a goblins face. It is painful seeing him like this. I hope that there will be a medical explanation on what is happening to my son. We need an urgent solution. We also appealing for US$500 that is needed for the scans, she sobbed.\n\nThe family said they were referred to a medical professor at the University of Zimbabwe, who suggested a CT scan and an echocardiogram after suspecting a congenital heart defect.\n\nWe just want to know the truth. If it is a medical condition, we will fight for the necessary treatment. But if it is spiritual, we just want to know what we have to do to save our baby. Another doctor told us that the child could be suffering from Hitchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome, but that can only be diagnosed through tests, which are yet to be done, said Nyamutata.\n\nPeople sometimes use the term Benjamin Buttons disease to refer to Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome.\n\nProgeria is an extremely rare genetic disorder that causes children to age rapidly, showing signs like wrinkled skin, hair loss, and heart problems, usually starting in early childhood, the same symptoms the couples child is showing.\n\nThe National Organisation for Rare Disorders in its Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome Report of 2021 states that children with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome are usually diagnosed between six months and two years old.\n\nThe condition often becomes noticeable when babies start showing unusual signs of aging, like slow growth and failure to gain weight, hair loss, including eyelashes and eyebrows, wrinkled or thin skin, joint stiffness and visible veins, aged facial features like a small face, pinched nose, and prominent eyes, reads the report.\n\nThe report also states that doctors might initially miss the diagnosis because the symptoms can develop gradually.\n\nI pray every day for a miracle. I just want my baby to lead a normal life. I would like to believe that this is a medical condition and not a spiritual one. I pray that we get help with the scans, and we are appealing to the public to help us because we are poor people who have no money, Nyamutata whispered.\n\nThose who want to help the couple can send them funds via Japhet Chinyangas EcoCash number which is +263774738741.\n\n",

Our aim is that every village in Gokwe gets a borehole that will be solarised. The programme also extends to schools to enable them to embark on their own income, generating programmes, said Dr Tungwarara.\n\nEach business unit is designed to be self-sufficient and includes a solar-powered borehole, provided under the Presidential Borehole Drilling Scheme, two 10 000-litre water tanks, four community water taps, one-hectare fenced-drip horticultural garden (size may vary based on borehole yield), and two fish ponds (100 cubic meters or 100 square metres).\n\nAdditionally, the units may include feeding and water troughs for livestock, tailored to the specific needs of the area.\n\nThe goal is to establish 35 000 units nationwide.\n\nThe average village requires about 33 metric tonnes of grain per year. If a business unit is well-managed, it can produce approximately seven tonnes of grain in one cycle, covering nearly a fifth of the villages grain needs. With two production cycles, this can meet about a third of the requirement.\n\n",

It is important to always be aware of the truism that we can never beg ourselves to prosperity.\n\nWe can always work ourselves to prosperity.

It spoke of the games they played, and the memories evoking the warmth and closeness of their relationship.\n\n . . . we used to play together games such as playing cards I used to get sad and also cry, I love you, mom. The best in the wholeworld. I want to see you because you made me cry. Rest in peace mom, she wrote.\n\nBeyond its emotional impact, the letter has also become a focal point, amplifying the familys insistent demands for a transparent investigation into the precise circumstances surrounding Detective Constable Hoves death.\n\nThe letters impact was further evident during her emotional funeral service held at Nyaradzo Funeral Parlour last Sunday, where heightened emotions among mourners and close family members led to verbal confrontations. They insulted police officers who were present, and the familys calls for accountability grew stronger, demanding to know whether Detective Constable Hoves death was an accident or deliberate.\n\nShe was shot dead in what police had initially reported to be a shoot-out with armed robbers in Bulawayos Pumula South suburb during a covert operation. However, it has since emerged that she was allegedly shot by a colleague and not armed robbers.\n\nAccording to the police, Detective Constable Hove sustained gunshot wounds to her upper limbs during the exchange of fire with robbers at around 8:40 PM on Thursday last week and was rushed to a nearby private clinic, where she was pronounced dead upon arrival.\n\nIt was only following the incident and after her family raised concerns as to how she was killed that the matter raised eyebrows.\n\nThe familys pursuit of the truth intensified, demanding to know the identities of the officers deployed in the Pumula South raid and the individual who authorised Detective Constable Hoves post-mortem. They stated that they were not involved in the process and were shocked to learn that someone else had signed documents at the hospital as her next of kin.\n\nDetective Constable Hove was 37 at the time of her death and is survived by four children.\n\nPolice Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba has since ordered a comprehensive investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death while assuring the family that no stone will be left unturned, and that justice will be served.\n\n",
