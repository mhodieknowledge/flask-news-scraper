We want to see how we can equitably place our employees in different categories, he said.\n\nThe commissions Conditions of Service Industrial Relations general manager, Dr Michael Sande said stakeholders, employees, and their leadership have said the current grading structure does not incorporate all the professions.\n\nThis is partly due to the emergence of new disciplines over the years, such as imaging. These disciplines that were not adequately addressed in the previous grading structure developed in 2003, he said.\n\nWe have had significant developments in various fields, and our grading structure must reflect these changes. We expect the job grading system to address these gaps.\n\nA stakeholder, Ms Flavia Muyambo said job evaluation is the cornerstone of every organisations development.\n\n",

Before that, I was earning US$90 a month, and even then, it was hard to meet the US$85 child support.\n\nWith no source of income, Mapurira told the court that increasing the maintenance amount would impose an even greater burden on him.\n\nAfter considering both arguments, Magistrate Mutasa ruled in Mapuriras favour, maintaining the current monthly payment of US$85.\n\n",
