            "url": "https://www.herald.co.zw/budget-will-leave-south-africans-bruised-bloodied/",
            "content": "Ordinary South Africans are walking away from the 2025 budget bruised and bloodied.\n\nGovernment not only proposed an increase in the value-added tax (Vat) rate, but their income tax burden has increased by R18 billion.\n\nThe partial relief for bracket creep provided for in the original version of the 2025 budget has been wiped off the table. There will be no inflationary adjustment, not even for low-income households.\n\nNor is there any inflationary increase in medical credits.\n\nBut there will be above-inflation sin tax increases. These tax proposals are designed to result in an increased tax collection of R28 billion for the 2025/26 tax year and a whopping R44,1 billion in the following year.\n\nDespite massive resistance to tax increases, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana raised the Vat rate by 0,5 percent, effective May 1 this year, and another 0,5 percentage points in 2026.\n\nTipping point\n\nThe expected collection from the Vat increase is R13,5 billion in 2025 and R15,5 billion in 2026.\n\nAneria Bouwer, senior consultant at Bowmans, says these projections may not materialise because of the overall increased tax burden.\n\nThe South African Revenue Service (Sars) seems to recognise that there is a tipping point where increased tax rates do not equate to increased tax collections.\n\nBouwer also notes that the primary and secondary rebates have not been adjusted to provide for the impact of inflation.\n\nIndividuals also receive an annual exemption on all South African interest income they earn. It has remained the same for a few years.\n\nThe exemption threshold for interest has remained unchanged since 2013. The current threshold is set at R23 800 for individuals under 65 and R34 500 for individuals 65 and older.\n\nThere is a general reluctance to increase certain thresholds, and because it is gradual it does have a substantial impact on taxpayers and their disposable income.\n\nGovernment thinking is that the higher income households will be bearing the brunt.\n\nLow Vat rate\n\nGerhard Badenhorst, director in Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyrs tax and exchange control practice, says Godongwana indicated in his 2025 Budget Review that 75 percent of the Vat collections come from high income households.\n\nThat may be true but one needs to consider that these households can afford to pay the taxes.\n\nWhat is important is to consider that poor and low-income households spend a substantial proportion of their disposable income on Vat.\n\nThey will feel the impact of the increase more than the richer households, he says.\n\nVat collections until 31 March are expected to come in at R460 billion, which is just under 25 percent of total tax collections. Time will tell if this percentage of total collections will increase because of the 0.5 percentage point increase in the rate, Badenhorst adds.\n\nThe minister attempted to motivate the increase by referring to peer countries and comparing their Vat rates with that of South Africa. The average of the peer countries is 19 percent compared to our current rate of 15 percent.\n\nBudget 2025, Vat, tax rates\n\nBadenhorst warns against considering the Vat rate in isolation.\n\nBotswana has a Vat rate of 14 percent, but its primary healthcare and education systems are exempt for Vat purposes. Our neighbours corporate tax rate is 22 percent compared to our 27 percent and their maximum marginal personal income tax rate is 25 percent compared to SAs 45 percent.\n\nScandinavian countries have an average Vat rate of 25 percent but virtually everything in these countries is tax-exempt.\n\nThey have taken a policy decision to move away from direct taxes to consumption taxes. That is why their Vat rates are so high, says Badenhorst. It is dangerous just to look at rates in isolation and then draw the conclusion that our Vat rate is low compared to other countries.\n\nSmokes and drinks\n\nSouth Africans will feel their tax burden further when they stock up on their smokes and drinks. Cigarettes and cigarette tobacco go up by 4,75 percent and alcohol products by 6,75 percent. Moneyweb\n\nTax Justice SA (TJSA) says these tax hikes will make life even harder for honest citizens while handing yet another victory to criminals.\n\nInstead of tackling the rampant illicit trade that is already robbing the fiscus of R100 billion every year, the government has chosen to punish law-abiding businesses and consumers, driving even more economic activity into the hands of criminals, the organisation says in a statement.\n\nMinister Godongwana has ignored reality and chosen a path that will only worsen South Africas economic crisis, says TJSA founder Yusuf Abramjee.\n\nIncreasing Vat and sin taxes will not raise the revenue the government hopes for. It will only boost illicit traders who operate with impunity while honest businesses struggle to survive.\n\nHe says the budget fails to address the real problem  criminals who are looting the nation on an industrial scale in virtually every sector.\n\nWhy is the Government so quick to squeeze honest taxpayers but so slow to shut down the kingpins of illicit trade?

Officials confirmed that preparations had gathered momentum for this years event.\n\nThe increase in the number of participating nations at the trade showpiece is evidence of the success of the Governments engagement and re-engagement drive.\n\nSince coming to power in 2017, President Mnangagwas administration has made economic diplomacy an integral part of the Governments foreign policy.\n\nThe mandate of the ZITF Company, responsible for organising the exhibition, includes spearheading national branding efforts, promoting investments and economic growth.\n\nOrganisers said to date, 47 140.87 square metres of the available space, representing 95,2 percent of the total, had been taken up by 435 direct exhibitors.\n\nThis years trade showcase will run from April 21 to 26 at the Zimbabwe International Conference and Exhibition Smart City (ZICES) in Bulawayo under the theme Industrialisation: Crafting an Integrated Economic Landscape.\n\nGiving an update on the state of preparedness yesterday, ZITF chairman Mr Busisa Moyo said the exhibition would position Zimbabwe as a competitive hub for trade and investment and highlight the ZITF Companys enduring legacy and role in shaping Zimbabwes industrial landscape over the decades.\n\nPreparations for the ZITF 2025 edition, taking place from April 21-26, 2025, at the Zimbabwe International Conference and Exhibition Smart City (ZICES) in Bulawayo, are gaining momentum.\n\nAs one of Africas premier trade showcases, ZITF continues to play a pivotal role in driving industrial growth, fostering business connections, and positioning Zimbabwe as a competitive hub for trade and investment.\n\nThis years edition is expected to bring together a diverse mix of local and international exhibitors, investors and policymakers, setting the stage for transformative economic dialogue and collaboration, said Mr Moyo.\n\nHe said as the annual trade showcase celebrates its Blue Sapphire edition, 65 years of exhibition excellence, this years edition would make significant strides in fostering collaboration among industries and countries, strengthening economic ties, and advancing mechanisation in industrial sectors.\n\nThis milestone edition will highlight ZITFs enduring legacy and its role in shaping Zimbabwes industrial landscape over the decades.\n\nMr Moyo said exhibition space uptake had been impressive.\n\nAs preparations for the international, multi-sectoral tradeshow are heading to a climax, the uptake by exhibitors has been quite pleasing.\n\nWe are currently sitting at 95,2 percent of space capacity with 435 direct exhibitors who have taken up 47 140.87 square metres of the set aside 49,499 Square metres.\n\nInternational participation is also very strong.
