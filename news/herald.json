No one must put our party into disrepute. This is unacceptable. Such behaviour cannot be tolerated and must stop. Vari kuzviita cherai chikomba, emphasised President Mnangagwa.\n\nEvery member, the President said, must adhere to provisions of the party constitution, founding principles, and procedural integrity, including wide consultation and formal ratification of issues that affect the party.\n\nPrudence must be exercised in the execution of our duties and rights as members, through the use of appropriate principal organs and structures of the party.

To this end, the convening of the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Indaba was a welcome initiative. It stands as a reminder to the party, Government and other stakeholders in the sector to quickly adapt and innovate as we revitalise this important industry of our nation, he said.\n\nFocus, he stated, must be towards guaranteeing that the natural endowments of the country benefit Zimbabweans and help accelerate the modernisation and industrialisation of the economy.\n\nHe commended party members for being instrumental in the success of programmes and activities that were held during the course of the year.\n\nYour individual and collective efforts were instrumental in the success of party programmes and activities held during the course of the year. The spirit of servant leadership and determination to wholeheartedly serve the party and people of our motherland, Zimbabwe, should remain our guiding beacon into the new year.

The programme is envisaged to bolster the land ownership model, and enhance access to financing, as well as to encourage production and productivity, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe implored communities to remain vigilant as the country seeks to capitalise on weather patterns for improved agricultural output.\n\nIn the agriculture sector, I once again urge communities, village-by-village, ward-by-ward to remain vigilant as we maximise the weather patterns for a successful agriculture season, said the President.\n\nTo ensure the smooth facilitation of the process, the Government issued an indefinite moratorium on the issuance of any new 99-year leases, offer letters and permits for agricultural land.\n\nIn announcing the new policy in October this year, President Mnangagwa said in implementing the new system, priority will be given to veterans of the liberation struggle, youths and women.\n\nIn addition, security of tenure to all agricultural land regularised under this programme will, at all times, only be transferable among indigenous Zimbabweans and land targeted for the new tenure system will exclude communal land that is under the jurisdiction of traditional chiefs.\n\nHe said the noticeable new paradigm amongst Zimbabwean farmers, especially the majority of beneficiaries of the land reform, was to regard and conduct farming as a business, a source of both livelihoods and means to increase personal economic value.\n\nChronicling the background of the programme, President Mnangagwa said the Government, has since 2008, put in place various programmes to assist farmers to be productive on the land through programmes such as the Basic Commodity Supply Side Intervention (Baccossi), Inputs and Mechanisation Equipment, Maguta, and the Special Grains Import Substitution Programme among others.\n\nIn the Second Republic, the country has witnessed and benefited from the Governments deliberate and complementary policy of incorporating accelerated infrastructure development which includes road construction and rehabilitation incorporating the much-needed rural roads, dam construction; irrigation; and housing development, he said.\n\nSome of the challenges, he said, that were faced by farmers in the past include difficulty in accessing affordable finance and varying levels of accountability from the farmers.\n\nThe President has since constituted a Cabinet Oversight Committee chaired by Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri to lead the reform process.\n\nA technical committee  the Land Tenure Implementation Committee (LTIC)  to coordinate and steer the implementation of this process will also be constituted.\n\nThese Committees will work diligently to develop improved security of tenure for land beneficiaries while ensuring that the value of agricultural and urban State land is fully unlocked to guarantee inclusive and nationwide economic development.\n\nGovernment will put in place all the necessary institutional and logistical mechanisms to ensure the smooth coordination and implementation of these new policies and objectives.\n\n",

When we took stock in April last year, we realised that we had completed 272 000 houses, and the Cabinet is ready to review the target to 1 million housing units. As we speak, we have already achieved more than 700 000 housing units, which accounts for over 70 percent of our targets. This positions us well to achieve our goals by 2025, he said.\n\nMinister Soda emphasised that housing delivery is not solely the responsibility of the Ministry of National Housing; it involves collaboration with various stakeholders, including pension funds, insurance schemes, individuals, and civil society. He noted ongoing partnerships with banks such as BancABC, CBZ, and CABS, highlighting the importance of private sector participation in realising the vision for 2030, which is expected to be led by the private sector.\n\nSo we are crowding in the private sector by creating a conducive investment environment where they can find opportunities to participate in the housing delivery sector, he said.\n\n",
