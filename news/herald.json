The contract, facilitated through Chemplex Corporation, involved the erection of a greenhouse shade at Dorowa Minerals Murambinda site.\n\nA payment of US$77 264.19 was supposed to be paid to Coursim Investments. The contract was signed by Katiyo and the acting general manager of Dorowa Minerals at Chemplexs headquarters in Harare.\n\nHowever, witnesses for Dorowa Minerals, stationed at the mine, were unavailable at the time.\n\nThe witnesses, Viznet Ruzvezve and Evans Bonde, signed the contract on February 22 and returned the signed document via email.\n\nKatiyo later received a scanned copy of the signed contract and acknowledged its receipt.\n\nThe business relationship allegedly went sour when contractual breaches emerged, prompting Katiyo to terminate the agreement and send a termination notice to Chemplex via email.\n\nAfter termination, Katiyo demanded payment for the services rendered. Chigwende allegedly disputed the payment claim and presented a contract document that had allegedly been unlawfully altered.\n\nThe State alleged that Chigwende had forged the document by replacing the witnesses signatures and falsely dating them back to February 20.\n\nThis forgery was reportedly used by Chigwende to manipulate the terms of the contract and justify non-payment of the claimed amount.\n\nKatiyo discovered the discrepancies in the contract and accused Chigwende of using the forged document to withhold payment.\n\n",
