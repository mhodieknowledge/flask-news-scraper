The engagements in London reaffirm the global confidence in Zimbabwes market potential, and we are committed to ensuring that investors receive the highest level of support as they explore opportunities in our country.\n\nZimbabwe is open for business, and this mission has demonstrated that our investment story is one of growth, resilience, and opportunity, he said.\n\n",

But last year, with WFP backing, we harvested over 650 tonnes of sesame from 2 930 farmers.\n\nThis season, we have scaled up to 11 278 farmers, covering 6 600 hectares, and we expect to produce 3 300 tonnes.Mr Masunda said Zimbabwe has successfully entered the export market, with 212 tonnes of sesame sold internationally last season.We exported 151 tonnes to Japan and smaller quantities to Mozambique. One of our biggest buyers is the Torture Corporation in Japan, and we also have commitments from buyers in India, China and Mozambique.\n\nThe economic impact on smallholder farmers has been significant, with expectations that this seasons harvest will generate approximately US$2.7 million in rural communities.\n\nWFPs Masvingo field offices programme policy officer, Mr Munyaradzi Gahadzikwa said the project is improving food security and livelihoods in drought-affected areas.\n\nIn Mwenezi alone, we are supporting 3 500 vulnerable farmers with funding from the government of Japan, working in collaboration with SAT and relevant Government ministries, Mr Gahadzikwa said.These farmers often struggle to put food on the table, but with sesame production, they have now achieved food security, nutrition security, and income security.\n\n",

            "content": "Sifelani TsikoInnovations EditorClimate-informed decisions are now more important for global investment in low-carbon energy transitions that guarantee reliable energy and future planning for electricity demand, a new global report shows.The 2023 Year in Review: Climate-driven Global Renewable Energy Potential Resources and Energy Demand Report says climate-informed and diversified energy solutions are essential if the world is to meet targets to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030.\n\nThe report was jointly produced by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), operated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).\n\nWhether it is solar power generation in drier-than-average conditions, wind power generation in regions experiencing shifts from La Nia to El Nio conditions, or hydropower generation in the face of fluctuating precipitation patterns, climate has a direct bearing on both electricity supply and demand, the three weather agencies said in a joint statement.\n\nSuch challenges also present unprecedented opportunities. The integration of climate insights into energy planning yields more reliable power generation, helps anticipate seasonal peaks in demand and strengthens the adaptability of future infrastructure development.\n\nCountries around the world are investing in cleaner sources of power to meet targets under the Paris Agreement.The report looks at 2023  a year which saw a transition from a La Nia to an El Nio phenomena, affecting key climatic variables for the energy sector, including wind speed, solar radiation, precipitation and temperature.\n\nIn addition, the report illustrates the potential applications of seasonal forecasts as a valuable tool for energy planning and management.\n\nSeasonal climate forecasts empower stakeholders to anticipate supply-demand fluctuations, optimise grid operations and enhance energy system resilience.\n\nThey also enable better preparation for extreme weather events, ensuring energy security and minimising disruptions.Globally, wind power installed capacity surpassed 1 000 GW in 2023, a 13 percent increase from the 2022 figures.Solar power has been growing considerably faster than wind power, with the installed capacity reaching 1 420 GW in 2023, a 32 percent increase from 2022.\n\nHydropower has grown slightly, with an installed capacity of about 1 410 GW in 2023, a 1 percent increase from 2022.Developing countries face a proportionally heavier financial burden in the shift to a sustainable economy as many are heavily engaged in energy-intensive industries and more reliant on coal for power generation.\n\n",
