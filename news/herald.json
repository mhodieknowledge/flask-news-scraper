The City of Harare currently charges US$25 a month for trading in Mbare markets.\n\n.US$580 per month is higher than the rent for a shop of a similar size in Joina City, a prime CBD location. These charges are not only unjustified, they are completely unreasonable and unacceptable, especially given that the informal traders are still recovering from the devastating fire that was declared a disaster.\n\n",
