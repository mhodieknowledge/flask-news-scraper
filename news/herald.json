            "content": "Prosper Ndlovu\n\nZIMBABWE has clocked a full year since adopting of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency, which has achieved commendable stability evidenced by low inflation and exchange rate predictability, anchored by prudent monetary policy management and other supportive Government measures.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) introduced the ZiG on April 5 last year, and since then, the local unit has defied odds, amid growing market confidence with positive impact on the entire economy.\n\nDespite scepticism and resistance to transact using the local currency by some speculators, major monetary policy indicators have shown that the ZiG is gaining higher economic momentum.\n\nIn a comprehensive report over the weekend, RBZ Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu said prudent monetary policy formulation and implementation pursued by the central bank since April last year had been credited for creating relative price, currency and financial stability.\n\nThe stability is evidenced mainly by the lower monthly ZiG inflation, which stabilised to 0.5 percent in February this year and -0.1 percent last month.\n\nThe significant decline in money supply growth was also consistent with the tight monetary policy stance of the central bank.\n\nAs a result of this stance, the RBZ has succeeded in curtailing the pass-through effects of money supply to the exchange rate and inflation.\n\nThe RBZ has committed to sustaining this momentum with higher stakeholder support, building a path to long-term de-dollarisation, and has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure that prices remain stable, notwithstanding external pressures and headwinds from the global economy.\n\nThere has also been greater exchange rate stability, with foreign exchange parallel market premiums crumbling below 20 percent from about 100 percent.\n\nThe exchange rate has been relatively stable since October last year, with the premium narrowing in September of the same year to levels around 20 percent in March 2025 in line with the stabilisation of the parallel market rate to around ZiG33-34 per US-dollar.\n\nHopes are high that the additional measures to deepen the foreign exchange market announced in the Monetary Policy Statement on February 6, 2024 will further reinforce the prevailing stability on the exchange rate front.\n\nForeign currency inflows on one hand have risen from US$11 billion in 2023 to US$13,3 billion in 2024, resulting in the continuation of the current account surpluses since 2019.\n\nDr Mushayavanhu said the increased availability of foreign currency to cater for all bona fide foreign payments and the sustained financial sector stability and soundness tells the whole story.\n\nThe Reserve Bank reaffirms its commitment to walk the talk of consistent and prudent monetary policy management to sustain price, currency and financial stability, said the RBZ Governor.\n\nAs such, the Reserve bank will remain vigilant to any emerging domestic and external risk to inflation while simultaneously putting in place appropriate measures to strike the delicate balance between stability and economic growth.\n\nHe said the obtaining low inflation and exchange rate stability anchored by prudent monetary policy management and other supportive measures will continue to be the guiding monetary policy frame work of the reserve bank.\n\nWithin this context, inflation expectations are expected to remain well-anchored with month-on-month inflation projected to average below three percent in 2025 consistent with exchange rate stability.\n\nGiven the base effects largely caused by the spike in monthly inflation in October 2024, annual inflation is expected to start at relatively higher levels between April 2025 to September 2025, said Dr Mushayavanhu.\n\nGoing forward, inflation is expected to significantly moderate to end the year 2025 at less than 30 percent, thus supporting the envisaged economic growth of six percent in 2025.\n\nSimilarly, ZiG loans have grown at an average of one percent per week since October 2024 compared to 6,9 percent during the period before September 27, 2024.\n\nIn that regard, Dr Mushayavanhu said the proportion of the local currency deposits now sits at 15,95 percent while total loans amounted to ZWG50,70 billion as at March 2025, with the proportion of the local currency denominated loans being 12,04 percent.\n\nThe RBZ Governor said the banks foreign reserves accumulation strategy has continued to bear positive fruit as attested by the significant build-up of foreign currency reserves, from US$276 million at the end of April 2024 to US$629 million as of last month.\n\nThe foreign reserves have been adequate to cover reserve money as per Reserve Banks commitment and are also currently sufficient to cover the entire ZWG deposits in the banking sector, pointing to the sustained ZiG stability, he said.\n\nAnchored on these measures, Dr Mushayavanhu said Zimbabwe has continued to receive foreign currency inflows enough to cover its external obligations and leaving a sizeable surplus.\n\nThe surplus, which averaged US$400 million per month for the 14 months from January 2024 to February 2025, has been crucial in supporting domestic transactions, he said.\n\nDr Mushayavanhu said foreign currency receipts averaged US$1,1 billion per month during the period January 2024 to February 2025 while the countrys external obligations averaged US$784 million per month during the same period.\n\nMeanwhile, the RBZ has said concerted efforts are being made to ensure delivery of new higher value ZiG bank notes in the shortest possible time to enhance convenience for the transacting public.\n\n",

Improved rainfall in late 2024 and early 2025 has contributed to favourable crop conditions.\n\nTobacco reaping and curing are also underway, with farmers earning US$143,3 million from the sale of 41,6 million kilogrammes of flue-cured tobacco so far.\n\nHowever, this is lower than the previous year, when farmers sold 56,7 million kilogrammes valued at US$200,4 million. The average price on day 22 of the marketing season was US$3,43 per kg, down from US$3,53 the previous year.\n\nThe horticulture sub-sector has seen slow growth due to the El Nio-related drought affecting irrigation, though some sectors, like blueberries and oranges, have increased.\n\nThe total area planted under horticulture has marginally increased from 11,952 hectares to 11,957 hectares.\n\nOn a positive note, the livestock sub-sector has shown resilience, with a slight increase in the national beef cattle herd and growth in the dairy herd, resulting in a 15 percent rise in raw milk production.\n\nThe national beef cattle herd grew from 5 718 523 in 2023 to 5 741 397 in 2024, while the dairy herd increased by 8,7 percent.\n\nGovernment is actively working to expand its fisheries sector through the Presidential Community Fisheries Scheme, distributing over 2 million free tilapia fingerlings nationwide.\n\nHowever, the fisheries sub-sector has been negatively impacted by the 2023-24 drought, leading to a decrease in total fish production.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Governments Rural Development 8.0 programme, encompassing eight Presidential interventions, has made strides in improving rural livelihoods.\n\nThe Presidential Climate-Proofed Input Scheme reached 3,5 million households, while the Presidential Poultry Scheme gained momentum with the distribution of 751 408 indigenous chicks.\n\nIn an interview, Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Minister, Dr Anxious Masuka, emphasised the importance of adapting to climate-related challenges.\n\nHe said institutional arrangements have been made to optimise planning and coordination of cloud seeding activities, and the Government aims to accelerate irrigation development from 217 000 hectares to a targeted 496 000 hectares by involving private players.\n\n",

To ensure Eng Chisango receives a fair hearing, I have exercised my powers to appoint an external, independent counsel and disciplinary authority to conduct the hearing in accordance with the Labour Act, the mayor wrote.\n\nThe step, Clr Mafume said, was taken to guarantee that Eng Chisango receives a hearing free from internal biases or political interference.\n\nThe outcome will likely shape the future of the town clerks tenure and set a precedent for similar cases.\n\nBoth Clr Mafume and Eng Chisango declined to comment on the matter.\n\nHowever, council sources confirmed the developments.\n\nCombined Harare Residents Association director Mr Rueben Akili expressed concern over the prolonged suspension of the town clerk, who continues to receive a monthly salary.\n\nThis, he said, has created a leadership vacuum as the local authority does not have an accounting officer.\n\nThe suspension of the town clerk has been too prolonged and we need to move forward. If they had wanted to gather evidence to ensure that disciplinary measures were taken, the time has been unnecessarily extended, Mr Akili said.\n\nIt would be more prudent for the local authority to make a decision and ensure that the town clerk returns to work as soon as possible.\n\nHarare Residents Trust director Mr Precious Shumba said employees should not remain on suspension for extended periods, as it becomes a significant financial burden.\n\nHarare residents are increasingly vocal about their demand for the resignation of city councillors and top executives, following serious corruption allegations uncovered by a Commission of Inquiry into the citys affairs.\n\nResidents have expressed frustration over a myriad of issues contributing to a deteriorating quality of life, including sewer bursts, inadequate water supply, overflowing dumpsites, poor street lighting, and pervasive corruption.\n\nThe Commission of Inquiry has uncovered shocking corruption scandals, including the purchase of luxury vehicles for top management at an exorbitant cost of US$300 000 each.\n\nHowever, as council bosses live in luxury and opulence, ordinary workers are wallowing in poverty.\n\nReports show that city directors are pocketing monthly salaries of US$12 000, an amount that many residents find unjustifiable given the citys numerous infrastructural and service-related issues.\n\n",

Its not even worth the time and energy to read it. The people of Zimbabwe and their Members of Parliament are solidly behind their President whom they overwhelmingly elected in 2023. That impeachment will never succeed, he said.\n\nDr Muswere said Zanu-PF was a colossal party with grassroots support and the majority of MPs in Parliament.\n\nThe Presidents support cuts across the political divide, with a lot of opposition MPs also supporting him because of the great work he has achieved. The partys leadership, Dr Muswere said, was united and would never allow for such a process to unfold.\n\nHe described Gezas grounds for impeachment as a vexatious figment of his imagination that will never see the light of day.\n\nThat piece of trash being circulated amounts to nothing. Zanu-PF has a majority in Parliament and Honourable members of the august House across the political divide appreciate the great work that has been achieved by the Second Republic, led by His Excellency, Cde Dr President E.D. Mnangagwa.\n\nGeza is in hiding and wanted to use data to foment an uprising that never succeeded as the peace-loving people of Zimbabwe refused to be used to drive agendas they are not part of. He is wanted by the police to answer for his treasonous activities, Dr Muswere said.\n\nThe impeachment compensatory falsehood for the massively flopped 31 March Protest , he said, falls short of constitutional and logical merit.\n\nApart from the abundant support which the President, Cde Dr E.D. Mnangagwa, enjoys from the ZANU PF Parliamentary majority, his statesmanship is duly endorsed by the opposition.\n\nTherefore, no sheer stroke of antagonistic intention to this reality will give life to impeachment considerations across the political divide in Parliament. Anyone with impeachment imaginations is labouring to waste.\n\nThose peddling such falsehoods should be more preoccupied with ensuring that the law doesnt catch up with them following treasonous plotting.\n\nNo amount of maliciously self-concentrated political interest by dubious opportunists will erase the foothold of national prosperity which Zimbabwe is poised to enjoy under the leadership of President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa. We have also taken note of manufactured documents relating to FIU/RBZ, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "WHEN the United States suspended its major aid programme in Africa that was supporting the battle against HIV and AIDS, and dealing with the associated tuberculosis, plus providing significant support for the battle to eliminate malaria, there was a great deal of concern in Zimbabwe that decades of progress would vanish.\n\nThe Government promised that essential health support for those living with HIV would be maintained with local resources and that while stocks of the critical anti-retroviral medication were adequate to June, steps were being taken to ensure that these stocks would be replenished.\n\nThis has now been done, using the time granted by the buffer stocks, to ensure that another three-month supply was bought, taking the stocks to September.\n\nThe Government has delivered.\n\nAs we have noted before, the Second Republic Government can deal effectively with emergencies through budgeting flexibility, something it had already proved with the Covid-19 pandemic and the need last year to ensure no-one went hungry with the dismal harvest after the El-Nino drought. So it should not have been a surprise that it is coping again.\n\nThe US had been pumping in more than US$200 million a year under the US Presidents Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, leaving a substantial hole that had to be filled. And this suspension came with no warning and was immediate, with no notice period to allow any country to readjust. All the adjustments had to be made promptly.\n\nSome of the US support money went on the extra overheads of using non-government organisations in preference to the Ministry of Health and Child Care, an American preference with Zimbabwe, and there was on the published breakdown a large sum to gather data that now can be filled by the Health Ministry and ZimStat.\n\nBut that still left the supply of the ART medication, the need to maintain the TB programme, and the need to maintain the quite separate anti-malaria programme from purely internal resources with perhaps some foreign support from other countries.\n\nThere was also need to maintain the health staff working under the PEPFAR programme and its contracted NGOs. Steps were already in progress from last year to bring the operational health staff, mainly community health workers but with a top layer of professional medical and nursing staff, into the Ministry of Health and Child Care.\n\nThey were doing such good and essential work that they should be in the Ministry and efficiencies would be boosted further if the relationship between this staff and the basic system of provincial and district health officers was formalised, instead of just relying on almost everyone showing common sense. This inclusion needs to be finalised and again provides a cost saving by eliminating much of the independent layer of administration driven by the US preference for NGOs.\n\nFor medical supplies, the Government moved swiftly with Minister of Health and Child Care Dr Douglas Mombeshora taking the lead and ordering available funds from the Aids Levy on taxpayers and other available money to be spent as a priority on the ART supplies and other associated medicines.\n\nThis is why there is now an extra three-months supply and that, in turn, should ensure that those who need this medicine must continue taking it as prescribed. Dr Mombeshora noted when he announced the new order that some people were skipping some treatment to build up their personal stocks in case there was a shortage.\n\nAlready steps are in progress to fund continued purchases automatically through ring-fenced taxes. Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Mthuli Ncube has discussed assigning some taxes and duties for this, so that the needed cash flows directly, like the AIDS Levy, from Zimra to the supply chain.\n\nZimbabwe is well on course to eliminating new HIV infections before 2030. The heart of the programme is to ensure that everyone infected with HIV is identified and put on ART treatment. After a while on treatment, the virus is suppressed and the patient is no longer infected.\n\nOnce all those living with HIV in Zimbabwe have their virus levels suppressed there is no new infection, simply a continuing need to supply the ART medication until old-age has taken off the last person living with HIV, probably at the end of this century. Hence the need for everyone prescribed ART to take the medication, not just for their own sake but for the health of the nation.\n\nAlready Zimbabwe has met the 95-95-95 target. That is at least 95 percent of those with HIV know their status, at least 95 percent of those living with HIV are on ART, and at least 95 percent of those on ART now have their virus suppressed.\n\nOur best performance is with those tested for HIV taking the medication, more than 98 percent. That is because there are adequate stocks of medication to ensure that everyone can start the treatment as soon as it is confirmed they are living with HIV, and the one percent not taking their tablets simply need a good shove.\n\nTime is simply needed to get a similar figure for those with suppressed virus. Suppression is not instant, but so long as the person living with HIV takes the right dosage as prescribed they will reach that stage.\n\nThe somewhat sticky statistic is getting those infected but not knowing their status to be tested so they can start treatment. This is almost 5 percent of the estimated infected. We now know that most of these are young people and here there are the additional complications of underage marriage, underage sexual relations and the like. Most teenagers cannot just sneak off from home for a test.\n\nSince many of the infections in this age group result from contact with older people, there is the additional complication that these older people are committing a crime and so hiding what they do. Major efforts are being made for all sorts of reasons to end child marriages and sexual exploitation of underage children, and those efforts will also translate into fewer HIV infections in those age groups. But we also need to reach out to those in these age groups so they come forward for testing.\n\n",

Cde Mabika, a seasoned cadre, has previously served as the Zanu PF Manicaland deputy chairperson, and I would like to wish her well in her new role.\n\nCde Mabika expressed gratitude and humility on being elected.\n\nAs she takes on her new role, Cde Mabika aims to enhance the welfare of women in Manicaland through various empowerment projects, demonstrating her dedication to creating positive change and improving the lives of those around her.\n\nI was humbled by the election and being entrusted with such a powerful position, especially when I least expected it. I urge women in Manicaland to unite towards a common goal of strengthening Zanu PFs presence in the province.\n\nLet us focus on economic development, peaceful co-existence, and womens empowerment. We must ensure women in Manicaland benefit from projects being initiated by President Mnangagwa and his Government.\n\nEmpowering women empowers families, provinces, and nations. We need these projects to impact households, communities, and the nation. We must promote peace, development, and support women to become influential figures, she said.\n\nCde Mabika reaffirmed the Womens Leagues commitment to Resolution Number One, adopted at last years conference in Bulawayo, which seeks to extend President Mnangagwas term of office until 2030, to allow him to continue implementing his developmental initiatives.\n\nShe emphasised that President Mnangagwas leadership is crucial for Zimbabwes economic growth and peace, and believes extending his term will ensure continuity and stability, enabling the country to build upon the progress made so far.\n\nAs regards Resolution Number One, there is absolutely no going back because it was made by the people, for the people.\n\nWe deeply appreciate and fully support President Mnangagwas leadership. The people have spoken, and their decision should be respected.\n\nAs a Christian nation, Zimbabwe acknowledges the voice of the people as the voice of God. Since the resolution originated from the people, it reflects their will, and we should abide by it, said Cde Mabika who takes over from Cde Nyakuedzwa who was last year suspended by the Zanu PF Politburo from holding any position in the ruling party for two years.\n\n",

We are aware that their handlers have the appetite to control Africa because of its abundant resources.\n\nWe know they protested against ANC, Frelimo in Mozambique, SWAPO in Namibia, and now Zanu PF and other progressive liberation movements.\n\nThey want to remove liberations movements out of power and put stooge Governments in Africa. As the youth, we agreed to work together to fight agents of the regime change agenda, Cde Malatji said.\n\nHe implored the youth from across the continent to stand firm and fight Western machinations that are sponsoring their proxies.\n\nCde Malatji said his visit highlights the positive relationship between the ANC Youth League and the Zanu PF Youth league.\n\n",
