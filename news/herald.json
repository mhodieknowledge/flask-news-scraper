Meeting her and exchanging notes would be a tremendous opportunity.\n\nI am eager to learn from her, and I hope she reads this article and reaches out to me.\n\nAnesu, who serves as a praise and worship singer at Kingdom Light Global Church, believes she has the potential to perform for larger audiences.\n\nI have primarily performed in the church because music promoters tend to favour big names, she said.\n\nThere are many talented artists, but sadly, promoters often do not cast their nets wide enough. I will continue to work hard to reach a level where promoters will seek me out. With Gods grace, nothing is impossible.\n\nWhile she acknowledges Pastor Muleya for providing her with exposure, Anesu insists that her motivation is not monetary.\n\nTo me, gospel music is a calling I received from the Almighty. I would be lying if I said I am singing for money, she said.\n\nIf financial rewards come, that would be a bonus, but for now, I want to build my name and be recognised among elite praise and worship singers in Zimbabwe and beyond.\n\nIn her quest for a breakthrough, her management team has lined up several collaborations.\n\nMy manager, Pastor George, is currently negotiating with Frets Donzvo for a gospel song. It would be a dream come true if we could reach out to Fungisais team. We are hopeful that this will happen, she added.\n\nLike many other artists, Anesu is also learning to play various instruments. The only instrument I can play without difficulty is the tambourine, and I am learning to play the acoustic guitar. However, my true strength lies in singing gospel songs.\n\nBorn into a family of three girls as the youngest, Anesu attended Dunuza Primary School in Triangle and completed her secondary education at Terrygoss High School in the Lowveld.\n\nShe studied Accounting at Masvingo Polytechnic. Anesu is married to Darlington Makurumidze.\n\n",

When you are there, you individually and collectively become ambassadors of our country. So, never think that you are an individual, wherever you are, you are actually representing us, he said.\n\nZimbabweans are known the world over for their hard work and tenacity, something President Mnangagwa said the students should showcase.\n\nMukanyadzisa muri ikoko, hamuna kunyadzisa vabereki venyu chete, matonyadzisa nesuwo ende kana madaro tinozonetsekana mangwana kuti titume here vamwe (If you act in an unbecoming manner during your stay in Algeria, know that you have not only let your parents down, but the nation at large and it will be difficult for us to send more students).\n\nSaka garai muchiziva kuti wakamirira nyika, hauna kuzvimirira pachako (You should always know that you are representing the country, you are not representing yourself).\n\nYou must go ahead and show the values of hard work. You must show that you are coming from a hard-working country. You must commit yourself to why you are there, he said.\n\nYou must go there with determination and courage and a sense of pride. Wherever Zimbabwean students go, they perform very well, we have that record across the world.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the scholarships were a testament to the cordial relations between Harare and Algiers.\n\nZimbabwe and Algeria have a longstanding relationship that continues to deepen. We have consolidated our relations and this is why we have this offer because our relationship is strengthening and is becoming more and more comprehensive.\n\nI wish to congratulate you students on your study assignment in Algeria.\n\nWe have a very long standing relationship with Algeria and the students that have gone before you behaved very well and upheld the good relations between us (Zimbabwe and Algeria), he said.\n\nI hope you will not be the group that will spoil that relationshipif that happens, our prisons are not full.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa shared a lighter moment with the students.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa poses for a group photograph with Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Professor Amon Murwira (fourth from left), Algerian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mohamed Seoudi (fifth from right), his deputy Mohamed Mehdi (fourth from right), students leaving for Algeria on scholarship and their parents at State House in Harare yesterday.Picture: Kudakwashe Hunda.\n\nJust think of it as you are representing ED, its a tall order so you must always keep that in mind. As you represent us in foreign lands, you should know you are not representing yourself. You are representing us.\n\nAnd before you sleep, you should pray and say, I am representing ED so I must do my best, said the President light-heartedly.\n\n . . . when you come back here, its either I will give you a red carpet and congratulate you or you spend a few days behind bars for misrepresenting us.\n\nHe also encouraged the students to cherish the scholarship opportunity as it was not something to take for granted.\n\nSo as you go ahead, you must embrace every opportunity you find so that you can bring such experience back home for the benefit of developing our country. You are only very few.\n\nThe students in this country of your age, with your qualifications, are so many, but you have been found fit to take up this challenge.\n\nYou have been given guidance byyour parents that you will not be representing your families but Zimbabwe, the President said.\n\nAs beneficiaries of the cordial relations between Zimbabwe and Algeria, President Mnangagwa encouraged the students to hoist the countrys flag high as this would see more scholarship opportunities being availed.\n\nYou see, these scholarships are a testament to the relationship between Zimbabwe and Algeria.\n\nIf you carry yourself in high esteem during your time there we will certainly get more scholarships because of our good mannerisms. If you do not represent us well then they will just reduce the number, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa also had some words for the students parents and guardians who were present during the send-off.\n\nTo the parents, do not expect financial benefits while the children are in Algeria, these children are going to school so you are the ones who should actually send them money, he said.\n\nAlgerian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mohamed Seoudi said Zimbabwe was more than a friend to Algeria hence the continuous extension of scholarships.\n\nOur relations (with Zimbabwe) are going on excellently and what is better than the building of human resources? That is why Algeria is giving Zimbabwe more than 100 scholarships each year including these ones extended to the President from his brother (Algerian President).\n\nLike the President says, nyika inovakwa nevene vayo. Algeria is very committed to countries on the African continent like Zimbabwe who are more than friends to us, he said.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries, Natasha Deni, said she was elated to have been accorded the scholarship.\n\nI am 20 and I was overjoyed, excited and most of all grateful to God for awarding me this opportunity and also to the President for this scholarship opportunity, she said.\n\nAnother student, Melogina Mano, said she was grateful for the opportunity.\n\nI am very happy because this is not an opportunity accorded to many, she said.\n\n",

We are now taking action. Yesterday, we met with our investors to refine our tripartite partnership.\n\nMinister Garwe indicated that the Ministry and the City of Harare are taking decisive steps, as directed by President Mnangagwa, to deliver world-class services to residents by 2030.\n\nHe reassured the public that while technology may raise concerns about increased rates, it could actually lower delivery costs, aiming for globally effective solutions that ensure affordability.\n\nWhile technology often raises concerns about increased rates, we want to reassure the public that it can actually lower delivery costs. Our goal is to implement globally effective technology that ensures affordable, world-class services for everyone, said Minister Garwe.\n\nHarare Mayor Councillor Jacob Mafume highlighted the necessity of collaboration for the development of the capital city.\n\nA capital city cannot be built by the city alone; it requires the support of central Government and the private sector.\n\nHe drew parallels with successful cities like Kigali in Rwanda and New Cairo in Egypt, underscoring the importance of synergies in meeting citizens needs and emphasising that water and sewage services transcend political affiliations.\n\nCities we admire, like Kigali and New Cairo, were built through collaboration between municipalities and central Governments. We see no contradiction in working together to align with citizens needs.\n\nMr Clark Dai, deputy managing director of Hangzhou Laison Technology, expressed enthusiasm for the project, saying their smart water management system will serve as a benchmark not only for Harare but for Southern Africa.\n\nWe have developed a reliable, practical, and advanced system aimed at improving efficiency and addressing the challenges of non-buried water, he said.\n\nMr Brendon Jere, chief executive officer of Helcraw Electrical, said the water plant, distribution, and billing system are part of a comprehensive plan to ensure water reaches all residents of Harare sustainably and intelligently.\n\nThis initiative signifies a collaborative effort to tackle critical water supply challenges in Harare, with the new water treatment plant expected to set a standard for similar projects across Southern Africa.\n\n",

            "content": "Joseph Madzimure-Senior Reporter\n\nTHERE is a growing call from Zanu PF structures, with more provinces joining the chorus in pleading with President Mnangagwa to continue his term of office beyond 2028 to realise Vision 2030.\n\nAppealing to President Mnangagwa to stay beyond 2028 is not a crime, but what the people are yearning for in appreciation of his work ethic, they said.\n\nThe structures are saying President Mnangagwa deserves to continue in office in light of the remarkable progress the country has achieved under his watch.\n\nThis week, Zanu PF Manicaland and Matabeleland South provinces joined other provinces such as Masvingo, Harare, Midlands and Mashonaland East in appealing to President Mnangagwa to remain in office beyond 2028.\n\nZanu PF Manicaland and Matabeleland South provinces are conducting inter-district meetings to give feedback on the 21st Zanu PF Annual Peoples Conference resolutions and appraise party structures up to ground level, the expectations of the leadership.\n\nOne of the resolutions which came out of the conference was the endorsement by all provinces of the extension of President Mnangagwas term beyond 2028.\n\nManicaland provincial chairman Cde Tawanda Mukodza said the purpose of the inter-district meetings was to give feedback on conference resolutions.\n\nWe were also unfolding the year plans, but the major factor is that inter-districts are a constitutional requirement and we have to do them, he said.\n\nCde Mukodza highlighted the importance of resolution Number One which stated that the party wants President Mnangagwa to continue with the good works as leader of the party and nation up to and after the year 2030.\n\nIts now our duty as a province to cascade these important resolutions to the grassroots, he said.\n\nMatabeleland South held their inter-district meeting in Insiza District on Wednesday which was attended by the party leadership from all top five wings; the main, women, war veterans and the youth wings at Mthwakazi Hall in Filabusi.\n\nIn an interview, Zanu PF Matabeleland South chairman Cde Mangaliso Ndlovu, who is also the Minister of Industry and Commerce, said they are conducting inter-district meetings across the province.\n\nWe started with Insiza District yesterday. We are now convening inter-district meetings in other districts. The move is meant to give feedback on the outcome of the 21st Zanu PF Annual Peoples Conference which was held in Bulawayo in October last year, he said.\n\nCde Ndlovu said one of the major resolutions is that the term of office of President Mnangagwa be extended beyond 2028.\n\nAll the provinces adopted that resolution and all the 10 provinces anonymously agreed on that. It is now up to party members and the generality of Zimbabweans to see that the resolution is implemented, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the countrys main opposition party, CCC, is also in agreement with a resolution by the ruling Zanu PF party to postpone the next harmonised elections from 2028 to 2030 to allow developmental projects initiated by President Mnangagwa and the Second Republic to come to fruition.\n\n",
