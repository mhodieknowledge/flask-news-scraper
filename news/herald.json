By nature, Zimbabweans are hardworking, he said.\n\nTowards that end, Parliaments Portfolio Committee on Industry and Commerce yesterday convened to discuss the challenges faced by manufacturers and retailers in the formal sectors.\n\nConfederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) chief economist, Dr Cornelius Dube, said there was need for legislation requiring Government ministries, departments and agencies to procure a specific percentage of their goods and services from local suppliers to boost the economy.\n\nGovernment should come up with legislation or a statutory instrument that compels it to buy a prescribed threshold for its goods and services from local suppliers, he said.\n\nDr Dube argued that this measure would enhance competitiveness and boost demand for local products.\n\nConfederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) president Mr Denford Mutashu highlighted the unfair competition posed by informal traders.\n\nThere are a lot of regulations and cost centres that we are facing as formal traders that those in the informal sectors are not paying. This makes our prices uncompetitive.\n\nThe closure of formal businesses could negatively impact other sectors, such as banking and finance, due to a decline in deposits, he said.\n\nIn her presentation, chief executive officer of the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) Ms Rosemary Mpofu-Chikarakara stressed the importance of addressing exchange rate discrepancies, foreign exchange shortages, and market distortions that encourage arbitrage.\n\nThe CCZ also wants smuggling stopped.\n\nIssues of porous border posts also need to be seriously dealt with and punitive (and) deterrent measures such as jail terms need to be introduced in order to curb these challenges.\n\nGovernment and the affected businesses can partner and aggressively invest and deploy advanced monitoring technologies, including drones, CCTV, and automated scanning systems, at all major border posts.\n\nAll imported products should abide by the rules, with no exemptions of who is importing. As long as there are other importers who are exempted from paying duty, loopholes will always be created and these products will then find their way both in the formal and informal market, creating an unfair playing field with the businesses that pay duties, the CCZ said.\n\nPortfolio Committee chairperson Cde Clemence Chiduwa acknowledged the concerns raised at the meeting.\n\nWe have taken note of the presentations and we will compile a report that we will table in the House for debate, he said.\n\nThe Committee aims to find viable solutions to support the local industry and create a fair competitive environment.\n\nThe Government and the Reserve Bank have taken taken steps to formalise the informal sector as part of broader measures outlined in the 2025 Monetary Policy Statement announced last Thursday, aimed at enhancing Government tax revenues and stabilising the economy.\n\nA week earlier, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Professor Mthuli Ncube announced measures to rein the burgeoning informal sector that was threatening the survival of formal businesses.\n\nThe RBZ Monetary Policy emphasises the need for both the informal and formal sectors to align, creating a more cohesive economic environment.\n\nRBZ Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu is advocating for the integration of informal businesses into a system that includes dual currencies, bank accounts, and electronic payments, which is essential for achieving the Governments economic goals.\n\nUnder the new regulations, items on a list of commonly smuggled goods will be presumed smuggled unless merchants can provide valid customs clearance.\n\nThis initiative places pressure on businesses to ensure compliance and legitimacy in their operations.\n\nGovernment will implement a presumptive retail-level VAT that manufacturers must collect when selling to small or informal businesses lacking tax clearance certificates.\n\nThis measure restricts wholesalers from engaging with unlicensed entities, further pushing informal businesses towards formalisation.\n\n",

It is pleasing that the Aero India show continues to grow in scope offering us great opportunities to witness the latest innovations and technologies in the aviation and defence industry. Military technology is indeed increasingly becoming integral to global peace and security given the non-traditional threats that are bedevilling our globe, said Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri.\n\nIt is pleasing that the conclave is coming at a time when India-Africa relations are growing from strength to strength as demonstrated by the continued participation of African countries at this event, she said.\n\nOur meeting is taking place on the backdrop of a shifting geopolitical environment and the rise in conflicts in many parts of the world, mainly in the Middle East and parts of Africa, said Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri.\n\nShe highlighted that these catastrophes confronting the world, were reversing the gains that have been made in the attainment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, thereby exposing vulnerable groups.\n\nThe global peace and security environment is being made more complex by the increasing recurrence of natural disasters with most emanating from climate change, she said.\n\nThis is rolling back socio-economic achievements made in recent years towards the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals and are impacting the vulnerable most, that is women, children, the disabled and the elderly, she added.\n\nMinister Muchinguri-Kashiri said recurring droughts owing to the adverse effects of climate change were increasing vulnerability among people.\n\nThese unwelcome developments require the defence forces to think outside the box.\n\nIn recent years, Southern Africa, in particular, has experienced severe droughts and flooding caused by cyclones. During the 2023-2024 rain season, the region experienced the worst drought in living memory.\n\nThe current season experienced floods that destroyed some parts of our region. This development prompted members of the defence forces to be increasingly involved in national and regional disaster preparedness mechanisms, and this calls for the modernisation and redesigning of our defence forces.\n\nThis new phenomenon requires mutual bilateral and multilateral cooperation for us to exchange experiences and best practices, she said. Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri lauded the India-Africa relations that were facilitating economic growth through forums like the BRICS+.\n\nIndia has been increasingly investing in Africa and also leading in the opening of markets for African goods and services, and in addition, continues to avail fair credit lines through its membership of the BRICS.\n\nTrade relations between the Republic of India and Africa are underpinned by diverse economic engagements with both governments and the private sector. As a result, trade between India and Africa continues to grow, making India our Africas third largest trading partner, after China and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri signed a memorandum of understanding on behalf of the Government with Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.\n\n",

This was driven by expectations of the Federal Reserve pausing its interest rate hikes, further weakening the dollar.\n\nContinuing geopolitical risks and golds growing attractiveness as a safe-haven asset also contributed.\n\nGlobal gold prices have remained steady in early 2025, maintaining the upward trajectory of recent years.\n\nThe gold coins are sold through the Reserve Bank and its subsidiaries, Fidelity Gold Refinery and Aurex. The coins can also be traded through local commercial banks and selected international banking partners.\n\n",

Because, you know, what I experienced in some organisations, there are plenty of nice ideas, and words, but the reality is not there.\n\nAnd when speaking about respect, they are introducing other ideological elements, they are even confusing the people and introducing other problems, he said.\n\nHe further thanked the First Lady for her programmes aimed at grooming todays youth saying that children needed to be raised properly and shown the correct path.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa exchange gifts with Vatican Ambassador Archbishop Janusz Urbanczyk, the Apostolic Nuncio to Zimbabwe at Zimbabwe House on Tuesday.  Pictures: John Manzongo\n\nThe ambassador had the privilege of touring the National Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Call Centre in the Office of the First Lady where victims of violence are assisted and linked to relevant organisations depending on their needs.\n\nThe 575 helpline is the brainchild of Amai Mnangagwa, who has taken the bull by its horns and pledged to curb domestic violence.\n\nThe ambassador showered praises on the First Lady for establishing the GBV call centre to end violence.\n\nViolence is always negative and it destroys families, destroying the normal situation. So, we must understand and try to help the weaker part. Women are always weaker and we must respect them and we must pay tribute, so it is important to have a Centre like this one to address domestic violence and violence against children. This is a place where we can collect data and completely help victims of gender-based violence, he said.\n\nCommenting on his meeting with the mother of the nation, the ambassador said: It was for me a great joy that I was able to come to see and greet personally the hardworking First Lady.\n\nRecognising her for all this work that she has been doing and continues doing for the country and trying to address the concerns of the people mainly women and children.\n\nEarlier, during the meeting, the ambassador told the First Lady his willingness to learn Shona and achieve a high degree of proficiency in it.\n\nHe said he was settling well in the country.\n\nIve been here for just over nine months, so its not that long since I came to stay here. I have been here for a short time and its my desire to stay here longer. I would like to learn Shona, he said.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa interacts with Vatican Ambassador Archbishop Janusz Urbanczyk, the Apostolic Nuncio to Zimbabwe during a courtesy call at Zimbabwe House on Tuesday\n\nDr Mnangagwa responded by saying, Shona is so simple and that will be very good for you because you will be able now to communicate with everybody even with those in rural areas.\n\nThe First Lady warmly welcomed Archbishop Janusz Urbancyzk.\n\nI welcome you with a warm heart that your appointment to come here to work with us is very important for the whole country and myself as Amai, as a mother I feel greatly honoured that you have come to see me which is very important. In every given family, the mother is the first person to see at home because she is always there looking after the family. I welcome you on behalf of Zimbabwe. I know you have met so many people in Government, but on my part here I thank you very much. I am so humbled, Dr Mnangagwa said.\n\nThe ambassador gave a brief background about his family, including the fact that he is the only boy in a family of five.\n\nThank you and I agree wholly with you about the importance of a mother. Imagine that in my family, we are five siblings but I am the only boy.\n\nMy older sisters took care of me, so I was raised alongside my sisters. I did all the work, and house chores as a boy and I would not fail to do something because I am a boy. My sisters would make sure I even cleaned the house. I would do all kinds of work in the house just like my sisters, he said.\n\nThe First Lady said she was working along the same lines to ensure both girls and boys knew all tasks around the home.\n\nThat is what we are now also training our children here, the boy child and the girl child that you should do the same because when you grow up you have to know all these chores because when you come of age you will lead your family, but the background is very important.\n\nBut your sisters were looking after you showing motherly care and they were protecting you, also teaching you that life goes this way. We have time to do that in our country as well, that all the work that is done at home every child must do, she said.\n\nThe ambassador said it was critical for children to be groomed and shown the correct path, including on dressing for their own benefit in the future.\n\nInstilling the correct values in children, he said, helps them stay away from drugs and other harmful activities.\n\nSpeaking on the respect of women, the ambassador said equality was fundamental.\n\nIn some countries that I worked in, they are speaking, discussing womens equality and empowerment but they are not respecting seriously the importance of women, the role of the women in the family, in the society and the country. Countries must maintain peace and shun war because the weaker ones, women, suffer the most. I am happy that it is a different situation in Zimbabwe as women here are being empowered and there is gender equality, he said.\n\nThe First Lady weighed in saying indeed it was important to recognise women.\n\nShe concurred with the ambassador that in times of war, it is women and children who bear the brunt.\n\nAll that women need is respect and to be empowered, so that they fend for their children, the husband being there or not, she needs to be empowered to look after her family. So, if there is no respect, there is no empowerment to talk about, the First Lady said.\n\n",
