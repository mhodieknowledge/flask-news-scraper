            "content": "Fungi Kwaramba\n\nNews Editor\n\nPRESIDENT Mnangagwa will lead a delegation of the Southern African Development Community to Tanzania later this week for an Extraordinary joint meeting with the East African Community (EAC) bloc in an effort to thrash out a peaceful resolution to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) conflict.\n\nThis follows a decision made by the Extraordinary SADC Summit in Harare last week for a joint summit with the EAC, chaired by Kenyan President William Ruto.\n\nDRC, a member of both SADC and the EAC, accuses Rwanda, which is a member of the latter grouping, of backing M23 and other rebel groups, that have left death and destruction in eastern DRC.\n\nThe Extraordinary joint summit has been spawned by growing hostilities in eastern DRC that have killed thousands, with millions fleeing their homes.\n\nDeputy Chief Secretary in the Office of the President and Cabinet (Presidential Communications), Mr George Charamba, who is also the Presidential Spokesperson, said the President will lead a Double Troika, plus the Troops Contributing countries to the joint summit, that he will co-chair with President Ruto.\n\nThe President has a very important foreign affairs fixture in the form of the situation in DRC. There is a joint summit of SADC and the East African Community that will be held in Tanzania later this week, which has taken an extraordinary decision to invite all parties in the DRC conflict to a meeting. The President is an important interlocutor in the crisis considering that he has built a strong relationship with both the DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and President Paul Kagame, said Mr Charamba.\n\nThe SADC Double Troika comprises the SADC chairman, outgoing chairman and incoming and the Chairperson of the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation.\n\nTanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan is the current chairperson of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation.\n\nThe SADC Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC), that was deployed on 15 December 2023 to support the Government of the DRC to restore peace and security in eastern DRC, comprises forces from the Republics of Malawi, South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania.\n\nIn the aftermath of summits that were held separately by SADC andthe EAC, the United Nations Security Councils strident criticism of the rebel groups in eastern DRC and their sponsoring countries, a wide conflagration in the Greater Lakes region has seemingly been averted after the M23 and other rebel groups declared a ceasefire, ostensibly on humanitarian grounds.\n\nThe coalition of rebels, which recently intensified clashes in eastern Congo, claimed control over Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.\n\nClashes between government forces and rebel groups have left an estimated 900 civilians dead, displacing tens of thousands more.\n\nThe recent fighting in eastern DRC, which has been dogged by conflict for more than 30 years since the 1994 Rwandan genocide, has also claimed 16 soldiers from the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and Malawi, who form part of the SADC Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC).\n\nAs rebel forces gained the upper hand on the battlefield, capturing much of Goma, the largest city in eastern Congo, South Africa responded with a stern diplomatic warning. The South African government stated that any further attacks on its troops would be regarded as a declaration of war.\n\nIn a swift rebuttal, Rwandas President Kagame accused South Africa of acting as part of a belligerent force. He claimed that South African troops were engaged in offensive combat operations to support the Congolese government in its fight against its own citizens.\n\nResultantly, tensions were high before last weeks SADC Summit in Harare, which mandated its Organ Troika on Politics, Defence and Security Co-operation to engage all state and non-state parties to the conflict on a ceasefire process to protect lives and facilitate a smooth flow of humanitarian support to people and communities affected by the armed conflict.\n\nThe Summit also urged Political and Diplomatic leaders who are parties to the conflict to engage in a co-ordinated effort of dialogue, including supporting the Luanda Process, MONUSCO and others, to restore peace and security in eastern DRC.\n\nSADC leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to the DRCs sovereignty, territorial integrity, and long-term stability, pledging ongoing support for its development and security.\n\nLast week, the African Unions Peace and Security Council (PSC) at its 1256th Emergency Ministerial meeting on the Recent Developments in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), condemned the DRC conflict and called for adherence to the Luanda Process.\n\nUnder the Luanda Process, Angolan President Joo Manuel Gonalves Loureno has tried to broker peace between DRC President Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Kagame. Such talks have, however, remained elusive, amid escalatory rhetoric and trading of accusations between the two leaders.\n\nThus, the summit, that will be held in Tanzania, offers a platform for both President Tshisekedi and President Kagame to meet directly with mediation from SADC and the EAC.\n\n",

Some major decisions will be made regarding the economy, he said.\n\nLast weeks meeting that was attended by Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, Vice President Kembo Mohadi, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube and State Security Minister Lovemore Matuke, deliberated on measures Government has taken on the economy and developments in specific economic sectors, including the retail sub-sector.\n\nThe meeting culminated in the announcement of a raft of new measures to compel regulatory compliance within the retail and wholesale sectors, aiming to rein in the countrys increasingly informal economy.\n\nOn a regional level, the President, who is the current Southern African Development Community (SADC) Chair, will continue to lead the regional body in intensifying regional peace and security efforts.\n\nThe President last week chaired the Extraordinary SADC Summit held in Harare to discuss the security situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\nBoth SADC Chair President Mnangagwa and East African Community (EAC) Chair Kenyan President William Ruto have since agreed for the convening of a joint summit between the two regional blocs.\n\nDuring his break, the President demonstrated that he was a hands-on leader as he performed his duties as and when needed.\n\nIn addition to chairing the economic meeting and the Extraordinary SADC Summit, the President saw off beneficiaries of an Algerian scholarship programme, welcomed ruling party and opposition legislators as they toured the First Familys Pricabe Farm in Kwekwe, a monumental tour that saw the unification of both Zanu PF and CCC MPs, and commemorated former Vice President John Landa Nkomos death, among other Presidential duties.\n\nIn the last Cabinet meeting of 2024, the President said going into the new year, the Second Republic would continue delivering for the general citizenry this year.\n\nThe service delivery demands of the people of Zimbabwe must be responded to timely. After all, we are a Government by the people and for the people, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Zvamaida Murwira and Joseph Madzimure\n\nUnited States President Donald Trumps administration has conceded that the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has been used as a conduit for regime change activities in several countries around the world, a development that vindicates Zimbabwes widely held view of the organisation.\n\nThe Republican administration, which took office on January 20, has since moved swiftly to close USAIDs Washington DC offices and operations, arguing that it has been used to fuel coups, protests, fund opposition parties and political activists, in what observers have noted as a Damascene moment for the Trump administration.\n\nUS billionaire Mr Elon Musk, who was appointed by President Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), branded USAID a criminal organisation after security officials reportedly denied members of his cost-cutting task force access to crucial files.\n\nHe said USAID should die amid reports that two top security officials at the aid agency were put on leave for refusing his representatives access to classified materials.\n\nIn a January 20 executive order announcing a 90-day pause in most of US foreign aid, President Trump said the US foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values.\n\nThey serve to destabilise world peace by promoting ideas in foreign countries that are directly inverse to harmonious and stable relations internal to and among countries, it said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he is now the acting director of the US Agency for International Development, following the Trump administrations sudden pause on federal foreign spending and layoffs at the 63-year-old agency.\n\nThe observations by the US administration dovetails with a widely held view by the Zimbabwean Government that USAID has since the turn of the millennium been used as an agent of regime change in Harare through creation of shadowy civil society organisations.\n\nThere have been several civic society organisations that occasionally surface as the country approaches national elections or ahead of an international conference such as the United Nations General Assembly to discredit the Government under the guise of human rights watch.\n\nThe Government has over the years consistently raised red flags over USAID activities as the international agency claims that it has provided more than US$3 billion in aid to Zimbabwe since independence in support of democratic institutions and actors in order to have free and fair elections.\n\nIn 2018, the United States admitted that the quasi-political civil society organisations it had been funding to push democratic activities in Zimbabwe squandered funds meant for the project.\n\nThe US said it had since suspended funding them and reported the matter to USAID Office of the Inspector General (OIG).\n\nThe OIG is an arm responsible for investigating the abuse of USAID programmes.\n\nOrganisations which were fingered by the US then for alleged abuse of funds include the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZimRights), Election Resource Centre (ERC) and Counselling Services Unit (CSU) and all three deal with political and governance issues.\n\nThis was revealed by the then US Embassy acting public relations officer Mr John Taylor who admitted that there was misuse of funds.\n\nIt has also emerged that nefarious activities by USAID were well documented across the globe.\n\nThere are reports that USAID built a fake Cuban Twitter platform called ZunZuneo, designed to lure young users and slowly feed them anti-government content to spark protests and was funded in secret through shell companies.\n\nThe plan collapsed when exposed in 2014.\n\nUSAID was accused of funding regime change in Venezuela after it poured millions into opposition groups trying to overthrow the leaders of that country, President Hugo Chvez and Nicols Maduro.\n\nIt trained activists, bankrolled anti-government media, and was linked to the failed 2002 coup against President Chvez.\n\nIn 2014, USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy poured money into opposition groups and media in Ukraine.\n\nOther countries where it was accused of meddling in political affairs include Bolivia, Haiti and Afghanistan.\n\nFounded in 1961, the agency manages billions of dollars in federal humanitarian assistance around the world.\n\nBut its work was thrown into upheaval in the last week, as the Trump administration halted nearly all its programmes and took down its website.\n\n",

            "content": "Tendai Rupapa\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nTRAILBLAZING First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa, who is also the Patron of Culture and Heritage in the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, yesterday launched a first-of-its-kind and educative Zviperengo Cultural Quiz Programme for learners, providing a platform where local languages will be showcased on a national level thereby, protecting and preserving the countrys culture and heritage.\n\nThey were asked questions from proverbs to idioms, spellings, figures of speech, and riddles as well as translating English words to Shona.\n\nThe children will also compete in a culinary showcase where they will prepare foods unique to their ethnicities.\n\nThe historic launch of the programme, held at the Heritage Village in Harare, targeting Grades 5 to 7, which will be taken to all the countrys 10 provinces, comes at a time when most people had abandoned their mother languages and viewed them as inferior due to the effects of Westernisation.\n\nSome parents and guardians mistakenly thought that having children speaking mostly in English was a sign of affluence, yet doing so alienated children from their heritage, cultural norms and values.\n\nPart of the schoolchildren who attended the launch of Zviperengo cultural quiz programme by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa follow proceedings in Harare yesterday\n\nThe educative and well-subscribed programme included learners from affluent to high-density suburbs as the First Lady is not leaving anyone and any place behind.\n\nIt emerged at the launch of the programme that some parents and children did not know various traditional instruments, utensils, and figures of speech, reinforcing the importance of the First Ladys programme.\n\nAmai Mnangagwa, who has children at heart, has been on a nationwide campaign where she has been instilling good values and morals in todays youth.\n\nIn her address, Dr Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was home to many languages, each carrying its own unique history, stories and wisdom.\n\nThe languages, she said, included Shona, Nambiya, Ndebele, Tonga, Venda, Shangani, and Xhosa just to mention but a few.\n\nThese languages are the lifeblood of our culture. They are the threads that weave together, the fabric of our identity. I am pleased to announce that these competitions will be held in the depths prevalent in the regions of Zimbabwe depending on when the programme would be hosted. As I said, we shall go to all the 10 provinces and Harare you have been the first.\n\nOur children are also going to compete in a culinary showcase where they will prepare foods unique to their ethnicities. We shall cook and to those who have never cooked at home, you will prepare meals. This is a first-of-its-kind programme where our local languages are going to be showcased and examined on a national level. It is our duty as cultural custodians to ensure that these languages and the rich heritage they represent are not lost to time. We must pass them down to our children so that they may carry them forward with pride and honour, she said.\n\nProgrammes like Zviperengo, said Dr Mnangagwa, could help ignite a passion for learning and preserving the countrys cultural heritage in learners hearts.\n\nIn Zimbabwe we believe in the spirit of ubuntu. I am because we are this philosophy teaches us that our humanity is interconnected and that we thrive as a community when we support and uplift one another. The Zviperengo cultural quiz Programme embodies the spirit of ubuntu. It brings us together, fostering a sense of unity and belonging and reminding us that we are all part of a greater whole. As you participate in this programme, I encourage you to embrace the opportunity to learn about your heritage, celebrate the diversity of our nation, and take pride in your identity. Remember that you are the future of Zimbabwe and it is through your efforts that our culture will continue to flourish, she said.\n\nSchoolchildren follow proceedings during an interactive Zviperengo cultural quiz programme launched by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa in Harare yesterday\n\nThe First Lady enjoined people to work together to preserve languages, honour traditions, and build a brighter future for the country.\n\nThank you and may the spirit of ubuntu guide us all. I thank my children that today you have come to a new teacher. You have come with your teachers, but today I am your teacher. I love you, my children, you are the pride of our nation, you are the pride of our dignity, you are the pride whom we shall bequeath to the knowledge that we have. You are the pride that will carry our nation forward. Therefore, never look down upon yourselves.\n\nYou are important to my child. There is a lot that we expect from you. Through learning and being taught and through your character, the way you behave, not being involved in drugs, listening to parents, knowing who you are. You are a boy and what do you want to do? you are a girl and what would you want to be? You were not born to be a girl for the boys, you boys were not born to be a boy for the girls, she said.\n\nDr Mnangagwa said she sought to come up with a model boy and girl who would be the envy of the nation and the world at large.\n\nToday we want to mould you so that wherever you go, you will not forget this day. Wherever you go, we shall not be present as your parents and teachers so preserve the teachings you shall receive today. These are the teachings that will look after you even when you go to school outside the country. Going to learn abroad is a result of excelling, you do not just go. Firstly, you must study hard. If you are lucky to go abroad, you must know that you come from Zimbabwe and you must behave as a Zimbabwean. Nowadays my children, westernisation is there, all of us, I think you heard me speaking here, English is for seeking jobs wherever you would have gone. We are, however, leaving our language and latching on to English. But English did not tell us how we live. Even at home we had taken it too far, she said.\n\nThe mother of the nation said it was critical to support children in their quest to deepen their understanding of mother languages.\n\nParents and teachers here present, we hear at some schools you do not encourage the use of the mother tongue. Even if you go to a school headed by those who are good in English, you must learn and pass while at the same time you will be speaking your mother tongue like Shona and Ndebele. With all the dialects that we have in our nation. We want you to preserve our languages, she said.\n\nDr Mnangagwa gave a brief on how she started the programme.\n\nPatron of culture and heritage First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa shows and teaches schoolchildren about the various traditional utensils and their use such as winnowing basket, mortar and pestle among others in Harare yesterday.  Pictures: John Manzongo\n\nIn my Gota/Nhanga/ Ixhiba programmes I am meeting children showing that indeed they do not understand our culture like what you are supposed to do when you meet an elderly person. In my travels, I am noticing that you view the use of English as the uppermost thing and you then use English at the expense of your mother tongue. As an example, if a child goes to the village where the grandmother resides, the child will be using English yet the grandmother wont be understanding the language. If the children get into the kitchen hut, they will be sobbing because of smoke showing that you are a child who does not frequently visit the village. This has prompted me to bring you all together and hold competitions in Shona with a view to bringing back the use of our mother tongue and encouraging the use of all languages. Despite this, we have started with Shona because this is the most spoken language here in Harare province. This dovetails with the aim of the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education to mould children in line with the fortress of wisdom they refer to as the Heritage-based curriculum. The Ministry of Education aims that when children get into school, they must know where they came from, and understand the environment so that it sustains them as they make things from it. Do you know that our nation has a lot of wealth in the form of trees, rivers, animals, and minerals which you can use to make things that sustain you? Therefore, the Ministry of Education expects you to learn skills that will help you. This programme must mould you into a dignified person. These competitions are in three phases. The first phase is spellings where you are expected to spell words and be able to use them in sentences. The second phase encompasses zvirunga mutauro. You will be expected to share proverbs that are similar or different and explain their meanings. The last phase is nyaudzosingwi where you must explain these nyaudzosingwi and use them to complete sentences and use them in words. We shall also have idioms and similarities.\n\nThe First Lady asked what one says when they reach someones homestead and one of the learners said: Tisvikewo.\n\nAnother girl said Gogogoi.\n\nA boy left the crowd in stitches when he said: Unoti pachipamwe.\n\nAmai corrected him.\n\nWhat does pachipamwe mean, the First Lady asked and a Grade 5 girl said it means maswera sei?\n\nA Grade 6 boy said pachipamwe is used to someone you would have seen before, prompting the First Lady to clap hands for him.\n\nShe sought to know what a room for girls is called and the children all shouted Nhanga.\n\nWhat about the one for boys? she asked and they all shouted Gota.\n\nDr Mnangagwa sought to know the place where ash is discarded.\n\nA learner correctly said Durunhuru which was correct.\n\nWhat about mukadzi akafirwa nemurume? and the answer was shirikadzi.\n\nOn traditional utensils, Dr Mnangagwa asked about the three utensils used for cooking sadza and the learners said musika, mugoti, and poto.\n\nThe First Lady said the answer was partly correct but the word poto from pot was not Shona and the correct utensil was tsambakodzi.\n\nThe mother of the nation asked the learners to name tools that\n\nTo Page 4\n\nFirst Lady unveils first-of-its-kind cultural quiz programme\n\nFrom Page 2\n\nare used in cutting firewood and they all said an axe.\n\nBut my children, as Environment ambassador I do not want to see an axe close to trees, why is this so? the children said because such acts destroy the forests, depriving citizens of fruits and oxygen.\n\nShe also sought to know how nhopi is prepared.\n\nA Grade 5 learner said with potatoes, while another pointed at butternuts and another contributor pointed at pumpkins.\n\nA young girl left people in stitches when she said matemba were the young ones of fish.\n\nShe was, however, corrected by a fellow learner who said the young one of a fish was known as rereza in Shona.\n\nThe young one of a chameleon is called Mandishaya, they learnt.\n\nDr Mnangagwa expressed gratitude for the childrens competency.\n\nMy children you are doing well, but how do you then fail to apply this in your tests? What is the young one of a mouse, she asked.\n\nIn response, the children said Chiduwa.\n\nA learner said it was called a baby rat but the First Lady weighed in saying the young one of a mouse is called Manditeya.\n\nShe also sought to know the young one of a zebra and the girl correctly said Njenjeta, though she failed to spell it.\n\nAmai went on to ask spellings like nzvenzvana and hozhwa.\n\nThe First Lady asked the children more questions like Akubaira zani anenge akuita sei . . . akuyambira. Kufira mafufu segonzo kuita sei?\n\nThe learners said it means walking aimlessly, dying for useless things while the other said committing time to no avail.\n\nDr Mnangagwa also asked what the phrase Kumirira nemeso matsvuku means and the children said it means anger, but she said it means waiting in great anticipation.\n\nDr Mnangagwa had traditional foods and fruits and asked the children what these were and how they were prepared and or eaten.\n\nThere was food such as madora, dried vegetables, sorghum meal, traditional rice, round nuts, groundnuts, matemba, and multi-grain meal.\n\nShe also showcased a grinding stone, basket, winnowing basket, and different types of clay pots, wooden plates, drinking gourds, and reed mats.\n\nA young girl drew laughter when the First Lady showed a dengu and asked why it was and one girl said it was a basket.\n\nWhen an edge tool used in carpentry, mbezo, was lifted, some learners mistakenly referred to it as a hoe, while others said it was an axe.\n\nAmai corrected them.\n\nShe also brought traditional musical instruments like rattles, mbira and marimba.\n\nThe First Lady turned to parents and asked them cultural quiz whereupon some failed showing that even some parents lack knowledge of traditional goods.\n\nBack to students, the First Lady asked where a dog lived and some said in the danga while someone said in the house. These answers were, however, wrong.\n\nA teacher corrected the learners and said inogara mugudzururu.\n\nAnother teacher said a kennel in Shona is called Usamo.\n\nAmai then opened the floor for students to ask each other questions.\n\nThey asked from proverbs to idioms, figures of speech, and riddles as well as translating English words to Shona.\n\nDeputy Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Hon Angeline Gata thanked the First Lady for sharpening the childrens brains.\n\nThe programme that you unveiled today showed a gap that exists. You have opened the childrens brains. It also requires the effort of parents back home to strengthen what children have learnt here. You have moulded our children today Amai. This programme encourages children to have good manners and they shall excel in their studies because you have given them a deep lesson. Your vision carries the nation forward. This programme promotes our heritage like who we are. As the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, we thank you Amai, she said.\n\nTourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Barbara Rwodzi praised the First Lady for her educative and quality programmes.\n\nThe First Lady is the one who unveiled the Gota/Nhanga/Ixhiba Programme so that we return to our culture. Even some of us grown people were lost, but the First Lady taught us how to dress, and the food which nourishes us. boys and girls you are being taught so that you may be dignified people in the future. Amai is also the Tourism patron and for gastronomy tourism to be talked about in Africa, its all because of her. She is now the champion of gastronomy tourism in Africa. We want to thank Amai for launching this new programme and including competitions in culinary as part of the programme, she said.\n\n",

Instead, it is a result of the Air Force of Zimbabwes support for gender-mainstreaming consistency with Government of Zimbabwe policies.\n\nThe process began with implementing equal opportunities policies at recruitment and in the workplaces. The results have been evident in Air Force of Zimbabwe promotion and appointments as we have witnessed today where women such as Air Commodore Chiweshe have risen to decision-making positions, he said.\n\nThe Air Marshal rallied the entire community at Jason Ziyapapa Moyo Air Force Base to help the incoming base commander.\n\nMilitary tasks by their very nature can only be effectively achieved through teamwork. There is a commander at every control level in the military and attainment of the tasks assigned to the base requires that we all play our part to support the base commander.\n\nAir Marshal Nzvede also took time to warn officers against alcohol abuse and irresponsible gambling, two vices that have the potential to compromise security and discipline.\n\nOutgoing Commander Air Commodore Nyathi thanked the air base community for the harmony and experience acquired during his two-year tenure, applauding his wife for standing by him.\n\nAir Commodore Chiweshe applauded Air Marshal Nzvede for the recognition, adding that the decision raises hope for fellow female officers.\n\nI will work to the best of my abilities to ensure that the recognition is not put to waste. In taking over the base, I am aware of the calls for teamwork to attain all military tasks, she said.\n\nHer appointment has inspired fellow officers who applauded the Air Force leadership for the elevating a woman to the influential and powerful position.\n\nWarrant Class 1 Officer Memory Chivhinge, the bases veterinary officer, said Air Commodore Chiweshes appointment was an inspiration to women.\n\nWarrant Class 1 Officer Esma Madzima was also equally overjoyed by the appointment.\n\nWe feel honoured by the appointment of Air Commodore Chiweshe as the Commander of this base. This shows that ladies are capable of taking influential positions due to merit rather than gender stereotyping. As women, we are honoured and feel respected, she said.\n\n",

The peace deal was meant to bring ceasefire and normalisation of relations between Uganda and the DRC governments. It was signed in Luanda between then DRC President Joseph Kabila and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.\n\nThe Luanda Peace Deal became the standard or model for peace accords in Africa and is viewed favourably by outside entities, such as the United Nations and the European Union.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Luanda Peace Deal was meant to bring ceasefire and normalise relations between Uganda and DRC. Uganda accused DRC of hosting ADF, a rebel unity that had been attacking western Uganda from the 1990s into 2000s.\n\nDRC on the other had accused Uganda of using the pretext of fighting ADF by plundering its valuable natural resources.\n\nThe genesis of instability in the Congo and broadly in the Great Lakes region, dates back to colonial times when DRC was under the control of Belgium, Rwanda under Germans/Belgium, Uganda under Britain.\n\nThe colonial powers parcelled the territories without regard to existing African social and political settings.\n\nFamilies and whole tribes were separated and when independence came, the new African rulers decided to stick with the colonial boundaries.\n\nIn mapping out the Luanda Peace Deal, President Eduardo dos Santos was conscious of the fact that Uganda and DRC were brotherly countries whose relationship predates colonial conquest.\n\nThus Article 1 of the Agreement on Withdrawal of Ugandan troops specifically states that: The Government of Uganda commit itself to the continued withdrawal of its forces from the DRC in accordance with the Implementation Plan.\n\nThe Luanda Peace deal was hailed by regional and international experts as a ground-breaking deal that attempted to bring peace and security between two contending parties.\n\nFast forward to 2022, almost three decades after the 1994 Rwandan genocide and after what former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright described the Congo as being at the heart of Africas first world war, the Great Lakes region seem to have come full circle with the same neighbourly protagonists- Rwanda, Uganda and the DRC once again entangled in an attrition conflict.\n\nOnce again, SADC the regional bloc had to intervene in line with its Defence Mutual Pact which outlines a commitment to collective self-defence and regional peace and security.\n\nIt states that any armed attack against one member is considered a threat to regional peace.\n\nThis is the rationale behind the deployment of SADCs Mission in DRC (SAMIDRC), which was deployed on December 15, 2023.\n\nThe decision to deploy the force was made in May 2023 at the Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government in Windhoek, Namibia.\n\nRevival of the Luanda Road Map\n\nThe Luanda Peace Process was established as part of the 2022 Luanda Roadmap aimed at calming tensions between Rwanda and the DRC.\n\nOn November 23, 2022, a mini summit of heads of States and Governments on peace and Security in Eastern DRC was held in Luanda, Angola to address the conflict and insecurity in the eastern region of the DRC.\n\nIt was attended by the EAC chairperson- Burundian President Evariste Ndayishumiye, DRC President Felix Tshisekedi, Rwandan Minister of Foreign Affairs and Affairs of Rwanda, Vincent Biruta who was representing President Paul Kagame and former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta who is the facilitator appointed by the EAC for the implementation of the Nairobi process as well as a representative of the African Union and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR).\n\nEscalation of fighting from October 2023 between M23 and the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) temporarily stalled the peace process.\n\nThis time the DRC claimed that the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) was fighting alongside the M23 rebels while Rwanda accused the DRC of harbouring and supporting the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR)- A Hutu rebel movement whose composition include former Rwandan Army forces who fled to eastern Congo following the genocide.\n\nThe peace process was revived in early 2024 under the Angolan President Joao Lourencos mediation, and on July 30 2024, a permanent ceasefire was agreed between the two countries.\n\nThe Rubavu Agreement\n\nThe ceasefire was followed by meetings between the Rwandan and DRC foreign ministers that looked at the core triggers of the recurrent conflict.\n\nAnother productive meeting between the two countries intelligence service heads was held in Rubavu, Rwanda, on August 29 and 30, 2024 whose agreement revolved around: neutralising the FDLR, withdrawal of Rwanda forces from the DRC territory, and possibly involving Rwandas forces in the military operation against the FDLR.\n\nAn ad hoc mechanism composed of three Rwandan, three Congolese and 18 Angolan military officers led by Angolan Lieutenant-General Joao Nassone was set up.\n\nDisagreements remain on how to implement the Rubavu agreement, as the DRC insists that the nuetralisation of the FDLR accompanies the withdrawal of Rwandan Forces.\n\nDespite the recent escalation of violence instigated by M23, both the EAC and the SADC still believe the Luanda Peace Deal is the best foot forward in bringing lasting peace to the DRC. Angolan President Lourenco is highly regarded by both Rwanda and DRC.\n\nIt is not surprising that the EAC chose him to mediate given the fact that he is the African Union Champion of Peace and Reconciliation in Africa and is designated to maintain dialogue between the DRC and Rwanda.\n\nBoth SADC and EAC are keen on reviving the Luanda Peace Process, which in November last year managed to facilitate the signing of a peace deal between DRC and Rwanda.\n\nThe Angola-brokered peace deal brought fragile truce that stabilised the situation until the recent incursions of the M23 which took over Goma in a development that has led to deaths of both civilians and military personal and displaced thousands of people.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe way forward in bringing lasting peace in the DRC lie in the communiqu released by the recent SADC Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government held in Harare on January 31, 2024.\n\nThe summit reiterated its support to the diplomatic efforts to secure peaceful resolution to the conflict in the eastern DRC through the Luanda Process, led by President Joao Lourenco of Angola and the African Champion for Peace and Reconciliation in Africa and the Nairobi Process, led by former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta.\n\nThe summit also called for the immediate dispatch of Defence Ministers, chiefs of defence and troop contributing countries to DRC to ensure that the SAMIDRC troops are safe and ensure immediate repatriation of the deceased troops and those injured.\n\nMore fundamental was the call to have a joint SADC and EAC summit and the mandate for the SADC Organ Troika on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation, to engage all state and non-state parties to the conflict on a ceasefire process to protect lives and facilitate a smooth flow of humanitarian support to people and communities affected by the armed conflict.\n\nIt is now left to the secretariats of both SADC and EAC to work out the logistics in terms of dates and venue for the joint summit of the two regional blocs.\n\nGiven the urgency of the matter, it will not be long before such a meeting is convened.\n\n",

Remember the MSU Law School has been number one in Africa. The school is also being constructed in recognition of the contribution of President Mnangagwa in the development of the legal system in the country, he said.\n\nDr Manyatera said the modern infrastructure will have everything one could expect in a law school. MSU already has campuses in Gweru, Zvishavane, and Harare with the Faculty of Law set for Kwekwe.\n\nWe expect to move staff and students by August. This was a forest but its being developed. Structures have emerged from a former forest and we are at 65 percent completion of the main building, which has four expansions or sections, he said.\n\nExpansion 1 is ready for roofing. Actually, we have Masvingo Polytechnic engineers working on roofing the first expansion. Then Treasury has also been releasing funds and we are happy with the trajectory that is being taken, he said.\n\nDr Manyatera said there were 300 workers on site who are working tirelessly to make sure the project meets the deadline for opening.\n\nWe want to move the Masters programme here. We will also offer short courses in the next two to three years, he said.\n\nKwekwe City Council mayor Councillor Albert Zinhanga said when the law school becomes operational, the local authority is going to benefit in terms of increased revenue from rates, water and sewer charges.\n\nHe said the campus will also attract other businesses much to the benefit of the local authority.\n\nAs Kwekwe we are very happy that this development will boost our GDP, said Clr Zinhanga.\n\nThe university has adopted a multi-campus philosophy that has seen it being in Gweru, Zvishavane, Harare and Bulawayo hence operationalising Heritage-based Education 5.0 model.\n\n",

Cotton and sunflower are smallholder crops and can be engines for transformation of communities. Government is currently a facilitator and actor in the cotton value chain, but when the sector is fully established it ceases the actor role and focusses on facilitation, he said then.\n\nThe Government is spearheading the adoption of resilient and economically viable crops through targeted policies and incentives, with farmers in agro-ecological regions 4 and 5 mandated to produce traditional grains, oil seeds and livestock feed.\n\nThese initiatives are crucial in mitigating the effects of erratic weather patterns while ensuring national food, nutrition and oilseed security for the country.\n\n",
