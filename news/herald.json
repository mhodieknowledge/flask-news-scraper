Rusike, however, missed the conversion in front of the posts.\n\nIn the 29th minute, Kunaka played the ball on the ground for a penalty. The visitors opted to tap and managed to score a try which was successfully converted under the posts to take a two-point lead.\n\nRusike comfortably converted a Junior Sables penalty to reclaim their lead.\n\nThe lead was short lived as poor decision making from the hosts cost them. The Outback Barbarians scored their third try and successfully converted.\n\nTwo minutes before half time, the Outback Barbarians flyhalf missed a penalty after they had decided to go for posts.\n\nA minute later, Shammah Jackson made a brilliant interception and run to score the Junior Sables third try. However Rusike missed the conversion with the last kick of the first half.\n\nThe Barbarians scored their fourth try in the 55th minute which was successfully converted once again to make it 20-28.\n\nImpact player, Ethan Chiponda scored a brilliant try from a drop kick in the 60th minute whose conversion, was however, missed by Phillip Chimhaka.\n\nThe miss, which would have leveled the score left Zimbabwe trailing 25-28.\n\nFive minutes later, Chimhaka went on to score a brilliantly worked out try which Tatenda Kambvumbi successfully converted to make it 32-28 in favour of the Junior Sables.\n\nIn the 69th minute, Outback Barbarians scored another try but missed the conversion to make it 32-33.\n\nIn 77th minute, Zimbabwe missed a penalty, but a minute later Tafara Dewa scored a try that sealed the game for the hosts. It was successfully converted by Rusike to make it 39-33.\n\n",
