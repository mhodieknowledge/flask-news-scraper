            "content": "The Auditor General of South Africa (AGSA) has given power utility Eskom another qualified audit for the 2023/24 financial year, raising the alarm over the groups financial viability amid rising municipal debt.\n\nWhile the AGSA said that the company remains a going concern, this is purely dependent on continued government debt support and the utilitys ability to resolve its most pressing financial crisis: municipal debt.\n\nPresenting the audit outcomes on Wednesday, the AGSA noted that Eskoms overall audit position had deteriorated in 2023/24 compared to the year prior, with an improvement in only one area and a decline in three others.\n\nThe improved area was generation and improved plant operations. However, the audit reported noted that this was off a low base, and still not in line with the expectations set by government in the National Development Plan.\n\nMore concerning, however, were the declines in distribution, finances and oversight.\n\nThe AGSA said that Eskom continued to submit statements for audit that contained material misstatements. It identified significant control deficiencies, a breakdown of controls related to compliance with laws and regulations, and inadequate action taken against those who contravened them.\n\nFailure to implement consequence management encourages a culture where the disregard for legislation, policies and procedures thrives.\n\nThe commitments made over the years by those charged with governance to address these matters have not materialised due to a lack of accountability at various levels in the organisation, inadequate oversight and monitoring processes and ineffective consequence management, it said.\n\nThe AGSA said that part of its mandate is determining whether it is appropriate for auditees to use the going concern basis of accounting when preparing financial statements and to flag material risks to their ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nWhile Eskom is a going concern in relation to its 2023/24 financial statements, the auditor said that the utilitys various dependencies and internal and external uncertainties could impact this status going forward.\n\nThe group has reported operating losses of R57 billion, and its current liabilities exceed its assets by R50 billion, it said.\n\nThe utility said it hopes to return to profitability in 2025.\n\nThe utility remains highly dependent on the national government for support on its debt-reliant liquidity position, and there is no certainty on price rulings from energy regulator Nersa, nor on what will be done about the mountain of municipal debt that is accruing.\n\nMeanwhile, the group also has to contend with significant electricity losses from theft, illegal connections, vandalism, ghost vending and illicit tokes, which ramp up Eskoms cost to produce electricity.\n\nThe going concern assumption remains fully dependent on the ongoing positive and incremental impact of the generation recovery programme, the AGSA said.\n\nHiking prices wont help\n\nAccording to the AGSA, Eskom has very limited options in addressing its financial challenges. It has to cut cost and raise more revenue  but both paths are not looking good for the utility.\n\nEskom has targetted cost savings of around R10 billion over the next two years (R5 billion each in 2024/25 and 2025/26).\n\nHowever, the AGSA said that current and historical audits have found that Eskom simply does not have the appropriate systems, processes and controls to quantify irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure, nor recover the losses due to criminal conduct.\n\nTherefore, the targeted savings will not be impactful or sustainable for as long as there is still a culture of non-compliance and continued struggle with (this spending), it said.\n\nThe alternative  to increase revenue through a path to cost-reflective tariffs is the next option. But, again, the AGSA said that this path is unlikely to work without a massive policy shift and significant interventions. Business Tech\n\n",

It addresses 12 key areas, she said.\n\nThe HeForShe solidarity march is a significant initiative that highlights the crucial involvement of men in our shared efforts to attain gender equality and eliminate gender-based violence (GBV). GBV is a widespread problem that demands the active participation of everyone, especially men and boys, she said.\n\nThe minister urged stakeholders to join hands in eradicating gender inequality.\n\nTogether, we must challenge societal norms that perpetuate violence and create environments where women and girls can navigate public spaces with confidence and dignity, free from fear.\n\nWhile the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence is celebrated each year from November 25 to December 10, conducting this initiative today reflects our understanding that the fight against GBV is not confined to a specific timeframe, she said.\n\nThe minister stressed that in 2021, the Government of Zimbabwe committed to ending GBV by officially launching the first-ever High-Level Political Compact (HLPC) on Ending Gender-Based Violence and Harmful Practices (2021-2030).\n\nThe incoming #HeForShe co-chair, Canadian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Adler Aristide said they are committed to providing more support for the advancement of gender equality in Zimbabwe.\n\nI see it as an opportunity for me to commit to promoting gender equality in all spaces, both physical and online, that I have access to by virtue of my position as the Ambassador of Canada, he said.\n\n",
