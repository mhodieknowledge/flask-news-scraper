His Excellency, the President and First Secretary of Zanu PF, Cde. Dr. E.D Mnangagwa, has conferred national hero status on the late Cde Maj Gen (Rtd) Solomon Siziba, who died on the 15th of January 2025.\n\nMourners are gathered at 527 Bulawayo Drive, Killarney, Bulawayo. The late Maj Gen (Rtd) Siziba will be interred at the National Heroes Acre in Harare at a date to be announced. I shall be most grateful if you would make the usual arrangements for his burial and payment of benefits to his family, said Minister Ncube\n\nShe described Maj-Gen Sizibas death as a great loss, saying her office had started initiating processes consistent with the handling of a funeral of a national hero.\n\nMajor-General (Retired) Solomon Siziba\n\nMaj-Gen Sizibas brother, Mr Leonard Siziba, expressed gratitude to the President for declaring his brother a national hero.\n\nThe status, he said, was befitting for a man who served the country since his childhood as a learner at Manama High School, where he and other learners joined the armed struggle.\n\nWe want to thank His Excellency, the President, for declaring my brother a national hero. We also want to thank the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for delivering the message to the family. My brother joined the armed struggle when he, together with other learners from Manama, left school and crossed into Botswana.\n\nHe did his primary level at Nhwali Primary School and proceeded to Manama High School in 1976, where he started his Form One.\n\nHe was part of the group that joined the armed struggle from Manama Mission in 1977. He did his military training in Zambia, and during the ceasefire, he was attested into the Zimbabwe National Army. He was stationed at the Zimbabwe Military Academy, where he rose to the rank of Captain. He was then transferred to the ZNA, where he worked until 2005, rising to the position of Lieutenant-Colonel. He was posted to Botswana as Defence Attach from 2005 to 2013, stationed at the Zimbabwean Embassy, he said.\n\nUpon his return to Zimbabwe in 2013, Rtd Maj-Gen Siziba was appointed Deputy Commander of One Brigade and had been elevated to the rank of Colonel.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2018, he was appointed Director of Administration at the National Prosecuting Authority.\n\nMaj-Gen Siziba returned to the ZNA in 2018 and was elevated to the rank of Brigadier-General and was assigned to the Brigadier-General Inspectorate position, a post he held until he retired from the military last year. He was elevated to the position of Maj-Gen upon his retirement.\n\nThe brother said Maj-Gen Siziba had become a father figure in the family. The Government has already taken over the funeral processes, including the provision of meals, tents, and other necessities.\n\nMaj-Gen Sizibas body is expectedto arrive in Bulawayo today and will be received at HQ One Brigade Barracks (Mzilikazi Barracks). After that, it will be taken to Doves Funeral Parlour. Tomorrow, a send-off funeral service will be held at his rural home in Nhwali, Gwanda, Matabeleland South.\n\nMatabeleland South Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Dr Evelyn Ndlovu, service chiefs, and other senior government officials were among the mourners at the familys residence.\n\nCde Chimutengwende died on Thursday and was declared a national hero last night.\n\nZanu PF National Political Commissar Cde Munyaradzi Machacha delivered the message to the family at their Milton Park, Harare, home.\n\nCde Machacha was accompanied to the Chimutengwende family home by Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Minister Kazembe Kazembe, who is also the Zanu PF Mashonaland Central provincial chairman.\n\nEarlier in the day, Zanu PF National Chairman and Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri had told the media that Mashonaland Central province had written to the national leadership requesting national hero status for Cde Chimutengwende.\n\nShe described Cde Chimutengwende as a strong member of the ruling party Zanu PF, who played a major role before and after independence.\n\nHe was a principled person who persevered and was consistent and these are some of those values that we consider (when declaring one a national hero), Cde Muchinguri-Kashiri said.\n\nCde Chimutengwende served as a Government Minister, Member of Parliament for Mazowe and a Politburo member.\n\nHe succumbed to chronic kidney disease.\n\nBorn on August 28, 1943, Cde Chimutengwende first became a Zanu PF Member of Parliament in 1985 in Mazowe, and served as a legislator for over 25 years.\n\nHe also served for 14 years as a Cabinet Minister.\n\nCde Chimutengwende served as Senator and Deputy President of the Senate, Member of the Pan-African Parliament (PAP) and Head of the Zimbabwe delegation to the PAP.\n\nHe earned a Masters degree in Social Science and a PhD from the University of Bradford in the UK.\n\n",

The Government has prioritised projects in energy, transport, and water supply to create a conducive environment for economic activities.\n\nKey initiatives include the expansion of the Hwange Thermal Power Station, which is expected to enhance electricity supply reliability, and the Beitbridge Border Post modernisation to facilitate trade.\n\nAdditionally, investments in irrigation systems are poised to mitigate the impact of erratic rainfall on agriculture. These infrastructure upgrades are not only expected to support immediate economic recovery but also lay the groundwork for sustained growth in the coming years.\n\nEconomist Gladys Shumbambiri-Mutsopotsi said the mining sector is a pivotal contributor to Zimbabwes economic resurgence.\n\nShe noted the sectors resilience amid global commodity price fluctuations and local operational challenges, emphasising its steady expansion.\n\nMs Shumbambiri-Mutsopotsi also highlighted the importance of electricity generation, which saw a 22 percent growth, in supporting industrial activities and boosting investor confidence.\n\nThe tourism sector is also poised for a rebound, driven by a resurgence in international travel as global economies recover from stagnation.\n\nAs more countries emerge from economic stagnation, international travel is set to rebound, benefitting nations like Zimbabwe with untapped tourism potential.\n\nHowever, the World Bank cautions that commodity exporters like Zimbabwe face risks from potential economic slowdowns in major markets such as China, which could adversely affect demand for minerals and metals.\n\nDespite these potential challenges, Zimbabwes diversified economic strategy, focusing on revitalising agriculture, bolstering mining activities, and rejuvenating tourism, positions the country favourably for sustained growth.\n\nThe anticipated economic expansion in 2025 and 2026 not only signals a robust recovery from recent adversities but also sets the stage for Zimbabwe to outpace its regional counterparts in economic performance.\n\n",

Among others, the empowerment programmes which primarily targeted the vulnerable in our society including elderly women, widows, orphans, and those with disabilities among others, the empowerment programmes have benefited more than 5000 households in 2024 alone.\n\nUnder the flagship Agric4SHE initiative, a wide range of support schemes which were recently rolled out in Manicaland include Pfumvudza4SHE initiative where thousands of elderly women were generously provided with agricultural inputs which enabled them to establish 3 000 maize plots, particularly in Honde Valley of Mutasa district, he said.\n\nCourtesy of extension support from experts, Adv Mugadza said the beneficiaries have produced a very healthy maize crop that is predominantly at the vegetative phase.\n\nThe beneficiary households are certainly guaranteed bumper harvests and household food security post the 2025 summer season harvest. The Fisheries4She initiative was received by beneficiary farmers given that Manicaland is one of the fastest-growing aquaculture farming enterprises in the country due to its abundant water resources. More than 10 000 fish fingerlings were recently distributed to already trained women farmers resulting in a project success rate of more than 90 percent, he said.\n\nThe fish, Adv Mugadza said, is now at the juvenile stage and these will tremendously improve nutrition status at the household level whilst also generating income for the previously marginalised women beneficiaries.\n\nThe Horticulture4SHE, he said, had also been widely welcomed.\n\nManicaland is a household player in the horticulture agriculture sub-sector due to its enabling climatic conditions. The introduction of the Horticulture4SHE initiative by Her Excellency, the First Lady, was, therefore, received with unparalleled enthusiasm by beneficiary communities. Hundreds of households were given vegetable combo packs and banana suckers for planting in their gardens and fields.\n\nIt is imperative to highlight that the resultant banana plots are thriving and this will see thousands more farmers also receiving planting material under a prudently managed pass-on arrangement, Adv Mugadza said.\n\nHe said more women also benefited from the Poultry4SHE programme.\n\nThe Poultry4SHE initiative was enthusiastically received by more than 1000 women who have since creatively established several groups for the purpose of facilitating a pass-on mechanism. It is, therefore, anticipated that the initiative will see thousands of households ultimately benefiting from it through improved motivation, security and enhanced income from the sale of chickens within their communities, the minister said.\n\nAdv Mugadza gave the First Lady plaudits for implementing the Widows Empowerment scheme in his province.\n\nThe Manicaland Widows empowerment initiative is one of the most successful schemes introduced by Her Excellency, the First Lady. The beneficiary widows have since established thriving grocery shops at Murambinda growth point in Buhera.\n\nEstablished in 2024, the business has since grown by more than 20 percent and has significantly helped in stabilising maize meal prices at the growth point given the shops commendable practice of selling the product at highly reasonable prices. Indeed, the initiatives by Her Excellency, the First Lady, have evidently registered a transformative impact in the lives of vulnerable members of the Manicaland community across the province, he said.\n\nIt is anticipated that the First Ladys empowerment initiatives will have a multiplier effect in the province, thereby significantly contributing towards the achievement of Vision 2030.\n\nOn behalf of the people of Manicaland Province and indeed on my own behalf, let me express our collective appreciation to Her Excellency, the First Lady of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Dr A Mnangagwa for all these life-changing empowerment initiatives whose effect is already being felt across the province, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "AS the local Premier Soccer League clubs re-group in their various camps to prepare for the 2025 season, excitement and anxiety is brewing among the games stakeholders and even neutrals.\n\nThe refreshing excitement has been brought about by the arrival of big-spending newboys Scottland Football Club.\n\nAlthough they might not be the first Premiership new kids on the block to spend big, there is a greater element of swag and a different approach that Scottland are bringing into Zimbabwean football.\n\nThey arrive in the PSL as the first club in the history of the elite league to own their own ambulance, a key asset in the welfare of athletes, in this case players welfare.\n\nThe biggest carrot they have dangled for players is their ability to pay hefty salaries and to ensure that their biggest assets, the players and their coach, are well-motivated.\n\nOften-times there has been talk in Zimbabwean football circles that the game needs to be commercialised.\n\nHowever, we have noted with concern that the so-called commercialisation of domestic football has largely been lip-service.\n\nBut when you get a club arriving on the stage and paying Khama Billiat well enough for the former Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs talisman to feel comfortable, then that can only up the standards of the game in the country.\n\nIn the last two seasons, we have seen how businessman Simba Ndoro has transformed the face of football in Mashonaland Central province and in the mining town of Shamva in particular.\n\nNdoros investment in Simba Bhora, which included refurbishment of Wadzanai stadium in Shamva, helped bring the Premiership to the mining town, to the benefit of surrounding areas like Madziwa and Murehwa.\n\nSimilarly, Scottland are not only restricting themselves to ensuring their players who include Ronald Pfumbidzai, Lynoth Chikuhwa, Walter Musona and Lincoln Zvasiya, will be looked after well.\n\nScottland owner Pedzai Scott Sakupwanya has told this publication a number of times that he wants his football project to also help build communities in Mabvuku and Tafara, which is the constituency that he represents in Parliament.\n\nThe businessman and legislator has embarked on an audacious project to turn a ground in his township Mabvuku into a world class stadium.\n\nIt would be easy for the narrow-eyed to dismiss Scottland and Simba Bhora as either flamboyant or mere big spenders.\n\nThe wider-eyed would however, welcome anyone investing hugely into local football. The arrival of such teams like Scottland and Simba Bhora means the local Premiership will be able to retain some of its best players.\n\nMaybe, now that we have actors in the elite league like Simba Bhora and Scottland, we could in the 2025 season and beyond see prolific strikers who can break the late Norman Marotos record of 22 goals.\n\nThe late Maroto, who featured for Dynamos, Buymore and Gunners, achieved the 22-goal feat in 2010 when leading the line for the now defunct Gunners.\n\nSince then, local football has struggled to retain top players including strikers as anyone who showed glimpses of talent was snapped up by clubs in South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique and Tanzania.\n\nThus, we believe that the more big-spending clubs we have in our Premiership, the healthier our football will become.\n\nThe development will no doubt push up the standards and that is why we applaud the emergence of such clubs at any given time.\n\nIn the era of Blackpool, competition became stiffer in the PSL and that Dynamos needed a superior goal difference to pip them for the 1995 title, spoke volumes of the impact that the team they called Ndochi had on the league.\n\nAmaZulu also positively impacted on the competitiveness of the national game as did FC Platinum who would go on to become the first team from outside Harare and Bulawayo to win the league title in more than five decades.\n\nThat FC Platinum became a dominant force for four seasons and knocking Dynamos, Highlanders and CAPS United off the perch, is stuff that can make Zimbabwean football healthier.\n\nWhile Dynamos, Highlanders and CAPS United remain the traditional giants, they will be the first to acknowledge that their dominance, just like Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates in South Africa, has now been confined more to the annals of history.\n\nIn South Africa, Mamelodi Sundowns arrived with a culture of free-spending to get the best talent and the results have been there for all to see.\n\nWe believe that the clubs with fatter cheque books, often called moneybags in our football, should in fact, be encouraged to retain their investment in the game and even set up commercial structures for sustainability.\n\nWith world football governing body FIFA introducing Club Licensing regulations aimed at enhancing governance of the sport in an environment that is increasingly becoming commercial, our PSL needs to ride on the emergence of more moneybags.\n\nThere is also a need for more company-owned teams to help the PSL up the ante.\n\nMoney traditionally follows where there is money and for Zimbabwean football to evolve into the megabucks industry that we all yearn for; it must start with the PSL clubs being able to pay well and attract the best talent from within and outside the countrys borders.\n\nIf at the start of every season there is a club in the mould of Scottland, Simba Bhora, FC Platinum, Ngezi Platinum and GreenFuel, who have financial stability, the PSL will rank among the top leagues in Africa.\n\nAnd that will result in the national teams having a healthy balance of local and foreign-based talent that is able to compete with the best.\n\nSouth Africas Bafana Bafana are already benefitting from the fact that their top clubs have invested heavily in players and thus can draw their squad from their domestic league.\n\nWe hope and pray there will be more money bags in the PSL to stimulate more competition and more crowds at local games.\n\n",

            "content": "Yeukai Karengezeka, Court Correspondent\n\nTHE Judicial Service Commission (JSC) yesterday swore in 15 magistrates at the Harare Magistrates Court as part of efforts to strengthen the countrys justice delivery system.\n\nThe Chief Magistrate, Mrs Vongai Guwuriro, presided over the ceremony, which saw the induction of 12 women and three men into the judiciary.\n\nThe new magistrates are: Bentone Matope, Blessing Makaripe, Blessing Shumba, Daphne Maruta, Gillian Padzakashamba, Lawrence Mubvumbi, Marvellous Joma, Moreblessing Mahaso, Nyasha Mangezi, Nyengeterai Bushu, Rufaro Musiiwa, Samantha Ruponga, Samukelisiwe Mpande, Tariro Hove, and Tendai Nyagura.\n\nThis development comes as the JSC intensifies efforts to improve the efficiency and accessibility of the justice system for all citizens.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Chief Magistrate Guwuriro explained the importance of fast-track courts, which she described as a game changer in ensuring timely justice delivery.\n\nThe fast-track courts will be fully functional at all stations dealing with all types of cases.\n\nWe are going to be working together in collaboration with other stakeholders. From the police, a matter can enter straight into a fast-track court, allowing witnesses to testify promptly and return to their normal lives. A person must come to court only when their evidence is required, she said.\n\nMrs Guwuriro further revealed that fast-track courts, which had previously operated on a limited scale, would now be established at all court stations across the country.\n\nPreviously, this type of court system was primarily used to handle sexual offences in regional courts. Now, it will cover a broader range of cases, she added.\n\nTo match the growing demand for justice services, the chief magistrate noted that the JSC had expanded its magistrates pool and opened new court stations.\n\nHarare has been split into two provinces, resulting in the establishment of two additional functional courts: Chinhamora and Beatrice courts. These new appointments will help staff these stations and reduce the backlog of cases, Mrs Guwuriro said.\n\nThe recruitment of additional magistrates is expected to improve access to justice, reduce case backlogs, and enhance the overall efficiency of the judicial system.\n\n",

            "content": "Freeman Razemba, Senior Reporter\n\nMORE than 100 people in Harare have fallen victim to suspected fraudsters masquerading as distributors of drivers licence discs.\n\nThese alleged scammers have been sending fake text messages, soliciting payments from unsuspecting individuals in exchange for drivers licences.\n\nThe fraudsters direct victims to the Vehicle Inspectorate Department (VID) offices in Eastlea, demanding a fee before vanishing. Investigations indicate that the scammers typically charge US$50.\n\nIn a statement, the Civil Vehicle Registry (CVR) Department Registrar Mr Saston Muzenda confirmed such cases.\n\nIt has come to the attention of the Central Vehicle Registry (CVR) that a fraudster with the following Econet numbers  0779 171 199 and 0783 123 505  is sending text messages to prospective drivers advising them that their drivers licences are ready for collection.\n\nHe interchanges the following names Mr Moyo, Mr Sibanda, Mr Nkomo or Mr Dube from VID Eastlea. Once the victims arrive in Harare, he directs them to deposit US$ 50 into either OneMoney or EcoCash account, whose details are 0715 107 676 or 0715 107 468 Ecocash 0786 721 613, he said.\n\nMr Muzenda said once the money is deposited, the suspect then blocks the victims.\n\nHe urged the public to be vigilant and report such incidents to the nearest police station.\n\nSecondly, do not deposit any money into an account provided by a stranger. Report to the nearest police station if you are texted by any of the above listed numbers to help the Zimbabwe Republic Police apprehend the fraudsters, Mr Muzenda said.\n\nIn June 2023, Government gazetted new regulations over the recently launched new standard plastic drivers licence linked to a database that will replace the metal licences and has reset the classes of licence, split both the bus and heavy truck classes and added in a sub-class for tri-bikes and quad bikes.\n\nThis followed the gazetting of new regulations, Statutory Instrument 119 of 2023 under the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 2023, by the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development Felix Mhona.\n\nThe new Zimbabwean licence is scannable and meets standards of SADC, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the East African Community. In the region, South Africa and some other countries already use plastic licences also known as plastic polymer licences.\n\nAt present, those who pass the Zimbabwe driving tests at VID depots countrywide are immediately issued with a temporary paper licence before obtaining the metal licence a few months later.\n\nOne of the advantages of the new plastic licences is that they will be printed instantly and have security features that will make them difficult to forge, as well as being scannable so checks can immediately confirm the authenticity and reveal any legal issues.\n\nThe new standard plastic drivers licence launched in Harare in 2023 to replace the metal licences will clear a backlog of approximately 600 000 applicants who were waiting for their drivers licences to be printed and issued since 2019.\n\nThe backlog was created by the use of obsolete equipment at the Central Vehicle Registry (CVR), as well as a shortage of materials to produce the costly metal discs.\n\nDrivers will now be able to receive their licence within seven to 10 days from the day they pass their tests and will pay US$5, or the equivalent at the official exchange rate on the day of payment, for the disc. An online booking platform is available for applicants to make appointments for the capture of biometric details.\n\n",
