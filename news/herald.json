Candidates should declare that they have not been convicted of any offense. The answer that we wanted from that nomination form is a yes or a no. If its a yes, then you include a bit of notes to at least explain what offences you were convicted of, said Sanyamandwe.The code will guide us but we also need to be guided by Art: 24 Para 8 of the ZIFA statutesSo we will look into those offences and also in our criminal jurisprudence, we know there are minor and major offences, surely a road traffic accident will not stop someone from running for the election. So the ethics committee will assist us in completing that eligibility test or interpreting the ethics code.Other ZIFA presidential aspirants include Nqobile Magwizi, Themba Mliswa, Benjani Mwaruwari, Makwinji Soma-Phiri, Twine Phiri, Martial Gore and Farai Jere.\n\n",
