Picture: OPC\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the facilitation of more opportunities and windows of support such as low-interest financing, business development services, transfer of skills and technologies as well as market access for the sector, will be availed.\n\nHe directed all partners to the Mbare Musika Traders Market and future projects to ensure that levies and rentals are pegged at competitive and affordable levels.\n\nOccupants and customers of the markets were also called upon to be responsible custodians of the modern facilities.\n\nThe President called for collaborative synergies between SMEs and relevant ministries, departments and agencies, saying such collaboration was important towards the formalisation of small businesses and start-ups.\n\nAs we continue to diversify our economy, the formalisation of this sector must never be viewed as a direct threat to the survival and sustainability of your respective businesses.\n\nOn its part, my Government will continue to improve the ease of doing business, through reducing barriers to entry, as well as streamlining business registration, licencing and compliance levies.\n\nDialogue with the SMEs sector is an essential building block for enhanced business productivity. There should not be a them and us mentality, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe added that the Government and SMEs sector must act as one for the good of the country.\n\nThe Ministry of SMEs was challenged to deploy innovative initiatives that will see more SMEs becoming fully fledged business entities with footprints beyond Zimbabwe and the SADC region.\n\nGovernment is determined to see the realisation of the Urban Transformation Agenda designed to primarily focus on addressing rapid urbanisation by prioritising safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable cities and human settlements, in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Number 11.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said Phase 2 of the New Mbare Musika is designed to be a multi-storey complex with improved sanitation, fire safety features and organised trading spaces, thus resonating with Vision 2030 and the SDGs.\n\nHe applauded Masimba Construction and Mkambo Misika Hubs, whopartnered the Government in the project, for their professionalism and work ethic, which have ensured the completion of Phase 1 of the market.\n\nEarlier on, President Mnangagwa commended Mbare residents for their consistent support of Zanu PF that saw the revolutionary party winning in that constituency in the 2023 harmonised elections.\n\nBe assured that the interests of the people of our great motherland, Zimbabwe, remain at the core of my Administration. Two weeks ago, I was pleased to receive, at State House, representatives of Vendors and Tuckshops Associations from across the country.\n\nThat engagement, among many others I have had in the recent past, gave me general insights into matters that concern you and the broader Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises sector. Government is seized with facilitating an environment where your businesses can thrive for an improved standard of living for all, he said.\n\nDefence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri said the construction of the market resonated with President Mnangagwas national vision spelt out in the National Development Strategy 1 and Governments ultimate goal of elevating Zimbabweans to a prosperous and empowered upper-middle-income society by 2030.\n\nThis bustling market has been a cornerstone of Zimbabwes SMEs and a vital source of livelihood for traders and their families.\n\nThis initiative has not only restored the markets infrastructure but also upgraded it to a cutting-edge facility, demonstrating Governments commitment to creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, she said.\n\nLocal Government and Public Works Minister, Daniel Garwe, said the commissioning of the market was a precursor to the second phase of another market to accommodate more people.\n\nThis event also marks the ground-breaking ceremony of the main market, which is going to accommodate 10 000 traders, he said.\n\nMinister Garwe said following the fire disaster that destroyed stock and stalls, President Mnangagwa directed the engagement of domestic investor, Masimba Holdings, in terms of the urban transformation policy to undertake reconstruction works.\n\nThe infrastructure, as you have witnessed, Your Excellency, is augmented by social amenities such as banks, Zimbabwe Republic Police Post, advanced security services, CCTV, advanced ablution facilities, advanced fire suppression systems, and availability of water infrastructure, among others, he said.\n\nWomen Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Minister, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa, said the new market was set to transform the SMEs sector that has been looked down upon over the years.\n\nMinister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Harare Metropolitan, Charles Tawengwa, commended President Mnangagwa for restoring the livelihood of traders following the fire outbreak.\n\nYesterdays event was attended by Cabinet Ministers, permanent secretaries, Harare City councillors, captains of industry, Zanu PF leadership, and traders, among others.\n\n",

However, even excluded activities may come within the scope of monitoring against money laundering if the activities are carried on by any high-risk entity.\n\nClause Six repeals the existing section of the principal Act requiring the registration of a PVO and replaces it with a more comprehensive provision that brings within the scope of registration certain trusts that were previously excluded from registration.\n\nIt requires organisations not previously within the scope of the PVO Act to now register as PVOs, but in these cases, time will be given for compliance.\n\nThis means those organisations not registered as trusts, but which receive external funding to pursue objects of a charitable nature, such organisations will be afforded a reasonable period to comply with the Act.\n\n",
