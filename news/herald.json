None, but us the SADC citizens will build and transform our region.\n\nThe SADC Chair said although the region remains largely harmonious, the Eastern DRC security situation needs to be effectively and decisively dealt with.\n\nIf peace is not brought in the DRC, added President Mnangagwa, the crisis in that country would weaken the regions aspirations towards collective growth and prosperity.\n\nSADC remains a relatively calm and peaceful region. For this, we are proud. However, I reiterate our call for lasting peace in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe situation in Eastern DRC undermines the aspirations bequeathed to us by our founding fathers and outlined in the SADC Constitutive Act and Vision 2050.\n\nThe time to silence the guns, de-escalate tensions and hostilities as well as to engage in dialogue to secure mediated outcomes for long-lasting peace in DRC is now, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa urged the region to remain vigilant and alert to the emerging challenges that threaten its hard-won independence and general stability.\n\nHe also singled out the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, which remains under Moroccan influence.\n\nWe must continue to stand in solidarity against the imposition of illegal sanctions, use of coercive measures and/or any other actions that undermine our sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nOn this historic day, we also remember our brothers and sisters in the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, who are still being denied the right to determine their own destiny.\n\nAfrica will not be free until the Western Sahara is liberated, free, and independent, he said.\n\nOn the climate change-induced phenomena, President Mnangagwa said it is our collective responsibility to take decisive action to mitigate and manage the effects of these natural disasters.\n\nMany parts of the SADC region and indeed the world, are being ravaged by climate change.\n\nThousands of lives have been lost, while infrastructure and crops have been damaged by floods caused by climate change.\n\nIn the last cropping season, most parts of SADC were food insecure after being affected by low rainfall due to the El-Nino phenomenon.\n\n",

She described Coventry as a beacon of inspiration and resilience.\n\nLet me say, Kirsty, your track record speaks for itself. You are not just Zimbabwes most decorated Olympian  you are Africas best, said Mutsvangwa.\n\nWith seven Olympic medals  two golds, four silvers, one bronze  she single-handedly brought home seven of Zimbabwes eight Olympic medals. Kirsty, youve placed Zimbabwe on the global stage of history. We are excited, and we will stand by you. This is not just a personal victory; it is a national milestone.\n\nCoventrys triumph is especially symbolic, coming during International Womens Month. Her election was celebrated by women across the continent, and a large contingent of female leaders turned up at the airport in solidarity.\n\nAmong them were ICT Minister Tatenda Mavetera, Deputy Ministers Emily Jesaya and Yeukai Simbanegavi, Sport and Recreation Commission Director Elta Nengomasha, Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture Director Eugenia Chidhakwa, and Zimbabwe Olympic Committee CEO Marlene Gadzirayi.\n\nMinister Mutsvangwa, who recently represented Zimbabwe at the 69th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW69) at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, said Coventrys victory resonated with the conferences core themes on womens leadership and empowerment.\n\nThank you, Kirsty. Ill miss you  shes like a daughter to me in Cabinet. Let the girls of this country know that it can be done. You can achieve your vision with dedication. Youve made us proud, said Mutsvangwa.\n\nI salute my dear sister, Minister Mavetera, and all the women leaders who came out today. I remember being with Kirsty in New York when she was lobbying for this role during the UN General Assembly. I saw her grit, tenacity, and determination  and I knew she would succeed.\n\nMutsvangwa revealed that Zimbabwe was mentioned at the General Assemblys closing ceremony, where Coventrys historic IOC presidency was acknowledged  another symbolic moment for the nation.\n\nWe are so proud of you. This is a powerful message for the girl child and women everywhere. Youve walked a long and demanding road, and I want to also honour Tyrone, your husband, and your parents  you are truly a source of inspiration for many.\n\nWhile her Olympic record is unmatched in Africa, Coventry has also made a mark in public service. Since her appointment to Cabinet in 2018, she has led several transformative initiatives in youth development, grassroots sport, and the creative industries.\n\nUnder her leadership, the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation spearheaded the national Youth Empowerment Strategy, the revival of community sport and recreational centres, and the restructuring of national sporting associations to improve governance and athlete welfare.\n\nShe also oversaw the drafting of a National Sport and Recreation Policy aimed at professionalising sport and positioning Zimbabwe as a competitive sporting nation.\n\nIn the arts sector, her ministry helped establish funding mechanisms for creatives and promoted cultural preservation through various national festivals and exchange programmes.\n\nCoventry has hinted that she may step down from her Cabinet post to focus on her new international duties. If confirmed, her departure would mark the end of an impactful chapter in Zimbabwes public administration  but also the beginning of a new era of global representation.\n\nAs she prepares to ascend to the helm of world sport, Kirsty Coventry carries not only the dreams of athletes but the pride of a nation.\n\n",

Addressing these issues was no small task, Dr Manyaya said.\n\nIt was a challenging process, but we remained resolute in our commitment to implementing reforms that would restore confidence in ZINARA.\n\nKey priorities set by Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona included upholding good corporate governance, reducing corruption, easing congestion at tollgates, strengthening road authority capacity, and digitising operations.\n\nZINARA adopted the ICEA strategic pillars  Integrity, Capacitation, Engagement, and Automation  to drive these reforms.\n\nFinancial management has seen a remarkable improvement.\n\nZINARA reported collecting ZW$6,6 billion, equivalent to US$346,3 million, in the past year. Notably, the entity achieved its first-ever clean audit for the 2023 financial statements and a 67 percent cure rate on the Auditor Generals 2023 report, the highest in the public sector.\n\nA significant hurdle was the repayment of the Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA) loan, which had strained ZINARAs finances.\n\nThrough prudent management, the loan balance was reduced from US$165 million in December 2020 to US$42 million by December 2024, and the interest rate was lowered from 8,16 percent to 5 percent. This achievement has restored Zimbabwes credibility with international financial institutions.\n\nZINARA has also addressed long-standing issues with outstanding Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and implemented recommendations from the Grant Thornton forensic audit. Out of 71 governance issues, 66 have been fully resolved.\n\nTo enhance transparency, ZINARA has automated procurement processes, deployed leakage detection equipment at tollgates, and begun relocating tollgates to address urban expansion. The organisation has also introduced e-tags and express lanes for efficient toll collection and transformed tollgates into vehicle licensing points.\n\nDisbursements to road authorities have significantly improved, with 90 percent of budget allocations accessed in 2024. ZINARA introduced a fuel disbursement programme, allocating over 1,9 million litres of fuel, and provided technical training to road authority engineers.\n\nFor the first time, ZINARA introduced a fuel disbursement programme, allocating over 1,9 million litres of fuel to road authorities. This initiative addressed a critical operational challenge, enabling authorities to use their own equipment for roads, contributing to a significant improvement in the scope and quality of road maintenance works, said Dr Manyaya.\n\nLooking ahead, ZINARA has proposed a ZW$11,6 billion budget for 2025 and plans to continue supporting road authorities with technical assistance and equipment funding.\n\n",

This will result in the restricting of the debt arrears.\n\nOnce that has happened, Zimbabwe will no longer be listed as an arrears debtor, which cuts the costs of ordinary financing as the perceived risks are much lower, and opens doors to very careful development financing at very low interest rates through global development agencies.\n\nFinance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Mthuli Ncube was upbeat at the weekend that the more than six years of fiscal discipline he has been directly responsible for will be bearing fruit as President Mnangagwas debt arrears clearing initiative enters the final stages.\n\nUnder an SMP, the IMF gets to see how Zimbabwe manages its State finances from the inside for nine months.\n\nIt already has been checking out the national finances periodically since soon after the start of the Second Republic, and its annual reports on Zimbabwe have been getting better each year as it sees inherited problems being successfully sorted out.\n\nSo the more detailed monitoring about to start for the rest of the year is not really anything new, just more detailed.\n\nZimbabwe, at least under President Mnangagwa, has never had a problem with accredited outsiders seeing how the Government runs the country. We have nothing to hide as can be seen by the ever greater information given to Zimbabweans as well as outsiders.\n\nTransparency and openness are seen as virtues, citizens being entitled to this and it being very useful when outsiders can see that Zimbabwe is now a well-managed and low-risk country.\n\nThis should be confirmed by the IMF as its staff monitoring programme reports in.\n\nHowever, like all auditors, it never gives a 100 percent mark, but it can and will measure the high levels of fiscal discipline and integrity of Government payment systems.\n\nAs Prof Ncube noted, that report is what the likely sponsors will want to see.\n\nDiscussions with potential sponsors have already begun, and while there is definitely sympathy for Zimbabwe, and an interest in helping the country, the potential sponsors just want to be reassured that everything is on the up-and-up and the figures are as good as we say.\n\nWhich is fair enough since they would obviously prefer to sponsor and reinforce success rather than failure.\n\nThe Arrears Clearance and Debt Resolution programme has been championed by African Development Bank president Dr Akinwumi Adesina and former Mozambican President Joachim Chissano.\n\nDr Adesina retires from Africas top financial job in August but is keen to continue championing the Zimbabwean programme, which by that stage should be entering the final batch of timelines.\n\nHaving high-calibre outsiders of integrity has meant that others who might have been reluctant to look at facts have been at least willing to listen and look at the figures.\n\nAt the very least they will not oppose a sensible and rational programme of clearing the arrears and many might support it to varying degrees.\n\nThe European Union, as it cast off the last sanctions against Zimbabwe, with just a symbolic arms embargo left that does not affect trade and other ties, did note that the continually improving relations were to a degree driven by the determined Zimbabwean effort to have the arrears cleared.\n\nAs we have noted, when you look at the voting strength of member countries in many global development agencies where Zimbabwe owes money, any attempt to stop a sensible and rational Zimbabwean clearance programme will require European countries backing the remaining sanctions countries.\n\nEuropean support for Zimbabwe would be ideal, but even abstentions would work.\n\nArrears clearance will require from Zimbabwe more than just promises.\n\nWe will have to be on what would be a payment plan for an individual, and so those who are willing to back that sort of plan would want to make sure Zimbabwe is both serious about any agreed plan, and that it can keep up with its conditions, hence the IMF staff monitored programme.\n\nAny such plan also has to allow Zimbabwe to continue growing at fast rates, rather than cripple the economy, and so the details will need to be carefully worked out.\n\nHaving an agreed set of facts, and the IMF having certified those facts will be exceptionally useful.\n\nIt will mean a proper arrears clearance programme can be implemented and Zimbabwe can return to the normal financial and trading world where it belongs.\n\n",

            "content": "Innocent Mujeri, Herald Correspondent\n\nThis year, Zimbabwe proudly celebrates its 45th Independence Day under the resonant theme Zim@45: Devolve and Develop Together Towards Vision 2030.\n\nAt its heart, this theme embodies not just a commitment, but a strategic pathway for Zimbabwes future.\n\nThe selection of Gokwe, Midlands as the host for this historic celebration signals a powerful step in actualising the spirit of devolution and inclusive development championed by the Second Republic.\n\nZimbabwes journey towards Vision 2030; a prosperous, upper-middle-income economy, depends significantly on inclusive growth and balanced regional development.\n\nDevolution, therefore, emerges not only as a policy directive, but as a practical necessity for national unity and socio-economic equity.\n\nBy explicitly centring this years independence theme around devolution, the Government reiterates its determination to empower local communities by bringing governance, resources and decision-making closer to the people.\n\nIt acknowledges that genuine development must begin at the grassroots, reflecting the priorities, aspirations and potential unique to each province.\n\nThe choice of the Midlands Province, specifically Gokwe North at the Nembudziya Growth Point Open Ground Venue, for hosting the celebrations is especially commendable.\n\nHistorically, national events and commemorations had been confined to major urban areas, often leaving rural regions on the periphery.\n\nHowever, by deliberately rotating the location of these events, the Second Republic demonstrates its earnestness in spreading developmental initiatives across all provinces.\n\nThe rotation policy ensures that no region feels marginalised or disconnected from the nations significant historical milestones.\n\nIt is a powerful gesture that underscores equity, inclusion and national cohesion.\n\nThe anticipated attendance of over 60 000 Zimbabweans in Gokwe underscores the eagerness of communities traditionally considered remote or under-served to actively participate in national celebrations.\n\nThis also opens an essential avenue for local economies, injecting substantial resources and spotlighting local products, culture and tourism potential.\n\nHosting such a national event in Gokwe amplifies local voices and showcases untapped potential, offering these communities a national platform to highlight their contributions and developmental challenges directly to the nations leadership.\n\nIn past celebrations held in Harare, Bulawayo, or other urban centres, rural provinces often experienced indirect benefits or were overlooked entirely.\n\nThe strategic decision to host Independence Day celebrations in Gokwe this year, therefore, actively reverses this trend, practically demonstrating the Governments dedication to development through active decentralisation.\n\nIt is a recognition of the rural majority, affirming that their role in nation-building is invaluable and deserving of direct acknowledgement.\n\nMoreover, by bringing national celebrations closer to the people, Government fosters a sense of ownership and belonging among local communities.\n\nThe people of Gokwe, previously accustomed to watching national events unfold from afar, now have a front-row seat in celebrating Zimbabwes freedom, sovereignty and aspirations.\n\nSuch experiences are vital in solidifying national identity, fostering patriotism, and nurturing an inclusive civic culture.\n\nThe theme Zim@45: Devolve and Develop Together Towards Vision 2030 serves as a powerful rallying cry, inspiring not only Government officials but every Zimbabwean to unite in the collective pursuit of progress and development.\n\nIt encapsulates the ideals of collective progress, participatory governance, and balanced economic growth.\n\nIt invites active participation and accountability from leaders at all governance levels and, importantly, empowers citizens to actively engage in decision-making processes that directly affect their lives.\n\nDevolution is transformative; it strengthens local governance structures, empowers communities, and ensures fairer distribution of resources.\n\nDevolution mitigates the historical challenge of uneven development, which has contributed significantly to rural-urban migration, urban overcrowding and neglected rural infrastructure.\n\nBy devolving governance, Zimbabwe can tackle infrastructural deficits, improve public service delivery, and enhance accountability at local government levels.\n\nThis approach is key to unlocking sustainable economic growth, reducing poverty, and achieving the broader aims of Vision 2030.\n\nFurthermore, by celebrating national milestones across different provinces each year, Zimbabwe achieves a powerful symbolic demonstration of unity in diversity.\n\nEach province brings to the fore its unique historical narratives, cultural traditions, and economic potential.\n\nSuch celebrations become more than mere commemorations; they are opportunities for intercultural exchange, dialogue, and mutual understanding among diverse communities.\n\nTherefore, as Zimbabwe commemorates 45 years of independence, citizens across the nation should fully embrace and support the strategic imperative embedded in this years theme.\n\nThe event in Gokwe must not merely be a momentary celebration, but serve as a lasting reminder and benchmark for development and meaningful inclusion.\n\nLeaders at national and provincial levels must recommit to the spirit and letter of devolution, ensuring that policy declarations translate effectively into transformative impacts on ordinary citizens lives.\n\nThe 45th Independence Day theme profoundly encapsulates the spirit of Zimbabwes developmental aspirations.\n\nHosting the event in Gokwe North signals a powerful commitment to inclusive national growth.\n\nZimbabweans across all provinces must seize this moment to renew their commitment to nation-building, equitable development, and the realisation of Vision 2030.\n\nThis years celebrations promise not only reflection on the nations proud past, but also a vigorous, united step toward a brighter, more equitable future.\n\n",
