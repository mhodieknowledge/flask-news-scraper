SADC thus expects all parties to the electoral process, both individually and collectively, to abide by the decision of the Council which should provide a constitutional way forward for the country, and facilitate the way to greater peace, normalcy and stability in the interest of all Mozambicans.\n\nFurther, the President said, the rule of law is sacrosanct and SADC, as the regional mother body, stands ready to assist the people of Mozambique in deepening and consolidating democracy.\n\nSADC stands ready to assist the incoming Government, and People of Mozambique, in consolidating their electoral democracy on the basis of the aforesaid Court decision which should be held sacrosanct by all. Indeed, this is what the rule of law is all about, the President said.\n\nIn the October elections, Cde Chapo won by a massive landslide; his party, Frelimo, also improved its parliamentary majority in the 250-seatlegislature.\n\nHowever, the opposition led by Mr Mondlane has refused to accept defeat, leading to sporadic protests in the gas-rich southern African country, concentrated mainly in the urban centres.\n\n",

I was at my office at my official residence, reflecting on who will remain, who will go, who is working hard, and what new things I can initiate. So Christmas Day is a day to brainstorm, plan, it is the day for that because all other people will be busy at their homes, there will be less disturbances, there will be fewer phone calls, said President Mnangagwa as he strolled around the driveway of his yard.\n\nAsked if he rests during the Christmas period, he said: Yes, at home I play with grandchildren. They came last night, and they will come again later in the afternoon, I play and interact with them briefly and I revert to my work in my office which is here. I have a lot of work to do. Today there are fewer phone calls.\n\nHe said he could not switch off his mobile phone to concentrate on his work because he had to run a country through teamwork.\n\nThe country does not stop working, it (Christmas Day) is the time to reflect without disturbances, we are headed for New Year. We must introduce new programmes, new policies. We must introspect about the past, our weaknesses, our strengths . . .to say this was my team, is it the team that has delivered our vision or does it require interrogation? he said.\n\nAsked if he would continue with his team going into the new year, the President said he would make a statement to the nation about his vision and programmes at the commencement of the New Year.\n\nI cannot release it now. I will make my statement after the 1st of January, because just now, everyone is happy, they are celebrating Christmas day and for you to call to tell them that you are no longer part of my team, it would not augur well, but that is the time I reflect how we have worked as a team, what weaknesses have I identified, what is necessary to execute Government programmes, he said.\n\nRecounting how Christmas was celebrated during his boyhood days, President Mnangagwa said it was a joyous event as they would collectively eat food prepared by his mother.\n\nIn the 1940s and 50s at Christmas, our mothers would cook food in huge pots, prepare bread delivered to us in winnowing baskets, for you(present generation) these things are now just normal, he said.\n\nHe said when he rests, mostly on Sundays, he goes to his farm in Kwekwe to assess the crops and livestock, among other tasks.\n\nFirst Lady, Dr Mnangagwa said on Christmas day she takes it upon herself to prepare food for her grandchildren.\n\nI had a message sent to me by my grandchildren, saying they are coming today and they want me to cook for them. They said they wanted some chips. I have prepared cabbages, butternut and so forth, I have prepared food which I want them to eat. I feel very happy because it is not often that we see them because of our busy schedule, she said.\n\nShe said her upbringing is what makes her work hard despite her status as the Mother of the Nation.\n\nAsked what Cde Mnangagwas favourite food is, the First Lady said the President, while she likes meat, preferred kapenta and milk.\n\nFrom the time I knew him, yes inasmuch as he wants to see meat in the relish, but what he likes most is kapenta and milk. I actually have them now. Even if we visit, we have no problems about what he eats, its kapenta and milk, she said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Zimbabwe joined the Christian world to celebrate Christmas Day meant to mark the birth of Jesus Christ.\n\nSome went to the rural areas, others went to holiday resorts while others were at home with their families to celebrate the day.\n\n",

            "content": "Fidelis Munyoro-Chief Court Reporter\n\nThe Judiciary has called upon the legislature to urgently expand the sentencing jurisdiction of regional magistrates, enabling them to impose penalties that reflect the gravity of the offences they preside over.\n\nThis call comes against the backdrop of new sentencing guidelines which prescribe a presumptive penalty of 20 years imprisonment for robbery committed under aggravating circumstances.\n\nHowever, the sentencing powers of regional magistrates remain capped at a mere 12 years, a limitation that undermines their ability to deliver justice in serious and complex criminal cases.\n\nThis legislative gap was starkly highlighted in the High Court case of Israel Mufure (22) and Charles Murinda (55)  two armed robbers who unleashed terror on a primary school in Norton, robbing teachers with brazen aggression using a pellet gun to instil fear.\n\nThe duo was convicted of five counts of robbery and one count of unlawful entry, receiving a consolidated 10-year sentence for the robberies and an additional 10 years for unlawful entry.\n\nHowever, Justice Esther Muremba and Deputy Judge President Garainesu Mawadze, expressed profound concern over the inadequacy of the sentence, viewing it as incompatible with the severity of the crimes committed.\n\nJustice Muremba, writing for the court, underscored the troubling disparity between the presumptive penalty of 20 years for robbery under aggravating circumstances and the regional magistrates jurisdictional limit of 12 years.\n\nShe characterised the imposed sentence as unduly lenient, particularly given the egregious nature of the offences.\n\nThe judge further noted that the sentencing magistrate failed to fully appreciate or apply the new sentencing framework, raising questions about whether the magistrates approach aligned with the legislative intent of the presumptive guidelines.\n\nWhen I queried the learned regional magistrate about the 10-year sentence for five counts of robbery committed under aggravating circumstances, given the presumptive penalty of 20 years for one count, she replied that her jurisdiction in robbery cases is limited to 12 years under section 51(3) of the Magistrates Court Act [Chapter 7:10], Justice Muremba remarked.\n\nYet, the magistrate did not expound on how this limitation influenced her sentencing decision or reconcile the discrepancy between the higher presumptive penalty and her imposed sentence.\n\nJustice Muremba said that the magistrate should have explicitly acknowledged this jurisdictional limitation in her judgment and provided a reasoned explanation for her approach in light of the sentencing guidelines.\n\nThe court expressed dismay at the apparent misconception that the magistrates maximum sentencing jurisdiction equates to the normal sentencing range for such offences.\n\nJustice Muremba cautioned that this view risks creating a disconnect between the sentencing framework and the realities of the crimes magistrates frequently adjudicate.\n\nShe remarked, While adhering to jurisdictional limits is necessary, this view may indicate a disconnect from the sentencing guidelines, which suggest a presumptive penalty of 20 years. It appears the learned regional magistrate has not fully embraced or given due weight to the new sentencing framework.\n\nThe judges also stressed that regional magistrates often handle robbery cases involving aggravating circumstances, making it imperative to enhance their sentencing powers.\n\nExpanding the sentencing jurisdiction of regional magistrates is crucial to ensuring that penalties adequately reflect the severity of offences. This would not only enhance judicial efficiency but also strengthen the publics trust in the justice system, Justice Muremba stated.\n\nThe current requirement to refer cases involving sentences beyond the magistrates jurisdiction to the High Court was described as cumbersome and counterproductive.\n\nJustice Muremba highlighted the delays and inefficiencies caused by this process, which often prolongs the resolution of cases and hampers the delivery of justice.\n\nShe argued that empowering magistrates to impose higher sentences would streamline the judicial process, reduce backlogs, and ensure that justice is served both swiftly and effectively.\n\nThe judges called for legislative intervention to amend the Magistrates Court Act [Chapter 7:10], aligning magistrates sentencing jurisdiction with the presumptive penalties prescribed by the guidelines.\n\nThey said that such a move would foster consistency and uniformity in sentencing, a cornerstone of a fair and credible judicial system.\n\n",

I want to believe that the year 2025 will be equally a busy year.\n\nSince the establishment of the Second Republic, significant progress has been made in infrastructure development, including the construction of dams, roads, innovation hubs at tertiary institutions, and the provision of safe drinking water through borehole drilling.\n\nThe administration of President Mnangagwa has spearheaded these initiatives, which have created numerous job opportunities and fostered economic growth.\n\nDespite challenges in accessing external credit due to the debilitating illegal economic sanction, the Second Republic, using its own resources, has prioritised infrastructural development as a vital component of economic transformation.\n\nCde Machacha also addressed the importance of strengthening party structures, noting that ZANU PF conducts annual cell verification exercises to account for both old and new members.\n\nThis initiative aims to ensure the integrity of the partys membership in accordance with its constitutional requirements.\n\nI want to believe that next year will be another busy year. We must build a formidable party by ensuring our structures are in place and authentic. We will also address the ideological gap between the elders and the youth through training, workshops, and outreach programs, he remarked.\n\nThe ongoing restructuring includes the computerisation of membership records in new cell and village registers. ZANU PF is leveraging technological advancements to implement a comprehensive computerisation program for party membership, enhancing organisational efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n",

            "content": "The reluctance of some losers in some elections to accept their loss and to encourage, or at least condone violence by their supporters negates the whole point of multi-party democracy, that the majority chooses who runs the Government and legislature of acountry.\n\nCentral to the whole democratic process is that someone wins each election with the obvious corollary that everyone else loses the election. If there were no losers there would be no multi-party democracy and no real election, simply the imposition of candidates and electorates limited to choosing, if choice was offered, from a very narrow range of approved candidates from one party.\n\nIt can be hard to lose, but that is the result of democracy, that more people voted for the other candidate or other party and so someone else had the most votes and won. Losers should brace themselves, accept the result, work out why they had fewer votes and try and offer better candidates and policies the next time round.\n\nThey also need to reign in their most enthusiastic supporters who might want to vent their disappointment through violence, or, as has happened, hope for violence to mask other criminal activity such as looting.\n\nAfrica has had more than its fair share of losers refusing to accept results, creating headlines of contested election results when usually the election results are not contested, but rather losing candidates refusing to accept them.\n\nBut Africa is not alone as the refusal by a large block of Republican Party voters showed in their refusal to accept the 2020 American election results, with resulting violence and some deaths. So this problem of refusing to accept results, violence and deaths can happen anywhere.\n\nMozambique, after a string of peaceful elections across SADC in recent years, is the latest country in the region to have the second-placed presidential candidate and the second largest parliamentary party refusing to accept results and their supporters taking to the streets and indulging in violence.\n\nThe Mozambique Constitutional Council, the top court for deciding all issues based on the constitution and the final court for all election petitions, ruled on Monday that the results of the October Presidential and Parliamentary elections did see Daniel Chapo win the Presidency with 65 percent of the vote and his Frelimo party winning an increased Parliamentary majority.\n\nMozambique has been seeing very high economic growth rates in recent years, and the militant insurgency in the north has been largely successfully dealt with as Mozambican security forces, backed by SADC, boosted their training and efficiency and found effective ways of dealing with the menace.\n\nThese sort of successes almost certainly increased the Frelimo vote as more people thought the party was the best for developing the country and coping with non-democratic violence. Openings for the opposition to leverage on were limited when the government was doing so well.\n\nBut the constitutional ruling resulted within hours with more violence, at least in Maputo and Beira, the two largest cities, and another 21 people killed, including two police officers, plus 13 civilians and 12 police injured and 25 vehicles set on fire, including two police vehicles. Once again large numbers took advantage of the violence to engage in burning and looting shops, according to video footage.\n\nThere has been a tendency in some new reports to blame the violence since October on the Government suppressing protests, but the fact that police are dying and comprise almost half the injured suggests otherwise, and that police are being targeted by violent protesters. The widespread looting is not a protest, but rather widespread thieving and crime, and the setting of vehicles on fire seems to be pure arson, not politics.\n\nSADC itself through its observer mission, as did the African Union, confirmed earlier that the elections, despite the odd hiccup, had been effective in finding out the will of the Mozambican population and that the results would be accurate. The Mozambican courts of course would have delved further, looking at all the objections and petitions that elections can generate, and then on the evidence making the final decision.\n\nSADC itself does not have any opinion of who should win any election in the region, except that the winners must have the majority support of their own population. Some elections result in a governing party maintaining its majority, some result in a change of government and a president from another party.\n\nThis year Botswana changed its government in an election, and every SADC leader sent their congratulations and the neighbours turned up at the inauguration. A few years ago Zambia saw the same, and once again that was accepted by all and once again the new president was congratulated. When a president wins another term, or at least their partys designated successor wins that is accepted and congratulations follow as has happened this year in South Africa, Namibia and now Mozambique.\n\nThe point is that SADC does not choose the winners, only confirms that the elections were adequately run and the local courts have settled any disputes. Presidents, governments and parties are chosen by the people.\n\nBut where SADC does make a stand after an election is that its recognises the winner, as SADC Chairperson President Mnangagwa did this week when the Mozambique Constitutional Council made its ruling, and makes it clear that it will support the country and those whom a majority of the people selected.\n\nThis support has been unconditional and absolute since SADC was formed, as the region saw so many violent wars before all people could vote freely and recognises that only the people can choose governments.\n\nLosers need to recognise this. Just because they cannot imagine voting for the winner does not mean that others may come to different opinion and they need to accept that despite their own opinion of the respective talents and policies, the people thought differently.\n\n",
