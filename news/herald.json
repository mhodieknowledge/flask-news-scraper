They inspect item by item with those who have not declared or under-declared paying duty and a fine, said a trader operating near the Zimra offices.\n\nObservers have noted that the number of cross-border buses has not reduced and people continue with their business.\n\nI think the people are still making money despite the crackdown, otherwise the number of traders should have declined or others would have stopped altogether, said an observer.\n\nIt means they still register a profit even after paying duty.\n\n",
