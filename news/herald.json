They told me that the country warmly receives investors as l had hinted on my plans, Shayanewako told the court.\n\nAccording to prosecutor Loveit Muringwa, on October 23 last year, detectives from Chitungwiza received information that Shayanewako was on a spending spree.\n\nActing on the information, they arrested the accused who was driving a Toyota Hilux GD6 vehicle he had just bought for US$36 000.\n\nThe accused was escorted to CID Chitungwiza where a search was conducted in his vehicle. A wallet containing ZAR 198 800 was recovered.\n\nFurther investigations revealed that he had also recently purchased a five-roomed house in Manyame Park, Chitungwiza, for US$27 000.\n\nThe court heard that Shayanewako was quizzed about the source of the money but he failed to give a satisfactory response.\n\n",
