And progressively we will be moving into other units like tractors, he said.\n\nThis move not only directly creates jobs on the assembly lines but also fosters growth in supporting industries, from steel production to component manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThe impact, Minister Ndlovu said, extends beyond vehicle assembly.\n\nThe ongoing agricultural mechanisation programme, a cornerstone of the Zimbabwe-Belarus partnership, is set to expand also, he said.\n\nBelarusian Vice Prime Minister Viktor Karankevich announced ambitious targets, revealing that more than 700 tractors, 80 harvesters, over 30 grain dryers will be delivered to Zimbabwe within the framework of 2025.\n\nThe machinery, coupled with the establishment of local service centres and training programmes, will generate numerous jobs in maintenance, repair and agricultural operations.\n\nMr Karankevich emphasised the comprehensive approach, noting the focus on service provision, spare parts provision and educational aspect where Zimbabwean specialists are being trained and educated on the grounds of the very service sector.\n\nLands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Permanent Secretary Professor Obert Jiri underscored the crucial role of this collaboration in modernising Zimbabwes agricultural sector.\n\nWe have mechanisation as one of our key enablers, and the support that we have gotten from Belarus is very much appreciated, he said.\n\nWe also noted that we must localise the production of these tractors and other pieces of machinery. So we are appreciative of the cooperation that we have with Belarus in the agro machinery space.\n\nThe initiative promises to generate thousands of jobs across various skill levels from factory workers and technicians to agricultural mechanics and support staff.\n\n",

            "content": "Diana NhereraChitungwiza Municipality has clarified that the brownish colour of the water coming out of taps is residual chlorine that had accumulated due to long periods without water.Spokesperson for Chitungwiza Municipality, Mr Tafadzwa Kachiko said this is a common occurrence in systems with intermittent water supply.\n\nBecause we are currently receiving 15 megalitres per day while the actual demand is 70 megalitres, we have had to implement water rationing, he said.\n\nAs a result, some areas go without water for extended periods. When supply is restored, the first flow of water that comes through the pipes often contains higher levels of residual chlorine.\n\nThis is due to the chlorine settling or concentrating in the pipes during the dry period. So when people start filling buckets again, the first few litres may appear to have stronger chlorine presence.\n\nMr Kachiko said this is not harmful and is a result of necessary chlorination for safe drinking water combined with the nature of intermittent delivery.\n\nHe said water supply has generally improved since the recommissioning of the Prince Edward water treatment plant.\n\nMr Kachiko said before the recommissioning of the plant, Chitungwiza was receiving between one to three megalitres per day pumped from Morton Jaffray waterworks.\n\n",

The deployment of breathalysers shows a real commitment to saving lives and keeping our roads safe, read the statement.\n\nWe applaud this step. It is a sign that the Government is listening and responding to a long-standing public health concern.\n\nStatistics from previous holiday periods have consistently shown a surge in road carnage, often linked to alcohol abuse. The introduction of modern enforcement tools is expected to significantly reduce incidents of drink-driving.\n\nHowever, SAAPA Zimbabwe warned that while breathalysers are a vital deterrent, they are not a standalone solution.The organisation called for the urgent adoption and implementation of Zimbabwes National Alcohol Policy.\n\nTo truly turn the tide on alcohol-related harm, Zimbabwe must urgently implement the National Alcohol Policy, a policy that has been waiting in the wings for far too long, the alliance said.\n\nThe proposed policy framework, which has been under review for several years, seeks to regulate alcohol consumption in line with the World Health Organisations (WHO) Global Strategy and SAFER initiative.\n\nThe strategy recommends evidence-based interventions such as restricting alcohol availability, enforcing drink-driving laws, increasing alcohol taxes, banning aggressive marketing and expanding treatment for alcohol dependence.\n\nBreathalysers can catch drunk-drivers  but strong alcohol policies can prevent them in the first place, SAAPA Zimbabwe said.\n\nThe organisation also urged members of the public to act responsibly during the upcoming holidays, calling on citizens to prioritise safety and look out for one another.\n\nLets honour these holidays by protecting one another. Dont drink and drive. Choose safety. Choose life.\n\n",
