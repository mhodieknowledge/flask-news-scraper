No one must put our party into disrepute. This is unacceptable. Such behaviour cannot be tolerated and must stop. Vari kuzviita cherai chikomba, emphasised President Mnangagwa.\n\nEvery member, the President said, must adhere to provisions of the party constitution, founding principles, and procedural integrity, including wide consultation and formal ratification of issues that affect the party.\n\nPrudence must be exercised in the execution of our duties and rights as members, through the use of appropriate principal organs and structures of the party. Zanu PF musangano unegwara, uye nematare.\n\nLet us do more to unite the party and entrench a positive culture of common purpose, harmony and love, as we advance our party Vision and Mission as articulated in Articles 6 and 7 of our party constitution, he said.\n\nOn top of that, a social media policy is being crafted which will guide party members.\n\nThe President urged the party leadership to look forward to 2025 with optimism and confidence that the colossal party will sustain the development momentum realised so far.\n\nIn doing so, our primary concern at every leadership level should be to continue building a positive image of the party and expanding the membership base in our structures. The party must remain visible in the villages, and urban areas, always guiding misinformed cadres in our communities, and raising their political awareness. Mu ZANU PF, iwe neni tine basa, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said despite the effects of the heinous illegal sanctions the country has witnessed numerous success milestones during the year.\n\nDespite the weighty and retarding effects of the heinous illegal sanctions on our country, we scored numerous success milestones during the year towards the modernisation, industrialisation and growth of our economy.\n\nOur national development philosophy, Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatigwa nevene vayo/ ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo, is now embedded nationally, in the mind-sets of our people.\n\nAs such, through this rallying call as well as hard work, focus and determination, our country is realising growth across all sectors of the economy and also a higher quality of life for our people, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nIn the past few weeks alone, President Mnangagwa has officiated at various ceremonies for notable development projects and programmes being championed by the ruling party.\n\nThese included the commissioning of the Shurugwi- Mhandamabwe Road, the Varun Beverages Phase 6 and 7 expansion project, and the launch of the construction of a US$1 billion Titan New Energy Plant, among others.\n\nAs we continue to make efforts to position Zimbabwe as an infrastructure powerhouse, the central role of the iron and steel sector cannot be overemphasised. To this end, the convening of the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Indaba was a welcome initiative. It stands as a reminder to the party, Government and other stakeholders in the sector to quickly adapt and innovate as we revitalise this important industry of our nation, he said.\n\nFocus, he stated, must be towards guaranteeing that the natural endowments of the country benefit Zimbabweans and help accelerate the modernisation and industrialisation of the economy.\n\nHe commended party members for being instrumental in the success of programmes and activities that were held during the course of the year.\n\nYour individual and collective efforts were instrumental in the success of party programmes and activities held during the course of the year. The spirit of servant leadership and determination to wholeheartedly serve the party and people of our motherland, Zimbabwe, should remain our guiding beacon into the new year. Congratulations on a job well done, he said.\n\nHe also commended the party and Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology for facilitating training and capacity building for the members of the Youth League through the ongoing partnership with the Julius Nyerere School of Leadership.\n\nSuch leadership training programmes along with those conducted with various stakeholders within the country nurture our people to value and promote the ideals of patriotism and Pan-Africanism for the ongoing national development revolution.\n\nThe Chitepo School of Ideology, as a strategic Party and national institution, is directed to remain guided by the founding objectives, spirit and letter, that saw its establishment, he said.\n\n",

The programme is envisaged to bolster the land ownership model, and enhance access to financing, as well as to encourage production and productivity, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe implored communities to remain vigilant as the country seeks to capitalise on weather patterns for improved agricultural output.\n\nIn the agriculture sector, I once again urge communities, village-by-village, ward-by-ward to remain vigilant as we maximise the weather patterns for a successful agriculture season, said the President.\n\nTo ensure the smooth facilitation of the process, the Government issued an indefinite moratorium on the issuance of any new 99-year leases, offer letters and permits for agricultural land.\n\nIn announcing the new policy in October this year, President Mnangagwa said in implementing the new system, priority will be given to veterans of the liberation struggle, youths and women.\n\nIn addition, security of tenure to all agricultural land regularised under this programme will, at all times, only be transferable among indigenous Zimbabweans and land targeted for the new tenure system will exclude communal land that is under the jurisdiction of traditional chiefs.\n\nHe said the noticeable new paradigm amongst Zimbabwean farmers, especially the majority of beneficiaries of the land reform, was to regard and conduct farming as a business, a source of both livelihoods and means to increase personal economic value.\n\nChronicling the background of the programme, President Mnangagwa said the Government, has since 2008, put in place various programmes to assist farmers to be productive on the land through programmes such as the Basic Commodity Supply Side Intervention (Baccossi), Inputs and Mechanisation Equipment, Maguta, and the Special Grains Import Substitution Programme among others.\n\nIn the Second Republic, the country has witnessed and benefited from the Governments deliberate and complementary policy of incorporating accelerated infrastructure development which includes road construction and rehabilitation incorporating the much-needed rural roads, dam construction; irrigation; and housing development, he said.\n\nSome of the challenges, he said, that were faced by farmers in the past include difficulty in accessing affordable finance and varying levels of accountability from the farmers.\n\nThe President has since constituted a Cabinet Oversight Committee chaired by Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri to lead the reform process.\n\nA technical committee  the Land Tenure Implementation Committee (LTIC)  to coordinate and steer the implementation of this process will also be constituted.\n\nThese Committees will work diligently to develop improved security of tenure for land beneficiaries while ensuring that the value of agricultural and urban State land is fully unlocked to guarantee inclusive and nationwide economic development.\n\nGovernment will put in place all the necessary institutional and logistical mechanisms to ensure the smooth coordination and implementation of these new policies and objectives.\n\n",

When we took stock in April last year, we realised that we had completed 272 000 houses, and the Cabinet is ready to review the target to 1 million housing units. As we speak, we have already achieved more than 700 000 housing units, which accounts for over 70 percent of our targets. This positions us well to achieve our goals by 2025, he said.\n\nMinister Soda emphasised that housing delivery is not solely the responsibility of the Ministry of National Housing; it involves collaboration with various stakeholders, including pension funds, insurance schemes, individuals, and civil society. He noted ongoing partnerships with banks such as BancABC, CBZ, and CABS, highlighting the importance of private sector participation in realising the vision for 2030, which is expected to be led by the private sector.\n\nSo we are crowding in the private sector by creating a conducive investment environment where they can find opportunities to participate in the housing delivery sector, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "With Christmas Day less than a week away, teams from State agencies have been deployed to enforce traffic and vehicle regulations and generally trying to create an accident-free festive season.\n\nSo, officers on the roads, from the Vehicle Inspection Department (VID), who check that vehicles are roadworthy, from Road Motor Transportation, who check that buses and trucks are registered and follow their specific extra rules, the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe, who battle to get everyone do best practices, and the police, who do the actual enforcement of all traffic law and regulation.\n\nOne innovation this year is the deployment of senior officers to monitor the teams and actual operations.\n\nThis is an important extra deployment and should help ensure that the enforcement of safety rules, the general system of warnings where these are appropriate, and the action taken against the more serious infringements are both fair and reasonable.\n\nWhile police have been tightening up their procedures since the advent of the Second Republic and taking action when there are complaints, there is still the problem of private negotiations between law breakers and police and other officers when they think no one is watching.\n\nThis can take the form of a return to the days of extortion, although that is less likely, but more importantly can see a blind eye, being turned to more serious offences where there is no accident to make everyone conform.\n\nThese patrolling senior police can make sure that the teams are doing their duty properly and fairly, that complaints or disputes with drivers can be sorted out quickly and that generally the system can be made to work properly to do what it is intended to do, ensure that everyone uses the roads safely, can be assured that others are also driving safely and that they can move with the assurance that they will arrive at their destination.\n\nEnforcement can be moderately flexible.\n\nFor example travelling a little over the speed limit on a clear day and dry road without much traffic might just need a warning, while travelling even at the speed limit in some conditions could be regarded as reckless driving.\n\nEven for minor infringements that could be dealt with by a warning, we would hope that these warnings will still be recorded, just a line in an exercise book of car number, driver name and address and licence number and nature of warning.\n\nSince most people stretch the law for these minor offences, having to spend a few minutes parked, while the junior constable on the team, the person the rest are almost bound to see as the natural recorder, is writing down these details will at least show that breaking rules does not mean a speedier journey.\n\nThere are additional problems this festive season beyond the greater likelihood of wetter roads. We have just passed the full moon, so as we move towards Christmas more and more of every night will be totally dark.\n\nBetween Christmas and New Year those half-moons will move towards the little slivers soon after sunset or soon before sunrise, that are totally useless for seeing anything.\n\nSo for much of this years festive season we will have far longer periods of intense darkness at night, another excellent reason for not driving at night except in serious emergencies. The less one can see the more dangerous a journey.\n\nUnfortunately, the police still do not have the adequate resources to check up on the two major causes of road accidents, people driving too fast and people driving after having had a few alcoholic drinks.\n\nIn time, breathalysers and speed traps will be ubiquitous at road blocks and police patrols, but until then we need to push hard the culture changes required, that drinking and driving, and speeding, are the two most dangerous activities anyone can do on the road.\n\nOther drivers also need to realise that these people are on the streets with them, and will be causing accidents, and they should be able to take action not to be involved in those inevitable crashes.\n\nStanding up to ones rights is not always the most sensible option when dealing with a drunk weaving at speed coming from the opposite direction.\n\nHaving a far safer Christmas requires everyone to conform, all drivers. The authorities and the enforcement and encouragement teams deployed on the roads can help, but most people drive very correctly when driving near a roadblock or past a police car.\n\nWhile there are cases of someone smashing into a line of cars at a roadblock, most of these accidents take place out of sight of the police, and hence the need to get everyone to understand that we need to all cooperate.\n\nThe rules of the road, and the best practices as outlined in the Highway Code, work extremely well when everyone follows them all the time.\n\nDrivers need to understand we are all safe together or are all in extreme danger together, and that we all need to choose the safe option to be safe. One rule breaker, and we are all unsafe.\n\n",
