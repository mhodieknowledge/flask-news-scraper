            "content": "Fungai Lupande\n\nMashonaland Central Bureau\n\nBINDURA University of Science Education (BUSE) is poised to revolutionise eye care in the country after securing modern equipment for the manufacture of eye lenses at its optometry and audiology centre.\n\nThis development will enable BUSE to supply affordable eye lenses to other facilities across the country in the shortest possible time at affordable prices.\n\nInformation, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Dr Jenfan Muswere yesterday visited high-impact projects in Mashonaland Central Province and expressed his admiration for the domestication of value chains in eye lenses, fertiliser, and water purification chemicals.\n\nDuring the Mashonaland Central provincial media tour, Dr Muswere said President Mnangagwas philosophy is that, Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo (a country is developed by its people) and that has been demonstrated by universities like BUSE.\n\nThe implementation of the Heritage-Based 5.0 Curriculum, he said, has led to the establishment of innovation hubs aimed at empowering learners as was articulated by President Mnangagwa.\n\nIn line with Vision 2030 and National Development Strategy 1, human capital development is a priority to propel and accelerate achievements across all sectors of the economy, Dr Muswere said.\n\nThe ministers tour included a visit to Ran Mines, which has seen an increase in its gold output.\n\nBefore 2017, the mining sector contributed around US$3 billion to the economy. Under the leadership of President Mnangagwa, we now have a mining sector worth over US$15 billion, significantly contributing to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Dr Muswere said.\n\nWe toured a water purification chemical company, Chilmund Chemicals and this is part of the localisation of all value chains within Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Government is shifting the balance of trade from negative to positive by producing most goods and services locally through the implementation of the local content strategy.\n\nHe added that a fertiliser manufacturing company, FSG, has contributed to increased agriculture productivity and cut costs in agricultural production by 50 percent.\n\nThe minister said the establishment of local manufacturing plants reduces the countrys import bill and contributes positively to job creation.\n\nThe more a country exports, the more it generates foreign currency and domesticates its value chains. If we import more, we are exporting jobs, he said.\n\nUnder President Mnangagwas leadership, we have witnessed a growth strategy that has improved our current accounts and helped stabilise inflation. There is less volatility in the currency because we are producing the goods ourselves. Domesticating value chains, especially in fertiliser production, ensures we can plan and meet deadlines.Dr Muswere stressed the importance of adopting new technology in production, especially in agriculture.\n\nTiming and control of inputs are crucial for food and nutrition security. Although we have been affected by environmentally-induced drought, we are recovering.\n\nThe tour will extend to farms owned bywomen and youth excelling in agriculture, which supports the security of tenure and economically empowers citizens participating in agriculture.\n\nThe Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Mashonaland Central, Christopher Magomo, said the province is undergoing economic transformation as the President works to ensure that everyone achieves an upper-middle-income economy by 2030.\n\nHe noted several developments in the province, including tapping into natural resources to produce food and beauty products.\n\nThe optometry programme will see lenses being cut to size in the shortest time possible. This is a milestone for Heritage-based Education 5.0, Minister Magomo said.\n\nHe pointed out that Mashonaland Central produces 50 percent of basal fertiliser at FSG, expressing pride in these achievements.\n\nMr Daniel Chihombori, an assistant to the Vice Chancellor at BUSE, said the optometry programme encompasses both academic and professional services.\n\nHe said they will soon begin manufacturing eye lenses as the necessary machinery has been procured, and they are awaiting experts from Germany to install the equipment.\n\nMr Chihombori expressed gratitude to the Government for its support in infrastructure development at the university.\n\nThis is the first optometry school in Zimbabwe. People from as far as Bulawayo seek services here because we can produce spectacles within a day or two.\n\nAll these achievements are possible because of the strong support from the Government. We extend our gratitude to President Mnangagwa for this support.\n\nThe optometrist at the facility, Mr Evans Aboagye, added that they also check for eye diseases like glaucoma and conduct comprehensive eye examinations for all patients.\n\nThe new machinery will enable us to reduce the importation of eye lenses that were previously inaccessible in Zimbabwe. We can supply all facilities in Zimbabwe with affordable eye lenses, he said.\n\nOur students will learn about all processes involved here, meaning that BUSE will become a top-notch optometry school in Africa.\n\nAt FSG, Acting Plant Manager Mr Tinotenda Kankuni said they currently have 40 000 tonnes of raw materials and hold a market share of between 50 and 60 percent.\n\nThey have a capacity of 1,500 tonnes per day and also operate a granulation plant that processes 200 tonnes per day.\n\nThe company has completed 70 percent of their Presidential inputs scheme commitments.\n\nAbout 80 percent of the raw materials are locally sourced. We are well prepared to supply fertiliser to the market. With the current rains, we are moving into the distribution of top-dressing fertiliser, he said.\n\nAt Ran Gold Mines, the geology manager, Mr Rayn Rosenfields, said they have two resources, Ran and Kimberly.\n\nHe noted that the minability of the Kimberly resources is better compared to Ran, which is located on the side of a hill.\n\nThe life of the Kimberly mine is 12 months, and we can process 23 000 tonnes of gold ore per month. Before the end of next year, we have plans to increase this to 40 000 tonnes, translating to a million tonnes per year, he said.\n\nRan Mine officials expressed their gratitude to the Government, ministries, and departments for their support, which has allowed them to grow tremendously within three years.\n\nThe mine has transformed from processing 5 000 tonnes of gold ore per month in 2023 to the current 23 000 tonnes, with a target of 40 000 tonnes for next year.\n\n",

Given the forecast of good rains, we anticipate that the country will be able to sustain itself more consistently, moving away from the episodic weather-related challenges of the past. This diversified farm is truly remarkable, he said.\n\nHe also noted the success of the farms fishery and livestock operations, which use modern breeding techniques, resulting in an annual off-take of 250 steers from a herd of 1 000 head of cattle.\n\nWe have seen enterprising tobacco curing facilities that are powered by renewable energy; this is the way to go, he added.\n\nExplaining the distribution of resources, Minister Masuka said that 70 percent of the strategic grain reserve is concentrated in Mashonaland West and Mashonaland Central, with additional supplies in Mashonaland East.\n\nWe have enough to feed the 6,45 million rural Zimbabweans at 7,5kg per person per month until March, and we can also feed the 4,5 million learners from early childhood development to grade seven until the first term concludes, he assured.\n\nMr Kudenga expressed gratitude for the Governments support in enhancing their farming operations.\n\nWorking with the Government has helped us to improve our farming, and we are looking forward to some rainfall to enhance that view. Once the rainfall comes, we hope to surpass the mark of 12 tonnes of maize a hectare. We collaborate with all our stakeholders, from seed companies to the Governments irrigation departments, he said.\n\nWith such commitment and collaboration, the Government remains optimistic about the nations food security, ensuring that Zimbabwe is well-equipped to meet its agricultural needs.\n\n",

If thats not enough to keep its plants running, then the problems clearly run much deeper than competition from imports.\n\nThe anti-dumping duty comes on top of a 10 percent duty on imported long-rolled steel, which is the maximum allowable under SAs commitments to the World Trade Organisation.\n\nSAs steel industry is a sea of competing interests  some calling for further protection, others lobbying for more open markets.\n\nLast week, Gerhard Papenfus, CEO of the National Employers Association of South Africa (Neasa), called for the scrapping of import duties on all long steel products with immediate effect now that the company will no longer be involved in long steel production. The only purpose in keeping tariffs on long steel products is to generate revenue for the state.\n\nOthers have blamed Amsas woes on an oversupply of finished products in the domestic market, which has pushed long-steel products below international prices.\n\nAs the government and the industry grapple with an oversupplied steel sector and weak local demand, they must not prioritise saving the older, heavily polluting and poorly structured Amsa above all else, but rather look at saving as much of the whole steel market as possible, wrote Cape Gate chair Oren Kaplan in Business Day.\n\nAmsa should not be saved at the expense of the rest of the long steel industry.

Barring any unforeseen complications, the duos trial is expected to last a week.\n\nJustice Kwenda pointed out that the accused should, as respected businessmen, be eager to clear their names over the cloud of suspicion hanging over them.\n\nCombined with the serious implications of a potential 20-year sentence, Justice Kwenda reasoned that the incentive to interfere or flee is magnified. The court explained that the presumptive penalty for fraud involving public funds, particularly where the prejudice is significant, begins at 20 years imprisonment.\n\nThis starting point, the judge stressed, is dictated by sentencing guidelines that apply to cases involving aggravating circumstances.\n\nSuch a severe penalty, he argued, could easily spur the accused to abscond from the trial, irrespective of any surety offered.\n\nThe accused had attempted to assure the court of their intention to stand trial by offering title deeds to a property and surrendering their passports.\n\nHowever, the court dismissed these measures as inadequate, pointing out that the risks of interference and non-attendance of the trial far outweigh the value of such sureties.\n\nThe sureties cannot address the gravity of the charges or the risks involved, Justice Kwenda remarked, ultimately finding that the seriousness of the alleged crimes rendered the accused unsuitable for bail.\n\nAdding to their woes, Chimombe and Mpofu face another charge involving the loss of public funds for which no recoveries were made.\n\nThis separate case, ready for trial, carries a similarly severe presumptive penalty, further compounding the risk of flight. Moreover, indictment papers for yet another pending fraud case involving the two have already been prepared, and the trial is scheduled for this term.\n\nThe accused now find themselves entangled in a web of criminal proceedings, with the court noting that the multiplicity of cases against them creates an even stronger incentive to abscond.\n\nJustice Kwenda also addressed the defences concerns about delays, clarifying that the trial experienced only minimal interruptions and has been given priority over other cases.\n\nThe court has ensured that proceedings will not be unnecessarily protracted, with a conclusion likely in February.\n\nAs such, the judge found no reason to release the accused on bail when the end of the trial is within sight.\n\nIn dismissing the application, Justice Kwenda delivered a stern reminder of the courts duty to protect the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nAllegations in this case, rooted in the misuse of public resources, strike at the heart of public trust.\n\nThe accused, while entitled to the presumption of innocence, must remain in custody to ensure that justice is not only, done but seen to be done.\n\nThe severity of the charges, the strength of the States case, and the risks of interference and flight all converged to form an unassailable argument for continued detention.\n\n",

            "content": "Fresh inflation data released Wednesday is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on pause during its next policy meeting this month, even though a new reading did show some signs of easing.\n\nOn a core basis, which eliminates the more volatile costs of food and gas, the December Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed 0,2 percent over the prior month, a deceleration from Novembers 0,3 percent monthly gain.\n\nOn an annual basis, prices rose 3,2 percent.\n\nIt was the first drop on a core basis after three months of being stuck at 3,3 percent.\n\nThis latest inflation reading confirms a Fed rate cut skip at the January FOMC meeting, said EY chief economist Gregory Daco.\n\nThe new print wont change expectations for a pause later this month, but it should curb some of the talk about the Fed potentially raising rates, said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\n\nThe Fed next meets on January 28-29, and investors are nearly unanimous in their view that the central bank will leave rates unchanged after reducing them by a full percentage point in late 2024.\n\nWe are making progress on inflation, its just very slow, former Federal Reserve economist Claudia Sahm told Yahoo Finance Wednesday.\n\nCuts are not coming later this month, but that doesnt mean they arent coming later this year.\n\nNew York Fed president John Williams said after the CPI release that while I expect that disinflation will progress, it will take time, and the process may well be choppy.\n\nThe economic outlook, he added, remains highly uncertain, especially around potential fiscal, trade, immigration, and regulatory policies  a reference to possible changes that could happen as part of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nLots of Fed officials in recent weeks have been urging caution on future rate cuts.\n\nIn fact, the Feds December meeting minutes showed officials believed inflation could take longer than anticipated to reach their 2 percent goal, citing stickier-than-expected inflation data since past fall and the risks posed by new policies of Trump 2.0.\n\nThey noted the likelihood that elevated inflation could be more persistent had increased, according to the minutes, even though they still expected the Fed to bring inflation down to its 2 percent goal over the next few years.\n\nSeveral members of the Fed even said at that meeting that the disinflationary process may have stalled temporarily or noted the risk that it could.\n\nThe elevated inflation concerns help explain why Fed officials in December reduced their estimate of 2025 rate cuts to two from a previous estimate of four.\n\nInflation could show new signs of progress in year-over-year comparisons later in 2025s first quarter since in 2024 inflation spiked back up before declining again.\n\nFed governor Michelle Bowman may be the most worried of the Fed officials, saying last week that she could have backed a pause in interest rates last month but supported a cut as the last step in the central banks policy recalibration.\n\nKansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid, a voting FOMC member this year, said, I believe we are near the point where the economy needs neither restriction nor support, and that policy should be neutral.\n\nSchmid said he is in favour of adjusting rates gradually, noting that the strength of the economy allows the Fed to be patient.\n\nBoston Fed president Susan Collins, another voting member this year, also called for a gradual approach.\n\nWith policy already closer to a more neutral stance, I view the current nature of uncertainty as calling for a gradual and patient approach to policy making, Collins said. But DWS Group head of fixed income George Catrambone said the new numbers released Wednesday provided a sigh of relief for the Fed.\n\nBut there is still a lot of uncertainty ahead, as new policies from the Trump administration may affect the outlook.\n\nAs to when the Fed may first cut rates in 2025, if we dont see it by Jackson Hole, its not coming, Catrambone added, referring to an annual Fed event that takes place in late August.

Their expertise ensures that the project is progressing smoothly and efficiently, said Dr Nguwaya.\n\nWe anticipate that the installation will be completed by the end of February, marking a significant milestone in our waste management efforts.\n\nIn respect of waste-to-energy, Dr Nguwaya said there is need to replicate such processes in all cities and towns around the country.\n\nWe aim to have all cities in Zimbabwe adopt a waste management process similar to the sorting plants implemented in Harare aimed at enhancing efficiency in waste handling and promoting recycling, he said.\n\nActing director of health services for Mutare City Council Ms Unice Muyambuki appreciated the advanced waste treatment plant.\n\nIn Mutare, we are pleased to report progress in developing our landfill, having successfully drilled boreholes in 2024 to monitor groundwater quality. Our next step is to establish a leachate treatment plant. We have gained valuable insights and observed advanced technologies that streamline the process of constructing leachate treatment ponds.\n\nWe are accustomed to old methods of using containers for water flow and planting specific weeds to process heavy metals. However, I was amazed today by the new technology that effectively cleans the water permanently, said Ms Muyambuki.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Nguwaya said his engineers are in Lesotho conducting a feasibility study in preparation for the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Lesotho.\n\nThey will be returning to Zimbabwe soon, and we will sign the MOU with the government of Lesotho. We are prepared to begin work in Maseru to provide them with effective waste management solutions similar to those we have implemented in Zimbabwe, he said.\n\n",
