            "content": "Wallace Ruzvidzo in KAMPALA, Uganda\n\nAFRICA must produce its own food, clothing and essential goods, taking advantage of the abundant natural resources and rich heritage, President Mnangagwa has said.\n\nThe President made these remarks during a Presidential Dialogue at the 11th Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development here yesterday.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa, who is also the chairman of SADC, said the African continent must seize control of its development and future as Africas transformation will not occur by chance.\n\nLet us remain steadfast in advancing the implementation of both the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and Agenda 2063. That responsibility lies with us, the leaders and people of this great continent.\n\nAs Africa, we must take charge of our development and our destiny. Let us, therefore, re-commit ourselves to the guiding objectives of inclusive development, strengthening human capacities and eradicating poverty, in all its forms.\n\nThese must remain at the centre of our shared aspirations for a prosperous and peaceful Africa, he said.\n\nGoing forward, President Mnangagwa said Africa must jointly explore emerging technologies, as the continent stood a better chance of sustained development by maintaining a united front rather than as individuals.\n\nThese should include harnessing Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things to drive productivity, build globally competitive economies, and to boost intra-Africa Trade, he said.\n\nOn its part, the President said, SADC remained committed to the attainment of regional, continental and global goals.\n\nIn the context of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, the collective experiences of our countries are invaluable in nurturing evidence-based leadership, as we reflect, learn and co-create solutions towards a better tomorrow. In Southern Africa, our resolve in this regard, is firmly grounded in the SADC Treaty.\n\nPrimarily our objective is to promote sustainable and equitable socio-economic development as well as the eradication of poverty through regional integration, said the SADC Chair.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the SADC Vision 2050 places inclusive development at the heart of the regions long-term aspirations.\n\nWe, thus, continue to strengthen institutions, broaden partnerships and entrench governance models that are responsive to current challenges and emerging opportunities, he said.\n\nThe President said the regions abundant natural resources offered a unique comparative advantage that must be fully leveraged to create decent jobs, sustainable enterprises and economic development through sustainable value chains, especially in commodity sectors.\n\nIn this regard, through the SADC Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap, the region has identified priority value chains in agriculture and mining.\n\nFocus is on scaling up industrialisation, diversifying industrial sectors, infrastructure development, tourism,and ICTs among others, to ultimately stimulate intra-regional trade, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe said youth employability and skills development remained top regional priorities.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nRiding on the demographic dividend, SADC Member States are undertaking various education sector reforms to make education institutions Centres of Excellence for innovation, entrepreneurship and skills.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that our young people are equipped with the appropriate knowledge and skills for jobs of the future, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nAdditionally, he said, the region was scaling up investments in Technical, Vocational Education and Training, with a renewed emphasis on practical and digital skills to help young people and women to benefit from the ongoing technological and green transitions.\n\nSolutions and new products related to agri-tech, fin-tech, digital health and climate technologies, among others, have the potential to propel modernisation and industrialisation of the continent, the President said.\n\nIn the case of Zimbabwe, President Mnangagwa said the Second Republic was leveraging on the energy, creativity and innovativeness of the youth and has thus, established Innovation Hubs which are helping to spur inclusive development.\n\nIn 2024, my Government passed the Science Technology and Innovation Start-Up Bill, creating a legal framework for tax incentives, infrastructure access and public procurement reforms that favour youth led enterprises, he said.\n\nThe President said key to Zimbabwes development success milestones towards the realisation of SDGs and Agenda 2063, was Governments adoption of the Whole-of-Government Monitoring and Evaluation System.\n\nThis allows the real-time tracking and performance of national programmes across sectors, enabling data-driven and people-centred governance, improved transparency, accountability and more agile institutional responses.\n\nAt regional level, efforts by SADC Member States are also reinforced by the regions commitment to peace, security and good governance.\n\nWe recognise that political stability, the rule of law and peace within our borders, regionally and globally, are foundational to inclusive development and job creation, he said.\n\nSADC is implementing adaptation and mitigation strategies, which include climate-smart agriculture practices and the promotion of traditional crops.\n\nTo accomplish this, the SADC Chair said the establishment of irrigation infrastructure was being scaled up.\n\nIn the case of Zimbabwe, the provision of inputs to smallholder farmers that are specific to the respective climatic regions, along with the drilling of boreholes and establishment of nutritional gardens are having positive impacts on incomes as well as food and nutrition security, at the household level.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa and his counterpart President Museveni.\n\nThis transformational model is in-turn accelerating rural industrialisation, as well as the adoption of relevant technologies, which are backed by our strong traditional knowledge systems, all resulting in job creation at the community level, leaving no one and no place behind, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe said the SADC Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan 2020-2030 and the SADC Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap 2015-2063 were the main frameworks adopted to actualise Agenda 2063 and will go a long way in achieving SDGs.\n\nThis includes in particular, Goal Number 8, on decent work and economic growth. Employment creation and empowerment have been deemed central objectives in national development plans while the mainstreaming of these key cogs, across macroeconomic and sectoral policies, is also a priority.\n\nIn other words, we are of the view that our fiscal and monetary policies should simultaneously promote economic stability and job creation, said the President.\n\nAs climate change remains one of the greatest threats to developmental aspirations, President Mnangagwa said addressing its risks requires global solidarity, synergy, partnerships and investments.\n\nCalls for increased climate financing and technology transfer to Africa and the global south towards strengthening resilience and adaptation should remain pronounced. In our pursuit of inclusive growth, renewable energy has emerged as a vital enabler.\n\nThrough the adoption of an energy mix that best suits our realities, our continent must see more of our communities, particularly those in rural areas, having increased access to affordable and clean energy, said the President.\n\nHe said energy transition therefore, presented immense possibilities for green jobs for Africas youth and women.\n\nThe need for infrastructure financing, while being cautious of the risk of debt burden requires us to embrace innovative financing models to leapfrog sustainable development and economic growth, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nRegional collaboration in financing large-scale infrastructure projects is essential to drive connectivity and economic integration for shared modernisation, industrialisation and prosperity.\n\nSpeaking to journalists upon arrival at the Robert Mugabe International Airport in Harare yesterday, President Mnangagwa said SADC and the East Africa Community (EAC) came together in Uganda to map a way forward towards sustainable development.\n\nSo, in the meeting we held with the President of Uganda, we were able to discuss all these issues. Yes, other Heads of State were represented by their Foreign Ministers, but we were happy that it was a robust debate. And we were happy that both SADC and the East Africa Community were all represented in terms of respective countries from those two regions.\n\nAnd we resolved to pursue our goals as the two regions. Fortunately, from SADC, the chairman, and from the eastern region, the chairman was there. So, the two chairpersons were present. President (Yoweri) Museveni is our elder, so whenever we meet him we pay attention and learn from him. We were able to discuss issues facing our two regions. We are happy with the co-operation that is existing between the two countries, said the President.\n\nDuring deliberations in Uganda, President Museveni said Africa had the solutions to ensure sustained development.\n\nDeputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ms Amina Mohammed, said Africa must confront the hard truths and ensure bold solutions are cultivated for the continents continued development.\n\nThe Forum brought together Heads of State, former Presidents, Prime Ministers and Ministers, among other delegates.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa was accompanied by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Professor Amon Murwira, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube and Presidential spokesperson Mr George Charamba.\n\nThe President was received at the airport by his deputies Vice Presidents Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi, the Minister of Defence Oppah Muchinguri Kashiri, Cabinet Ministers, service chiefs and senior Government officials.\n\n",

Efforts are being made to convene the inaugural session of the long overdue Zimbabwe-Uganda Joint Permanent Commission on Cooperation, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe said it was important for the two countries to take advantage of the AfricanContinental Free Trade Area.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa asked for Kampalas support in Zimbabwes bid for a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) non-permanent seat.\n\nRussia, India, Cuba and countries in the SADC region have already thrown their weight behind Zimbabwes bid.\n\nI wish to request, my dear brother, Ugandas support in Zimbabwes bid for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council for the 2027-2028 period, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe expressed Zimbabwes appreciation for the support rendered by Uganda in calling for the unequivocal removal of sanctions imposed by the United States.\n\nI wish, my dear brother, to appreciate your relentless support for the removal of the illegal sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the Western countries. We thank you for that stance.\n\nThe President wished Uganda peaceful general elections in January next year.\n\nI am informed that you are likely to have an election in January 2026. I wish you, President Museveni, a peaceful election.

            "content": "Martin Kadzere-Senior Business Reporter\n\nZIMBABWE has started compensating white former commercial farmers whose land was acquired under the Land Reform Programme, marking a significant milestone towards resolving this long-standing issue and further opening pathways for the countrys arrears clearance and debt resolution.\n\nFinance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube announced that the Government had issued US$307.9 million in Treasury bonds and disbursed US$3.1 million in cash to 378 farmers.\n\nThe cash payment represents one percent of the US$311 million allocated for the first payment batch.\n\nTo date, the Land Compensation Committee has approved a total of 740 claims. The balance will be paid through a 10-year US dollar-denominated bond, Prof Ncube said.\n\nThe payment aligns with the revised Global Compensation Deed (GCD), an agreement between the Government and white former commercial farmers to pay US$3.5 billion in compensation for improvements made on the farms compulsorily acquired under the land reform programme.\n\nThis development follows the Governments commencement in February of compensating investors whose farms  protected by Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (BIPPAs) and ratified before the 2000 land reform  were repossessed.\n\nAccording to the Constitution, BIPPA farmers will be compensated for both land and improvements, while those who lost land through the fast-track land reform programme will be compensated for improvements only.\n\nOne of our commitments as we try to reform the Zimbabwe economy, to clear our arrears, is really to compensate the former farm owners who lost their farms during . . . the land reform programme, said Prof Ncube.\n\nWe have now begun to honour that agreement.\n\nThe bonds offer a fixed annual coupon rate of 2 percent to the holders and incorporates several key features designed to make them attractive and beneficial for the former farm owners.\n\nAll payments associated with the bonds, including the annual coupon payments, are entirely exempt from taxation. This is a significant advantage, particularly for elderly recipients, as it ensures the compensation is not reduced by tax liabilities.\n\nThe bonds are also designed for easy trading, with the Government intending to engage the Victoria Falls StockExchange to list them.\n\nThis will provide farmers with the flexibility to sell their bond holdings in the market if they require immediate access to funds before the 10-year maturity, Prof Ncube said.\n\nFurthermore, the bonds are recognised as liquid assets, signifying their immediate value and near-cash equivalence.\n\nThe bonds have been granted prescribed asset status, making them appealing to institutional investors like pension funds, potentially increasing demand and supporting their value and tradability.\n\nUnder the original 2020 GCD agreement, the farmers were scheduled to receive half of the US$3.5 billion compensation within the first year, followed by four annual instalments of US$437.5 million.\n\nHowever, facing challenges in raising the necessary funds, the Government re-engaged the farmers, leading to the revised compensation plan now being implemented.\n\nCompensation steering committee chairperson Mr Andrew Pascoe confirmed in an interview with The Herald yesterday that the initial payment was made about two weeks ago.\n\nMr Pascoe expressed confidence that more former landowners who were dissatisfied with the revised payment plan will now begin to apply for compensation.\n\nAs the word (about payment) goes out there, we expect the numbers (of applications) to also increase, said Mr Pascoe.\n\nLast year, the Government approved US$145 million in compensation claims for 94 BIPPA beneficiaries and started making disbursements early this year. The majority of these claims originated from the Netherlands (46), followed by Switzerland (27), Germany (14), Denmark (6), and Yugoslavia (1).\n\nA total of US$20 million has been paid so far.\n\nFarmer compensation is a key reform under Zimbabwes Structured Dialogue Platform for Arrears Clearance and Debt Resolution.\n\nEstablished in December 2022, the platform facilitates engagement with creditors and development partners, focusing on reforms across economic growth and stability, governance and land tenure, including farm owner compensation and BIPPAs.\n\nOutgoing African Development Bank (AfDB) president Dr Akinwumi Adesina was appointed to champion the dialogue, with former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano serving as facilitator.\n\nThe payments will continue. We are very serious about this. By settling our arrears, we can tap into long-term capital which is essential for infrastructure development and other significant investments, said Prof Ncube.\n\nThis is not just crucial for the Zimbabwean Government; it also impacts our private sector, which faces restrictions from creditors due to these arrears. Lifting these caps will facilitate access to foreign capital, making it easier to obtain financing to support our industries and create meaningful jobs for our citizens.\n\nDeputy Chief Secretary in the Office of the President and Cabinet, Mr Willard Manungo, who is also the Co-Chair of the Sector Working Group on Land Tenure Reforms and Compensation, said the payment was a demonstration of the Governments commitment to the countrys reform agenda.\n\nThese positive developments present Zimbabwe with a strong opportunity to successfully negotiate its arrears clearance and outstanding debt obligations. It is also a boost towards the countrys re-engagement efforts with the international community, said Mr Manungo.\n\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) resident representative to Zimbabwe, Dr Ayodele Odusola, commended the progress being made under the BIPPA settlements, the Land Tenure Reforms, the Compensation frameworks, and the initial disbursements under the GCD.\n\nThese steps are vital for restoring trust, advancing reconciliation, and rebuilding Zimbabwes agricultural sector. We remain committed to supporting a transparent, inclusive, and sustainable process that contributes to economic recovery and re-engagement, said Dr Odusola.\n\n",

            "content": "THE major remaining gaps contributing to the rural-urban divide are electricity and affordable internet access along with provision of safe available water supplies.\n\nSo there is little surprise that President Mnangagwa has led his Second Republic Government to fill these gaps and end the divide that tends to keep too many rural people with lower quality of life, despite the successful education and health initiatives that have largely filled other gaps.\n\nSo we have the Presidential Borehole Programme that is steadily drilling boreholes in every district until every village and every school has its own borehole and decent water supply. We have the Presidential Solar Electricity Programme, designed to ensure that every household has at least basic electricity supply for essentials from solar power if a grid connection is not possible.\n\nAnd now we have the Presidential Internet Programme approved by Cabinet this week to provide high-speed and broadband internet connection to every one of the 2 400 administrative wards across Zimbabwe.\n\nThese programmes have also been filling urban gaps, such as the urban boreholes, and the internet programme will work with all schools, but since services are so much easier to roll out in urban areas it will be the rural areas that will see the most dramatic progress.\n\nThe expansion of the mobile phone networks has largely ensured that a degree of internet access is available almost everywhere in Zimbabwe to everyone who has a smartphone, even a basic smartphone, and there is such a phone in the vast majority of households.\n\nBut the phone internet services are limited and data is sold at high prices, far higher than cable or satellite access and far higher than most people can afford, especially when they need broadband connections.\n\nThere are technical reasons why data is pricey on pure wireless telephone circuits, although the continual upgrade of the technology should reduce costs as the equipment on a tower can handle far wider bandwidths and quantities of data. The Government is already working to get the providers to be justifying costs and to be lowering data charges. But there will still remain inherent technical limits that require alternatives.\n\nThe point is that we need fuller and more affordable services when we want to use internet access to upgrade education, to provide clinics and hospitals with better access to expertise, to ensure businesses are fully linked, to make sure our development ministries can tie in their thousands of staff, and to give ordinary Zimbabweans access through some sort of community centre. This is what is behind the new Presidential programme which will use both terrestrial fibre optic cable connections, always the best and cheapest where there is cable, and low-orbit satellite connections where cable cannot be provided to ensure the critical centres across the communities are connected.\n\nThese are the schools and clinics, the business centres, the administrative offices and police stations, agricultural extension offices, courts, district development coordinators offices, vocational training centres and other obvious points. There is already a policy to set up community information centres across the country, and these will now be where ordinary people can come and access cheap or free broadband internet.\n\nFibre-optic cable is now available in most urban areas and can be extended easily to schools and other needed community centres that are not on the fibre grid. It should also be possible to extend fibre-optic cable into some rural areas, often having it ride piggyback on infrastructure that is already in place for cable phone and the electricity grid.\n\nBut that leaves a lot of places across rural Zimbabwe needing the other alternative, the low-orbit satellite networks. One such network is already licenced to operate in Zimbabwe and its competitors are catching up and will soon be able to offer similar services, with the competition helping to control prices.\n\nThe Ministry of Information Communication and Technology, Postal and Courier Services is following the dual strategy of getting the internet services to the desired community centres and on seeing how costs both at these centres and for the general public can be kept as low as possible.\n\nWe would hope that in many areas it will be possible to get a better density of community wifi centres by dual use. We would think that a community information centre could be opened next door to a connected school at very low cost, and could use the same connection, at least out of school hours. There will be other obvious ways of combining infrastructure.\n\nWe also note that the Presidential Internet Programme has to move along with the Presidential Solar Programme, since the schools and other centres need an electricity supply before a broadband internet connection. This makes much sense, so the developments will often come together in the more remote areas.\n\nTechnology is changing so fast in these digital fields that there may well be ways through innovative licencing and other systems to upgrade phone data while lowering its cost so we get the advantages of all systems. We can advance on a broad front.\n\nWithin a few years there should be no serious divisions between rural and urban areas when it comes to services, the divide being largely between those who farm for a living plus the service providers and processors within those communities, and those who work at jobs more conveniently done in urban areas.\n\nAlready housing standards have been converging as Government development programmes pump more cash into most rural households, and the devolution programme is making sure that rural people can get to health facilities nearer home and their children are within walking distance of schools.\n\nNow the trio of Presidential service programmes will over the next few years make sure that basic services reach all rural communities.\n\n",
