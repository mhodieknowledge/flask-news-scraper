He will allow his party Zanu PF and the country to elect his successor.\n\nThe Head of State and Government said this yesterday at State House during an interactive meeting with editors of various publications drawn from both the public and private media.\n\nThe meeting was facilitated by the Department of Presidential Communications in the Office of the Present and Cabinet headed by Deputy Chief Secretary in the Office of the President and Cabinet Mr George Charamba.\n\nIn the no-holds-barred meeting, President Mnangagwa fielded questions from editors focusing on all facets ranging from the economy, politics, international relations and the media industry.\n\nSoon after delivering his keynote address, President Mnangagwa tackled questions from editors with responses that showed how conversant he was with current issues and punctuated his answers with humour and satire.\n\nThe question of clarity regarding his tenure in the context of current efforts being made to extend it to 2030 took centre stage with editors taking turns to pose questions on the subject.\n\nThe editors sought reconciliation between what he has always said about his commitment to constitutionalism and the current efforts being made by people who feel that he ought to extend it.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa, flanked by Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Dr Martin Rushwaya, Deputy Chief Secretary for Presidential Communications Mr George Charamba, chief directors Dr Sadiki Maeresera and Dr Anywhere Mutambudzi, along with public and private media editors, listen to a contribution during an interactive session on national issues and developments at State House in Harare yesterday.  Pictures: Believe Nyakudjara\n\nThose pushing to have his term extended have cited the elaborate contribution President Mnangagwa has made in terms of signature projects that range from infrastructure, economic growth, agriculture and mining, among others, which saw Zanu PF resolving at its Annual Peoples Conference in Bulawayo last year to pass a resolution to extend his term to 2030.\n\nAsked to respond to growing calls for him to lengthen his term President Mnangagwa said:\n\nIts not imaginable that there is anybody in the country who can push me. I am very solid. I have always said I am a constitutionalist, I have my two terms when they come to an end, the country and the party will move on by electing my successor.\n\nOne editor appeared not to have been satisfied with the response and asked President Mnangagwa to make a pronunciation that would help in guiding the media. He said this is so, given what he felt was confusion and anxiety as some were still pushing for the term to be extended beyond 2028 even though he had consistently said he would not go beyond his constitutionally provided term limit.\n\nI thought you are putting it very clearly, that I am very clear, that I have two terms, and these terms are very definite, and I am so democratic. When they come to an end, I will step aside and my party will elect my successor that is as clear as day. Those who have other imaginations, its a democratic society for people to dream, but facts will carry the day, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nAnother editor asked President Mnangagwa what assurance was there that he would not be persuaded to shift from his well-pronounced position given the current efforts to have his term extended.\n\nI will persuade the persuaders not to persuade me so that I remain constitutional, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa, flanked by Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Dr Martin Rushwaya (right) and Deputy Chief Secretary for Presidential Communications Mr George Charamba, delivers his remarks during the interface with public and private media editors at State House in Harare yesterday\n\nThe President was also asked about the apparent disrespect of the party leadership particularly directed at some members of the Presidium by certain elements in the party and members of the public, particularly on national events such as burial of national heroes at the National Heroes Acre.\n\nI am so happy, this is the vibrancy of democracy.\n\nThe foolish and the wise both have their day. I think those who really are Zanu PF at heart go by the rules and decorum of Zanu PF. We have other people who are in Zanu PF, who in themselves are not Zanu PF, but they dress in Zanu PF regalia, so you must always see when people talk and see which camp they belong when they open their mouth, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nThe President has on several occasions been consistent that he will leave office once he has completed his two terms and would not violate the Constitution which he was equally instrumental in crafting during the constitution-making process which was eventually adopted in 2013.\n\n",

We feel the impact and repercussions of these changes of technologies even in our own sphere of Government which is supposed to be stable and traditionally change averse.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said things are no longer the same for everyone, and never will ever be, adding that all sectors are having to adjust.\n\nOnly a few days ago, I made new appointments to our Government which included a portfolio I never thought I would need to think about a few years back. Big nations think they now have the prerogative of planning their economies with our resources in mind.\n\nIt is as if national boundaries have been collapsed in their favour, evidenced by emerging laws on critical minerals which foreign blocs are drafting, but with African resources in mind. This is an emerging threat we now have to contend with.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa interacts with Herald Editor Victoria Ruzvidzo during a photo session after the interface at State House in Harare yesterday\n\nThe President said the Government was keen to share with the media industry their challenges and explore how it could assist to survive the headwinds of the global change.\n\nGovernment values a vibrant media industry, that vibrancy is underwritten by viability of the media as individual businesses.\n\nAbove all, our national media are part of our institutional identity markers, they must be sovereign and self-determining in thought, expression and in the interests, they express and defend, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe challenged the media to be well-informed as they interpret the society and developments, particularly in proffering directional insights on the political trajectory.\n\nYour profession is to read and understand that script, which we do not always write legibly, so you can report and comment on it. From where I sit, I am always fascinated and even amused by your attempts at reading and interpreting those politics we ourselves do.\n\nSome political issues you do report well, others with quite some dramatic imagination. All in all, I want to believe you do it all in good faith. Once there is purity of motive, which is to inform and serve the national interest, even lapses and failures, which are inevitable from time to time, will always have a ring of dignity and gallantry about them, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said he valued interactions with the media, as evidenced by his readiness to meet when a request was made.\n\nWhen my spokesperson, George Charamba consulted me on this edition of what I believe is going to be the first of many such to come, I readily acceded to it, more so given that this is the beginning of yet another year into my mandate, he said.\n\nAsked if he was happy with the performance of the economy given some turbulence that has seen some mainstream retail outlets such as OK Zimbabwe closing some branches, President Mnangagwa said:\n\nI would say that as a country or as an economy, we would have wanted to be better than where we are, but challenges continue to affect every economy, not only Zimbabwe but as a region and perhaps as a continent, but I am happy as Zimbabwe we are rising up to the challenge and we are doing our best to manage our economy and challenges facing it.\n\nFortunately, recently we had good rains and our economy is basically agricultural and we have a good season and its huge impetus with regard to the positive trajectory to the growth of our economy.\n\nThe President said the economy was doing better than what people would have expected given the yoke of illegal sanctions imposed by the West.\n\n",

We have been doing that and today we are here.\n\nSo we are here to thank you on behalf of the President. We are also appealing for you to shun social media abuse.\n\nThere are some who are always saying bad things about our leadership on social media. Those are not ZANU PF members or supporters.\n\nWe do not tolerate such wayward behaviour where the Presidium is always attacked on social media. Social media should be used responsibly, Cde Garwe said.\n\nHe said if not contained, social media could be used to destroy the revolutionary party.\n\nCde Garwe took the opportunity to enlighten people on Cde Blessed Gezas behaviour, urging them to stop listening to what ever he says.\n\nNow after we voted for the President, there are some like Blessed Geza who are saying ill things about the President. We believe that there are some people who are sending him to do that. To me, Geza is a sell out. He has completely sold out.\n\nIf he has things to say to the President, he should engage him and not resort to attack him on social media. As we speak, he is a wanted man for various offences he allegedly committed.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa had done a lot in a space of five years, hence he was the peoples favourite, said Cde Garwe.\n\nHe has done a lot, some which could not be done in the first dispensation. He is indeed a hard worker. Because of him, we are food secure. Every person who prepares plots for Pfumvudza/Intwasa programme received inputs. He is also reviving irrigation equipment in all farms.\n\nLast season, he made sure everyone is proofed from the El Nino-induced drought that affected most parts of Southern Africa, therefore no one starved. Remarkable strides have been made also in the education sector through Heritage Based Education 5.0. Our education system has been transformed.\n\nAlso in the health sector, the President made sure devolution funds are put to good use. A lot of clinics have been built for the benefit of the people. Road infrastructure is being improved.\n\nThe First Lady is, on the other hand working flat out to restore our culture and traditions. This is commendable.\n\nCde Garwe said besides being an excellent example of a hard and dedicated worker, President Mnangagwa was a unifier par excellence.\n\nHe is saying all of us, regardless of political affiliation, should join hands and build the Zimbabwe we want. He is saying Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo. No one should come and build this nation for us, only us as a people should do that. We do not expect other nations to come and build Zimbabwe for us.\n\nThe President is saying let us build this nation using our abundant resources and we are doing that.\n\nHe urged everyone present to always pray for the nation and ask God to continue blessing Zimbabwe.\n\nGo and pray without ceasing, pray for the nation, pray for Zimbabwe and pray for our President.\n\nIn his remarks, Murehwa ZANU PF District Coordinating Committee chair Cde Israel Maliki urged members to remain united, saying there is strength in unity.\n\nZANU PF is a party with direction. It is strong and is organised as well as united. The party is alive despite the fact that there are some who say ill things about the leadership on social media. As ZANU PF, we are supposed to remain disciplined and respect our leadership.\n\nBe wary of social media. There are some forces who are working restlessly to recolonise Zimbabwe and they are using social media. Now it is our duty to stop that. We must protect our party and our nation. It is uncultural to disrespect our leaders. We should have Ubuntu.\n\n",

We prefer stability to be prioritised at all costs, and the current level of stability, characterised by a declining parallel market premium, is a welcome development.\n\nIf this wave of stability is sustained, confidence in the Zimbabwean currency may begin to materialise.\n\nDr Dube also welcomed the introduction of interest payments on savings for both ZiG and US dollar accounts, though he noted that the interest rates, 5 percent for ZiG savings and 2,5 percent for US dollar savings, were still lower than bank charges, which might limit their attractiveness.\n\nSimilarly, Mr Tapiwa Karoro, president of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce, praised the RBZs movement towards a market-driven exchange rate.\n\nThe central bank has certainly made measures to try to move towards greater market-driven exchange rate determination.\n\nAs business, we are in favour of a market-driven exchange rate. Yes, we appreciate that this cannot be done overnight. Therefore, it needs to be underpinned by a very clear de-dollarisation roadmap with very clear milestones, where the market can move in tandem with the monetary and fiscal authorities in terms of knowing where we are as an economy and where we are as economic agents, said Mr Karoro.\n\nHe acknowledged the gradual process required for this transition, emphasising the need for a clear de-dollarisation roadmap with specific milestones.\n\nMr Sevious Mushosho, a board member of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers, urged the RBZ to establish a foreign currency facility for retailers.\n\nHe proposed a forex access window at the RBZ where retailers could obtain foreign currency at interbank rates by processing a certain percentage of sales in ZiG.\n\nThis would help prevent mismatches between local currency collections and foreign currency needs for supply payments.\n\nAdditionally, the organisations raised concerns about the high costs of compliance with regulations, which hindered business operations. They recommended providing incentives to encourage informal sector businesses to formalise their operations.\n\nIn response to the high compliance costs, President Mnangagwa has already directed that they be reduced to enhance business competitiveness.\n\n",

            "content": "While the Second Republics economic reforms have been driven by the need for Zimbabwe to have a permanent stable and expanding economy, with standards of living growing inexorably year after year, the general support for the policies by institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are useful indicators.\n\nIt is important that the reforms are driven by Zimbabwean needs and engineered by Zimbabweans, so that Zimbabweans take ownership of what is required. Any economic policy will have detractors, and we have seen this with the present tight monetary policy brining up opponents who see liquidity being kept tight.\n\nThe fact that many of those who complain about tighter liquidity also complained about the inflation and currency upheavals when liquidity was looser just shows that it is impossible to please everyone. So the Government and Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe need to be looking at the long term benefits for Zimbabwe, that is continuing economic growth every year and a reasonably stable economic environment, meaning very little currency instability and low rates of inflation.\n\nTight fiscal policies came into effect with the election of President Mnangagwa for his first full term in 2018. His new technocratic Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Prof Mthuli Ncube started as he meant to continue. The policy was ensuring that all Government expenditure was properly budgeted in advance and that very largely the Government would only spend what was raised from taxes, with borrowing kept low and basically only for that fraction of capital expenditure that saw an immediate and guaranteed stream of income that would service the debt.\n\nAt the same time tight monetary policies were put in place at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, with the printing that is the deliberate creation of money now stopped.\n\nWhile these two policies did stop State spending driving inflation, it became fairly obvious that there were a lot of other pressures driving inflation, many not normally part of standard economic theories, and it took several years to hunt down each particular tap, creating new money and close it down.\n\nSpeculation driven by cheap bank loans was one major tap, as were concerns in the private sector willing to build and use the black market, consumer-led credit schemes, and even the way the Reserve Bank was buying the then 25 percent of foreign currency that the exporters had to sell promptly.\n\nEventually each tap was closed and new ones do not seem to have been created. At the same time the Government and Reserve Bank started the process of building up gold and foreign exchange reserves, perhaps an old fashioned policy but one that works rather well, to cover all the local currency in existence, with a healthy margin of safety, and eventually to make sure that these reserves also, that means in addition, can cover six months of imports.\n\nDespite the wish to move more swiftly towards a single currency in all local business dealings, the authorities have noted that at present there are not enough ZiGs in existence to do this, and they have no intention to create new ones out of thin air to do this. The normalisation of the economy will be driven by strictly applied economics.\n\nIn its latest report the World Bank has recognised the major gains of such a policy, by hoping that the Government and Reserve Bank will maintain what they are now doing so well. The IMF has already noted that growth will be high in Zimbabwe this year.\n\nHaving the approval of the World Bank and IMF will be helpful for Zimbabwe as it continues its normalisation path, even if it was not the central reason for making the reforms that are now working.\n\nFor a start, it is a bit like a private company having a good audit report. Others feel far happier doing business with it, even though all the auditors are saying is that the company is as good as it says it is and auditors do not run the company. When the major multinational global financial institutions say you are doing what should be done, others take note.\n\nAt the same time this sort of positive commentary should help Zimbabwe in its present arrears clearance programme that is proceeding forward in a clear and deliberate fashion.\n\nThe final result of this is to be able to reschedule a good chunk of the inherited debt, with an approved payment plan.\n\nWith everything then cleaned up new money becomes potentially available, although Zimbabwe will be exceptionally careful about what it borrows for and how it borrows. Fairly obviously we need to make sure that any loans, even the very low interest development loans, can be serviced properly and repaid promptly.\n\nSo it is possible to borrow for power stations, for example, since Zesa can sell almost anything that is generated, and for dams, so long as towns and farmers pay economic prices for raw water, and even to accelerate road building along tolled highways, since the toll fees will pay off loans.\n\nBut other capital spending, especially health and educational spending, will still have to come from taxes as high fees cannot be set to pay back loans.\n\nWe would also note that a reasonable World Bank report also helps drive investment. People willing to sink their money in Zimbabwe will like to hear that we are doing things properly, helping to reduce non-business risks and so investors just have to work out if their investment will make the desired profits in a normal economic environment.\n\n",

            "content": "Brandon Moyo, Zimpapers Sports Hub\n\nZIMBABWE captain Craig Ervine says his side need to up their game and, crucially, stick to their processes if they are to win their One Day International series against Ireland.\n\nThe series, which ends today, is delicately balanced at 1-1 ahead of their decisive third match at Harare Sports Club, which gets underway this morning (9.30am).\n\nThat means there is all to play for, and Ervine does not want to see the Chevrons, who have struggled to win a series, come a cropper again.\n\nZimbabwe thought they had set themselves onto a victory path when they won the opener last Friday by 49 runs.\n\nBut the Irish bounced back to level matters with a comprehensive six-wicket victory at the same venue on Sunday.\n\nAnd Ervine, speaking after Sundays defeat, said they would not be looking too far ahead of themselves but stressed that his troops need to give their all on the field today.\n\nWe need to stick to our processes, said Ervine.\n\nWe need to stick to our plans, try and execute those as best we can, and also stay in the moment.\n\nYou want to go out there and you want to win, but there is a process to winning, and we need to stick to it.\n\nAll we can do is turn up on Tuesday (today) and try and give it our best shot again.\n\nHopefully, we can clean up on a few of those areas that went wrong today (Sunday).\n\nWe need to pull our socks up, and, hopefully, at the end of Tuesday, we can say that we were the better team on the day, he added.\n\nZimbabwe go into the match in search of their first series win since 2023, when they beat the Netherlands 2-1 in a three-match ODI series in Harare.\n\nAfter winning Fridays opener, the Chevrons were on Sunday asked to bat again and were bowled out for 245 runs in 49 overs with Wessly Madhevere and Sikandar Raza scoring half-centuries.\n\nIreland responded well with the bat, chasing down the target in 48.4 overs, finishing on 249/4 courtesy of two half-centuries from Paul Stirling and Curtis Campher.\n\nZimbabwe made one change to the team that had played in the series opener.\n\nTrevor Gwandu came in for Newman Nyamhuri.\n\nBut with Zimbabwe now on 77/3 in 17 overs, it was Madhevere and Raza who tried to rebuild the innings with a 74-run partnership for the fourth wicket.\n\nMadhevere was then trapped in front for 61 runs off 70 balls, his sixth ODI half-century.\n\nRaza, in his 150th ODI for the Chevrons, scored 58 runs after facing 75 balls. Wellington Masakadza chipped in with a handy 35 runs off as many deliveries, his new highest score in the longer format.\n\nAdair was the pick of the Ireland bowlers, finishing with figures of 4/54 in his 10 overs, while Campher picked up three for 13 in five overs. Graham Hume, Little, and Andy McBrine picked up one wicket apiece.\n\nWith the ball in hand, Zimbabwe once again lacked discipline as they gave away 23 extras, having conceded 28 in the previous game.\n\nStirling and Campher had a record-breaking 144-run second-wicket partnership.\n\nTheir brilliant stand is now Irelands highest second wicket stand against Zimbabwe in ODIs. Stirling scored 89 runs in the chase while Campher made 63 runs.\n\nGwandu picked up two wickets for the Chevrons. Three T20Is are lined up after the completion of the one-day games.\n\nThe three matches are scheduled for February 22, 23, and 25.\n\nAlthough it might be a weekday fixture, the Chevrons are expected to have a decent crowd rooting for them at Harare Sports Club as they seek an important victory that will hugely boost their confidence.\n\n",

            "content": "Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Bulawayo Bureau\n\nAT LEAST 40 people have drowned across the country since the start of this rainy season, among them, seven children who were swept away in the past four days.\n\nA five-year-old Early Childhood Development learner at Donkwe Primary School in Kezi, Matobo District, Matabeleland South, was swept away by a flooded stream on Friday afternoon while on her way home from school.\n\nPromise Ncube was travelling with two other five-year-olds after school had finished at midday. They had walked about 5km towards Sigwaza Village when heavy rains began.\n\nMatabeleland South acting police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Stanford Mguni, said the three small children started running towards home but encountered a fast-flowing stream on the way.\n\nThe other two learners managed to cross, but the deceased was swept away as she attempted to follow her classmates. Upon witnessing the tragic incident, her companions rushed home to inform their parents, who quickly attended the scene and managed to retrieve the body a few metres from the road, said Asst Insp Mguni.\n\nHe said police attended the scene and transported the body, which is awaiting a post-mortem.\n\nInvestigations are ongoing, but as the police, we continue to urge parents and guardians to always escort young children, especially during the rainy season. School authorities are also advised not to release such young learners to travel home unaccompanied, said Asst Insp Mguni.\n\nIn Mawabeni, Umzingwane District, Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) employees discovered the body of a seven-year-old boy floating in the filter at its slow sand filter at Mawabeni Water Supply yesterday while carrying out their duties.\n\nIn a recent report on rain-induced incidents and drownings, the Civil Protection Unit stated that on Sunday, a six-year-old ECD pupil at a Lupane school went missing and was later found dead in a nearby river.\n\nHer lifeless body was discovered trapped in roots, with scars on her face and private parts. The circumstances surrounding her death remain unknown, leaving the community shaken and searching for answers.\n\nThe District Civil Protection structures are intensifying education and awareness in communities about the dangers of rainfall season hazards, including crossing flooded rivers.\n\nThe biggest danger with crossing a river in flood is not so much the depth, but the speed of the flow which quadruples in force for every doubling of speed.\n\nThe CPU also reported that on Friday last week, heavy rainfall in Gokwe South, Midlands province, caused the Tare River to flood its banks. A group of over 50 members of the Johane Masowe eJerusalem Sect, who had taken shelter under the Tare River Bridge during a night vigil, were swept away by the flood waters while asleep.\n\n",
