            "content": "Wallace Ruzvidzo-Herald Reporter\n\nTHE introduction of bankable title deeds for State-owned land and the establishment of Mutapa Investment Fund have placed the national economy in a position of solvency in just six months, chairperson of the Land Tenure Implementation Committee, Mr Kudakwashe Tagwirei, has said.\n\nIn an interview on ZBCTVs Face the Nation programme, broadcast last night, Mr Tagwirei said the two initiatives were strokes of genius on the part of President Mnangagwa.\n\nMr Tagwirei explained that the new Land Tenure Implementation Programme, launched by President Mnangagwa on December 20 2024, had created an asset worth about US$13 billion. This was on top of the US$16 billion valuation of the Mutapa Investment Fund.\n\nYou know that our debt in this country is around US$21 billion. With one single stroke of genius from the President, he has solved the issue of the farmer who did not have access to finance; he has made sure that constitutional provisions are met (as regards the right to own and transfer land), and now Government has an asset.\n\nIf you are a businessperson like I am, one of the things you try and avoid is to be insolvent. You have heard comments, people saying Zimbabwe is insolvent as a country . . .\n\nWithin six months, the President has managed to make sure that this country is solvent, while ensuring that the farmer has got access to cheap finance, he said.\n\nMr Tagwirei expressed confidence that the work of the Land Tenure Implementation Committee would unlock huge economic benefits for all Zimbabweans, not just the estimated 380 000 direct beneficiaries of the Land Reform Programme.\n\nHe said the fees people would pay to get the bankable title deeds could raise in the region of US$13 billion, which would be placed in a fund administered by banks.\n\nPart of the money is going to be used to pay some obligations that Government has. Also, the fund is going to go towards infrastructure, and while another chunk of that fund is going to go to the farmers themselves so that they can access finance.\n\nBecause the very same fund is going to be used to build infrastructure, that is how our economy is going to grow. Not only that, remember we gave mortgages to these farms. It means Government has also got an (additional)asset.\n\nHe projected a huge leap in national GDP thanks to the Land Tenure Implementation Programme and the Mutapa Investment Fund.\n\nI believe that with this stroke of genius, our GDP is going to move from US$47 billion where it is right now, to in excess of US$65 billion.\n\nMr Tagwirei described the Land Tenure Implementation Programme as one of the best the world has ever seen, adding he was excited to be part of it.\n\nHe said the Land Tenure Implementation Committee had submitted recommendations to Government that would allow the issuance of two land-based mortgages that would raise money for agricultural operations.\n\nThe deed structured by the Land Tenure Implementation Committee will see beneficiaries of the Land Reform Programme who had 99-year leases, offer letters, and permits getting a bankable, registrable and transferable document.\n\nSaid Mr Tagwirei: The liberation objective was that we were going to take the land from those who stole it from us  Im just using crude words  and to make sure that it goes to the beneficiaries of this country, right? So what government did initially is that it took the land for the people, and now they are doing the second part of this dispensation, of making sure that the would-be beneficiary is given security.\n\nIn its first three months, the committee will facilitate the issuance of 2,000 title deeds, and then another 24,000 for both A1 and A2 farmers over 18 months.\n\nDuring that 18-month period, Mr Tagwirei said the Land Tenure Implementation Committee would also be reviewing the seamlessness of the system in place to ensure the nation derived maximum benefit.\n\n",

            "content": "Fungi Kwaramba-News Editor\n\nBANKABLE title deeds for State-owned land will not result in financial institutions seizing control of large tracts of land, or lead to the reversal ofthe Land Reform Programme,Chairperson of the Land Tenure Implementation Committee, Mr Kudakwashe Tagwirei, has said.\n\nSpeaking on ZBCTVs Face the Nation programme last night, Mr Tagwirei allayed fears that financial institutions would wrest land from beneficiaries of agrarian reform who would have failed to service loans extended under the scheme.\n\nThe businessman also laughed off speculation that he would personally grab land from indigent or defaulting farmers, adding that the issuance of title deeds would indirectly address aspects of multiple farm ownership, as is stipulated in the countrys Constitution.\n\nOutlining the processes and mandate of the Land Tenure Committee, Mr Tagwirei said it was impossible for banks to take ownership of what is essentially State land.\n\nThe land belongs to the Government, it does not belong to the bank. If you look at the total value of this land that we are talking about, the actual value is around US$20 billion. There is no bank that can give a mortgage for that land.\n\nSo what the banks are merely doing is administering the mortgage that this farmer is going to get (through Government) on that piece of land. The ultimate owner of this land still remains Government, its not the bank that owns it.\n\nWhen the bank is repossessing this land for whatever reason, maybe the farmer has failed to pay, remember that the owner is still the Government . . . ok? They (banks) will have to consult Government, obviously, when they are doing that process.\n\nHe added: One of the things that you must understand is that these farmers are supposed to be commercial farmers, not subsistence farmers. When you were applying to get that piece of land, you were saying I want to be a commercial farmer.\n\nAnd the risks that are associated with being a commercial farmer are that you must make sure that you work the land so that you are able to pay back.\n\nMr Tagwirei said because title deeds were allocated on the basis of an individuals unique national identification number, this could help address public concerns about multiple farm ownership.\n\nHe emphasised, though, that this was not the committees core concern or its mandate.\n\nSection 289 of the Constitution says that any citizen of this country is allowed to have access to land. A citizen is a person. Its not an institution. Its a person. A person is identified by an ID number. The ID number represents a person. You cannot have multiple ID numbers . . .\n\nWhen an ID is given to an individual, to a citizen of this country, the ID is a unique identifier to an individual. When we are issuing title to a farmer, the main focus point is the ID number; we will issue it on the basis of that ID number.\n\nWhen the bank repossesses this land  because a bank cannot take land  on behalf of Government,the bank cannot then own the land because they have no ID number.\n\nOn claims that he would use his financial muscle to gain control of land, Mr Tagwirei said at an average valuation of US$2,000 per hectare of arable land, it was ridiculous to think he could purchase it because he did not have that kind of money.\n\nSome people have even said Kudakwashe Tagwirei wants to take all this land for himself because he can buy it, which I cant because I dont have US$20 billion to buy this land.\n\nMr Tagwirei explained that banks would only administer a fund that would, among other things, provide affordable financing to farmers.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa launched the bankable deeds late last year as part of measures to unlock the value of Zimbabwes agricultural land and to grow the economy in line with national development targets.\n\nThe deeds are structured as per recommendations of the Land Tenure Implementation Committee, which brings together 14 experts from a variety of fields.\n\n",

It is the hope that during the first quarter, the hearings are going to commence. These are public hearings and the media to a certain extent is going to be allowed as regulated by the sector, said Mrs Mabiza.\n\nThat is the progress that we have recorded so far. Resources will never be adequate, but Im happy to announce that the Office of the President and Cabinet has availed some resources to take us somewhere and we are optimistic that the hearings will begin in the first quarter.\n\nNational Council of Chiefs president, Chief Mtshane Khumalo, expressed optimism about starting the hearings in February.\n\nI had a meeting with the Attorney-General Mrs Mabiza on Monday where we discussed the matter. We aim to commence the hearings in February if everything goes according to plan, he said.\n\nThis will be a busy period for us. Although we intended to begin shortly after the President launched the programme, resource constraints delayed progress. However, we are now ready to move forward.\n\nChief Mtshane highlighted the importance of the Command Centre, which will serve as a secure repository for testimonies. Located at the corner of Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo Street and Simon Muzenda Avenue in Bulawayo, the facility is undergoing renovations by the Department of Public Works to meet programme requirements.\n\nWe now have the Command Centre which will be used for the storage of our data. We are going to be using the offices that previously housed the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission. We have been assured that the offices will be secure, we have been promised security 24/7, he said.\n\nTraditional leaders will conduct hearings in villages, but testimonies will be stored at the Command Centre for security reasons.\n\nTo ensure smooth operations, the Government is hiring staff for the Command Centre and plans to provide vehicles for the 72 or 73 chiefs involved in the hearings.\n\nCars will be hired for all the chiefs involved to improve their mobility. The Office of the President and Cabinet will hire vehicles to enhance the mobility of chiefs and their teams during the hearings, Chief Mtshane said.\n\nAdditionally, a refresher training session for traditional leaders, including newly appointed chiefs, is planned, subject to funding availability. The public hearings are expected to play a crucial role in promoting healing and reconciliation while addressing unresolved issues from the past.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the Gukurahundi manual to guide the holding of victim-friendly public hearings at State House in Bulawayo in October 2022, President Mnangagwa emphasised the importance of unity. He noted that detractors have attempted to sow divisions, but the Government remains resolute in its commitment to fostering national cohesion.\n\nThe manual, developed through inclusive engagements between chiefs and various stakeholders, is a culmination of traditional leaders meetings with the President, which began in March 2019.\n\n",

As we are gathered here today, the global community is going through enormous transformation.\n\nTechnology is developing at an unprecedented rate, and this has a complex effect on national security.\n\nDr Muswere added that information, publicity and broadcasting is also not immune from the major transformations taking place in the world, making it imperative to reflect on evolutions of technology and their impact on national security.\n\nDeveloping nations continue to face foreign-funded propaganda through social media and radio stations, he said, resulting in massive misinformation to suit the aspirations of the funders.\n\nThis action, Dr Muswere said, is against International Telecommunications Union regulations.\n\n(Through) such interference, foreign nations are able to voice their opinions on African issues thereby interfering with issues beyond the reach of their geographical boundaries, he said.\n\nDr Muswere said the birth of the Second Republic had fast-tracked the connection of communities to the internet and extension of the radio signal to rural areas.\n\nNew television stations are mushrooming in all corners of the country. Since 1980, Zimbabwe only had one broadcaster and today under the astute leadership of our President Cde Dr ED Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe enjoys a flourishing information access economy, he said.\n\nTurning to social media, Dr Muswere said they continue to misinform society, hence the need to put some regulatory mechanisms.\n\nSocial media usage is on the rise and is consistently affecting mainstream media. As we speak, within the broadcasting industry, printed media circulation used to be 100 000 copies per day, but is now less than 10 000 copies per day (due to social media), he said.\n\nDr Muswere said revenue that used to support the local media industry is now being taken by social media channels, causing viability challenges for the mainstream media.\n\n",

In an interview yesterday, Sen Tshabangu dismissed claims that engaging with the ruling party amounted to betrayal.\n\nIt is certainly strange reasoning to suggest that an opposition which engages with the ruling party is selling out. How else should State affairs be conducted? Democracies across the world have healthy interactions between the ruling party and the opposition, he said.\n\nThe real issue is whether or not the opposition remains true to the independent political demands of its constituency.\n\nSen Tshabangu added that the oppositions engagements with Zanu PF reflect a commitment to advancing national interests while maintaining its independence.\n\nWe have maintained that the status quo is inconsistent with the objectives of the struggle for national liberation. Our engagements with the ruling party have asserted this contention, he said.\n\nSen Tshabangu called for a shift in opposition politics, urging maturity and a focus on home-grown solutions.\n\nThe tragedy is to assume that opposition should oppose for the sake of it. It is not enough to oppose. In fact, it is not the task of the opposition. The task is to offer alternative, objectively sound, and home-grown solutions made by Zimbabweans, for Zimbabweans, and about Zimbabweans, he said.\n\nTurning to Zanu PFs resolution to defer the 2028 elections to extend President Mnangagwas term until 2030, Sen Tshabangu said the CCC had not yet deliberated on the matter.\n\nThat issue has not been considered by the party. At present, it is a matter internal to Zanu PF. Zanu PF has neither approached us on the issue nor presented it in the appropriate legislative body for deliberations, he said.\n\nSen Tshabangu said the issue of the deferring of elections has not arisen in any of their party meetings, stressing the importance of understanding and debating the reasons behind any proposal to defer elections.\n\nIt will be important to understand and debate the reasons for the argument of the deferring of elections and how that benefits us as a people and country. Deferring elections cannot be an end in itself, he said. On the question of CCCs internal structures, Sen Tshabangu acknowledged the need for a congress to elect substantive leaders.\n\nCongress is an absolute necessity. We are in the process of strengthening the party to prepare and have a congress. It will happen as soon as the conditions permit, he said.\n\n",

In response, the District Civil Protection Committee is swiftly assembling a rescue team to ensure their evacuation.\n\nTragically, the rains have also led to drownings, while artisanal gold miners have also been particularly affected.\n\nIn Hwedza, three miners lost their lives in a mine shaft disaster on December 27, with their bodies retrieved on January 3.\n\nThere are recommendations to close the Chikomba mining area given the recurrence of these incidents, a department representative noted.\n\nIn Makaha, Mudzi district, three miners remain trapped underground after a shaft they were working under caved in about 14 days ago.\n\nOne miner managed to escape, and rescue efforts are ongoing, with a 24-hour command centre established, comprising personnel from the police, army, health officials, mines chiefs, and the Environmental Management Agency (EMA).\n\nAll the trapped miners are of the same family from Mateta 1 Village under Chief Chireya in Gokwe, officials reported, drawing attention to the personal tragedies hidden within this disaster.\n\nIn Mberengwa, two miners died after a shaft they were working under collapsed last Thursday.\n\nFlash floods also hit Mbare, Harare, on January 8, inundating homes near the new Mbare Traders temporary market, a development that underscored the challenge of poor drainage faced by local authorities.\n\nIn Mashonaland Central, the storm unleashed devastation on Avonda Farm along the Bindura-Harare highway on January 7, affecting 11 households.\n\nRoofs were ripped, leaving families vulnerable.\n\nIn response, the Department of Civil Protection provided essential relief items, including rice, tinned beef, and sanitisers.\n\nAs the rains continue and the impacts deepen, communities are left grappling with the aftermath, and with more rains expected today and tomorrow, more people and infrastructure could be affected by natures fury.\n\n",

We are preparing to launch the NDS-2 agenda into next year, 2026. So by the end of the year, we will be launching a document, which is the NDS-2 document, which again will seek to drive further transformation of our economy and leaving no one and no place behind in doing so, said Prof Ncube.\n\nGovernment will continue creating an enabling environment for sustainable and inclusive economic development through enunciating and implementing robust policies aimed at consolidating the gains already made in the countrys economic development in line with Vision 2030.\n\nProf Ncube said the Government would re-impose duty on imported buses to improve local production.\n\nWe will re-impose duty on completed buses that are imported. Again, you can see where we are going. We want to support local production of vehicles including trucks and buses. We believe that these policies will go a long way in supporting the economy, in supporting resilience, in supporting the transformation of the economy, said the Minister.\n\nThe Minister noted that the current rains have rejuvenated hopes for a better harvest following a dry spell at the beginning of the season.\n\n",

            "content": "Asignificant majority of the working population of Harare Metropolitan rely on public transport to get to and from work, and during the school term they are joined by a large group of schoolchildren who attend schools beyond normal walking distances.\n\nThe overwhelming bulk of vehicles involved in this major movement of people every day are privately-owned, Zupcos contribution now being minimal outside the dedicated services for a range of civil servants.\n\nThis means that proper standards and requirements need to be set, and then enforced, to ensure high levels of safety for the passengers as well as ease of use, a requirement not always highlighted by Harare City Council, although it should be.\n\nIn the absence of the city council showing any interest whatsoever, the police have taken on the burden of enforcement, at least so far as the registration, licensing and insurance of kombis is concerned and the continuing effort to get pirate taxis, the mushikashikas, off the roads since they cannot be registered and insured for the sort of public transport service they offer.\n\nThe problems of the terminuses in the city centre and the ranks in the city centre and many suburban areas has so far been left to the city council who, after a brief surge of energy for a few weeks last year when they did manage to contain the touts, have relapsed back into total inactivity and allowed protection rackets to resume to the detriment of both the passengers who need to board kombis and the drivers and owners of the kombis.\n\nThe police estimate that only around 2 950 kombis are properly and up-to-date registered for public transport in Harare Metropolitan, with more than 13 000 others existing, but not compliant or fully compliant with the requirements.\n\nSome of these are not even runners and will never return to the roads, but there is a large group that are offering services, but whose owners need to go through the procedures and get all the permits and licences required.\n\nA compliant kombi owner needs the normal ZINARA licence and vehicle insurance.\n\nBut as a public service vehicle the kombi needs the operators licence, requiring in turn a Zimra tax clearance certificate, the additional passenger insurance, the red on white registration plates including the third plate so there cannot be substitution, a certificate of fitness, a City of Harare permit, RMT route authority and a City of Harare rank disc.\n\nNone of this is impossible to obtain, and the fact that almost 3 000 kombis have the required paperwork, discs, plates and the like shows that it is routine for an operator who keeps the kombi in shape and pays the required fees.\n\nThe rest need to get their roadworthy kombis fixed up so all offering services are compliant.\n\nBut it is a fair amount of paperwork to display at a police checkpoint and we think it should be possible to work out some way of obtaining advance clearance and a single combined pass of some sort so that compliant kombis are not held up at checkpoints and passengers delayed.\n\nThis requires a degree of trust and the police could limit the special passes to kombis owned by operators who belong to reputable associations.\n\nAnother way of enforcing the rules without causing delays and congestion would be to enforce the rules about dropping off and picking up passengers.\n\nGenerally this must be done at the four city centre terminuses and associated ranks since the terminuses are generally on the small side.\n\nWe also think the city council should be willing to have more bus stops at suitable points so people can be dropped off nearer where they need to go. There is also that problem of no central bus station, with three of the four terminuses to the west of the city centre and one, the largest, well over 1km to the east.\n\nKombis should be allowed to loop around the city centre so they can drop off passengers at both groups of terminuses.\n\nAt some stage, the city council and the National Railways of Zimbabwe need to work out how to use that huge railway reserve at the south of the city centre as a proper railways station for commuter and long distance travel plus the huge central bus station next door, which in a multi-storey structure could include a huge vendors market and get traders off the pavements.\n\nThe railways could be compensated for the land they surrender to buses by land in Aspindale and other suitable areas.\n\nThe existing terminuses are maintained to a degree by the kombi crews that use them, although there are limits what they can do.\n\nThe city council, as expected, does nothing and there are not even proper rubbish bins for the vast amount of litter, instead piles of rubbish accumulate in informal dumps just outside as the users try and keep the rest of the area clear.\n\nKombi owners are prepared to pay modest charges to proper terminuses operators, rather than see their drivers extorted by touts, and would be more willing to pay if that money was used to upgrade and maintain the terminuses, with municipal staff keeping order and touts away, vendors prevented from grabbing bus bays for their stalls, proper garbage bins regularly emptied, decent public lighting, passenger shelters repaired or installed, and generally speaking creating modern clean bus stations for the passengers.\n\nThis sort of set up, with unauthorised stops prevented and all loading done at a terminus, make enforcement of the kombi rules simple, as police could just walk down the line and check over the permits, without having to have road blocks or checks. Patrols could prevent quiet parking away from the terminuses by the non-compliant.\n\nBy upgrading terminuses, allowing sensible legal bus stops and generally looking at the passengers as well as the kombis, Harare City Council could make the city centre a far more friendly place for public transport, which it must do as car ownership rises.\n\nEvery kombi replaces around 50 or so private cars, and having all those in the city centre will create total gridlock congestion.\n\nSo we need safe, efficient and passenger-orientated public transport and that requires co-operation between the police and transport operators, which is now happening as the police make it clear they will enforce the rules and so the non-compliant operators are fixing their paperwork.\n\nBut that is just the start. The upgrade also needs more cooperation between police and operators and the city council, with the council giving a lot of thought to the sort of services its residents who use public transport require and want, so that terminuses, bus stops and ranks are properly provided, are safe and at least clean and free of touts.\n\n",
