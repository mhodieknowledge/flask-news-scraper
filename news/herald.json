The State opposed bail on the basis that Mhlanga is a flight risk and is likely to interfere with witnesses.\n\nThe State also said Mhlanga is likely to commit offences of the same nature if granted bail.\n\nThere is a likelihood that he will commit similar offences. The same machinery he used in the present case that is before the court is yet to be recovered by the police and procedures to recover the same have commenced, said the State in opposing bail.\n\nIn opposing bail the State called Josphat Chitamira from CID Counter Terrorism Unit , who said there are 10 witnesses who are Mhlangas workmates hence his fear is that he will influence them which will prejudice the investigation.\n\nIn response Mr Mhike said the State failed to proffer evidence on why his client is not a proper candidate for bail.\n\nHe proposed bail in the sum of US$100 and for Mhlanga to reside at his given address. Mr Mhike also said his client can also be ordered not to interfere with any State witnesses.\n\nIt is alleged that on January 27 this year by Mhlanga used a computer to record a video of one Blessed Runesu Geza and made the video available to members of the public by transmitting and broadcasting the video through an internet platform called\n\nYouTube,HSTVzimlive.co.zw. intending to incite members of the public to commit acts of violence.\n\nThe court heard that the broadcasted videos contained statements intended to incite members of the public to commit public violence in Zimbabwe.

            "content": "Sifelani Tsiko\n\nInnovations Editor\n\nVultures, at risk of extinction, are providing southern African countries with an estimated US$1,8 billion worth of ecosystem services a year, a new study has revealed.\n\nThe assessment, carried out by the conservation group BirdLife International, found that vultures which help to stem the spread of disease by eating carcasses in the wild, have a huge value to ecosystems of southern African countries.\n\nAccording to the report which focused on Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia, vultures provide ecosystem services including bequest values, sanitation and pest control services totalling US$1,8 billion per year.\n\nThis includes sanitation and pest control services to human health.\n\nThe decline of vulture populations across the continent is indeed worrying. This groundbreaking study on the economic value of vultures in the region is crucial in advancing conservation efforts, said Matthew Lewis, head of conservation, Africa at BirdLife International.\n\nBirdLife and partners will continue to collaborate with stakeholders in the region to turn the tide for vultures in Southern Africa.\n\nSaid Leeroy Moyo, preventing extinctions programme manager at BirdLife Zimbabwe: As BirdLife Zimbabwe, this report is intended to support policy advocacy for vulture conservation.\n\nIt seeks to enhance awareness among local communities and stakeholders regarding vultures essential role in maintaining ecosystem health and promoting human well-being.\n\nBy integrating these findings into national conservation strategies, he said this could help mitigate threats such as poisoning, habitat loss, and illegal trade supporting a sustainable future for vulture populations in Zimbabwe.\n\nAbout seven of Africas 11 vulture species are at risk of extinction. They are listed as Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.\n\nVultures are an important scavenging species that help stem the spread of disease in Africas ecosystems by eating carcasses that would otherwise rot.\n\nOther scavengers like rats and jackals eat carcasses and then go after livestock or become pests to humans.\n\nExperts fear that if vultures are removed, the numbers of rats and jackals will increase, thereby posing a threat to humans.\n\nVultures, essential for maintaining ecological balance by scavenging on decaying carcasses, have experienced alarming declines, with African vulture populations plummeting by 80 to 97 percent over the last five decades, with some species facing a decline of over 92 percent.\n\nThe main threats include poisoning (responsible for 61 percent of recorded vulture deaths across Africa), belief-based use (29 percent) and electrocution by energy infrastructure (9 percent).\n\nEnvironmentalists say halting and reversing these declines is now imperative to prevent vultures extinction.\n\nMary Malasa, programme manager at BirdWatch Zambia said: Quantifying vultures role as natures clean-up mechanism strengthens the case for their conservation. This valuation will serve as a tool not only to raise awareness but to ensure that the role of vultures in the ecosystem is appreciated.\n\nIn Southern Africa, widespread poisoning of vultures through secondary poisoning poses a severe threat to vultures, with incidents such as the mass poisoning in Botswana in 2019 resulting in the death of over 500 critically endangered vultures.\n\nOther threats include the presence of diclofenac in carcasses, which has also compounded the fight to save the scavengers from across the world.\n\nBirdLife International and its partners commissioned the study to evaluate the value of vultures in the African context and the impact of not having vultures in the ecosystem.\n\nVultures are worth much more to society in saving health service costs and the significant revenue generated in the tourism sector as well.\n\nThe decline of the scavengers can have serious knock-on effects on other species.\n\n",

COSECSA, and indeed the entire region, is poorer without him, but richer for having known and benefited from his extraordinary life and work. May his soul rest in eternal peace.\n\nProf Kakande, a distinguished surgeon and scholar whose career spanned over 50 years, died on February 18 at the age of 81.\n\nThe Ugandanborn eminent scholar played a pivotal role in the formation of COSECSA in 1999, a milestone that revolutionised surgical education and practices across the region.\n\nFor more than 15 years, his compatriots say, Prof Kakande served with distinction on the governing council and executive committee of the college, contributing significantly to its growth and establishment as a premier academic institution.\n\nHis visionary leadership and tireless efforts laid the foundation for COSECSAs enduring impact on surgical training and healthcare in Africa.\n\nOne of Prof Kakandes most enduring contributions was his stewardship of the East and Central African Journal of Surgery (ECAJS).\n\nHe served as its editor-in-chief from 1995 to 2016, taking over from Professor John Jellis, who had founded the journal in 1975 under the name Proceedings of the Association of Surgeons of East Africa.\n\nUnder Prof Kakandes guidance, the ECAJS evolved into a respected peer-reviewed publication, showcasing the innovations, challenges, and triumphs of surgical practice across the continent.\n\nHis commitment to advancing surgical knowledge and fostering academic excellence has left an indelible mark on the field, Dr Muteweye said.\n\nProf Kakande qualified as a surgeon in the early 1970s and dedicated his life to the practice and teaching of surgery.\n\nHe served as a surgeon and lecturer at several leading institutions, including the University of Nairobi (from 1977), Makerere University, and the National University of Rwanda.\n\nOver the decades, he trained and mentored hundreds of surgeons across the COSECSA region, earning a reputation as a fatherly figure who was deeply respected and admired by his peers and students alike.\n\nHis wisdom, humility, and unwavering dedication to his craft inspired countless individuals to pursue excellence in surgery, Dr Muteweye said.\n\nLast December, Prof Kakandes contributions were celebrated when he joined delegates at COSECSAs 25th anniversary celebrations in Zimbabwe.\n\nHis presence at this milestone event was a testament to his enduring commitment to the college and its mission, said Dr Muteweye.\n\nProf Kakande will be best remembered for his commitment to building a platform for African surgeons to showcase innovations, discuss challenges and find mechanisms to improve surgical practice across the African continent.\n\n",

It is through such engagements that we can refine these guidelines to ensure they drive effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability in our climate response efforts, Mr Musi said.\n\nThe development of these guidelines marks a milestone in Zimbabwes climate policy framework, aligning with National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) and international commitments under the Paris Agreement.\n\n",
