            "content": "Zvamaida Murwira in KWEKWE\n\nPRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday delivered the historic first batch of title deeds to beneficiaries under the Land Tenure Implementation Programme as the Second Republic bolsters land ownership that will put an end to the issue of tenure and security.\n\nThe tenure system will revolutionalise the Land Reform Programme embarked upon by the Government from the year 2000, and ensure bankability and transferability of title.\n\nThe President launched the programme at Pricabe Farm in Kwekwe, a property owned by the First Family.\n\nIt was a colourful ceremony attended by Cabinet Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, service chiefs, traditional leaders, farmers and captains of industry, among others.\n\nIn his keynote address, President Mnangagwa described the event as a significant milestone in the countrys journey towards the attainment of Vision 2030.\n\nIt is with a great sense of pride and joy that we gather here on this historic day to highlight another accomplishment of the Second Republic, he said.\n\nI welcome you all to Pricabe Farm. My Government is charting a new transformative and inclusive development agenda encapsulated in our National Development Strategy 1 (NDS 1).\n\nThis is consistent with the collective aspirations and determination of the people of our great nation to become an empowered and prosperous upper middle-income society by 2030.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said it was through such relentless pursuits that Government was determined to deliver broad-based transformation, wealth creation and provision of economic opportunities for all Zimbabweans, leaving no one and no place behind.\n\nThe land in our great motherland is an indispensable economic enabler to the attainment of our vision, more so that agriculture is at the epicentre of our national transformative agenda, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the land holds deep historical significance as its ownership can be traced back to the First Chimurenga, adding that the countrys forebears fought tirelessly for the right to keep the land.\n\nThe Second Chimurenga reclaimed this land in 1980 when we won our Independence. The Land Reform Programme, undertaken in 2000, remains a cornerstone of our national identity and an essential pillar for our economic independence.\n\nWe fought the liberation war to get back our land, ivhu rave nevene varo, vene vevhu vave nevhu ravo.\n\nThe land is irreversibly with its people, and the people irreversibly with their land. The Land Reform Programme is, therefore, irreversible, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the national Constitution recognised the importance of land in agricultural productivity.\n\nOur Constitution binds us to strengthen the Land Tenure System of 99-year Leases and A1/A2 permits. The Constitution, in sections 289, 293 and 295, gives rights to every Zimbabwean citizen to acquire, hold, occupy, use, transfer or dispose of agricultural land.\n\nLand tenure security is critically important to Zimbabwes economic growth and development.\n\nIt encourages investment, improves agricultural production and productivity, and lifts many out of poverty into prosperity, he said.\n\nWith secure land tenure, the President said, farmers can access credit facilities, buy inputs and hire labour, ultimately increasing their yields and incomes.\n\nAs such, the importance of more secure, bankable and transferable land tenure cannot be overstated. Such a tenure document is the ultimate empowerment tool for our farmers, especially war veterans and their children.\n\nThe title deed, which my Government has developed for issuance to farmers, will preserve security and spur investment for accelerated livelihoods upliftment and economic development, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nMy administration has, therefore, made a bold decision to empower the beneficiaries of the Land Reform Programme by giving them tenure that will unlock the value of our land, allowing it to be used as collateral.\n\nWar veterans, whose sacrifices won the countrys independence and the land, must not be left behind, added the President.\n\nYouths, women and people with disabilities should also be considered for the title deeds.President Mnangagwa said the need to safeguard the land andpreserve the liberation struggle gains is paramount.\n\nIn this regard, land transfers shall be amongst qualifying Zimbabweans, he said.\n\nThe President implored financial institutions to embrace the title deeds in order to improve farmers access to finance and capital, which is critical for production.\n\nLet me reiterate my Governments commitment to ensuring that land distribution is fair, transparent, and beneficial to all Zimbabweans.\n\nThe handover of these title deeds is a testament to our commitment to empower Zimbabweans  the estimated 23 500 A2 farmers and estimated 360 000 A1 farmers, he said.\n\nFarmers were reminded that the land must be used judiciously and responsibly.\n\nAs you are aware, the land vests in the President on behalf of the State. The State is, therefore, transferring the land to each holder of a valid land tenure document.\n\nThis new tenure system will be the ultimate anchor of our Land Reform Programme. To the recipients of this new tenure document, I challenge you to use this to defend the revolution, unlock investment and increase production, productivity, profitability, viability, and sustainability to accelerate agricultural transformation.\n\nThe President commended the Land Tenure Technical Committee chaired by businessman, Mr Kudakwashe Tagwirei, for its excellent and meticulous contribution to the success of the initiative.\n\nYour dedication is deeply appreciated. Your selfless contribution is a true testimony to the mantra, Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatigwa, nevene vayo/ Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe, ngabanikazi balo.\n\n",

It marks a landmark development to unlock value to the Land Reform Programme, said Dr Masuka.\n\nLand Tenure Implementation Committee chairperson and businessman, Mr Kuda Tagwirei, said the land tenure system unveiled by the Government is unique.\n\nYour Excellency, I am a businessman. From history and my study, I have never seen a better empowering programme like this in the whole world, said Mr Tagwirei.\n\nHe said his committee will facilitate the issuance of 2 000 title deeds in the next three months and more than 24 000 title deeds for both A1 and A2 in the next 18 months.\n\nWe believe that all these farmers will be able to access loans from banks, said Mr Tagwirei.\n\nThose who got the title deeds yesterday include President Mnangagwa, who was awarded for leading the agricultural revolution by example at Pricabe Farm.\n\nOthers are Mr Lester Chizunza from Manicaland Province, Public Service Commission chairperson, Dr Vincent Hungwe, former Cabinet Minister Dr Herbert Murerwa, Chief Vengai Rushwaya from Gutu in Masvingo Province, Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Cde Tsitsi Gezi from MashonalandCentral Province and Mr Egypt and Miriam Kakono from Mazowe district in Mashonaland Central province.\n\nOthers include Minister of State for Masvingo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Ezra Chadzamira, Mrs Mangamela Sibanda from Matabeleland North province and Ntambeleni Ndou from Beitbridge district in Matabeleland South Province.\n\nIn an interview, Mr Chizunza described the issuance of title deeds as crucial to his farming operations.\n\nI want to thank President Mnangagwa for taking a bold decision because the issue of transferability and bankability has been a huge impediment.\n\nThose who lent money never looked at the productivity of a farmer but at security; they were worried about what would become of their money should one be removed from the property, said Mr Chizunza.\n\nDr Murerwa said the issuance of title deeds is a huge step in the right direction.\n\nWhen you have title you are able to invest knowing fully well that you have security of tenure and you also have access to capital.\n\nThis will unlock a lot of poductivity on the farms, said Dr Murerwa.\n\nYesterdays event was attended by Cabinet Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, Service Chiefs, traditional leaders, captains of industry and farmers among others.\n\n",

I joined one of the biggest teams in Russia called Spartak Moskow, bigger than DeMbare here in Zimbabwe (Dynamos F.C). I came through the ranks as a teenager and trained hard to play in the first team but my parents decided I must be a diplomat since many people in my lineage were diplomats.\n\nMy career path changed but I learned a lot through football, you have to set goals and try to do the best in everything you do. Through hard work and discipline, you can make it in life, added the Ambassador.\n\nThe Russian Ambassador challenged the children at Chambuta to work hard in school.\n\nChildren at the Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa childrens home enjoying a sumptuous meal during a Christmas party organised by the First Lady yesterday\n\nI failed my first exam but that did not deter me from pursuing my objective I studied hard and eventually passed before I was admitted and this is where I am today.\n\nMy message to you today is not to give up but to be resilient and use this platform that the First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangangwa has given you to launch your careers.\n\nThe Ambassador also made donations to the home, which included footballs.\n\nDr Auxillia Mnangangwa Childrens Home formerly Chambuta, is now home to 58 boys who were living in the streets.\n\nSome suffered from drug abuse but their story is now different after they were rescued by the First Lady.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries of the First Ladys benevolence at Chambuta, Joshua Emmanuel, showered praise on the Mother of the Nation for transforming his life and other former street children at the home.\n\nI want to appreciate and thank the First Lady, Dr Auxillia Mnangangwa for taking us out of the streets, he said.\n\nWe go to some of the best schools in the province (Masvingo) where we are taught different things. Some are good in sports like soccer and basketball while others are doing well in academics and we are glad we are being supported in everything we do.\n\nWe have good shelter here. We are also taught a lot of life skills here at home such as animal husbandry and horticulture projects and the knowledge will help us and the country at large, he said.\n\nWe have good food and clean water and we also have a good library for our studies as well as a computer laboratory for ICT projects so I can safely say this is the best place and all this is because of the love from our lovely mother Dr A Mnangangwa, added Emmanuel.\n\nAmbassador Krasilnikov also handed out Christmas presents to the boys and mingled with them.\n\nThe children were very happy as they enjoyed meals while wearing their medals around their necks.\n\nThe Ambassador also personally prepared a fire and served the children a Russian traditional meal despite the scorching heat in Chiredzi.\n\n",

In 2018, Nigeria also received ADF support of UA 10.21 million to invest in ATIDI, said the SADC Secretariat.\n\nMr Magosi conveyed SADCs heartfelt gratitude to the AfDB for sharing the blocs vision in partnering with its endeavours to fast-track the operationalisation of the RDF.\n\nHe also underlined that with this level of commitment, SADC could not afford to fail in making the RDF operational for use without delay.\n\nWhile the AfDB has committed resources and support, member states must do their part to ensure the exercise is successfully concluded, said the SADC Secretariat.\n\n",
