            "content": "South African musician and actress Winnie Khumalo has died at the age of 51. Sunday World can exclusively reveal that Khumalo died on Tuesday at her home after a short illness.\n\nMedia personality, Sabelo Ntombeningi Sithole was one of the first few people to be contacted by Rethabile Khumalo, Winnies daughter.\n\nConfirmed by close friend.\n\nI was contacted by Rethabile, and I could hear from her voice that she was not okay. She asked me to rush to her mothers house because Winnie was not moving. I rushed there and unfortunately it was too late. I am distraught and I have lost a friend, cried Sithole.\n\nHe said he last spoke to Winnie on Monday, January 6, 2025.\n\nI knew she was not fine, but I did not know she would come to this, he said. Khumalo first rose to fame as a teenager, having been introduced to the music industry by the late Brenda Fassie.\n\nSeries of health scares over recent years.\n\nIn November 2024, Khumalo was briefly admitted into a Johannesburg hospital after suffering from shortness of breath, which she later learnt was asthma.\n\nShe said she was unaware that she suffered from asthma until an attack over the weekend. Khumalo told media outlets then that she was recovering at home.\n\nI didnt know that I had asthma until I had shortness of breath. I was so confused, she said. I have never heard of anyone being diagnosed with asthma at this age. But the doctors have told me its still in the early stages. They said I need to manage it well and just take care of myself.\n\nThis was not her first health scare. A few years ago, she was diagnosed with diabetes. But she had successfully managed it.\n\nI take care of myself; make sure I eat well, she added. She was also wheelchair-bound for a few weeks following a back operation and an abscess that had developed in her buttocks in 2017. Khumalo said then that she would also get through the hurdle.\n\nI am a fighter, everyone knows. Many of my peers have passed on. But I want to see my grandchildren grow old, so I pray for long life, she said.\n\nBack-up singer for late icon Brenda Fassie\n\nThe Soweto-born singer worked for Fassie as a backing singer. At the age of 15, she released the album Hey Laitie, Tshina Tshina (produced by Sello Chicco Twala).\n\nIt was followed by an album titled Dlamini, also in the 1980s. She also recorded a gospel album titled Izono Zami in the 1990s, produced by Pastor Langa Dube.\n\nA highlight of her early music career was working with Brenda Fassie as Brendas backing vocalist. She has also worked with the likes of Pure Magic, Sipho Mbele, Brothers of Peace (B.O.P), Bongo Maffin, Zonke Dikana and DJ Cleo, among others.\n\nSuccessful singing and TV acting career\n\nKhumalo also had small roles in the SABC series Muvhango and Mponeng, in which she played a sangoma. She was also in a stage play titled The Journey.\n\nAfter a break from live performance and recording, Khumalo returned in 2008. She released a mature album titled I Just Wanna Live My Life. And it was produced and distributed by Kalawa Jazzmee Records Oscar Oskido Mdlongwa.\n\nThe video for I Just Wanna Live My Life was nominated for Best Dance Video and Best Afro Pop Video at the Channel O Music Awards.\n\nIt was also nominated as one of the top five nominees at the South African Music Awards (SAMAs).\n\nThis was alongside DJ Oskido, Liqui-Deep, Big Nuz and Rhythmic Element in the category Record of the Year. Khumalo was selected to take part in the Shoprite Checkers Women of the Year competition as well as the Museke online Africa Music Awards.\n\nDaughter also followed in her footsteps.\n\nShe and Sello Chicco Twala composed a hit song that topped the charts titled Mina Ngiyohlala Nginje.\n\nKhumalo was seen performing it alongside then-President Jacob Zuma during the 2009 ANC election campaigns.- sundayworld.za\n\n",

            "content": "Edgar Vhera\n\nAgriculture Specialist Writer\n\nSTAKEHOLDERS in the pig industry have lamented the high cost of production against a decline in average selling price this festive season, which left many of them in the red and unable to recoup.\n\nA smallholder pig producer from Goromonzi, Mr Tapiwa Takawira said many pig farmers were caught between a rock and hard place characterised by low output prices against high cost of production rendering their businesses unprofitable.\n\nIn the past, the average on farm cost of production was averaging US$2, 20 per kilogramme but this has shot up to US$2, 95.\n\nWe used to cut on production cost by buying feed concentrate and mix with on-farm maize, but due to the El-Nino induced drought, there is no maize and we are buying expensive straight feeds, he said.\n\nThe pig industry is generally characterised by two pricing regimes in any calendar year  the peak and off-peak periods.\n\nMr Takawira disclosed that the festive season, which spans from October to February was the peak price period with average pork wholesale prices ranging between US$3, 60 and US$3, 75 per kilogramme. The off-peak period from March to September usually has an average price of US$2, 80 per kilogramme.\n\nAbout 60 percent of pig producers are small-scale.\n\nBrokers influence on pork pricing, high slaughter fees, market glut, water and pollution challenges, shortages, smuggling of cheaper pork and pork products from neighbouring countries are some of the challenges bedeviling the sector.\n\nPig slaughter charges have risen from an average of US$5 per beast to the current US$12 and small-scale farmers viability has been impacted negatively, added Mr Takawira.\n\nHe said the country risked depending on pork imports thereby losing out on the gains the industry had made under the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1).\n\nLivestock and Meat Advisory Council (LMAC) executive administrator, Dr Reneth Mano concurred saying the pork industry has been hardest hit by a combination of higher than usual cost of feeds in a drought year and the shift of pork from value added tax (VAT) exemption to a standard rated food subject to 15 percent when sold through VAT registered abattoirs and retail outlets.\n\nFalling discretionary real income of lower income households with highly elastic demand for meat also meant that pig farmers ended up absorbing almost all of the rising cost of feed and the rising cost of money, as well as 100 percent of the 15 percent VAT introduced in January 2023, said Dr Mano.\n\nHe said smallholder commercial pig farmers supplying pork to most rural townships and growth points have struggled to get feed since last year.\n\nThese farmers are used to making their own feeds through buying locally available maize and oilseeds to formulate. The drought caused local maize prices to rise by more than 100 percent for most pig farmers from the normal range of US$240 to US$350 per tonne to between US$360 and US$700, he added.\n\nPork demand has suffered as well from the abundance of cheap beef on the informal rural and urban markets coming from a distressed drought-hit smallholder cattle farming community.\n\nDr Mano said the countrys biggest pork brands have not been spared, as they suffered their biggest loss in domestic market share with the supermarket route to markets suffering further losses in competitiveness to the informal route.\n\n",

He was provided with an invoice for the vehicle and a South African First National Bank account number by Makuyana, where the payment was to be made.\n\nThat same day, Chiweshe transferred the required funds and sent proof of payment to Makuyana.\n\nMakuyana instructed Chiweshe to wait a few weeks for the vehicles arrival at Beitbridge Border Post, where customs duties would be settled.\n\nHowever, the court heard that after receiving the payment, Makuyana became evasive.
