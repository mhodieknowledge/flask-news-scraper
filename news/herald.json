He will be chairing the Extraordinary Summit on Friday (today) to discuss Eastern DRC matters. That is a worrying situation, Mr Magosi said.\n\nSecurity situation in DRC\n\nSome 400 000 people have been displaced in North and South Kivu since the beginning of this year alone, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nHighlighting the humanitarian crisis that continues to unfold, UNHCR spokesperson Matt Saltmarsh reported that bombs have fallen on camps for people uprooted by the violence in South and North Kivu.\n\nThese attacks include one on 20 January, when explosions at Kitalaga site in South Kivu killed two children.\n\nOn 21 January, five makeshift shelters were destroyed in Nzuolo, near Goma, while on Wednesday, Bushagara site  also near Goma  was heavily impacted, causing panic and new waves of forced displacement, Mr Saltmarsh told journalists in Geneva.\n\nHe noted that heavy bombardments from clashes involving the M23 rebels forced families to flee various displacement sites on the periphery of Goma and try to seek safety within Goma.\n\nHow the M23 emerged\n\nOperating in the North Kivu province, the group takes its name from the March 23 Agreement of 2009 when the DRC government, under President Joseph Kabila  son of Laurent-Desire Kabila  signed a ceasefire treaty with the Tutsi-\n\nmajority National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), one of the numerous groups of fighters active since the Second Congo War.\n\nIn the agreement, the CNDP was meant to become a political party and its fighters were to integrate into the Congolese military, FARDC.\n\nHowever, on April 4, 2012, 300 CNDP soldiers revolted, complaining of poor treatment in the army.\n\nThey formed the M23, claiming to be fighting for Tutsis rights in the DRC.\n\nIn late 2012, M23 launched an offensive, seizing Goma and several other towns. A special UN force along with FARDC pushed the rebels back into the eastern hills on the border with Rwanda in 2013.\n\nM23 resurfaced in 2022 with violent attacks and has seized at least four towns in North Kivu.\n\nThe group briefly withdrew from occupied towns in January 2023 as part of the Nairobi Peace Process, but the ceasefire fell apart in October.\n\nFighting between M23 rebels and FARDC erupted again at the beginning of last year.\n\nEast African Community calls for unconditional ceasefire\n\nAn emergency East African Community Summit held in Nairobi, Kenya, called for immediate unconditional ceasefire and facilitation of humanitarian access to the affected population in DRC.\n\nThe summit, called by President William Ruto, was held on Wednesday night virtually.\n\nRwandas President Paul Kagame, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, President Samia Suluhu of Tanzania, President Sheikh Mohamud of Somalia, President Evariste Ndayishimiye of Burundi and South Sudans President Salva Kiir attended the meeting.\n\nThe meeting also urged the DRC government, led by President Felix Tshisekedi, to directly engage all stakeholders in the conflict, including M23 and other armed groups, to end the rebel assault.\n\nDRCs President Felix Tshisekedi\n\nScenes at the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport ahead of the arrival of SADC Heads of State and Government\n\n10:33-Tanzanias President, who is also the chairperson of Sadc Organ Troika on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation Dr Samia Suluhu Hassan has arrived at Robert Mugabe International Airport.\n\nTanzania President Samia Suluhu Hassan arrives\n\nShe is welcomed by Attorney General, Mrs Virginia Mabhiza\n\nMadagascars President Andry Rajoelina has also arrived at the Robert Mugabe International Airport joining other Heads of State and Government for the Extraordinary SADC Summit.\n\nHe is being received by National Housing and Social Amenities Minister Zhemu Soda.\n\nMOZAMBIQUEs President Daniel Chapo has also jetted into the country for the Extra Ordinary Summit.\n\nHe is welcomed by Minister of Defence Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri and Zimbabwes Ambassador to Mozambique Victor Matemadanda.\n\nNeighbouring country, Botswanas President Duma Boko has also arrived in the country for the Extra Ordinary Summit.\n\nPresident Boko has been received by Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Barbara Rwodzi.\n\nAs the clock ticks towards the commencement of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Extraordinary Summit this afternoon, the atmosphere at the new Parliament is charged with anticipation and optimism.People have gathered eager to catch a glimpse of the arriving Heads of State and Government who will convene to deliberate on pressing regional issues.\n\nSOUTH AFRICAN President Cyril Ramaphosa has arrived in Harare where he is joining other regional leaders for the SADC Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government.\n\nPresident Ramaphosa was welcomed by Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Mthuli Ncube.\n\nMozambiques President Daniel Chapo has arrived at the new Parliament for the Extra Ordinary Summit.He is accompanied Minister of Defence Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri and Zimbabwes Ambassador to Mozambique Victor Matemadanda.\n\nBotswanas President Duma Boko has also arrived at the new Parliament for the Extraordinary Summit.He was accompanied by Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Barbara Rwodzi.\n\nPresident of Lesotho Sam Matekane has arrived at the new Parliament for the SADC extraordinary summit.\n\nHe was accompanied by the the Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Kazembe Kazembe and they were welcomed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Professor Amon Murwira.\n\nTanzanias President and SADC Organ Troika on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation chairperson Dr Samia Suluhu Hassan has arrived at the new Parliament for the SADC extraordinary summit.\n\nShe was accompanied by Attorney General Attorney General Virginia Mabhiza and they were welcomed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Professor Amon Murwira\n\nMadagascars President Andry Rajoelina has arrived at the new Parliament joining other SADC Heads of State.
