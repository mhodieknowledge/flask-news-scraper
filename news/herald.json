I feel very uncomfortable. I am very solid. I have always said I am a constitutionalist, I have my two terms when they come to an end, the country and the party will move on by electing my successor.\n\nThe editors asked the President to pronounce himself if he would not be persuaded to remain in office beyond 2028, and he responded:\n\nI will persuade the persuaders not to persuade me so that I remain constitutional.\n\n",

            "content": "(Zimpapers) Fact Checking Desk\n\nMANY Zimbabweans rely on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and X for their news, exposing themselves to misinformation and biased sources. A recent social media frenzy centred around the use of cardboard boxes as makeshift plaster in first aid management following a tragic accident that claimed the lives of 25 people when an Urban Connect bus collided with a truck near the Lutumba tollgate along the Masvingo-Beitbridge highway.\n\nMajor talking point:The use of cardboard boxes on injured patients has sparked debate, with some experts defending the practice.\n\nIs there anything wrong with using cardboard box makeshift plasters?\n\nAccording to a Harare-based surgeon, it is common to use cardboard box slabs to immobilise an injured limb or suspected fracture during patient transportation or while waiting for X-rays.\n\nNo there isnt! This approach is widely accepted for immediate coverage of limbs in emergencies.\n\nResponding to Farai Maguwu on X, Australia-based medical practitioner, Thabisa Sibanda, cautioned against invading privacy when sharing images of patients with makeshift slabs.\n\nFirst, I wish to express my displeasure at the apparent invasion of privacy viz a viz this photo. Secondly may I offer a word of caution. This lady may be waiting for surgery and the surgeon felt no need to remove the prehospital makeshift slab in place.\n\nWhats the advantage of this? Does it work?\n\nIn emergencies where victims may be far from healthcare facilities, cardboard boxes are crucial to prevent further injury and stabilise fractures during transport. Community healthcare workers and first aid responders can easily utilise cardboard boxes to immobilise limbs and provide temporary support until patients receive proper medical care.\n\nVerdict:Using cardboard boxes for emergency handling of accident victims is cost-effective, widely accepted, and practical in Zimbabwe. These makeshift plasters help prevent further injury and facilitate the initial treatment of fractures before patients receive proper medical attention. Ultimately, patients will require a real plaster cast to hold the fracture in place while it heals, but cardboard boxes play a vital role in the initial stabilisation process.\n\n",
