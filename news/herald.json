The husband is believed to have crossed into Zimbabwe through the Beitbridge Port of Entry, said Col Ledwaba.\n\nOn 20 January 2025, police in Musina received information from a tracking company about a white Ford Ranger with Limpopo registration numbers, which had been parked at a 6residence in Campbell. The vehicles owner had been reported missing since Friday, 17 January 2025, under Moroka SAPS in Gauteng, along with his wife.\n\nPolice rushed to the scene and found the vehicle at the residence. The property owner explained that he had kept the pick-up truck in his yard with permission from the male owner, who had borrowed a large amount of cash and indicated he intended to cross the border to Zimbabwe for spiritual assistance due to issues at his workplace.\n\nHe said further investigations revealed that the Nemangwele was accompanied by another man when he dropped off the vehicle on January 17, 2025 at about 10 pm.\n\nCol Ledwaba said during preliminary investigations, police discovered bloodstains inside the vehicle, two empty rifle cartridges, three empty 9 mm pistol cartridges, one fragment of 9 mm ammunition, six live 9 mm rounds, two black 9 mm pistol magazines (one with 15 rounds and one empty), and a pair of black gloves.\n\nHe said further investigation led to the discovery of the body of the 29-year-old woman, who had multiple gunshot wounds, on January 22, 2025 at approximately 11:15 in the bushes along the N1 in Kromdraai, in Free State.\n\nPreliminary investigation revealed that the husband (Nemangwele), who was supposed to be travelling with the deceased, passed the Verkeerdevlei Toll Gate alone in the same vehicle on Friday, 17 January 2025. It was at the turn-off in Kromdraai where the womans body was discovered, said Col Ledwaba.\n\nThe provincial police commissioner for Limpopo, (Lt Gen Hadebe), has strongly condemned the senseless shooting that resulted in the tragic death of the woman.\n\nPolice are searching for the suspect (Nemangwele) to assist in their investigation regarding the murder.
