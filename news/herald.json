Section 12 ofthe regulations provides that when a girl child gets pregnant, the school must provide psycho-social support.\n\nWhere a girl who is a pupil at a school becomes pregnant, the school head  (a) shall inform the parents of the girl as soon as possible if they are not already aware of the pregnancy, (b) shall facilitate psycho-social supportive services to the girl and parent, (c) if the girl and her parents so wish, the girl shall be permitted to remain at school for as long as possible before the delivery of her child, and to return thereafter as soon as her health and the health of her child permit it, reads the regulations.\n\nSection 14 of the regulations does not allow students to visit teachers quarters.\n\n14 (1) No pupils must be allowed at the school staff quarters. (2) Every school shall develop guidelines for the pupils to access staff offices and base rooms to ensure safety of the pupils. (3) Subsection (1) shall not apply where the pupil is a child or relative of the teacher or member of staff whose living-quarters he or she enters and resides in, reads the regulations.\n\nSection 18 empowers a school head to suspend a pupil whom he or she reasonably suspects of serious misconduct for up to 14 days to allow investigations.\n\nNo pupil may be suspended from school without first being granted a reasonable opportunity, with the support of his or her parents, to make representations with respect to the proposed suspension, the regulations read.\n\nSection 20 prevents pupils from being excluded from school for non-payment of any form of school fees or levies.\n\nHowever, it imposes an obligation on parents and guardians to pay school fees and levies before schools open for a new term.\n\nThe regulations seek to provide equal opportunity to education and it stipulates that no pupil should be denied an opportunity to learn because of the quality of his or her results.\n\nBasic education is compulsory and, if the parents of the pupil cannot afford the tuition fees and levies at a Government school, the State shall assist, within the limits of the resources available to it, in providing that education.\n\nAdmission of children into Government schools; No school head shall exclude a child of school-going age from enrolment at a Government school solely on the ground that the child does not have a birth certificate. No child of school-going age shall be denied admission into basic education in Government schools based on the quality of results he or she possesses, reads the regulations.\n\nA fine not exceeding level six or imprisonment of up to six months shall apply to those found guilty of violating the above.\n\nThe regulations also empower the school head to expel a pupil if he or she is satisfied, after a fair hearing that the pupil is guilty of serious misconduct and in expelling the pupil, he should notify the parents furnishing them with reasons for his or her decision.\n\nBut the expulsion should be effected after consultation with the District Schools Inspector (DSI) and responsible authority of the school, if it is a non-Government school.\n\nA parent of an expelled pupil has 14 days of appealing in writing to the Permanent Secretary or any other person designated by the Permanent Secretary through the DSI and a decision should be made within a month.\n\nThe learner concerned might be allowed to attend lessons unless school authorities feel on reasonable grounds, that such attendance might lead to indiscipline or injury to any person or damage to property.\n\nThe school head is obliged to notify his superior about his decision to expel a pupil including the Permanent Secretary of Primary and Secondary Education and the reasons for doing so.\n\n",

            "content": "Tendai Rupapa in MASVINGO\n\nCASES of people enduring excruciating pain and letting it dissipate on its own or even dying without seeking medical help are common across communities, especially among men.\n\nStudies and testimonies by medical experts indicate that men shun health checks and present for treatment usually when it is late.\n\nSome men use their spouses health as a yardstick for their own and largely conclude that once their wives are certified healthy, they too will be safe.\n\nIt is for this reason that First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa is taking her fully equipped mobile hospital and mobile clinic for medical outreaches in the provinces to ensure no place and no one is left behind in her mission to save lives and ensure everyone knows their health status.\n\nHer mission has produced great results as evidenced by what she encountered in Masvingo during her medical outreach programme, which was supported by the Ministry of Health and Child Care.\n\nAmai Mnangagwa has been urging people to get checked for ailments, especially men whom she said needed to be screened for prostate cancer.\n\nA case in point is Sekuru Silas Dzirasha from Chivi, who was losing weight spectacularly and often spent his time sleeping, complaining of feeling weak and having a headache.\n\nSo serious had this become that he was now struggling to put food on the table for his family since he had stopped going to work.\n\nAs someone who had just finished constructing a three-bedroomed house, he never sought treatment and firmly believed he had been bewitched by close relatives who did not want to see him succeed.\n\nFortunately, when health ambassador First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa took her medical outreach to Masvingo this week, he was found to be diabetic and immediately placed on treatment.\n\nSekuru Dzirashas tale is similar to that of Gogo Revai Zizhou.\n\nShe was suffering in silence until health experts at the First Ladys medical outreach discovered she was hypertensive and prescribed the drugs that have seen her regain her strength.\n\nWhen feeling unwell, one has to visit the hospital and not harbour bad thoughts about certain people. Sickness, if not treated, can make you hate others for nothing.\n\nI now always pray to God for forgiveness because I was always blaming people for crimes they didnt commit, said Gogo Zizhou.\n\nA young man who preferred to be identified only as Brighton, said he had received solid counselling through the First Ladys medical outreach and was now looking at life with renewed vigour after quitting drug and substance abuse.\n\nI just do not know how best I can thank the First Lady for her great love for the people of Zimbabwe. I was taking drugs after being introduced to them by bad friends.\n\nI had become an animal and lost respect for my parents and siblings. But after the First Ladys address and the help I got from experts at the outreach, I am now a new creation. I really thank her for her love, he said.\n\nMs Lilian Moyo also had her reasons for thanking the First Lady.\n\nPeople queue for free medical checks and treatment during a medical outreach organised by Angel of Hope Foundation in Masvingo yesterday.\n\nI was struggling with pain in my breasts which resulted in me spending most of my time sleeping and crying. I was told by experts at the First Ladys medical outreach that I could be in the earliest stages of breast cancer and they have recommended further tests while I was given medication to relieve the pain.\n\nI come from a humble family and my parents cannot afford the costs of examinations. The medical outreach came as a blessing in disguise for me and I can only thank the First Lady for her love. She is a well-meaning mother of the nation who deserves everyones prayers. I encourage other people out there to come forward and seek help during this outreach so they can be examined and told what is afflicting them, she said.\n\nMrs Sunungurai Chikozhere (67) from Chivi North saluted the First Lady for rolling out the medical outreach.\n\nWe were gratified by what the First Lady did to assist the people of Masvingo province which shows her deep organisational skills. Yesterday, I was screened for cervical cancer and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). I am back again today as we are being checked for eyesight free of charge. Amai also gave us food hampers and inputs, she said.\n\nMr Remigio Marandure (69) was happy for the services unlocked by the First Lady.\n\nWe came here yesterday and were screened for prostate cancer. Our mother did well for us and today I am here again to be screened for eyesight challenges, thanks to our mothers benevolence, he said.\n\nIn a speech read on his behalf by Provincial Epidemiology Disease Control Officer (PEDCO) Dr Tapera Saravoye, Masvingo provincial medical director, Dr Amadeous Shamhu, said Masvingo province was excited to be hosting the medical outreach which came to life because of the visionary leadership of the First Lady.\n\nIndeed, we are more than grateful that Amai has seen it fit for the community of Masvingo to benefit from this cancer screening and wellness programme.\n\nThe programme is for everyone as we aim to screen for cervical cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer in men. We are also doing eye screening, HIV testing, and hypertension checks. Family planning and outpatient consultations are also being done, he said.\n\nCervical cancer, he said, is a preventable disease, adding that globally, cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of death among women.\n\nIt is estimated that one woman dies from the disease every two minutes. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates of cervical cancer in the world, making it the leading cancer-related cause of death in the region.\n\nIn 2018, Zimbabwe had an estimated 3 156 new cases of cervical cancer and 2 151 cervical cancer deaths, a very big cause for concern for a disease which is preventable. To eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem by 2030, it is recommended that 90 percent of all women of reproductive age with precancerous lesions should be treated using an effective method but that only depends upon their early identification through screening.\n\nTo ensure that no one is left behind, VIAC (Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid and Cervicography) screening outreach activities and treatment camps are being conducted thanks to the First Ladys initiatives.\n\nWe are therefore immensely grateful for the synergies we are receiving from our partners, especially the NAC (National Aids Council) for their profound support in that regard, he said.\n\nDr Shamhu said the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem by 2030 was a possibility.\n\nBut to achieve this, he said, they want to encourage every eligible woman first to get screened and those found to have VIAC-positive results to be treated.\n\nThe treatment modalities that the Ministry of Health and Child Care is using are effective and are also recommended by the World Health Organisation. As the Ministry of Health and Child Care, and as Masvingo province, in particular, we do not want to leave any woman behind, and we will continue working hard to ensure equitable access to cancer screening and other preventive services. I want to reiterate the old time-honoured saying that prevention is better than cure and therefore encourage every woman to make every effort within her means to prevent cervical cancer.\n\nBreast cancer caused 670 000 deaths globally in 2022. Breast cancer was the most common cancer in women in 157 countries out of 185 in 2022. Breast cancer occurs in every country in the world. Approximately 0,5 percent to 1 percent of breast cancers occur in men. Yet this, like all other cancers, is very preventable through regular breast self-examination, examination by experienced health professionals, and a screening test called mammography. Early screening accords an individual early identification of both pre-cancer and cancer of the breast followed by early treatment which prevents further complications and/or death, he said.\n\nDr Shamhu added that prostate cancer has also become a major concern among men not only in Masvingo but the world over.\n\nAn elderly woman having her eyes examined during a medical outreach organised by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa in Masvingo yesterday.\n\nProstate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. In 2020, there were an estimated 1,4 million PCa diagnoses and 375 000 deaths due to prostate cancer for those men who sought medical care. There is a high likelihood that this is an estimate as men rarely want to seek health care until its too late.\n\nI would therefore like to take this moment to encourage all men to prevent premature deaths due to prostate cancer by going for regular screening and treatment when the need arises, he said.\n\nNAC programmes officer for Masvingo, Mr Munyengetero Masunga described the First Ladys medical outreach as a blessing.\n\nWe are blessed to have Amai assisting in the response. We used to have high levels of stigma and discrimination but with increased awareness raised by the outreach of our First Lady, Dr Mnangagwa, we have seen that people are now free to come and access the services ranging from testing for HIV to accessing treatment for those who would have tested HIV positive.\n\nWe also have cervical cancer affecting most women who are HIV positive, but now because we have the mobile outreach that is coming to enhance efforts on the ground, we have seen several people openly accessing the services.\n\nYesterday, we had six teams testing for cervical cancer in the outreach. We also are happy that we have added the critical service that is quite costly for people to access in Harare, the breast cancer screening and its coming with the mobile outreach has made life easier for the majority of people who cannot raise resources to access the service. We also have our prevention thrust where we even have family planning services looking at condom distribution.\n\nThey are here offering services. With HIV several conditions have crept in where we have non-communicable diseases so we also have a team that is screening for sugar, and eyes. For our cervical cancer and wellness day we had a full house of those services and we appreciate our mother, the First Lady. We hope that these outreach programmes will take us somewhere targeting our vision of ending Aids by 2030, he said.\n\n",

Another 40 passengers sustained injuries with 10 of them regarded as critically injured.\n\nThe incident occurred at around 7am after the south-bound bus, reportedly while overtaking another vehicle, collided with the northbound truck carrying 34 tonnes of magnesium and heading to Chirundu.\n\nThe bus had 65 people while the truck had three people including the driver.\n\nAccording to the Beitbridge District Medical Officer, Dr Lenos Samhere, a total of 17 passengers died on the spot while eight others who had sustained head injuries died upon admission at the Beitbridge District Hospital.\n\nHe said 10 of the injured were in critical condition and were taken to Gwanda and United Bulawayo hospitals.\n\nWe have transferred 10 who were critical to Gwanda provincial hospital, said Dr Samhere.\n\nThe injured were rescued by motorists passing through the accident scene, the police and other stakeholders working together with the local Civil Protection Committee.\n\nSurvivors said they had been sleeping only to wake up on the tarmac and at the hospital.\n\nI was awoken by the large bang and I saw a lot of bodies lying on the road, said Tinashe Chingono from Chitungwiza.I was thrown out of the bus through the front side during the impact and became very scared and in a few moments. I passed out for a few minutes and then saw a lot of bodies on the tarmac covered in blood.\n\nAfter a few minutes we were rushed to the hospital where medical staff attended to me and the other injured passengers. The service here is excellent.\n\nMs Tambudzai Mugasa said she was frightened as she noticed the bus was about to collide with the truck.\n\nI just stared at death haplessly and put everything to God when I noticed that the bus was about to collide with the truck, she said. I couldnt believe my eyes. The next thing I found myself outside the bus next to several bodies.\n\nA customs clearing agent from Beitbridge, Mr Washington Musemwa, who was injured on the neck, said he watched helplessly as the bus headed for the collision with the truck.\n\nMr Musemwa said after the collision he woke up after almost 30 minutes and saw bodies around.\n\nI saw some rescue workers retrieving from the wreckage those who were still crying for help. The first thing I did was to look for my bag. After locating it, I walked to one of the vehicles that was carrying the injured passengers on my own and was later taken to this hospital, he said.\n\nWhen I noticed the bus was about to collide with the truck, I jumped out through the window and sustained some injuries on the left side of my face, said Mr Tapiwa Mambaya.

My head was covered in blood and I then called my brother to inform him about the accident, said Mr Mambaya.\n\nA passenger who preferred anonymity said she became terrified when she saw some bodies on the tarmac and upon seeing the rescuers pulling out some passengers from the bus.\n\nOne of the first people to attend the scene, Mr Thomas Nhundu of Great Hope Funeral Parlour who was also driving towards Beitbridge said he and together with community members living close to the highway retrieved some of the injured from the bus.\n\nThe bus had just overtaken us and when we arrived there were bodies all over the tarmac, said Mr Nhundu.\n\nAnother witness, Mr Leonard Wanderson, a resident of Tshapfutshe said he rushed to the scene after hearing a loud bang near the toll gate.\n\nI had seen the bus passing through our business centre when suddenly I heard a loud bang and I rushed here.

            "content": "Fidelis Munyoro-Chief Court Reporter\n\nIn a landmark ruling, the High Court has delivered a declaratory order affirming the inalienable rights of Peter Jack Masedzas children to exhume and rebury their fathers remains, 50 years after his death.\n\nMasedza is known by the legion of apostolic sect members as Johane Masowe.\n\nThis decision heralds a significant legal and spiritual victory for Magaga and Reuben Masedza, granting them the authoritywithin the parameters of established legal frameworksto honour their fathers legacy and memory in accordance with their familial and cultural obligations.\n\nThe case stemmed from a protracted and bitter dispute with a faction of the Gospel of God Church, which had resolutely barred the Masedza brothers from accessing their fathers gravesite at Gandanzara Shrine in Makoni, a sacred burial place near Rusape.\n\nBaba Johane, a revered religious figure and spiritual guide to millions, passed away in Zambia on September 14, 1973, at the age of 59. His remains were later repatriated to what was then Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and interred at the shrine.\n\nEfforts by the High Court in 2017 to mediate the feud by granting both sides equal access to the burial site proved futile, as hostilities persisted unabated. The Masedza brothers application asked the court to determine two critical questions: whether they had the legal right to exhume their fathers remains and whether the court could order such an exhumation.\n\nJustice Tawanda Chitapi, in his judgment, upheld the brothers right to exhume their fathers remains, subject to compliance with statutory procedures, but declined to grant the consequential relief of directly ordering the exhumation.\n\nThe applicants have a right to exhume the remains of the late Johane Masowe Shoniwa Masedza, which are buried at Gandanzara Shrine, Rusape, subject to their following due process, ruled Justice Chitapi.\n\nThe judge further clarified that the declaratory relief granted did not, in and of itself, authorise immediate exhumation but instead required adherence to the procedural dictates outlined in the Cemeteries Act.\n\nJustice Chitapi emphasised that the applicants cultural and familial assertions were well-founded, noting their insistence that it was both a traditional and moral obligation for children to bury their parents, maintain access to their graves, erect tombstones, and preserve such burial sites as enduring family heritage.\n\nThe brothers legal counsel, Advocate Lewis Uriri, instructed by Mr Nickiel Mushangwe, argued that the denial of access to their fathers burial site had caused grave prejudice, severing their connection with their late fathers remains.\n\nAdvocate Uriri submitted that Baba Johane, a devout worshiper of God, would not have wished his grave to become a symbol of worship, a shrine for idolatry, or a source of benefit for leaders of the Gospel of God Church.\n\nOpposing the application, the Churchs Deputy President, Erica Office, represented by Advocate Silvester Hashiti, argued that the deceased had expressed wishes to be buried at the Gandanzara Shrine and dismissed the application as frivolous, citing the passage of over 20 years since his death.\n\nThe judge observed that the parties had been embroiled in related litigation over the years, which explained the delay in bringing the current application.\n\nMr Mushangwe hailed the ruling as epochal, describing it as a momentous decision with far-reaching implications beyond the mere administration of justice.\n\nThis ruling brings joy, relief, and a clear pathway to resolve the pernicious problem of children fighting for the right to honour their parents in death. It also carries spiritual significance, as it involves one of Africas religious luminaries, he said.\n\nWhile the courts order is declaratory and does not directly mandate the exhumation, it provides the siblings with the legal clarity and authority needed to proceed within the confines of statutory requirements.\n\nJustice Chitapis judgment underscores the importance of balancing cultural imperatives, legal procedure, and the sanctity of burial sites, while reaffirming the judiciarys role as the ultimate arbiter in matters of justice.\n\nThis ruling not only restores the dignity of the Masedza family but also serves as a poignant reminder of the enduring bond between family, tradition, and the law.\n\nIt lifts the shadow of conflict that had long loomed over Baba Johanes final resting place, enabling his children to honour his memory in peace and unity.\n\nSince 1932, when Shonhiwa Masedza, later known as Johane Masowe, received his divine call to the prophetic ministry, the Gospel of God Church has been synonymous with worship in open spaces, a practice that became its enduring hallmark.\n\nMagaga now 77 years old, stood on the precipice of triumph after enduring a grueling 52-year legal and emotional battle to access his fathers burial site.\n\nHis voice, heavy with both exhaustion and relief, trembled as he reflected on the journey. This journey was unbearably tortuous, but we are happy that finally, justice has prevailed while we are still alive, he said.\n\nFor Magaga and other family members, this victory is not merely a legal milestone, but a deeply personal and spiritual reclamation of their heritage.\n\n",
