            "content": "Crime Reporter\n\nThe Ministry of Justice in France recently responded to a request by the Government to assist them in investigating the case in which the countrys late former Ambassador to Belgium, Hurudza Gift Punungwe, and his wife, Mrs Runako\n\nBeauty Punungwe, were allegedly defrauded of nearly US$1,3 million through an investment scam.\n\nThe couple was defrauded by Richard Kaye, a British national, who operated companies such as Thomas Barclay Group (TBG) and Lloyd Morgan Company (LMC) in Belgium and France during the year 2000.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), and the Zimbabwe Republic Police have collaborated with Interpol to track Kaye, whose current whereabouts are unknown, though he is believed to be hiding in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe government however approached France officials where Kaye had also been operating from, seeking assistance and this resulted in the French officials responding to their request.\n\nIn their response, the French Ministry of Justice said, I have the honour to return herewith the above-mentioned execution elements from the Attorney General of Zimbabwe dated 11 March 2015. It was not possible to have a hearing of\n\nMr Richard Kaye, a British national as requested by the delegation.\n\nHe had lived in Montpellier between 2003 and 2005. His art gallery, located at 6 rue Albert Thomey in Carcassonne was closed in 2010 and the company he ran was shut down that same year. The Kaye family obviously no longer resides at 1 rue des Lauriers in Fonties Cabardes and the house at Domaine de Clement in the same area was sold. Lastly, it should be noted that the vehicle registered under his name was sold in the United Kingdom on 14 October 2014.\n\nLast week, Mrs Punungwe visited the Interpol offices in Harare to inquire about the progress on the case.\n\nThe investigation is now being actively pursued by Interpol along with other relevant stakeholders and law enforcement agencies.\n\nIt is alleged that Kaye, posing as a broker, convinced the late Ambassador Punungwe to invest US$214 233 into LMC.\n\nHe was reportedly acting in collusion with five accomplices, identified as, Professor David McKay O.B.E., Hendrik Vriesen, Erik Bjertnes Jr, Michiel Eyken-Slyuters, and Penny Willis Jones (also known as Penelope Slan Kaye)\n\nOn June 1, 2001, Kaye allegedly provided Ambassador Punungwe with a personal guarantee for the safe return of the investment.\n\nFollowing the Ambassadors death, Kaye issued new share certificates in Mrs Punungwes name.\n\nAs of October 28, 2013, investigations revealed that the investment in LMC had grown to US$739 337 and EUR 661 714,07.\n\n",

Our role is to educate families and ensure they prioritise childrens education and wellbeing.\n\nChild marriages have been a long-standing challenge in the district, often driven by cultural practices and economic hardships.\n\nHowever, through coordinated efforts with community leaders and activists, these harmful practices are being steadily uprooted.\n\nAnother community childcare worker Mrs Beauty Jiri said collaboration has been pivotal.\n\nWe have established platforms where we openly discuss the dangers of child marriages. Parents and guardians are now more aware of the legal and emotional consequences of such practices, she said.\n\nAnother focus area has been the inclusion of children with disabilities, a group often marginalised in many communities.\n\nMrs Grace Mukuyu has praised the districts initiatives.\n\nChildren with disabilities are now being included in schools and community programs. We have trained parents and teachers to accommodate their unique needs, ensuring they feel valued and supported, she said.\n\nMrs Linnet Kamutsamba attributed the success to community involvement and consistent awareness campaigns.\n\nWe have worked tirelessly to ensure no child is left behind. This includes addressing stigma surrounding disabilities and supporting families through resources and counseling, she said.\n\nThe districts approach involves partnerships with local and international organisations, Government departments, and traditional leaders, creating a united front against child exploitation.\n\nThe strides made in Mutasa are setting an example for other districts in Zimbabwe and beyond, demonstrating the power of community-led initiatives in fostering a safe and inclusive environment for children.\n\n",
