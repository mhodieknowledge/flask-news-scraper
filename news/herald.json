            "content": "Wallace RuzvidzoHerald ReporterGovernment has not banned small-scale mining activities but has urged miners to exercise caution during this rain season, Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister Dr Polite Kambamura has said.This comes after misguided reports by some media outlets that the Deputy Minister had called for a ban on small-scale mining activities.\n\nIn an exclusive interview today, Dr Kambamura allayed fears that Government had banned small-scale mining activities.\n\nThe Deputy Minister said he was only advising small-scale miners to suspend their operations as a cautionary measure.\n\nThis was after a mining shaft in Makaha, Mudzi, collapsed last week, resulting in three small-scale miners getting trapped.We did not ban underground mining, we value the contributions coming from the small-scale sector, especially the gold sub-sector, but above all life is sacred. We value the lives of people and therefore safety will be a priority.\n\nSo underground mining is not banned, we do not have any plans to ban small-scale underground mining but what we are saying is if there are bad weather conditions, our miners should consider safety, he said.\n\nI issued a comment on the matter (Makaha incident) advising small-scale miners to consider suspending going underground considering the dangers posed by incessant rains and the weak ground conditions that can lead to mine flooding and the ground collapsing.\n\nOn 13 February 2019, we had a similar case at Battlefields in Kadoma where small-scale miners were flooded by rain and we lost 24 miners. So as a cautionary statement, we advised small-scale miners not to go underground when it is raining and resume when weather conditions improve, he said.\n\n",

The cloud of bitterness, sorrow and anger still hovers among them.\n\nWith time, it is hoped that they will find each other and move on.\n\nThen, another yesteryear icon, Manatsa, lost his battle against cancer on January 20, 2022.\n\nHe was 78.\n\nThe Green Arrows boss, who shattered records after his wedding ceremony at Rufaro Stadium in 1979, was a music colossus for years.\n\nA unifier, Manatsa won the hearts of football fans with songs dedicated to the countrys once most-supported four teams  Dynamos, Highlanders, CAPS United, and Zimbabwe Saints.\n\nHis all-time hits, including songs like Chipo Chiroorwa, Chitima Nditakure, Hwahwa, and Tea Hobvu, are still as wonderful as ever.\n\nAs a true legend, he received a State-assisted funeral and was buried at Warren Hills Cemetery, Harare.\n\nManatsas wife, Stella, died in her sleep at their Mabelreign, Harare home, on August 30, 2022.\n\nOn January 20, 2023, the nation was plunged into mourning again following the death of Mbuya Stella Chiweshe.\n\nShe lost her battle against a brain tumour at the age of 76.\n\nThe cultural icon, whose career spanned over five decades, was also hailed for the role she played in Zimbabwes liberation struggle.\n\nThe mbira queen also marketed Zimbabwe overseas, especially in Germany, where she spent most of her life.\n\nLike a true traditionalist, Mbuya Chiweshe was buried the traditional way in Nekati Village under Chief Masemburas area.\n\nHer burial made headlines after her body was transferred from an expensive casket to be wrapped in a cloth and a reed mat.\n\nThe casket was destroyed, with close relatives in charge. The media was barred from taking pictures, true to tradition.\n\nHer daughter, Virginia Mukwesha, told mourners that it was Mbuya Chiweshes wish to be buried the traditional way.\n\nTwo years after her death, Mbuya Chiweshe is still remembered for promoting African tradition through music.\n\nLike her two counterparts  Tuku and Manatsa  the departed mbira icons influence is still being felt.\n\nShe remains a role model, inspiring other female mbira players to navigate the terrain she once occupied.\n\nBesides this trio, there are also other Zimbabwean celebrities who died in January.\n\nThe late Simbarashe Mhere, a Zimbabwe-born South African actor, presenter, and television personality died on January 31, 2015, at the age of 26.\n\nMhere, who reportedly moved to South Africa when he was only one, will be best remembered for his exploits on the top lifestyle show, Top Billing, which earned him fans across the continent.\n\nAcross the Limpopo, fans are mourning the death of South African actress and singer Winnie Khumalo, who died on January 7 at the age of 51.\n\nThe Afro-pop star, whose career dates back to the 1980s, will be buried on Saturday.\n\nFamed for her hit song Live My Life, she had the opportunity to collaborate with top South African acts, including Brenda Fassie.\n\n",
