Comprehensive measures are in place to safeguard our society. Our security forces are well-prepared to handle any potential disruptions while ensuring that people going about their daily business are respected and protected, said Minister Matuke.\n\nMinister Matuke\n\nWhile acknowledging citizens right to lawful protest, the minister firmly opposed any actions endangering public safety.\n\nIn the spirit of promoting calm and resilience, I encourage all citizens to continue with their daily business as usual. There is no need for undue anxiety or panic, he said.\n\nWe must collectively focus on our national priorities that enhance welfare and progress, rather than be distracted by rogue elements.\n\nThe minister warned that security forces would respond decisively to any threats posed by malcontents.\n\nOur security apparatus is equipped to handle the situation, and anyone attempting to incite violence or chaos will be dealt with swiftly and decisively. We call upon every citizen to show restraint.\n\nMinister Matuke stressed national unity as essential for Zimbabwes stability:\n\nLet us work together to uphold the values of peace, stability, and democratic engagement. We stand ready to protect our citizens and our sovereignty, ensuring that our nation remains a place of safety and prosperity for all.\n\nMinister Matuke revealed concerns about foreign influence behind potential unrest.\n\nWe are concerned about a concerted effort to undermine our stability and foster discord within our society. I urge all citizens to remain vigilant against such foreign-funded threats.\n\nOn Saturday, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Dr Jenfan Muswere said Zimbabweans should go about their business as usual as law enforcement agents will be vigilant and on high alert to guarantee security and ensure peace across the country.\n\nDr Muswere\n\nAddressing the media, Dr Muswere urged Zimbabweans to ignore calls for protests that are being made by cyber terrorists and fanned through social media, saying the countrys security sector is well-equipped to deal with any mischief.\n\nAs official Government spokesman, I would like to assure the nation that peace and stability will continue to prevail in our country in terms of the Constitution, including on the 31st March 2025, and all Zimbabweans should disregard misinformation and disinformation being peddled on social media platforms by cyber terrorists, said Dr Muswere.\n\nWe also like to assure the people that law-enforcement agencies have more than enough capacity to deal with any illegal activities that might take place in our country. As a Government, we have taken note of artificial intelligence-generated videos and messages from comedian-cum-terrorists who seek to misinform and dis-inform the public. Those who want to create despondency, alarm and anarchy will be dealt with in terms of the law. No one has the right to overthrow a constitutionally elected Government. So labour, business, learners, students and the generality of all Zimbabweans should continue to do their business as usual as the security sector has more than enough capacity to deal with any illegal activities in our country.\n\nThe call for protests, Dr Musweresaid, was misplaced as it sought to create a false narrative of a non-existent political crisis.\n\nWe urge Zimbabweans not to participate in these illegal activities which are aimed at creating a false narrative of a political crisis in the country. These actions are criminal and undermine the constitutional rights of freedom of assembly, he said.\n\nLast Thursday, the Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, Kazembe Kazembe, said security services were on high alert to ensure the safety and security of the public and everyone, including visitors to the country, should feel secure and continue engaging in their socio-economic activities.\n\nYesterday, police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi also assured the nation that it will be business as usual across the country today.\n\nThe police have made adequate deployments throughout the country. Those using public transport or private vehicles should not fear. Businesses and schools should operate normally.\n\nComm yathi issued a stern warning against social media misuse.\n\nWe are aware of individuals spreading threats online, discouraging work attendance or public transport use. Once identified, they will face the full force of the law.\n\nNationwide, normalcy prevailed yesterday with businesses operating, churches holding services, and social activities continuing undisturbed.\n\nHarares commercial centres remained busy while transport services operated smoothly.\n\nPassengers Association Coordinator Tafadzwa Goliati said: Harare is operating normally, with no major disruptions. Commuters should proceed with their daily routines.\n\nReligious services across the capital proceeded without concern, with congregants focused on worship rather than protest fears.\n\nDuring sermons yesterday church leaders delivered sermons that focused on the importance of respecting Government authority as a means to promote peace and national development.\n\nTheir messages drew heavily from Romans chapter 13 in the New Testament, which addresses the relationship between Christians and governing authorities.\n\nThe Apostle Paul, who authored Romans, underscores the significance of submission to civil authorities, stating that they are established by God.\n\nThe leaders highlighted that resisting such authority equates to resisting Gods ordinance.\n\nOne church leader remarked, We shared Apostle Pauls message in the Book of Romans 13, which highlights that rulers are meant to be a source of good, rewarding those who do right and punishing wrongdoers. Paul describes the government as a servant of God for maintaining order.\n\nThe sermons encouraged congregants to pray for peace and unity, emphasizing the need for personal and national development. The leaders acknowledged the presence of individuals with negative attitudes, likening them to Tobiah from the Book of Nehemiah, who criticized the rebuilding efforts in Jerusalem.\n\nAmong the people, we have those with evil thoughts who do not emulate the good work being done by President Mnangagwa, one church leader noted.\n\nThe church leaders reiterated that Christians should not only obey civil laws but also fulfil their moral obligations, such as paying taxes and showing respect to those in authority.\n\nThey also referenced the concluding verses of Romans 13, which call for love among individuals, stating that love fulfils the law. This reinforces the idea that genuine Christian living is guided by love for others.\n\n",

It experienced congestion during peak periods of returns submission and in 2021 the system was not able to process all the 364 011 returns and its downtime was 0,45 percent and 0,95 percent, which was far above the tolerable downtime rate of 0,02 percent.\n\nThe committee also said Zimras Commissioner-General, Ms Regina Chinamasa, had confirmed that in 2021, the e-service system was non-functional, prompting the Authority to put in place mechanisms to ensure that taxpayers were able to submit their returns to facilitate revenue collection.\n\nInitially, the Authority had used the e-mail facility where people submitted their returns through their e-mails.\n\nLater in 2022, they developed an in-house solution (e-taxes) to mitigate the challenge the taxpayers were facing. The long-term solution was the implementation of the TaRMS which was deployed in 2023 with a four-life deployment period ending December 2024, further reads the report.\n\nThe PAC added that the e-service platforms poor performance and frequent downtime had hindered taxpayers ability to submit returns, potentially affecting revenue collection.\n\nIt said Zimras reliance on e-mail submissions as a temporary solution was not a secure or efficient method for handling sensitive tax information.\n\nThe development of an in-house solution (e-taxes) and the implementation of the TaRMS were positive steps, but the delay in deploying TaRMS until late 2023 was a matter of concern.\n\nZimra must ensure the TaRMS is fully functional and user-friendly by the end of the deployment period, that is December 2025, to prevent further disruptions.\n\nZimra must develop a comprehensive contingency plan to address potential system failures and minimise downtime by 31 December 2025, PAC said in thereport.\n\nIt also recommended that Zimra conduct a thorough review of the e-mail submission process to ensure the security and integrity of taxpayer data, by December 31.\n\n",

Some wanted to see my house, but I can tell you mine is very small.
