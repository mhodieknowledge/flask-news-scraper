This candidate I have is Prof Janabi, he has already been endorsed by the Sadc region as our sole candidate for all the 16 countries, Amb Kombo said.\n\nProf Janabi said his objective was to bring transformative changes in African health discourse and make ensure the continent becomes independent.\n\nOne of the goals which I want to do is the transformative changes, which I am picking the baton from Dr Matshidiso Moeti, to continue the transformative changes if elected, especially now that we are all aware of the geopolitical tension with the donors in WHO.\n\nSo, I think you can look at it in two ways; you can look at it as a challenge or you can look at it as an opportunity. I look at it as an opportunity for the Afro region, which has got 47 countries.\n\nI think its high time we should think of being independent in managing our health matters, because African problems are supposed to be solved by Africans ourselves, said Prof Janibi, a cardiologist.\n\nHe said he would ensure universal health for everyone if elected, using his vast experience in health issues.\n\nI am the chief executive officer of Muhimbili National Hospital, our largest hospital in the country with 2 400 beds (and) 4 000 staff. We see roughly 4 000 patients every day, but on top of that, I am senior advisor to the current President Dr Hassan on health matters, policy and nutrition.\n\nSo, I do advise a lot on primary healthcare, universal health coverage, and equity, because what we want is universal health coverage, so there should be equity. Every citizen, the 47 member States, should get the basic services, he said.\n\nApart from Prof Janabi, other contenders are Dr Nda Konan Michel Yao from Cte dIvoire, Dr Dram Mohammed Lamine from Guinea, Dr Boureima Hama Sambo from Niger and Prof Mijiyawa Moustafa from Togo.\n\nAccording to the WHO appointment process, any member State of the African region may propose a candidate for the post of regional director.\n\nThe nomination is conducted by secret ballot during a private meeting of the regional committee session scheduled to take place on May 18, 2025, in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nFollowing the regional committee meeting, the nominated regional director will be officially appointed by the WHO Executive Board, based on the nomination made by the WHO Regional Committee for Africa.\n\nThe WHO regional director serves a five-year term, with the possibility of one reappointment.\n\n",

But what came out from the deliberation mostly is only exchange rate issues, he said.\n\nCde Chiduwa said findings from these visits will be consolidated into a report for Parliament, with recommendations aimed at further strengthening the sector.\n\nDespite signs of recovery, Cde Chiduwa acknowledged some lingering challenges shared by retailers, including distortions in the exchange rate market, foreign currency shortages, inconsistent power supply, and regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe distortions that are happening in the exchange rate market, the shortages of foreign currency, power, regulatory requirements. And we are upset, he said.\n\nCde Chiduwa said beyond major retail outlets, the committee is also focusing on Zimbabwes vast informal sector, which plays a crucial role in the economy.\n\nAfter we are done here, we are also going to the downtown area, where we are going to look at the compliance level, especially in the informal sector, he said.\n\nCde Chiduwa said the committees outreach extends across multiple cities, including Harare, Mutare, Chiredzi, Bulawayo, and Gweru.\n\nSpeaking during the tour of OK Mart, the group company secretary, Mrs Margaret Munyuru, said the firm was now on a recovery path.\n\nWe have already started restocking. A few weeks ago, even a month and a half ago, you would have noticed that even Mazoe was missing on the shelves. The shelves are now filling up, she said.\n\nLast month, OK Zimbabwes former chief executive officer, Mr Willard Zireva, returned to lead the retail group and help lift it from its current operational challenges, which have seen the company closing five branches.\n\nLate last year, the retail giant struggled to restock its branches across the country, citing a tough trading environment and a growing debt burden.\n\n",

I believe pre-conditions have been discussed and we are close to, I hope we are close to signing.\n\nRepresentative of the ongoing Polish Presidency of the EU Council Mr Radoslaw Sikorski, who was in the country for a landmark visit, then weighed in expressing his confidence in the success of the SMP once it begins.\n\nThe IMF has signed agreements on curing economies with dozens of countries over the last 40 years.\n\nThey are really experienced in how to help an economy, but also how to monitor the conditionality, the fulfillment of conditions.\n\nYou do not have to reinvent the wheel, if you just listen to the IMF, you will be fine, he said.\n\nMr Sikorski, who is also Polands Minister of Foreign Affairs, said Warsaw had previously had a similar experience to Harare.\n\nWe had a very similar experience to you. We had shops for using the local currency and shops for using the dollar.\n\nToday the Zloty (Polands official currency) is actually gaining against the dollar and the Polish economy is doing very well.\n\nThere are ways of dealing with it, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has already expressed Zimbabwes commitment to the success of the SMP.\n\nTo anchor implementation of further economic reforms under the Arrears Clearance and Debt Resolution Process, Government is currently negotiating a Staff Monitored Programme (SMP), with the International Monetary Fund, said the President at the 6th High-Level Structured Dialogue Platform Forum: Arrears Clearance and Debt Resolution Process held last November.\n\nThe implementation of any reforms under the SMP, however, impacts negatively on the vulnerable groups of our population.\n\nIn this regard, the protection of the vulnerable groups, through effective social protection programmes, is of critical importance to my Government.\n\nOn Zimbabwes economic potential, Mr Sikorski said it was immense, while expressing the blocs interest in partnering African countries like Harare.\n\nYou have wonderful tourist attractions. You have raw materials that we need. We recognise the huge economic potential of this part of the world, and we would like to be your partners in mutually beneficial enterprises and ventures, he said.\n\nAmbassador von Kirchmann said trade figures between Zimbabwe and the EU were low but there was scope to get them much higher.\n\nI do not have the figures at my fingertips, but they (trade figures) are far too low. They could be much, much higher, just starting with tourism.\n\nI mean, Victoria Falls is a wonder of the universe.\n\nMany more people would love to see it. You have a wonderful climate. You have talented and hardworking people, he said.\n\n",

For instance, the United Nations Childrens Fund (Unicef) estimates that the resurgence of conflict in the province of South Kivu in the Eastern DRC has forced more than 700 000 people, nearly half of them children, to flee their homes.\n\nDr Mudavadi thanked the represented countries for demonstrating commitment to the welfare of the Congolese people through co-operation towards establishing a roadmap for peace in DRC.\n\n",

This is unacceptable, he said.\n\nMinister Ndlovu urged consumers to be cautious of counterfeit products flooding the market, many of which are produced or repackaged in unregistered backyard industries.\n\nOur street pavements have turned into market stalls, filled with everything from designer-label clothes and shoes to foodstuffs, beverages, and even medicines.\n\nMost of these products are unregulated, posing serious risks to consumer health and safety.\n\nWhile we want to harness the entrepreneurial spirit of our people, it must be done correctly, without endangering the very people we aim to serve, he said.

However, he warned that these low prices come at a significant cost to consumer health and safety.\n\nI appeal to all consumers not to fall for this brazen deception.

            "content": "THE near total normalisation of relations between Zimbabwe and the European Union, with only the largely a symbolic arms embargo left of the old sanctions regime, shows the gains of the Second Republics pragmatic foreign policy of engagement and re-engagement.\n\nOn its part, the EU has also displayed remarkable magnanimity and open-mindedness in acknowledging the immense progress achieved under President Mnangagwa since he took the reins of power in 2017.\n\nThe new normal was seen at the weekend when Polish Foreign Minister Mr Radoslaw Sikorski visited Zimbabwe to co-chair a SADC-EU Ministerial meeting. During Polands Presidency of the EU Council, this is a duty that falls to Polish Ministers and so Mr Sikorski was representing the EU, and while his presence was obviously normal, he was still the highest ranking EU representative in the country for more than 20 years.\n\nBut in many ways more importantly was the step last week, when the last EU sanctions targeted entity in Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Defence Industries, was removed from the list. It is very unlikely that there are any ties between that company and any European business, but the removal meant that there were no longer any EU sanctions targets in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis is important. The problem with so-called targeted sanctions is that there is serious collateral damage on ordinary people and the country as a whole.\n\nEuropean companies doing business in Zimbabwe had to make sure that no person or entity targeted was involved in any way in the deal. In the same vein, European banks in particular had to make sure that every payment from a Zimbabwean business for something they bought from a European company and every payment to a Zimbabwean company did not involve a target.\n\nThis imposed practical restrictions on a lot of business and financing, as checks had to be made and when the profits of a deal, or the banking fee, were to be chewed up by the costs of a required check then often the decision was made not to bother.\n\nNow any European company and any European bank can go ahead and conduct normal business with Zimbabwean customers and suppliers without having to look over its shoulder.\n\nThe final EU sanction, the arms embargo, does not have this effect since all arms sales in every country go through a separate defined route and need positive approval from the selling companys Government, so there is never that need for major checks that the targeted sanctions demand.\n\nIn any case the lifting of that sanction would be largely symbolic, as Zimbabwe is not a major buyer of arms and has assured suppliers for the routine supplies of things like generic ammunition and the very modest supplies of equipment. The lifting of that embargo would thus just be a signal that there were no sanctions whatsoever, and so total normality of relations.\n\nThe EU joined the American and British sanctions in response to the land reform programme almost 25 years ago. They drew up their own lists of sanctioned individuals and companies and had their own set of financial sanctions.\n\nAt the same time many EU-Zimbabwe ties were put on the back burner, along with ties between Zimbabwe and many EU- member states.\n\nThe advent of the Second Republic and its policy of engaging with everyone attracted a response from the EU and from many European states. What we saw was largely a willingness to be open-minded and to look at what was happening, rather than looking at the past or wanting to remain entrenched.\n\nThat open-minded approach in response to the openness displayed by the Second Republic saw steady progress in the improvement of relations between Zimbabwe and the EU.\n\nIn recent years, EU member states and their Ambassadors have become noticeably very business orientated and tend to stress the positive aspect of relations rather than dwelling on the diminishing number of disagreements. The problem of Zimbabwes debt arrears, the difficulty of any new funding from international development institutions and the difficulty of sorting out rescheduling and other measures are still there but are being addressed.\n\nThe EU has made it clear that it sees the present progress in a very positive light, including that deal made a few years ago with the former commercial farmers fulfilling the Constitutional requirement for proper compensation for the improvements the farmers had made on the acquired farms. That compensation is being paid but it will be paid a lot faster once access to global development finance is possible.\n\nZimbabwe itself, for its own reasons and its own needs rather than in response to outside pressure, had put in place its new home-grown Constitution and started the lengthy process of bringing hundreds of pieces of legislation into line with the Constitutional requirements set by the people when they approved the new basic law. That included practical fulfilment of the compensation for improvements.\n\nIt has been apparent for some time that any attempt to block a debt-clearance arrangement that includes the normal rescheduling and other measures, along with a payment plan for Zimbabwe, would require the European countries to vote against relief for Zimbabwe. Even their abstentions would probably be enough to ensure the passing of a properly-worked out arrangement. So the present warming of relations makes an effective deal far more likely.\n\nThe new levels of EU-Zimbabwe relations, along with other diplomatic progress, has shown the practical benefits of President Mnangagwas engagement policy, and his determination to be a friend to all and an enemy to none.\n\n",

            "content": "SPORTS Minister, Kirsty Coventry will make sporting history if she is elected president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at its General Assembly on Thursday.\n\nShe would be the first woman and first person from Africa to head the IOC.\n\nShe would also be the youngest since Pierre de Coubertin, the founding father of the modern Olympic Games. The Frenchman founded the IOC in 1894 and took over the presidency two years later at the age of 33.\n\nCoventry, a 41-year-old former world-class swimmer from Zimbabwe , has always had a strong will and vision.\n\nWhen I was 9 years old, I told my dad I wanted to go to the Olympics and win gold. He told me it would be a rough road ahead, he explained how difficult it was just to make the Olympic team let alone win a medal, but he believed in me, she wrote in a Facebook post a few years ago.\n\nAt the age of 20, she made her dream come true. At the 2004 Games in Athens, Coventry won the gold medal in the 200-meter backstroke.\n\nFour years later, in 2008 in Beijing, she won gold again. In addition to those two gold medals, she collected four Olympic silver medals and one bronze.\n\nThis makes Coventry Africas most successful female Olympian of all time. The only African, who has had more success at the Olympics, is long-distance runner Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia  who won three gold medals (and two bronze).\n\nI have been to five Olympic Games, won seven individual Olympic medals, broken multiple world records and had one of the best World Championship careers of all time, Coventry wrote on her Linkedin profile.\n\nWhile still an active swimmer, Coventry was elected to the IOC Athletes Commission in 2013.\n\nShe represented the interests of athletes for eight years, including three years as chairperson. More recently, she has been a member of the IOC Executive Board.\n\nThe increased influence of the Zimbabwean has raised hopes in Africa that the Summer Olympics could be hosted on the African continent for the first time.\n\nAlthough South Africa and Egypt have expressed their interest, Coventry has played down such expectations.\n\nThe interest is there and now we need to ensure that were working closely with all of these countries that are interested so that they fully understand the magnitude of the Olympic Games, she said.\n\nThe countries of Africa, Coventry said in a Q&A session organised by the Association of International Sports Journalists (AIPS), should really strategically look from the African Union point of view on how we can develop through the All Africa Games our infrastructure that can then be followed up and used by an Olympic Games bid.\n\nCoventry knows from experience just how tough such political processes can be. She has been Zimbabwes Minister of Sport since 2018.\n\nShe says she now has definitely a thicker skin than she used to as an athlete.\n\nKirsty Coventry is not only a sports administrator and politician, but also a mother. She gave birth to her second daughter less than six months ago. Her eldest is six years old.\n\nBy the time she was one year old, she had already been to 10 different countries around the world, Coventry said.\n\nI have an incredible network of support from my husband and family. This is a normal way of life for us. I think its a good way to show that women are just as capable as men even if we are to be expected to be full-time mothers, wives, daughters etc.\n\nWe still have a lot of work to do, and I am excited about leading this movement, Coventry said of gender equality.\n\nWomen are ready to lead. I look at it as an opportunity to push through boundaries so that when my two girls are growing up, they dont have the same boundaries.  DW/MSN/Sports Reporter.\n\n",

            "content": "Business Reporter\n\nKUVIMBA Mining House (KMH) is targeting 3 600 kilogrammes of gold this year, driven by higher ore volumes and improved processing plant efficiencies.\n\nThe projected production represents a 12,5 percent jump from the 3 200kg the company realised in the previous year.\n\nKMH expects improved quality ore and enhanced operational efficiency across its portfolio of gold mines namely Freda Rebecca Gold Mine, Shamva Mine and Jena Mine.\n\nKMH, which is now 70 percent owned by Mutapa Investment Fund, recently said it was seeking to raise US$950 million from development banks, mining companies and traders to fund the development of its lithium, platinum and gold assets.\n\nIf completed the capital raise initiative is expected to bolster the groups operational efficiencies and buoy output.\n\nFor the current year, ending March 31, we project gold production of approximately 3 600kg, representing a 12,5 percent increase from the previous year.\n\nThis growth is primarily driven by a higher ore grade, increased tonnage of processed ore and enhanced operational efficiencies at our two plants.\n\nOur goal as a cluster has been to maximise gold production, capitalising on the rising gold price trend. We are pleased to have successfully leveraged the thriving gold market to achieve our target, said KMH head of gold cluster Mr Patrick Shayawabaya.\n\nThis comes after Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube recently said that the contribution of the mining sector to the economy had been steadily growing, rising from 11,5 percent of the countrys Gross Domestic Product in 2018 to 13,3 percent presently.\n\nSimilarly, the mining sector growth is projected at 2,3 percent and 5,6 percent for 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nGold is Zimbabwes largest foreign currency earner while mining in general accounts for more than three quarters of Zimbabwes export earnings.\n\nThe growth is driven by increased output, the discovery of new minerals (lithium) and investments in additional capacities.\n\nThis comes after the gold price earlier this month rose to a record, breaching the US$3 000-an-ounce followingUS President Donald Trumps aggressive tariff agenda, which fanned concerns about the potential hit to growth, hurting demand for risk assets and aiding flows into bullion-backed funds.\n\nGold peaked at US$3004.84 an ounce on March 14, 2024.\n\nThe yellow metal has performed robustly in the first quarter of 2025, extending a strong annual gain in 2024.\n\n",

            "content": "Fidelis Munyoro, Chief Court Reporter\n\nJUDGMENT has been reserved in the case of Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) senior reporter Blessed Mhlanga, who faces allegations of transmitting messages to incite public violence.\n\nThis decision follows the conclusion of arguments presented by both the defence and the prosecution before Harare High Court judge, Justice Gibson Mandaza yesterday.\n\nMhlanga approached the High Court seeking bail after the magistrates court denied his application, citing concerns over the risk of witness interference.\n\nDuring the proceedings, Justice Mandaza dismissed the defences attempt to introduce electronic evidence, which had been argued as critical to Mhlangas bail application.\n\nThe court ruled that admitting such evidence at this stage would amount to pre-trial conduct, affirming that it is only admissible during the trial itself.\n\nMhlanga, represented by his lawyer Mr Chris Mhike, argued that he is a suitable candidate for bail and maintains a plausible defence to the charges.\n\nMr Mhike insisted that Mhlanga had no involvement in the alleged transmission of a video recorded at a press conference held by war veteran Blessed Geza.\n\nThe accused has presented a logical and plausible defence, Mr Mhike told the court. He was not present at the press conference, nor did he transmit any of the recorded content. The ownership of the video is attributed to HSTV on YouTube, and my client is not connected to HSTV in any way.\n\nMr Mhike further argued that the States case rests on a false premise that Mhlanga is HSTV, the broadcaster of the content.\n\nThe State alleges that the transmission of the video is an uncontested fact, but it fails to establish who actually transmitted it. There is no evidence linking my client to the act of broadcasting or transmitting the video.\n\nThe defence contended that the State did not allege or provide evidence showing Mhlanga operating a computer or otherwise transmitting the video in question.\n\nThe lawyer emphasised that the quoted words, allegedly inciting violence, were uttered by Geza, not Mhlanga.\n\nThere is no logical connection between my client and the statements attributed to the video. The arrest was baseless, and the State has failed to demonstrate a compelling case against him.\n\nMr Mhike also criticised the magistrates court for denying bail on grounds that the offence posed a threat to public peace and security, arguing that the alleged crime is not a scheduled offence under the law.\n\nHe pointed to what he termed errors in the magistrates reasoning, including the failure to consider Mhlangas co-operation with law enforcement.\n\nAppearing for the State, Mr Fungai Nyahunzvi indicated that the prosecution stands by its written submissions and offered no additional arguments.\n\nJustice Mandaza reserved judgment, leaving the matter pending further deliberation.\n\n",
