            "content": "Sifelani Tsiko\n\nInnovations Editor\n\nZimbabwe has stepped up efforts to draft regulations for new biotechnology techniques covering genome editing and genetically modified foods (GMOs) to protect public health and the environment.\n\nPermanent Secretary in the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development, Professor Fanuel Tagwira said the drafting of regulations is a crucial step in promoting the safe and ethical application of genome editing and GMO technology.\n\nIt is our collective responsibility to ensure that these technologies are developed and applied in a responsible, safe and transparent manner, he said.\n\nA robust regulatory framework is essential to address the challenges posed by genome editing.\n\nSuch a framework must balance the need to promote innovation with the need to protect human health, the environment and animal welfare.\n\nZimbabwe has embraced genome editing technologies as it aligns with Education 5.0, which seeks to develop home-grown solutions and industrial growth.\n\nThe National Biotechnology Authority (NBA) and the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) are holding the workshop to help advance the drafting of the Genome Editing Regulatory Framework for Zimbabwe.\n\nGenome editing refers to a set of biological techniques that allow scientists to make precise alterations to the DNA of an organism.\n\nThese techniques have great potential to improve genetics and performance of crops, livestock and other organisms for agricultural, industrial and medical applications.\n\nWe want to develop regulatory frameworks that are in line with international best practices, said Prof Tagwira.\n\nCreating regulatory frameworks that align with regional and international standards will enable Zimbabwe to develop competitive biotechnology products for regional and global markets.\n\nTo meet the Fourth Industrial Revolution in Zimbabwe and the SADC region, the country has pledged to promote emerging technologies in a number of fields, including robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, quantum computing, big data, biotechnology, fifth generation wireless technology and 3D.\n\nZimbabwe is participating in a regional genome editing pilot project alongside seven other African countries.\n\nThrough this project, Zimbabwe has drafted a national Genome Editing Communication and Advocacy Strategy that has been reviewed and will soon be launched.\n\n",
