They grow subsistence crops and often possess unique knowledge of local crop species.\n\nHe said that improving womens rights to access natural resources is not just a necessity but an obligation and an urgent imperative for maintaining the development trajectory of Africa and Zimbabwe.\n\nMinister Magomo noted that the significant contributions of women to economic growth and food security should not be overlooked.\n\nHe, however, pointed out that one major barrier to maximising these contributions is womens lack of secure tenure over natural resources, particularly land and water.\n\nThe clean-up campaign coincided with the commemoration of the Africa Environment Day, celebrated annually on March 3.\n\n",
