These vehicles often lack proper warning signs, leaving drivers with little time to react. It is a tragedy that is entirely preventable.\n\nData from the Zimbabwe Republic Police reveals that between January and September 2023, the country recorded 38 482 road accidentsan average of 141 per day. These incidents claimed 1 545 lives and injured 7 294 people.\n\nThe numbers speak for itself, Mr Goliati said. Every accident is not just a statistic, its a family torn apart. We need to act decisively to stop this carnage.\n\nPAZ has proposed a series of measures aimed at reducing accidents caused by broken-down vehicles, including vehicle maintenance, driver training, and public awareness campaigns.\n\nTruck owners and drivers have been urged to prioritise the safety of other road users.\n\nIt is their responsibility to ensure their vehicles do not endanger lives, said Mr Goliati. Broken-down vehicles left on the road without adequate warnings are death traps.\n\nHe noted that addressing the crisis requires collaboration between the Government, road authorities, and the public.\n\nWe cannot afford to wait while lives are lost. If everyone plays their part, we can make our roads safer for all.\n\nAs Zimbabwes vehicle population continues to grow  reaching 1.47 million registered vehicles by December 2022  experts warn that without urgent action, the risk of road accidents will only escalate.\n\n",

            "content": "Patrick Chitumba and Freedom Mupanedemo\n\nPRESIDENT Mnangagwa has underscored the importance of the iron and steel industry in Zimbabwes economic revitalisation, highlighting its vast potential to transform, not only the countrys economy, but that of the entire SADC region.\n\nThe President said the industrys current state was worrisome, with Zimbabwe spending in excess of US$1 billion on importation of iron and steel.\n\nHe was speaking at a gathering to officially open the Iron and Steel Indaba which is underway at a hotel in Kwekwe.\n\nIn attendance were Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, Industry and Commerce Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu and other senior Government officials.\n\nIn attendance were Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, Industry and Commerce Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu and other senior Government officials.\n\nIt is my singular honour and privilege to officiate at this Iron and Steel Indaba here in Midlands Province, being hosted under the theme, Leveraging the Resurgence of Zimbabwes Iron and Steel Industry. As you are aware, the Engineering, Iron and Steel industry has always been a cornerstone of Zimbabwes industrial landscape. In the past this was through the operations of Ziscosteel, then the largest steelworks in Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the sector holds immense multiplier effects in promoting value addition and beneficiation by leveraging the countrys expansive mineral resources, such as iron ore and chrome, among others.\n\nIn light of this, the resurgence of this sector is of urgent necessity. This Indaba is, therefore, taking place at an opportune time. It is in line with our vision to ultimately establish a robust and sustainable iron and steel industry that meets domestic demand, while also positioning Zimbabwe as a regional manufacturing hub, he said.\n\nThe President added that the recent operationalisation of the Dinson Iron and Steel Company in Manhize, Mvuma, has significantly increased the prospects of the sector.\n\nThe investment by Tsingshan Group, which is the largest steel giant in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the 6th leader in the world, is a show of confidence, by one of the global industry leaders, in our iron and steel sub-sector, he said.\n\nThe iron and steel value chains, the President added, are among key sectors identified to accelerate the transformation and growth of the manufacturing sector.\n\nThrough the requisite policy mix, our manufacturing has been on the rebound. Capacity utilisation increased from an average of 36.4 percent in 2019 to 53.2 percent in 2023, while capital investments in the sector amounted to US$747 million over the past three years. Shelf occupancy of locally produced goods rose from about 64 percent to 80 percent in 2019 and 2023, respectively, he said.\n\nFurthermore, President Mnangagwa said, the manufacturing sectors contribution to overall national employment remains on a positive growth trajectory from 7.5 percent in 2019 to 9.7 percent in 2023.\n\nHe said the vast natural resources and a youthful population should be continuously harnessed for sustainable industrial transformation in the country.\n\nIt is a misnomer that we continue to lose millions every year on the importation of iron and steel and other related products. This is despite the numerous investments within our manufacturing sector. It is against this background that the Second Republic resolved to facilitate a vibrant, dynamic and competitive industrial base, driven by smart and strategic value-chain linkages. We are fostering structural transformation of our economy by putting in place deliberate and systematic measures to graduate from being resource-driven to a knowledge-based economy. This will be achieved through incremental step-by-step, brick-upon-brick, and stone-upon-stone processes, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nThe Iron and Steel indaba is thus expected to speed up the realisation of targets in the critical mining sector and the economy as a whole, towards Vision 2030.\n\nHe said the Indaba is taking place after the Government, through Treasury, recently presented an elaborate 2025 National Budget, which is both citizen and pro-business-centric.\n\nFrom a regional perspective, Zimbabwe, as the current chair of SADC, has the opportunity to drive both the national and regional industrialisation agenda.\n\nFurther, the present round of the Industrial Revolution is moving at a heightenedpace, characterised by increased digitalisation, artificial intelligence and innovation. These are in-turn transitioning traditional modes of production as well as broadening the range of products required by the markets, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nI, thus, challenge stakeholders in this sector to take leadership and implement forward-looking business models which impact beyond our borders and the continent. Zimbabwe and the SADC region are part of the global village and should not be left behind.\n\nHe said the domestication of the value chains and value addition must be expedited, adding that the sector is integral for the resuscitation and modernisation of the national railway network, as well as foundry and fabrication of industrial equipment for the transport and energy sectors, among others.\n\nIn the agriculture sector, President Mnangagwa said iron and steel products are essential to counter the dire consequences of climate change through expanding the countrys irrigation infrastructure to build resilience, while also securing farm land through appropriate boundary fences.\n\nSimilarly, our construction sector, other infrastructure such as dams, modern roads and bridges, among other upstream, downstream and main-stream products, all depend on the viability of this sector. Great is the task before you, hence the need to have unity of purpose and collaboration. This Indaba should merely be the first step. The sector cannot afford to work in silos but must be complementary in approach, leveraging on the various technical resources and skills that reside within different entities in the industry, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said to scale up efforts in this regard, it is critically important that the strategies to resuscitate and grow the sector are holistic, well-co-ordinated and focused on the overall national good.\n\nThe President, who later in the day commissioned the Shurugwi-Mhandamahwe road, said other national development projects such as the Gwayi-Shangani Dam in Matabeleland North, and Tugwi Mukosi Dam among others, are important for the realisation of national targets.\n\nHe said energy projects like the new 720 MW power plant under construction in the Hwange area, will aid the drive for a robust and growing iron and steel sector anchored on broader value chains.\n\nA skilled workforce equipped with modern technical expertise is an integral component for sustaining innovation, productivity and growth of the iron and steel industry. Hence, investments in human capital development are essential, as well as partnerships between industry players and academia, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe said the Indaba is taking place after the Government, through Treasury, recently presented an elaborate 2025 National Budget, which is both citizen and pro-business-centric.\n\nIt is my sincere hope that as businesses, you will capitalise on the wide spectrum of both fiscal and non-fiscal incentives availed for sustainable economic development. As we engage and deliberate throughout this Indaba, it is critically important that we collectively find lasting solutions to resuscitate and grow the iron and steel sector.

We found ourselves in constant conflict with city officials who refused to adhere tobasic accounting principles.\n\nMs Mahari disclosed that the officials also obstructed the integration of financial records from major subsidiaries, including City Park, Rufaro Marketing, and Harare Quarry.\n\nPrior to the discontinuation of the ERP, we submitted crucial reports highlighting deficiencies in the system. Yet, the city officials turned a blind eye, leaving us powerless to address the gaping holes in their financial controls, she said.\n\nMs Mahari said the exclusion of executive payrolls, coupled with poor financial practices, had fostered an environment ripe for fraud.\n\nThe two Groupview Technologies officials expressed concern that councils transactions could be slipping through the cracks, unrecorded and unaccounted for.\n\nThey pointed out that the lack of bank reconciliation left room for fraudulent activities.\n\nMr Jasi pointed out the dire consequences of the citys refusal to fully utilise the ERP system, claiming it created a loophole for corruption.\n\nRevenue generation is the lifeblood of the councils operations. Yet, management has consistently delayed critical integrationsputting finances at risk and leaving us vulnerable to fraud!\n\nMr Jasi revealed that the citys repeated audit disclaimers had tarnished its reputation, casting doubt over its financial integrity.\n\n",
