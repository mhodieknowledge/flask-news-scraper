In that respect, the Budget will support the capitalisation of the Empowerbank as well as Womens Bank, he said.\n\nProf Ncube said provision of sanitary wear to young girls, generally through the public schools system, was a topic for debate and ZiG211 million was set aside for that.\n\nThe Budget builds resilience against currency and other shocks by maintaining fiscal discipline where the deficit will be kept within 0,4 percent of Gross Domestic Product, or at least below 1 percent of GDP.\n\nIn terms of allocations, the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education got the highest vote of ZiG46,7 billion while the Ministry of Health and Child Care was allocated ZiG28,8 billion.\n\nLands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development was allocated ZiG22,9 billion while the Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Ministry got ZiG28,7 billion. The Ministry of Defence was allocated ZiG18,05 billion.\n\nThe Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare was allocated ZiG10,7 billion while that of Transport and Infrastructure Development got ZiG5,4 billion. Parliament got ZiG2,7 billion.\n\nThe Finance Act, while maintaining tax bands in US dollars, converted these to ZiG at current exchange rates so incomes from 0 up to ZiG33 600 a year will not be taxed, from ZiG33 601 to ZiG100 800 will be taxed at 20 percent, from ZiG100 801 to ZiG336 000 at 25 percent, between ZiG336 000 and ZiG672 000 at 30 percent, between ZiG672 001 and ZiG1 008 000 at 35 percent and anything above ZiG1 008 001 a year at 40 percent tax.\n\nThose into sport betting will now pay a 10 percent tax of their winnings deducted when they are paid out and sent to Zimra by the betting house, while the betting houses will pay three percent of their gross monthly income.\n\nA half percent surcharge is now being charged on the sale value of less healthy fast foods that include burgers, pizza, chips, chicken and doughnuts among others that will be announced in regulations to be published later.\n\nA 20 percent surcharge will now apply on the sale value of non-renewable plastic carrier bags whether manufactured locally or imported.\n\n",

Your contributions in education, health care, social welfare, and spiritual awareness have led to this change, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nThe Seventh Day Adventist Church, he said, had uplifted communities and was advancing the countrys shared vision of a prosperous Zimbabwe.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa quoted Psalm 127, verse 1, reminding people that God is the ultimate builder and that they should involve Him in every project.\n\nAs we reflect on the importance of nurturing strong families, I commend your continued efforts to promote family-centred values. Indeed, as the Bible says, If the Lord does not build a home, they labour in vain they that build it.\n\nI urge you to continue standing as a pillar of support, guiding parents, children and building strong communities, moral integrity, and spirituality.\n\nStrong families lead to a strong nation, and the commitment to building family life aligns perfectly with our national goal of creating a society founded on love, harmony, and prosperity, he said.\n\nThe President also expressed a desire for the community to come together, support one another, and spread joy and kindness throughout the year.\n\nDuring the festive season, and as we look forward to the dawn of a New Year, I offer heartfelt wishes for a blessed celebration and a fruitful 2025.\n\nMay this period bring joy, renewed hope, and a deep compassion to all. I urge every member of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church and indeed all communities of faith to stay in a spirit of collaboration in the New Year, he said.\n\nWork hand in hand to realise our common aspirations for a better Zimbabwe.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa urged various faiths to keep the countrysleadership in their prayers.\n\nWe encourage you to keep us every day in your prayers as you steer this country towards an upper middle-income economy.\n\nMay the grace of God continue to guide your endeavours as you serve and uplift our nation. With hope, faith, and love, let us embrace this New Year together in line with our countrys mantra,Nyika Inovakwa Nevene Vayo, Inotongwa Nevene Vayo, Inonamatirwa Nevene vayo.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, Seventh-Day Adventist Church leader and businessman Mr Kudakwashe Tagwireyi urged youths to dedicate themselves to the Lords work.\n\nHe lauded the presence of the Minister of Youth Empowerment, Development and Vocational Training, Tino Machakaire, his Deputy Kudakwashe Mupamhanga and the Permanent Secretary Mr Solomon Mhlanga.\n\nMr Tagwireyi emphasised that in these challenging times, it was crucial for young people to stand up and make their presence felt, not just by being counted, but by becoming active advocates for democracy.\n\nI want to encourage you, because we are in a war, that you are going to stand up and be counted. Stand up, not only to be counted, but stand up and become a soldier, a soldier of democracy. Thats the other challenge, he said.\n\nMr Tagwireyi also encouraged people to always be a friend to all and an enemy to none and strive to make a positive impact in whatever they touch.\n\nI hope with this New Year, you will be able to encourage yourself to see your enemy as your friend. That is what I want you to do, and that way you become a better person because of your faith. And that is what I pray for, and that is what I wish for. And I hope that all of what you do is going to make history in our country.\n\nThe event saw top regional and local gospel musicians such as Janet Manyowa, Everton Mlalazi who doubled as host of the night, Natasha Mlalazi, Blue and Tadiwa, Xola Toto, Fisani, Rudo Madindi, Khaya Mthethwa, Mmatema and Canaan Nyathi sharing the stage as they dished out Seventh-Day Adventist Church popular hymns.\n\n",

Tomorrow (today) we are going to Mashonaland East and then to all the other provinces. So, this allows the media an opportunity to be able to get to see and appreciate a number of these projects and also to interact with the public as we journey towards an upper middle-income society, Dr Muswere said.\n\nSpeaking on progress at the Trabablas Interchange, Fossils Contracting head of operations Engineer Kudakwashe Maguta said all 15 bridges are now at 97 percent completion.\n\nAll the 15 bridges are now done up to deck level. 13 bridges completed, 100 percent. The last two bridges are the ones we poured the decks in December, which are bridges one and three.\n\nOtherwise, all the bridges are now complete on the interchange. And coming on to the earthworks, we have got a road network of about 21 kilometres. This is now standing at 80 percent complete. The overall progressis 86 percent for the Trabablas Interchange.\n\nAs for the temporary traders market at Mbare Musika in Harare, Masimba Holdings said progress now stood at 82 percent with traders set to occupy the market by February 1.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa declared a state of disaster for Mbare Traders Market following an inferno that destroyed stalls and wares late last year.\n\nMasimba Holdings chief executive Mr Fungai Matahwa said the temporary market will accommodate 5,000 traders.\n\nIn terms of progress, we are sitting at 82 percent complete. We will complete it in the third week and officially on February 1 traders will be using the market, he said.\n\nConstruction of the permanent three-storey Mbare Traders Market is now coming to fruition as all modalities are in place.\n\nMinister Charles Tavengwa (left), Minister Jenfan Muswere (second from left) and other officials meet some of Budiriro 5B residents , Cleopatra Marwa(right) and Judith Mhuriyenda who benefited at Dziwarasekwa flats in Harare today.Picture : Joseph Manditswara.\n\nAt least 108 new modern houses and flats are being constructed behind Madokero Shopping Mall as part of efforts to ensure that the Governments one million housing units are met by year-end.\n\nThe Second Republic has delivered 700 000 houses and flats under National Development Strategy 1, more than triple its initial target of 220 000 and is now almost reaching the new one million target.\n\nSpeaking during the Harare provincial media tour of Madokero Creek and Madokero Mall, Exodus and Company chief executive Progress Mambo said the mall was financed by the Public Service Pension Fund.\n\nWe are also working with them to do the apartments I mentioned earlier, the 108 flats just behind this shopping mall.\n\nThis mall was officially opened by the President in December 2022 as the first phase, then the second phase was opened in June 2024, he said.\n\nTwenty-eight families that moved from Budiriro suburb to avoid being flooded out by the Marimba River are now housed at Dzivaresekwa flats. They heaped praise on President Mnangagwas administration for honouring his pledge of providing shelter to them.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries, Mrs Cleopatra Mahwa, said initially they had lost hope but were pleasantly surprised when they were offered shelter.\n\nI am glad that l now have decent accommodation courtesy of the Government. Although l still somehow experience fear when there are heavy rains that I might lose a child again, eventually l feel comforted knowing that l am at a safer place, she said.\n\nAnother beneficiary, Ms Judith Muriyenda, said had it not been for the benevolence of the President, life would have remained tough for her.\n\nIt took President Mnangagwas love to rescue us. At first, we thought the Government was just speaking without action. I nearly lost hope but thanks to our President for providing us with shelter, she said.\n\nSpeaking at the roundabout at the intersection of the Harare-Bindura Highway and Boulevard Road, Exodus and Company director (projects) Mr Alex Mashangu said infrastructure development was the new norm.\n\nThis is an exciting period in the nation in terms of infrastructure development, which covers roads, residential, and commercial. We are so excited about what weve done here in terms of contributing to the infrastructure around Harare.\n\n",

There is an urgent need for the Ministry, in collaboration with other relevant agencies, to take immediate action to restore the lakes health.\n\nAs part of the Governments initiative, Minister Nyoni outlined several measures, including formation of an Inter-Ministerial Committee to coordinate efforts in addressing water pollution.\n\nThe other plan is to have real-time monitoring systems installed to track pollution levels and inform management decisions while a proposal for over US$250 million has been set in motion to revamp aging wastewater management systems and replace outdated sewer infrastructure.\n\nMinister Nyoni also highlighted the necessity for additional funding to assist in cleaning out the dams.\n\nNotably, the lakes maximum depth has decreased from 27 metres to 20,7 metres, largely due to sediment accumulation, which poses a significant threat to aquatic life and overall biodiversity.\n\nGovernments commitment underscores the urgent need for decisive action to restore Lake Chivero and protect the livelihoods of the communities that depend on it.\n\nRecently, the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) said cyanobacteria caused the death of wildlife and fish in Lake Chivero.\n\nZimParks said thorough investigations conducted by the University of Zimbabwe and their own Veterinary and Capture Unit, conclusively showed that cyanobacteria was responsible for the deaths.\n\nThe Authority also said it was committed to ensuring that the problem affecting Lake Chivero was rectified to preserve natural heritage.\n\n",

We encourage split applications to enhance crop conditions. Time is running out, and we want our farmers to plant on time, he said.\n\nThe recent rainfall offers a glimmer of hope for Zimbabwean farmers who have been battling the effects of a prolonged dry spell. As they adapt to the changing weather, the emphasis remains on timely planting and effective pest management to maximise crop yields.\n\nAgritex deputy director Ms Rutendo Nhongonhema urged farmers to adopt good agronomic practices to speed up germination and growth.\n\nWe should come early with our top dressing and subsequent top dressing should be frequent with little amount of top dressing being applied so that we give our crop a comparative advantage and it grows fast to cater for the heat units, she said.\n\nMs Nhongonhema stressed the importance of scouting for pests, especially the fall armyworm, which peaks from December to January, recommending checks at least twice a week.\n\nFurthermore, farmers are encouraged to keep their fields weed-free, especially during the crucial six weeks of crop establishment, as improper weed management can lead to significant yield losses.\n\nUp to 50 percent losses can be incurred if weeds are not managed properly. Farmers are encouraged to implement an integrated weed management plan.\n\nThis includes chemical, physical, and biological control. During incessant rains, it may be difficult to use chemical control, so we advise methods like slashing, hand-pulling, or using hoes, Ms Nhongonhema said.\n\n",

At the household level, the Pfumvudza/Intwasa is key, as well as the agro-ecologocal tailoring and matching for maize and traditional grains. At the national level, the emphasis is on irrigation development, said Prof Jiri.\n\nConfederation of Retailers Association president Mr Denford Mutashu said they remained hopeful about the prospects for 2025.\n\nCZR hopes the ongoing engagement between Government and the private sector will regenerate a conducive business environment for both commerce and industry. Expectations remain high on levelling the playing field, improving competitiveness and restoration of formal businesses, said Mr Mutashu.\n\nEconomic analyst, Dr Prosper Chitambara said the economy was going to perform better than last year as that was hinged on a good rainfall season.\n\nWe are expecting industry and the economy in general to outperform last year. This expectation is based on the assumption that we are going to have a normal to above normal rainfall season that will boost agricultural production and ultimately help industry and the rest of the economy, said Dr Chitambara.\n\nAnother economic analyst, Mr Brains Muchemwa expressed optimism about this years prospects, but implored policy makers to address macro-economic fundamentals like power generation.\n\nBarring another drought and on the back of the multiple currency environment, the economic prospects for 2025 generally remain positive although persistent power shortages and the tight liquidity conditions in the economy will curtail the extent of the rebound.\n\nWhat is key, going forward, is for policy makers to protect the solvency of the domestic United States dollar clearing and settlement system through strict adherence to a prudent fiscal budget in order to see through the multiple currency regime all the way to 2030, he said.\n\nA legal practitioner, Advocate Ngobizitha Mlilo said the year will be good, but implored unity among Zimbabweans.\n\n",

Instead, the High Court is tasked with the solemn duty of imposing an appropriate substitute sentence, he said.\n\nMinister Ziyambi further emphasised that the Minister of Justice and the Commissioner-General of Prisons must ensure that those under death sentences are appropriately brought before the High Court for re-sentencing.\n\nMr Mlondolozi Ndlovu, a passionate anti-death penalty activist, expressed profound gratitude for the Presidents courageous decision, asserting that history will forever honour this pivotal legislative act.\n\nFor years, civil society, religious organisations, and compassionate individuals have rallied for the abolition of this heinous practice, which stands as a cruel, degrading, and inhumane form of punishment, he said.\n\n",
