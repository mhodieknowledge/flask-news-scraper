Africas youth must take an active role in land and economic matters. Their participation is not optional, it is imperative, he said.\n\nThe summit, organised by the Africa Youth Congress (AYC) chairperson Cde Taurai Kandishaya, aims to educate, empower, and engage youth in policy discussions, ensuring they play a central role in land governance.\n\nProf Jiri said Zimbabwes land tenure reforms aim to unlock economic value, improve land security, and drive economic growth.\n\nWe have entered a new era. All beneficiaries of the land reform under 99-year leases, offer letters, and permits will receive bankable, registrable, and transferable documents. This will enhance land security and boost investment, he said.\n\nProf Jiri also highlighted the Governments indefinite moratorium on issuing new 99-year leases, offer letters, and permits for agricultural land, ensuring better governance and sustainable land usage.\n\nZimbabwes reforms are not just transformative for us they offer a model for other African nations. Land is more than an asset. It is our heritage, our identity, and the foundation of our economies.\n\nProf Jiri said the future belongs to those who use land wisely.\n\nTogether, we can build a future where every citizen has access to land, opportunities, and prosperity, he said.\n\n",

Sadc is in solidarity with the Congolese people, she said.\n\nHer sentiments reflect Sadcs long-standing commitment to regional security, as enshrined in the Sadc Mutual Defence Pact of 2003, which obliges Member States to collectively address threats to peace and stability.\n\nThe Summit also paid tribute to the soldiers from Tanzania, South Africa, and Malawi who lost their lives during recent clashes in the eastern DRC while serving under SAMIDRC.\n\nRegional leaders expressed their condolences and reaffirmed their commitment to the mission.\n\nThe DRC crisis has drawn not only Sadcs attention but also that of the East African Community (EAC). While Sadc has been actively involved through SAMIDRC, the EAC has also deployed a regional force to counter the rebellion and stabilise the region.\n\nThe collaboration between SADC and the EAC underscores the necessity of regional partnerships in tackling complex security challenges. Both blocs continued engagements signal a shared determination to find a lasting solution.\n\nThe outcomes of the Troika Summit will be presented at an upcoming Extraordinary SADC Heads of State and Government Summit.\n\nThis meeting will likely refine and strengthen SAMIDRCs mandate, ensuring that it aligns with the evolving security landscape in the DRC.\n\nDuring a ZANU PF Politburo meeting last week, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, in his capacity as the Sadc chairperson, reaffirmed his commitment to addressing the ongoing crisis in DRC.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of regional unity and dialogue in resolving the conflict.\n\nThe DRC crisis is not just a Congolese problem, it is a regional challenge that requires a collective response. As Sadc, we are committed to ensuring peace and stability in the region, and we will continue to work tirelessly to support the DRC in its quest for lasting peace, President said.\n\nHe also highlighted the need for a balanced approach that combines military interventions with dialogue and peace building efforts.\n\nWhile we recognise the importance of military action in neutralising armed groups, we must also prioritise dialogue and inclusive solutions that address the root causes of the conflict, he said.\n\nAs leaders deliberate on the next steps, the people of the DRC, particularly those in its conflict-ridden eastern provinces, await a lasting solution to the conflict.\n\nThe DRC government, on the other hand, has offered a reward of US$5million for those who can help in arresting three leaders of the M23 rebel group.\n\nCorneille Nangaa, a former head of DRCs electoral commission, now leads the Congo River Alliance, which includes the M23 rebel group. He has addressed large rallies in the cities under the groups control.\n\nThe bounty is also on offer for M23 leaders Sultani Makenga and Bertrand Bisimwa.\n\nLast year, the three men were prosecuted in absentia by a military court and were given death sentences for treason.\n\nThe M23 rebel groups occupation of key areas in the region has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis and displaced thousands.\n\nA reward of US$4m was also offered for the arrest of two journalists living in exile and others that have been described by the DRC government as accomplices.\n\nIn recent weeks, the rebels captured large parts of the mineral-rich eastern DRC, including the regions two largest cities  Goma and Bukavu.\n\nHowever, the road ahead remains fraught with challenges, and both Sadc and the EAC must translate their commitments into tangible actions that address the root causes of the conflict and lay the groundwork for lasting peace. -@muponderichard\n\n",
