            "content": "Wallace Ruzvidzo-Herald Reporter\n\nTHE Government-sponsored air ambulance service will from next week be fully operational in Victoria Falls as the roll-out continues across the country.\n\nZimbabwe received a fleet of 18 Russian-made Ansat and Mi-17 helicopters in 2023 in a deal initiated by President Mnangagwa to ensure that patients in the public health system have access to top-class medical care.\n\nThe availing of this service has already seen several lives being saved across the country, with people in rural areas now able to be airlifted promptly to central hospitals.\n\nThe air ambulance service has so far been rolled out in Harare, Bulawayo and now Victoria Falls.\n\nMedical personnel comprising four doctors and four nurses have since received training at a local hospital in the resort city the countrys prime tourist destination.\n\nThis latest development will see an improvement in Victoria Falls capacity to promptly deal with eventualities that may arise needing the air ambulance services.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa visited HeliDrive Air Medical facilities in Russia last year and endorsed the roll out of air ambulance services in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis tour has been an eye-opener. The air medical services are critical for Zimbabwe. I give it my blessings, he said.\n\nTourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Barbara Rwodzi told The Herald yesterday that such services were a pull factor in terms of assuring prospective tourists, including high-profile figures of their safety, as they would be guaranteed of being taken care of should the need for the service arise.\n\nWe welcome the initiative, first and foremost let me thank His Excellency President Mnangagwa for bringing this long-term (service) which has positive results for tourism.\n\nAs the tourism sector and Ministry, we appreciate this because we have a lot of tourists who visit Victoria Falls as one of the seven wonders of the world. Many high profile people flock to Victoria Falls, but end up thinking twice, so right now we are working on the construction of a hospital which has a theatre because we do not have one in Victoria Falls, said Minister Rwodzi.\n\nThese high profile people put so much importance on their health and security so when they go for holiday to relax they really consider what happens in case of an emergency. They look for services such as the air ambulance so that if anything happens to them they are taken to a hospital that has a theatre which may be in Harare or Bulawayo. So these air ambulances that are coming will give comfort to the niche market of clients.\n\nNational Air Ambulance Service Russia Medical Director Mr Andrei Perevedentcev said local medical personnel in Victoria Falls had been fully trained and were ready for action.\n\nWe have trained eight medical personnel from the local hospital, four doctors and four nurses. So, that was kind of initial training, but its good enough to begin operations. Our plan is to relocate a helicopter to Victoria Falls latest at the beginning of February.\n\nSo, together with that helicopter, another doctor will come to Victoria Falls and do some kind of additional hands-on training because now that we have trained them on the ground, the next stage is to be trained practically in the helicopter.\n\nBut the local medical personnel is already, let us say, ready for action, he said.\n\nMr Perevedentcev went on to explain the operational modalities.\n\nWe have found a helipad inside the hospital. It is quite in a good condition. All we have to do is to remove some debris that surrounds the helipad, and then we will probably put a container there or establish an office nearby.\n\nBut for the beginning of operations, more or less, everything is ready, he said.\n\n",

The school will be responsible for the payment of legal fees for the urgent chamber application.\n\nI will give British Council up to 11 am tomorrow and if the matter is not resolved by then, I will engage the lawyers so that we map the way forward, which way forward will be communicated to stakeholders tomorrow.\n\nThe school also revealed that they were going to report the matter to the police.\n\nI am going to report a case of theft of trust funds amounting to US$41 272.00 to the Zimbabwe Republic Police and institute civil proceedings to recover the amount in question from the perpetrators of this criminal offence.\n\nHowever, my primary focus at the moment is to pursue options aimed at causing British Council to release theOLevel Cambridge results and thereafter will attend to the matter involving what appears to be a case of theft of trust funds.\n\nWhen The Herald contacted Knowstics Academy on its direct office line yesterday, the phone was picked up by a lady who said she was not in the right position to comment and promised to give us the number of a person who could comment.\n\nHowever, an hour later, when The Herald contacted them again and asked to speak to the schools principal, she simply said: Why cant you call the British Council?\n\nThis reporter also went to the British Council Zimbabwe offices in Belgravia, Harare, where he failed to even reach the reception after being advised by the security personnel manning the premises that they had just been informed that the council was not ready to entertain the media and that they had no comment.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot let you in, I have just been informed that they have no comment, the security guard said.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, the Acting Manicaland Provincial Education Director, Mr Richard Gabaza, confirmed the incident, saying they received the report on Friday and were still verifying the number of students affected.\n\nThe school is in Mutasa District, and I am based in Mutare so the District Schools Inspector (DSI) is the one handling the investigation, and after its completion, the DSI will submit a comprehensive report, he said.\n\nPrimary and Secondary Education Ministry spokesperson Mr Taungana Ndoro also confirmed that investigations were in full swing.\n\nWere still monitoring and investigating the situation, Mr Ndoro said.\n\nThis development also comes amid revelations that the top private school, which was recently placed under corporate rescue, has been battling an avalanche of legal suits from disgruntled staffers and service providers since 2023.\n\nIn that year, the non-payment of staff members was reported to the National Employment Council for Welfare and Educational Institutions (NEC).\n\nMeanwhile, Primary and Secondary Education Permanent Secretary Mr Moses Mhike has announced that all 2025 Lower Sixth classes will commence on Monday, January 27.\n\nMr Mhike said pupils will pay fees based on the number of days they attend school in Term 1, proportional to the total approved fees for the term.\n\nThe commencement date for the 2025 Lower Sixth classes is Monday, the 27th of January 2025. Please ensure that all Heads of schools, teachers, parents and pupils are advised of this date.\n\nThe fees payable by the lower six pupils will be on a pro-rata basis to the approved Term One fee for each school, given by the following formula:\n\nNumber of days remaining in Term 1 2025 x total approved term 1 Fees.\n\n",

There is a link that connects trees, humans, and wildlife. It is difficult to separate trees from the lives of people. Tree planting can help combat deforestation, soil erosion, and climate change while also providing benefits for people and wildlife, she said.\n\nShe bemoaned the cutting down of trees without re-planting them which she said exposed the country to the effects of climate change, erosion, and depleted forests.\n\nWhenever I travel with my programmes around the country, I am saddened with the way trees are being cut and veld fires. This also removes the natural habitat for wildlife Ndinorwadziwa ndichiona masango ave magwenga.\n\nLet us avoid the cutting down of trees and burning of forests because the law is against this. If you cut for production purposes, please re-plant the trees.\n\nIf we cut down trees and not replace them, how will our future generations know about them? Our forests are essential because they provide a habitat for our animals, she said.\n\nThe First Lady, who has traversed the length and breadth of the country urging communities to plant trees, spelt the need for community leaders to show how important the countrys resources were so that everyone rallied behind them in preserving trees and forests.\n\nShe humbly engaged traditional leaders and asked them what should be done to people who cut down trees.\n\nPeople plant trees during a planting programme led by Environment patron First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa in Murombedzi yesterday.\n\nOne of the chiefs responded, As traditional chiefs, we are also saddened by this kind of behaviour. Tinoti munhu asingazive pekushandisira demo rake ngaasungwe.\n\nThe First Lady further urged communities to also plant trees at their homesteads especially fruit trees.\n\nWill tourists visit us when our country is bare? These trees dzinopfekedzawo nyika yedu and this will attract tourists. Ndinoda kupa kuridziro kune varikuchera zvicherwa kuti vaite zviripamutemo. Vamwe vanopinda makanzi nevemutemo vasapinde vobva vazodhirikirwa nekuti pasi pazara mvura nekunaya. Even when the rain season is over, let us mine zviripamutemo.

We realised that the first port of call, especially for the citizens is the councils.\n\nSo, when we did our analysis for us to find out which Government departments need capacitation, we realised that RDCs need great capacitation.\n\nShe said the capacitation of councils remains at the heart of the Presidents vision.\n\nThis is very, very important because we realised that in terms of service delivery, in terms of even their capacity, whatever they need to do will be enhanced very much.\n\nWe are very happy that these 415 computers will go a long way towards capacitating our RDCs, and also for us to be able to attain a digitalised Zimbabwe.\n\nMinister Mavetera said they will take all the necessary steps to equip the councils.\n\nWe need to be able to equip them with the hardware. We have also gone some way in terms of connectivity, high-value connectivity, also increasing the uptime.\n\nSo we have engaged the Ministry of Local Government and said to them, it is quite important for them to also look at initiatives to provide alternative power sources, so that when it comes to connectivity, it is readily available, especially for RDCs.\n\nAccepting the gadgets on behalf of Local Government and Public Works Minister Daniel Garwe, his deputy Benjamin Kabikira said the donation will go a long way in improving efficiency among councils.\n\nDeputy Minister Kabikira said as a ministry, they are happy that the donation of computers will essentially accelerate the modernisation and digitisation agenda in pursuit of Vision 2030 and to be compliant in terms of service delivery by local authorities as outlined in the Call to Action Blueprint.\n\nI am happy to report that your donation has gone a long way in giving wings to our ministrys thrust of accelerating modernising and digitising our operations at all levels, he said.\n\nDeputy Minister Kabikira said Information Communication Technology has become an undoubted pillar of national development, and rural areas must be never left behind in the digital transformation journey.\n\nAssociation of Rural District Councils of Zimbabwe chairman, Dr Aaron Shamu, thanked President Mnangagwa for remembering this third tier of Government with such a good donation.\n\n",

In granting the interim relief sought by Prof Ncube, Justice Wamambo annulled Mr Tshabangus reshuffle of parliamentary leadership.\n\nThe judge cited an earlier judgment by Justice Tawanda Chitapi, which had explicitly barred Tshabangu from initiating recalls pending the resolution of the primary legal dispute surrounding his authority.\n\nJustice Wamambo remarked: Further, the reshuffle in this case amounts to a recall both literally and at law. I also find that the position of chief whip is not sanctioned by the constitution and is thus unlawful. The removal of members from the CSRO and their replacement amounts to a recall. Effectively, the first respondent disobeyed the order rendered in HH 652/23. In light of these circumstances, I find that the application is meritorious and should be granted.\n\n",

            "content": "WHILE the major cases of corruption have tended to make the headlines, the culture of corruption now being tackled effectively in Zimbabwe has been carried across a slew of amounts from a few dollars up to the headline grabbing millions.\n\nThe determination to investigate and prosecute all involved, regardless of whether they are a big shot or just a small shark, by the police, the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission and the Prosecutor General, shows that we are not tolerating or excusing any corruption.\n\nThis sort of attitude is needed as we continue clearing out the criminals and stop their crimes slowing Zimbabwes growth.\n\nSometimes an investigation just requires careful checking and some sort of audit process, that allows the honest to be ticked off the lists and the suspiciously dishonest invited to explain just what they are doing. Sometimes they can even be caught red-handed.\n\nOne exercise in progress is auditing the duty free import of personal motor vehicles by long-service civil servants below the top management ranks. The scheme has already been highlighted as helping to retain well-qualified and hard working civil servants and so has been considered a success.\n\nZimra has been checking up on the cars and while the honest majority have sighed and driven their cars up to a Zimra officer to be checked out, we have already seen those who probably sold them directly or indirectly being uncovered.\n\nAs the check is remarkably simple, just a look at the car with the owner standing by, all fiddles will be uncovered.\n\nAs with all schemes meant to help employees in both the private and public sectors, there have been those wanting to abuse the system or latch on to it to further other crimes.\n\nSome civil servants went through the application process, but then for a price allowed a dealer or someone else to import the vehicle under their names.\n\nThis particular fiddle also saw civil servants selling the vehicle before the minimum holding time was reached if they wished to retain the duty rebate.\n\nThen there were those who went commercial over the corruption, with one woman from Zimra using her boss electronic signature to sign off on more than 400 fake rebate letters, generally held by car dealers.\n\nWhile she has wisely gone to ground, probably in a foreign country, already assets in this country have been frozen so that eventually she will not profit.\n\nThis sort of bulk order corruption and forgery explains why some authorities suspect there could be as many as 3 000 cars and pick-ups that escaped duty illegally, although far fewer civil servants were involved.\n\nIn some cases importers were not even civil servants, just people outside Government service who held fake documents, and in other cases there have been civil servants startled to find they are on some list of importers when they never applied for the benefit, but whose identities were in effect stolen by criminals.\n\nSo the investigation has had many facets, but in the end those who may have acted corruptly and those who were outside criminals will all be accounted for and in the end Zimra will get the duty money, and the guilty will lose their cars.\n\nBoth sources will help the Government find the money for important projects.\n\nThe main point is that the investigations and prosecutions are shielding no one.\n\nProsecutor-General Justice Loice Mutanda-Moyo wryly noted that she and her office are certainly not going to shield civil servants as some have speculated. There are already six prosecutors on trial for bribe taking, so no one is being spared.\n\nThe culture of corruption, and the assumption that it is possible to get favours for bribes, has seen some other types of con-artist at work.\n\nThere is now a man in court accused of conning a number of people out of US$2 855. He was seeking low-level bribes, generally US$20 a shot, to guarantee employment by Harare City Council in a low level job of a named person.\n\nThere were people intending to help relatives and prepared to spend US$100 to have five listed, but part of the success of this low-level con artist was his cheapness, which meant people did not perform the sort of checks they might well have thought prudent for more expensive schemes.\n\nIn the end, the conned people found out there were no jobs to start with, and that the conman was not connected to the council.\n\nBut the corruption culture meant that those paying off the conman thought that paying what they must have known were illegal fees was just part of life, and that is sad.\n\nWe have seen over the decades similar con-schemes, especially around the civil registry offices, where smooth-talking touts take a small bribe and vanish, although some, once they have a willing payer, may ask for a top-up because they have to pay off a second registry clerk.\n\nAs people start realising that corruption is being tackled effectively we hope that these sort of attempts, to collect a bribe for a service that does not even exist, will be rejected.\n\nMeanwhile, some Government offices, like Zimra tax offices, the civil registries and the central vehicle registry, will need to retain their public notices that they do not employ agents wandering around outside and their clients and customers need to talk to regular officers inside.\n\nChecks are always important and most legitimate civil service offices and private businesses welcome such checks, especially if they can then have yet another conman arrested.\n\nThose who think they are benefiting from someone elses corruption need to think seriously since they are either being conned, or are being sucked into a deal that will see them join the con person in the dock.\n\n",
