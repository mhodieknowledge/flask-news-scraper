            "content": "Harmony Agere\n\nTHE electric vehicle (EV) market in Zimbabwe is still in its infancy but industry players are confident the sector will soon register rapid growth due to measures being implemented by the Government, including the scrapping of import duty.In an interview with The Herald on the current state of EV adoption in the country, BYD Zimbabwe general manager Mr Edward Muchuchuti highlighted the importance of Government support, giving reference to policies such as the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), which promotes the use of renewable energy.\n\nThe EV market is still in its infancy in Zimbabwe, and baby steps are being taken to grow the market, he said.\n\nIt is still relatively quite low compared to regional countries, but we are getting there.\n\nThere is political will from our Government, as evidenced by the crafting of NDS1, which talks about the social and infrastructural pillar that promotes renewable energy adoption.\n\nChallenges hindering EV adoption\n\nWhile Zimbabwe is making progress, Mr Muchuchuti acknowledged significant challenges hindering the adoption of electric vehicles.\n\nThe first challenge is education. Africa, generally, is slow in terms of adoption, he said.\n\nWe often ride on the bandwagon after the rest of the globe. But because of the pressures on us, I believe we will move in the right direction.\n\nFinancial constraints also pose a barrier.\n\nThe element of disposable income is a challenge for many individuals in the country, he said.\n\nCoupled with limited access to capital, the high upfront cost of EVs makes adoption difficult.\n\nMr Muchuchuti said infrastructure remains another hurdle.\n\nCharging stations are still a major concern, he said.\n\nFor example, I come from Buhera and between Harare and Buhera, there is no charging port. That affects the decision to switch to EVs.\n\nEfforts to expand charging infrastructure\n\nDespite the infrastructure gaps, Mr Muchuchuti revealed that BYD Zimbabwe is actively working on solutions.\n\nWe are very upbeat about promoting EVs and are ensuring that we roll out charging ports across the country, he said.\n\nWe have a deliberate plan in place, working in conjunction with other stakeholders. Within a short period, we will see a shift.\n\nBYD is currently engaging with Government agencies and private entities to develop charging infrastructure.\n\nWe have been talking to quasi-government institutions like ZERA, as well as the oil industry, given their existing energy infrastructure, he said.\n\nNGOs with an appetite for renewables are also on board.\n\nAffordability and policy considerations\n\nAddressing concerns over EV affordability, Mr Muchuchuti stressed the importance of policy interventions.\n\nWe are lobbying our Government to reduce the duty component of EVs to zero, he said.\n\nIn South Africa and Zambia, this has already been done and we believe it is a step in the right direction.\n\nBYD Zimbabwe is also engaging original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to understand the local market and make EVs more accessible.\n\nWe are working to ensure our price build-up is as lean as possible to promote adoption, said Mr Muchuchuti.\n\nElectric buses and the transport sector\n\nMr Muchuchuti underscored the economic benefits of electric buses, particularly for companies managing large fleets.\n\nWe recently worked with a banking sector partner with a huge fleet, he said.\n\nCurrently, they spend nearly a million dollars annually on fuel for internal combustion engines. If they shift to EVs, their budget could drop to around US$130 000.\n\nOnce EVs are adopted in the transport sector, perhaps we will go back to the days when a bus ride from Highfield to town was just 11 cents.\n\nFuture prospects\n\nMr Muchuchuti encouraged Zimbabweans to embrace EV technology now rather than waiting for the future.\n\nEV adoption is about the now, he said.\n\nGiven the economic benefits, including low cost and low maintenance, there is no reason not to make the switch.\n\nIf you want to be frugal and economic, going for EVs is the right decision.\n\nThe BYD ATTO3: A new contender\n\nAs part of BYDs push into the Zimbabwean market, Mr Muchuchuti highlighted the companys latest model, the ATT03.\n\nIts designed for Zimbabwean terrain, with excellent ground clearance and advanced driver assistance technology, he said.\n\nThe ATT03 has a range of 420 kilometres on a single charge, which is about a weeks worth of local trips.\n\nits battery capacity of 60 kilowatts can even be used as an alternative power source during load shedding.\n\nWith continued efforts in policy reform, infrastructure development and public awareness, Mr Muchuchuti remains optimistic about Zimbabwes EV future.\n\nWe are moving in the right direction, and with collective effort, we will certainly get there.\n\n",

            "content": "Africa Moyo, Deputy News Editor\n\nTHE amount of ZiG circulating in the market matches the Governments aspirations for durable currency stability desired by consumers, a Cabinet Minister has said.\n\nExplaining Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwes tight fiscal and monetary policy positions, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube said the prevailing exchange rate stability where the official and parallel market rates were almost converging was not artificial and would be sustained for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis follows concerns by some members of the transacting public and industrialists about the alleged shortage of the ZiG, which they claimed was affecting the economy.\n\nSome critics say ZiG shortages have resulted in an artificial inflation level, which would rise if more local currency became available on the market.\n\nThe domestic currency monthly inflation rate matched the US dollar rate in January, following a spike driven by increases in rentals.\n\nIn January 2025, Zimbabwes month-on-month inflation rate in ZiG terms surged to 105 percent, a significant increase from the previous months 3,7 percent, compared to the 11,5 percent rate for the US dollar monthly inflation rate.\n\nThe ZiG monthly inflation rate came in at 0,5 percent in February and remains well below the 5 percent monthly range set by Treasury.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Herald, Prof Ncube said Zimbabwes low inflation trajectory was not artificial.\n\nInflation is what it is. But also the accusation is that theres no money in the market. That is what is called a tight monetary policy; that is actually the technical definition, he said.\n\nSo, right now, we have a policy that is tight in order to manage inflation in the first place. That is the objective; so its not artificial.\n\nA tight monetary policy, also known as contractionary monetary policy, is a strategy used by a central bank to limit the amount of money available in the economy and may include raising interest rates to curb inflation and speculative borrowing.\n\nThe level of inflation is commensurate with the ZIG money supply that is at hand, and it is appropriate that the Reserve Bank is conducting such tight monetary policy, said Prof Ncube.\n\nThat monetary policy is complemented, also, by a tight fiscal policy because what you dont want is for Government spending to run away, getting out of control to a point where we have to monetise that excess budget deficit.\n\nHe said doing that would drive the money supply and raise inflation, pushing prices of most products beyond the reach of many.\n\nA tight fiscal policy involves a government making sure it lives within its means. In this case, all current and capital spending on social services come out of taxes.\n\nOnly capital spending that produces an instant flow of extra money to repay a loan can be supported by borrowing. This means that the Government does not create money and thus feeding inflation.\n\nProf Ncube said a tight fiscal policy and a tight monetary policy went hand in hand.\n\nThat is what we have right now and that is why the ZiG is stable in the first place. The economy and citizens have been crying out for a stable macroeconomic environment and that is what we are delivering right now. So people should be pleased that at least, we are delivering what is expected of us as the economic policymakers, he said.\n\nThey demanded stability; it allows them to plan, it gives our domestic currency, ZIG, value. You can now save in it, you can transact in it, you restore value characteristics.\n\nZimbabwes monetary policy focuses on maintaining a tight stance, backing Treasurys tight fiscal stance, to stabilise the ZiGand curb inflation, with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe aiming to ensure all ZiG in circulation is well-covered by foreign currency reserves.\n\nZiG is backed by gold and foreign reserves.\n\nThe RBZs gold and foreign reserves accumulation strategy in 2024 has resulted in its gold holdings increasing from 1,5 tonnes to 2,7 tonnes.\n\nThe monetary value of gold and foreign currencies ended last year at over US$500 million, which is more than three times cover for the ZiG in circulation.\n\nIn its Strategy Plan (2025-2029), the RBZ exclusively focuses on its core mandate of maintaining price and financial stability, which is aligned to the Back-to-Basics thrust aimed at balancing Confidence-Trust-Credibility-Efficiency-Stability-Growth outcomes.\n\n",
