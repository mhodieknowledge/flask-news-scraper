Our major challenge is not so much that we are not literate but it is that there is a need to go beyond just literacy to the attainment of a skill set that is more productive.\n\nIndian Ambassador Mr Dina Nath Barnwal stated that the initiative fosters unity between nations by facilitating the exchange of ideas.\n\nHe said that participants will gain valuable skills and use them to contribute to the development of both Zimbabwe and India.\n\n",

            "content": "Business Reporter\n\nInvestors have acquired 58 percent of the fractional shares in WestProp Holdings innovative apartment hotel, Millennium Heights, in Borrowdale West, Harare, chief executive, Mr Ken Sharpe has said.\n\nThe innovative model was launched in November last year, with investors participating with a minimum investment of US$5 000.\n\nThe model allows multiple investors to co-own an apartment, which will then be leased out to clients as short-term serviced accommodation.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, we have traditionally been accustomed to owning property outright. This approach (outright ownership) often requires significant upfront capital and can be a costly endeavour, especially for first-time investors, Mr Sharpe said.\n\nThat is where fractional ownership comes in. By pooling resources with like-minded investors, you can own a share of a luxury apartment hotel like Block 5 without breaking the bank.\n\nMr Sharpe said WestPop was actively engaged in an educational campaign to inform customers about the benefits of fractional share ownership in the apartment hotel.\n\nHe said the market was showing increasing interest in the concept, with a significant number of customers already purchasing shares in the branded apartment hotel.\n\nInvestors are particularly drawn to the flexibility of fractional ownership, which reduces risk and makes the investment more accessible\n\nAfter the first year of operation as an aparthotel, investors can expect returns of at least 8 percent, he said.\n\nHowever, as the property values increase and the hotels occupancy rates grow, so too will be the return on investment.\n\nMr Sharpe encouraged potential investors to seize the opportunity to secure their future and that of their families.\n\nHe said the investment presents a unique pathway towards long-term financial security. With guaranteed returns, he described it as a game-changer within Zimbabwes property market.\n\nThe innovative model, the first of its kind in the country, allows investors to enjoy the benefits of property ownership while simultaneously generating income, effectively enabling them to have their cake and eat it too.\n\nDo not miss out on this opportunity to invest in Zimbabwes future and secure a share of the profits, he said.\n\nWestProp is finalising a partnership with an international hotel brand currently absent from the Zimbabwean market.\n\nThe brand possesses significant expertise in the marketing and management of serviced apartments, often referred to as short-term rentals.\n\nMillennium Heights will offer a range of amenities for residents, including concierge services and exclusive recreational facilities. They include a swimming pool, a childrens play area, a gym, among others.\n\n",

The contract, facilitated through Chemplex Corporation, involved the erection of a greenhouse shade at Dorowa Minerals Murambinda site.\n\nA payment of US$77 264.19 was supposed to be paid to Coursim Investments. The contract was signed by Katiyo and the acting general manager of Dorowa Minerals at Chemplexs headquarters in Harare.\n\nHowever, witnesses for Dorowa Minerals, stationed at the mine, were unavailable at the time.\n\nThe witnesses, Viznet Ruzvezve and Evans Bonde, signed the contract on February 22 and returned the signed document via email.\n\nKatiyo later received a scanned copy of the signed contract and acknowledged its receipt.\n\nThe business relationship allegedly went sour when contractual breaches emerged, prompting Katiyo to terminate the agreement and send a termination notice to Chemplex via email.\n\nAfter termination, Katiyo demanded payment for the services rendered. Chigwende allegedly disputed the payment claim and presented a contract document that had allegedly been unlawfully altered.\n\nThe State alleged that Chigwende had forged the document by replacing the witnesses signatures and falsely dating them back to February 20.\n\nThis forgery was reportedly used by Chigwende to manipulate the terms of the contract and justify non-payment of the claimed amount.\n\nKatiyo discovered the discrepancies in the contract and accused Chigwende of using the forged document to withhold payment.\n\n",
