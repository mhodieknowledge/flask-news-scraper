Charltan Trust provides them with a safe place to live, grow, and learn while raising their children, read the statement.\n\nWe donated fabric materials and two sewing machines to enhance their skills training and income-generating projects.\n\nThe club added that this is not just a donation of tools but an investment in their future.\n\nThe young mothers, who produce handmade bags and hats, recently secured a contract to supply an exclusive international outlet in Harare, a major step toward economic independence, said the club.\n\nThese are the people we are called to serve those society has forgotten. Empowering them is the essence of Rotary.\n\nIn Beatrice, the club is overseeing the local implementation of the Manyoshwa Primary School Project. The US$67 703 project involves constructing classroom blocks and toilets for a rural farming community.\n\nThis is a community-driven initiative. Residents are providing labour and materials, and we are ensuring transparency and accountability, said the club.\n\nA site visit held on September 20 2024, confirmed readiness for the implementation stage.\n\nWe are excited to witness transformation where it is needed most, the Club said.\n\nDaramombe Mission Clinic located in Chivhu and serving both Chikomba and Buhera districts, is also receiving attention.\n\nThe clinic urgently needs a reliable water supply, solar power, and modern equipment, the Club said.\n\nWe are actively seeking partners to help rehabilitate the facility and restore dignity to rural healthcare.\n\n",

Traditional grains do well in this region and we encourage our farmers to grow crops according to their agro-ecological regions. They should go by nature.\n\nWhere there is low rainfall we must respond by growing traditional grains which give us good yields, he said.\n\nThis initiative aims to improve food security by providing farmers with the necessary support and inputs to increase their yields, improving their livelihoods and promoting the production and consumption of traditional grains.\n\nProf Jiri emphasised that sorghum yields that had been achieved this season are a testament to the potential of traditional grains in Muzarabani District.\n\nThat is the grain we must eat because it is naturally bio fortified with rich nutrients like zinc, magnesium and so forth, he said.\n\nProf Jiri said the swap programme whereby farmers could exchange their traditional grains for maize was still operational.\n\nHe however, urged farmers to eat traditional grains which are healthier.\n\nThe field day was aimed at providing a platform for farmers to share knowledge and best practices on sorghum production.a\n\n",
