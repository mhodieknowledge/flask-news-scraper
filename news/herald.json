            "content": "Trust Khosa\n\nSoccer-mad Zimdancehall stalwart Sylvster Freeman Chizanga has urged the corporate world to partner with creatives in community-building initiatives.\n\nHis call comes after the recent Pacific Storm social soccer tournament, featuring various musicians at Gwanzura in Highfield, Harare.\n\nVigilance FC won the tournament, taking home US$1 000, while Freemans Gallis FC, King Shaddys Makorokoza FC, and Zim Musicians, captained by Peter Moyo, received consolation prizes in the packed stadium.\n\nAlthough Freeman missed the tournament due to other commitments, he expressed his support for his team and commended the organizers for uniting musicians and fans.\n\nIts important for people to connect with artists in person. They might resonate with you more than through radio, and that can lead to new followers. People can fall in love with your character as a celebrity, he said.\n\nFreeman praised his team for their commitment over the past year.\n\nThey participated not just because Im the leader but because they have a passion for the game. Their effort is evident in every tournament.\n\nAs a youth icon, Freeman acknowledged the organisers efforts to combat drug abuse through the event.\n\nDrug abuse is often linked to unemployment and bad influences. However, there are many ways to escape these temptations. When idle, try reading, researching, meditating, praying, or going to the gym. Self-empowerment can be a powerful escape route.\n\nHe also offered advice to aspiring musicians.\n\nBe true to yourself. The internet can mislead you into thinking that youre falling behind, but no one posts their failures online. Trust your process and embrace your journey; eventually, youll succeed.\n\nPacific Storm marketing manager Kuda Chiutsi assured the youth that more community-centred programmes are on their way.\n\nThis tournament is part of the numerous initiatives we implement at Pacific Cigarette Company.\n\nIt is aimed at promoting community cohesion and addressing issues affecting young adults. We believe that the tournament has sparked more projects that will enhance local economies and improve livelihoods for all, he said.\n\n",
