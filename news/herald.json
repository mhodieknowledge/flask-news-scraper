It is now a global challenge, said the Ministry.\n\nThe Ministry urged farmers to do regular scouting in their crops to check for the presence of the pest so that they take remedial action once its presence is confirmed to avoid possible losses.\n\nThe army-worm travel in multitudes and cover long distances during the night. They can cross national boundaries within a short period of time and are driven by winds.\n\nExperts note that the armyworm follows humid areas and lays eggs at a very fast rate. A female can lay up to 800 eggs within five weeks.\n\nThe armyworm can wipe out the whole crop during the night if not controlled on time, as it has a monster appetite for foliage.\n\nYoung armyworms are small making it very difficult to spot them. The best time to check for the pest is in the morning or evening.\n\nAdditionally, the Ministry also took the opportunity to advise farmers that the maize planting window had expired, hence the need to expedite the planting of short-season varieties of sugar beans, sweet potatoes, African peas, and traditional grains, as the possible options.\n\nFarmers are also encouraged to diversify crop options and practise staggered planting, as a way of spreading risk and reduce losses.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Agricultural and Rural Development Advisory Services (ARDAS) has since indicated that teams from the Migratory Pest Control department were already on the ground to attend to the distress call.\n\n",
