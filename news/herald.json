            "content": "Ivan Zhakata\n\nHerald Correspondent\n\nHarares ambitious promise of achieving world-class city status by 2025 is in tatters since the new year has been ushered in with nothing to show that the capital is anywhere near being a world-class city.\n\nThe opposition-led City Council, which once rallied citizens with the mantra of a modern, clean and efficient urban environment, is now facing harsh criticism for failing to deliver on basic services.\n\nResidents have expressed frustration over deteriorating service delivery, citing mounting issues such as uncollected garbage, erratic water supply, crumbling roads, and inadequate street lighting. Far from the envisioned world-class standards, Harare appears to be sinking deeper into urban decay.\n\nIn 2018, the councils leadership announced its ambitious vision of transforming Harare into a beacon of modern urban living by 2025.\n\nThe blueprint included improved waste management systems, consistent potable water supplies, upgraded road infrastructure and a smart urban transport system.\n\nHowever, seven years later, progress has been scant.\n\nWe were promised a city we could all be proud of, but it is a nightmare now. Refuse goes uncollected for weeks, and potholes have turned roads into death traps, lamented Tafadzwa Moyo, a resident of the high-density suburb of Mbare.\n\nOne of the most glaring failures has been waste management. Heaps of garbage are now a common sight across the city, posing serious health risks.\n\nReports indicate that the citys refuse trucks are frequently grounded due to poor maintenance, while budget constraints have stalled the procurement of new vehicles.\n\nWater provision, a long-standing challenge, has worsened. Many households receive water only a few days a week, forcing residents to rely on unsafe boreholes.\n\nThe opposition-led council blame obsolete water infrastructure and a lack of central Government support as the main hurdles.\n\nThe citys road network, once a point of pride, is now riddled with potholes, contributing to increased road accidents.\n\nDespite promises of regular maintenance and upgrades, little has been done to address this critical issue.\n\nStreet lighting is virtually non-existent in many areas, plunging neighborhoods into darkness and increasing crime rates.\n\nCritics have accused the opposition-led council of prioritising political battles and looting over service delivery.\n\nResidents argue that resources meant for development projects have been mismanaged, while others blame the councils failure to engage the central Government effectively for financial support.\n\nThis is not about politics, it is about governance. We are tired of leaders who use excuses instead of solutions, said a disgruntled resident.\n\nCouncil officials, however, argue that their hands are tied due to limited funding and interference from the central government.\n\nWe have faced constant sabotage in our efforts to secure funding and implement our plans, Mayor Jacob Mafume is on record saying.\n\nHe further highlighted that the city requires over US$100 million annually to meet its operational needs, yet revenue collections remain low.\n\nThe failure to deliver on promises has left residents disillusioned and questioning the competence of their leaders.\n\nHarares decline underscores the urgent need for a paradigm shift in urban governance, where leadership transcends political squabbles to prioritise the needs of its citizens.\n\nAs the council grapples with its challenges, residents can only hope that the next chapter brings real action instead of empty promises.\n\n",

The complainant is a 14-year-old girl. According to prosecutor Ms Tariro Janhi, Tunha was a spiritual advisor to the complainants mother, who frequently sought his assistance for spiritual matters.\n\nThe complainant and her mother were regular visitors to Tunhas shrine at Churu Farm in Glen View for spiritual healing.\n\nAt some point, Tunha reportedly requested the complainants cellphone number, which he was given.\n\nThe two began communicating via WhatsApp. In October 2024, Tunha allegedly proposed love to the complainant, which she accepted.\n\nThe court heard that later that month, Tunha phoned the complainant and arranged to meet her at Glen View 3 Turn-Off.\n\nHe allegedly picked her up in a white Toyota Quantum and drove to a lodge in Kuwadzana 2.

Let us adhere to this guidance to avoid potential losses, he said.\n\nWhile the maize planting period is over, he encouraged farmers to continue growing crops such as sunflower and sugar beans, which can still thrive with the available moisture\n\nZimbabwe Commercial Farmers Union (ZCFU)president Dr Shadreck Makombe echoed this sentiment, warning that late-planted maize varieties may not mature in time due to potential rainfall shortages in March.\n\nHe urged farmers to engage agriculture extension officers for suitable planting advice.\n\nFarmers should stop planting because failure to do that may lead to losses, he said.\n\n",
