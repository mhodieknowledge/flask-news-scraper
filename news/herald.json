Improving road safety is not solely the responsibility of the Government.

It has become increasingly clear that road safety is a key aspect of development and needs to be accorded the seriousness it deserves.\n\nYou will see a strong presence of law enforcement and traffic safety officers on the roads, conducting roadblocks and patrols to ensure that traffic laws are being observed. We want to create a visible deterrent to reckless behaviour and to ensure that all road users take road safety seriously.\n\nAs Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe, we continue to reiterate the message of road safety, keeping in mind, that Safety First, There Is No Second Chance, he said.\n\n",

That is when Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova launched by herself, becoming the first woman in space. Tereshkova spent three days off the planet.\n\nEven after the latest launch, women represent barely 15 per cent of the more than 700 people who have travelled into space.\n\nSanchez said she deliberately chose women to launch with her, each of them eager to inspire both the young and old to dream big, and even commissioned special flight suits.\n\nIts an important moment for the future of commercial space travel and for humanity in general and for women all around, Katy Perry said last week.\n\nThe launch brought out VIPs to West Texas, including Oprah Winfrey and several other women.\n\nBezos is an American businessman best known as the founder of Amazon, the worlds largest e-commerce and cloud computing company. -www.scmp.com\n\n",
