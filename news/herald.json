            "content": "Zvamaida Murwira, Senior Reporter\n\nThe Sadc Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has repelled an aggression by M23 armed rebels as the regional bloc steps up efforts to restore normalcy in the Great Lakes region.\n\nHostilities in the region have killed thousands, with millions fleeing their homes.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa, who is the current chairperson of Sadc, convened an extraordinary summit in November last year to discuss unrest in the North Kivu of DRC as the regional bloc shows commitment to address the challenges.\n\nIn his message after the summit, President Mnangagwa implored the region to support peace efforts in eastern DRC, adding that the region should never settle for less.\n\nBoth Sadc and the African Union have issued statements denouncing the aggression by the rebel group.\n\nIn a statement at the weekend, the Sadc Secretariat expressed concern at the recent attack on the SADC Force, the SAMIDRC, by the M23 armed group.\n\nSadc unequivocally condemns this act of aggression by the M23 operating in the Eastern DRC, such actions undermine the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and peace and security of the DRC and the SADC region, reads the statement.\n\nThe pursuit of territorial expansion by M23 only exacerbates the already existing dire humanitarian and security situation in the Eastern DRC, which has left thousands of people dead and forced millions in North Kivu, particularly women, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities, to flee their homes, reads the statement.\n\nThe rebel group M23 attacked SAMIDRC in Goma to which SAMIDRC retaliated and successfully repelled the armed group. SADC commends the actions of the brave men and women from SAMIDRC who sacrificed their lives for the Region.\n\nThe Sadc Secretariat noted that the M23 aggression was in violation of the peace agreement that was struck by Angolan leader, President Joase Manuel Goncalves Lourenco, between the DRC Government and the rebels.\n\nThe actions of the M23 armed group contravenes the Nairobi Peace Process and is a clear violation of the agreed ceasefire brokered through the Luanda Process led by His Excellency Joo Manuel Gonalves Loureno, President of the Republic of Angola in his capacity as the African Union Champion for Peace and Reconciliation in Africa. We, therefore, call on all parties in the conflict to adhere to their obligations in the ceasefire, calling for immediate cessation of hostilities and atrocities perpetrated by M23 as well as unconditional withdrawal from all occupied positions, reads the statement.\n\nSadc further encourages all parties to the conflict in Eastern DRC to comply with the terms and conditions of the existing peace agreements and engage through dialogue for everlasting peace, security and stability in the DRC and the Region.\n\nThe regional bloc reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to continue supporting the DRC in its pursuit of safeguarding its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, as well as sustainable peace, security, and development.\n\nTo this end, the SAMIDRC will remain resolute in supporting efforts aimed at addressing the unstable and deteriorating security and humanitarian situation prevailing in the Eastern DRC. We call upon the international community, including the United Nations, to join us in denouncing these unlawful actions by the M23. Sadc Region reiterates its solidarity with the people of the DRC and commends them for resilience against brutal actions perpetrated by the M23 and other armed groups, reads the statement.\n\nAfrican Union Commission chairperson, Dr Moussa Faki Mahamat, said the continental body was following with great attention the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in the east of the DRC.\n\nIn a statement the AU said: He (Dr Mahamat) notes with deep concern the threats that such developments pose to the tireless and significant efforts undertaken within the framework of the two African mechanisms, notably the Luanda process led by President Joao Manuel Loureno, President of the Republic of Angola.\n\nHe expresses his unreserved support for such efforts, which are the only way to resolve the persistent tension between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Rwanda, on the one hand, and between the Government of the DRC and its political-military opposition, on the other.\n\nHe calls for the strict observance of the ceasefire agreed between the parties and the immediate cessation of all hostilities.\n\n",

This is a great loss to the United Methodist family. With his ties to people he did so many things for the church of God to go forward that we would spend the whole day talking about, said Eng Rafamoyo.\n\nRetired Major Anesu Katsande, who is the United Methodist Harare District Superintendent, concurred saying the death of Cde Mupamhanga was not a loss to the family alone, but the nation at large.\n\nThe national hero was a devout Christian who would not miss a church service. He did a lot for the growth of the church, including building a church in his home area of Mount Darwin.\n\nHe did not show that he held top positions in Government but rather remained simple. He was a giver, he loved God and he was someone who looked after the church, she said\n\nCde Mupamhanga abandoned his university studies at the then-University of Rhodesia in 1975 to join ZANLA forces fighting to liberate the country.\n\nFollowing his military training, he was permitted to complete his university education. He subsequently held key positions within the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), serving in the commissariat and education departments.\n\nAfter Zimbabwes independence, he embarked on a distinguished career in the public service.\n\nHe commenced his Government service in 1983 within the Economics Division of the Presidents Department.\n\n",

            "content": "Trust Freddy, Herald Correspondent\n\nAs Lower Sixth classes start today, a cloud of uncertainty hangs over 40 students from Knowstics Academy, who are yet to receive their Cambridge Ordinary Level results after school authorities allegedly embezzled over US$40 000 in examination fees.\n\nHowever, all Zimsec O-level exams candidates will have a seamless transition to Lower Sixth, thanks to the Governments efforts to release results on time, just a week after schools opened, breaking the tradition of delayed releases that often occurred in mid-February.\n\nThough the majority of those who sat for the external Cambridge board examinations, learners studying at private schools, received their results on time, 40 students from Knowstics Academy are still awaiting theirs as the British Council is reportedly demanding payment of the examination fees before releasing the results.\n\nAs of Friday, most Lower Sixth boarders had started travelling to their schools for orientation, with the majority making their way to their destinations yesterday while day schools will start today.\n\nThe Government yesterday confirmed that all necessary preparations were in place to ensure a smooth opening of Lower Sixth classes today, marking the beginning of a new academic term for Lower Sixth students nationwide.\n\nYes, everything is in place, Primary and Secondary Education Ministry spokesperson Mr Taungana Ndoro said.\n\nLast week, we were going around schools, particularly in Manicaland, checking whether they were ready to enrol the Lower Six students, and everything is in place. Those who are going to boarding schools are ready to start tomorrow.\n\nHe also reiterated that tuition and boarding fees should be paid on a pro-rata basis, which will see the incoming learners paying less than their counterparts who started classes mid January.\n\nIts on a pro-rata basis, so we will calculate by the number of days that are remaining in the term vis-a-vis the approved fee, he added.\n\nThe early release of results is part of the Second Republics efforts to maximise face-to-face learning and keep learners away from societal ills, such as drug abuse, and is also in line with the heritage-based curriculum being implemented this year.\n\nOur efficiency has made us realise that we do not need to lose teaching and learning time for our form fives or our form ones.\n\nThis is why, as the administrative Government, we made sure that ZIMSEC releases results much earlier. \n\nIn the past, Lower Sixth students had a longer gap between the release of their O-Level results and the start of classes, which often led to some students engaging in undesirable activities during the extended break.\n\nYou will notice that the Grade Seven results were released before schools closed, so that parents could have ample time to prepare. The same with the O-level results, which were released less than 24 hours after the Cambridge results, so that our pupils may also be able to get into form five without losing much time. Schools only opened on the 14th of January, and as you can see, by January 27, which is barely two weeks later, we are already opening for the lower sixth classes\n\nRemember, we also have a heritage-based curriculum, which we have implemented and which we are implementing, so we dont want any of our learners to lag behind.\n\nThe Government is however still trying to engage both parties to resolve the issue affecting 40 students from Knowstics, but the process is reportedly being hindered by the fact that both the school, which is currently under judicial management, and the examinatin board are private entities, making it difficult to find a mutually beneficial solution.\n\nMinister of Primary and Secondary Education, Torerai Moyo, told The Herald on Friday that if the dispute had been directly between ZIMSEC and the school, the ministry would have been able to intervene and resolve the issue more swiftly.\n\nThis incident comes barely two months after President Mnangagwa bailed out 34 learners at Findale School in Eastview, Harare, who missed their first ZIMSEC OLevel examination paper after the school allegedly embezzled their examination fees.\n\nThe President paid for the stranded learners examination fees and made it possible for them to write the remaining subjects since it was a local examination board.\n\nThe results scandal also comes barely a month after Knowstics Academy was placed under corporate rescue in a bid to revamp its operations and restore its reputation.\n\nOn the other hand , the British Council of Zimbabwe is on record saying they will not release the results until the school has paid the balance of US$22 000, citing a breach of contract.\n\nWhen contacted for comment yesterday, the schools corporate rescue practitioner, Mr Bhudhama Chikamhi, said, There is no progress yet regarding the release of results; we are still where we were last time.\n\nHowever, Mr Chikamhi noted that not all 40 students would be stranded, as some had also sat for the ZIMSEC O-level exams and could use those results, providing them with alternative options to further their education.\n\n",

He said the issue of drugs and substance abuse had become a cause for concern among the youths.\n\nTodays event is a celebration of athletics, teamwork and an opportunity for our youths to showcase their skills, said Vice President Mohadi.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I am saddened by the prevailing situation of drug and substance abuse which is not only affecting the youths alone, but adults as well. Many youths with a good upbringing and a promising future have unfortunately fallen victims to this scourge.\n\nLet me hasten to point out that Government, under the Second Republic, is putting all efforts to curb this pandemic through identification and establishment of fully resourced and functional rehabilitation centres in each and every province.\n\nThe establishment of Provincial Drug and Substance Abuse taskforce serves as commitment to fighting this social ill.\n\nHe said the Government was aware that the youth in Matabeleland South are facing a lot of other problems such as illegal migration to neighbouring countries due to unemployment. Vice President Mohadi said this has even seen many students dropping out of school crossing the borders.\n\nHe said the Government was fully working with development partners, such as IOM, Zimbabwe Council of Churches, Save the Children and many others, in order to reduce the Risky Flight of youths by addressing the root causes of that problem through enhancing access to basic services and promotion of youth empowerment.\n\nAs we embark on this exciting event, I would like to acknowledge and offer my heartfelt appreciation for such a great gesture done in my honour and I do hope that you, the youths, will continue with such ubuntu/hunhu and respect, not only to me but, all your elders within the Party, the Government and in your own communities and families, said the Vice President.\n\nThe Second Republic led by his Excellency, President Mnangagwa is committed to ensuring that all the youths in Zimbabwe and, indeed, in our own rainbow province, are fully empowered and developed as evidenced by the creation of a Ministry solely responsible for the youth, the Ministry of Youth Empowerment, Development and Vocational Training, he added.\n\nUnder this Ministry, various programmes and activities are offered for development and empowerment of youths.\n\nAs I recall in 2024, 963 youths graduated from Phangani Vocational Training Centre in Insiza District on various courses.\n\nThese were youths drawn from all the five operational Vocational Training Centres in the province who offer skills development and technical courses such as motor mechanics, metal fabrication, textiles and clothing, carpentry and joinery among others.\n\nThese courses enable the youths, including those without the necessary 5 O Levels, to attain a skill and create employment for themselves and others.\n\nHe added that the attainment and sustainability of Vision 2030 was hinged upon empowerment and emancipation of youths.\n\nHe encouraged all organisations, both in government and private sector, to streamline youth empowerment in their programming.\n\nVice President Mohadi said the creation of youth focal desks and appointment of youth focal persons in every organisation was critical so that youth development becomes a reality, not just rhetoric talk.\n\nAs we strive to modernise our country, it is imperative that the youth play an active role in every aspect of nation development, he said.\n\nThe youths should stand up and demand to be included in national and community development programmes.\n\nOur beloved President (Mnangagwa) often reminds us that ilizwe lakhiwa ngabanikazi balo, which is a clear sentiment that me and you need to work tirelessly for a better tomorrow.\n\nHe continued; At this juncture, let me again express my profound appreciation to the ZANU PF youth league, working with Government stakeholders, for honouring me and making this day possible.\n\nVice President Mohadi pledged the Governments full support and continued cooperation and collaboration, not only in sports but in many programmes that will uplift the province and nation at large.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-prepaid-water-meters-need-to-be-customer-friendly/",
            "content": "The switch to prepaid water meters countrywide, starting in Harare where it will be part of a major public-private partnership to sort out the whole problem of treatment, distribution and sewerage, is obviously required, but can give maximum benefit and ease of operation if everyone keeps in mind the householders buying water.\n\nPayment in advance means that everyone pays so that the company treating and distributing the water does not have to worry about bad debts, and the advance payments should mean that there is enough working capital to buy treatment chemicals in advance and have a proper response for pipe bursts as well as make budgeting easier for the longer-term investments in refurbishing water works and pump stations, and a proper replacement cycle for water mains, as well as adding capacity.\n\nFew will disagree so long as water is fairly priced, with the prices explained, and is readily available and of a respectable safe standard.\n\nHarare City Council did toy with pre-paid water meters some years ago with several offered systems tried out in four suburbs.\n\nThe experiment was discontinued without any attempt to work out what might have been the best system and the council decided that prepaid water was a no-go and instead wanted to continue with extremely intermittent supplies and a lot of people not paying even for these.\n\nThe systems being tried out imposed a lot of problems on water users. For a start they were built around a card that had to be charged in a designated municipal office during municipal working hours.\n\nBesides the problems of cards being lost or wallets stolen, this meant that if you ran out at say 4pm on a Friday you could not buy water without a trip into the city centre on Monday morning.\n\nZesa has many problems, but has created a largely user-friendly and trouble free set of payment systems for its prepaid metres, and thus set standards for the new systems that will be set for paying water bills.\n\nWhile people can buy tokens at Zesa banking halls, and this is how it started, and then at agents, which were operating in many suburbs, the big breakthrough came when Zesa installed software that allowed users to buy electricity 24/7 via their online bank account and, in the most user-friendly advance, via their mobile money account on their phone.\n\nFrom the very beginning customers did not need their physical cards, and by now many have been lost, so long as they had the meter number recorded and almost everyone has this in a notebook or on a piece of paper or recorded as a contact in their phone.\n\nBesides needing it to buy energy, you also need it for other Zesa dealings, such a recording a fault.\n\nThe modern payment systems mean that you can usually buy a token from home, if you wish to, in the middle of the night, most useful if you see your meter has only one or two units left. Even if you have allowed your prepaid power to run out you can still buy a token and almost everyone can plug in their meter next door at the nearest neighbour to activate that token.\n\nAdmittedly in some ultra-low density suburbs the nearest neighbour is out of range, but everyone in a flat, cluster house, high and medium density suburb has that useful fall-back.\n\nThe other useful point about the Zesa cardless and mobile money system is that anyone knowing the meter number can buy a token for their granny at the other end of Zimbabwe and text it across in a minute or two, boosting the convenience.\n\nA second major problem that must be addressed is the fixed monthly water charge that appears on rate bills. This dates back decades when it was introduced as a minimum amount of water that public health medical experts set for a healthy average family. Doctors did not want people trying to save money by using too little water.\n\nThese days it is simply unfair, especially when water supplies are intermittent and when households need to be careful how they use water.\n\nIf a household chooses brief showers over deep baths and harvests rainwater from the roof for laundry and garden, and even if it buys drinking water in bottles, it should be encouraged in such conservation and not forced to buy water it never uses.\n\nPublic health education these days lays down that people should wash themselves and their food and drink enough, not how much they should use doing so. The minimum thus needs to go.\n\nAt the same time the bulk meters for blocks of flats need to be all converted to single unit meters, so that every household can manage its own supplies.\n\nPricing will be debated. We think it is vital that there is a proper neutral regulator in place before the meters are installed and the water is piped in and sold. Zera does this work for Zesa and in the petroleum industry and generally has been doing a good job, insisting on proper costing and checking out these costs.\n\nThe most important part of regulation is to allow a highly efficient concern to make a modest profit, the stress being on efficient and modest, after proper investment is costed in to expand production.\n\nIt is vital that consumers are not exploited by profiteering, but equally important that the supplier is not allowed to be paid for inefficiency.\n\nWater supply has to be a monopoly and in Harare the way it is organised means that the supplier will need to operate in five local authorities: Harare, Chitungwiza, Ruwa, Epworth and Norton.\n\nThis huge operational area and market will mean that the system needs to work, and that the huge needed investments not made for the past quarter century are made, and the maintenance neglected is caught up.\n\nNone of this will be cheap and that is why the regulator is needed and approval given not just for tariffs, but also for setting timelines for each set of needed investments plus a rational capital return that is both reasonable and which encourages efficiency.\n\n",

He did exceptionally well while he was with us, and we definitely miss him a lot.\n\nBut we continue to soldier on, doing the work. May his soul rest in peace, Tira said.\n\nThe birthday girl, Sandra Ndebele, was full of energy, taking selfies with everyone in the room.\n\nDespite January typically being a financially tight month when people often avoid outings, Sandras celebration drew an impressive turnout.
