No one must put our party into disrepute. This is unacceptable. Such behaviour cannot be tolerated and must stop. Vari kuzviita cherai chikomba, emphasised President Mnangagwa.\n\nEvery member, the President said, must adhere to provisions of the party constitution, founding principles, and procedural integrity, including wide consultation and formal ratification of issues that affect the party.\n\nPrudence must be exercised in the execution of our duties and rights as members, through the use of appropriate principal organs and structures of the party. Zanu PF musangano unegwara, uye nematare.\n\nLet us do more to unite the party and entrench a positive culture of common purpose, harmony and love, as we advance our party Vision and Mission as articulated in Articles 6 and 7 of our party constitution, he said.\n\nOn top of that, a social media policy is being crafted which will guide party members.\n\nThe President urged the party leadership to look forward to 2025 with optimism and confidence that the colossal party will sustain the development momentum realised so far.\n\nIn doing so, our primary concern at every leadership level should be to continue building a positive image of the party and expanding the membership base in our structures. The party must remain visible in the villages, and urban areas, always guiding misinformed cadres in our communities, and raising their political awareness. Mu ZANU PF, iwe neni tine basa, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said despite the effects of the heinous illegal sanctions the country has witnessed numerous success milestones during the year.\n\nDespite the weighty and retarding effects of the heinous illegal sanctions on our country, we scored numerous success milestones during the year towards the modernisation, industrialisation and growth of our economy.\n\nOur national development philosophy, Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatigwa nevene vayo/ ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo, is now embedded nationally, in the mind-sets of our people.\n\nAs such, through this rallying call as well as hard work, focus and determination, our country is realising growth across all sectors of the economy and also a higher quality of life for our people, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nIn the past few weeks alone, President Mnangagwa has officiated at various ceremonies for notable development projects and programmes being championed by the ruling party.\n\nThese included the commissioning of the Shurugwi- Mhandamabwe Road, the Varun Beverages Phase 6 and 7 expansion project, and the launch of the construction of a US$1 billion Titan New Energy Plant, among others.\n\nAs we continue to make efforts to position Zimbabwe as an infrastructure powerhouse, the central role of the iron and steel sector cannot be overemphasised. To this end, the convening of the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Indaba was a welcome initiative. It stands as a reminder to the party, Government and other stakeholders in the sector to quickly adapt and innovate as we revitalise this important industry of our nation, he said.\n\nFocus, he stated, must be towards guaranteeing that the natural endowments of the country benefit Zimbabweans and help accelerate the modernisation and industrialisation of the economy.\n\nHe commended party members for being instrumental in the success of programmes and activities that were held during the course of the year.\n\nYour individual and collective efforts were instrumental in the success of party programmes and activities held during the course of the year. The spirit of servant leadership and determination to wholeheartedly serve the party and people of our motherland, Zimbabwe, should remain our guiding beacon into the new year. Congratulations on a job well done, he said.\n\nHe also commended the party and Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology for facilitating training and capacity building for the members of the Youth League through the ongoing partnership with the Julius Nyerere School of Leadership.\n\nSuch leadership training programmes along with those conducted with various stakeholders within the country nurture our people to value and promote the ideals of patriotism and Pan-Africanism for the ongoing national development revolution.\n\nThe Chitepo School of Ideology, as a strategic Party and national institution, is directed to remain guided by the founding objectives, spirit and letter, that saw its establishment, he said.\n\n",

The programme is envisaged to bolster the land ownership model, and enhance access to financing, as well as to encourage production and productivity, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe implored communities to remain vigilant as the country seeks to capitalise on weather patterns for improved agricultural output.\n\nIn the agriculture sector, I once again urge communities, village-by-village, ward-by-ward to remain vigilant as we maximise the weather patterns for a successful agriculture season, said the President.\n\nTo ensure the smooth facilitation of the process, the Government issued an indefinite moratorium on the issuance of any new 99-year leases, offer letters and permits for agricultural land.\n\nIn announcing the new policy in October this year, President Mnangagwa said in implementing the new system, priority will be given to veterans of the liberation struggle, youths and women.\n\nIn addition, security of tenure to all agricultural land regularised under this programme will, at all times, only be transferable among indigenous Zimbabweans and land targeted for the new tenure system will exclude communal land that is under the jurisdiction of traditional chiefs.\n\nHe said the noticeable new paradigm amongst Zimbabwean farmers, especially the majority of beneficiaries of the land reform, was to regard and conduct farming as a business, a source of both livelihoods and means to increase personal economic value.\n\nChronicling the background of the programme, President Mnangagwa said the Government, has since 2008, put in place various programmes to assist farmers to be productive on the land through programmes such as the Basic Commodity Supply Side Intervention (Baccossi), Inputs and Mechanisation Equipment, Maguta, and the Special Grains Import Substitution Programme among others.\n\nIn the Second Republic, the country has witnessed and benefited from the Governments deliberate and complementary policy of incorporating accelerated infrastructure development which includes road construction and rehabilitation incorporating the much-needed rural roads, dam construction; irrigation; and housing development, he said.\n\nSome of the challenges, he said, that were faced by farmers in the past include difficulty in accessing affordable finance and varying levels of accountability from the farmers.\n\nThe President has since constituted a Cabinet Oversight Committee chaired by Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri to lead the reform process.\n\nA technical committee  the Land Tenure Implementation Committee (LTIC)  to coordinate and steer the implementation of this process will also be constituted.\n\nThese Committees will work diligently to develop improved security of tenure for land beneficiaries while ensuring that the value of agricultural and urban State land is fully unlocked to guarantee inclusive and nationwide economic development.\n\nGovernment will put in place all the necessary institutional and logistical mechanisms to ensure the smooth coordination and implementation of these new policies and objectives.\n\n",

When we took stock in April last year, we realised that we had completed 272 000 houses, and the Cabinet is ready to review the target to 1 million housing units. As we speak, we have already achieved more than 700 000 housing units, which accounts for over 70 percent of our targets. This positions us well to achieve our goals by 2025, he said.\n\nMinister Soda emphasised that housing delivery is not solely the responsibility of the Ministry of National Housing; it involves collaboration with various stakeholders, including pension funds, insurance schemes, individuals, and civil society. He noted ongoing partnerships with banks such as BancABC, CBZ, and CABS, highlighting the importance of private sector participation in realising the vision for 2030, which is expected to be led by the private sector.\n\nSo we are crowding in the private sector by creating a conducive investment environment where they can find opportunities to participate in the housing delivery sector, he said.\n\n",

We are dedicated to duty, said Mr Salaigwana.\n\nMr Silaigwana said, going forward, the commission would work towards enhancing the efficiency and proficiency of the ZPCS.\n\nThere are issues to do with maybe regulations, where necessary, they must be put in place and also to make sure that the ZPCS enjoys good relations with the civilian population as they interact with them for correctional services as per their mandate, he said.\n\nOn his part, Mr Muchena said he would serve ZICC as a specialist psychologist because mental health issues have become ever so pertinent.\n\nAs you are aware, according to the act of the Zimbabwe Independent Complaints Commission we are supposed to have a psychologist on the panel, so I am there to represent the entire psychology fraternity in Zimbabwe.\n\nFor a very long time, mental health issues have never been a part of the discourse in terms of commissions, but this is the first commission that we see a specialist psychologist being on the panel so that they represent issues that have to do with mental health, he said.\n\nMr Muduva said human rights were fundamental in promoting democracy hence he would discharge his duties diligently.\n\nRemember, these are commissions that have been appointed through the establishment of the Paris Principles.\n\nThe Paris Principles led to the United Nations Commission also adopting the same and it cascades down to national levels where as commissions we are adopting the same.

We have just passed the full moon, so as we move towards Christmas more and more of every night will be totally dark.\n\nBetween Christmas and New Year those half-moons will move towards the little slivers soon after sunset or soon before sunrise, that are totally useless for seeing anything.\n\nSo for much of this years festive season we will have far longer periods of intense darkness at night, another excellent reason for not driving at night except in serious emergencies. The less one can see the more dangerous a journey.\n\nUnfortunately, the police still do not have the adequate resources to check up on the two major causes of road accidents, people driving too fast and people driving after having had a few alcoholic drinks.\n\nIn time, breathalysers and speed traps will be ubiquitous at road blocks and police patrols, but until then we need to push hard the culture changes required, that drinking and driving, and speeding, are the two most dangerous activities anyone can do on the road.\n\nOther drivers also need to realise that these people are on the streets with them, and will be causing accidents, and they should be able to take action not to be involved in those inevitable crashes.\n\nStanding up to ones rights is not always the most sensible option when dealing with a drunk weaving at speed coming from the opposite direction.\n\nHaving a far safer Christmas requires everyone to conform, all drivers. The authorities and the enforcement and encouragement teams deployed on the roads can help, but most people drive very correctly when driving near a roadblock or past a police car.\n\nWhile there are cases of someone smashing into a line of cars at a roadblock, most of these accidents take place out of sight of the police, and hence the need to get everyone to understand that we need to all cooperate.\n\nThe rules of the road, and the best practices as outlined in the Highway Code, work extremely well when everyone follows them all the time.\n\nDrivers need to understand we are all safe together or are all in extreme danger together, and that we all need to choose the safe option to be safe. One rule breaker, and we are all unsafe.\n\n",

The wind speed and rainfall intensity have also weakened, providing relief to event planners, party-goers, and entertainers eager to capitalise on the lucrative festive season.\n\nOutdoor venues are especially vulnerable during inclement weather, and without proper precautions, they risk disappointing attendees.\n\nMany experienced promoters, who have opted for indoor venues to mitigate these risks, expressed their relief while still taking necessary precautions.\n\nProminent music promoters Partson Chipaz Chimbodza and Benjamin Nyandoro of Jive Zimbabwe have reaffirmed their commitment to moving forward with their events.\n\nThey are set to host the Zimbabwe Cup Clash at City Sports Centre in Harare on Unity Day, followed by another event at the Chitungwiza Aquatic Complex, headlined by Alick Macheso.\n\nIn a recent interview, Chimbodza confirmed that both shows will proceed as planned.\n\nTropical cyclones and rains are part of Gods plan that we cannot oppose. As experienced event planners, we have chosen enclosed venues to ensure fans safety.\n\nWe are also monitoring the weather conditions, especially the weakening Cyclone Chido, which was initially set to cause damage.\n\nWe chose City Sports Centre and Chitungwiza Aquatic Complex, both indoor venues, and we encourage attendees to arrive early to avoid any inconvenience in case of rain, Chipaz stated.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of staying informed about weather conditions:\n\nWe constantly monitor forecasts to avoid being caught off guard.\n\nAdditionally, we are praying for favourable weather and the safety of our fans. We have taken every measure possible to ensure their well-being.\n\nIn Chitungwiza, Chipaz will host Alick Macheso at the Aquatic Complex, with support from Holy Ten, Killer T, and others. At City Sports Centre, the new king or queen of clashes will be crowned at the 2024 Zimbabwe Cup Clash, where a car is up for grabs.\n\nSimilar sentiments were echoed by popular events planner Chau Nedi, who operates Jongwe Corner in Harare and Chinhoyi respectively.\n\nKnown as Boss Chau, the promoter has a packed schedule from December 22 to January 1.\n\nWe always set up tents and provide additional shelter at our venues to protect our fans from adverse weather.\n\nIn winter, we offer braziers, and we are committed to taking extra precautions during the rainy season.\n\nOn Unity Day, he will host Cello Culture at Jongwe Corner Harare, supported by the Transit Crew.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Master H will perform at his Chinhoyi branch, with Godfatha Templeman and Tanaman also on the lineup.\n\nThe New Years eve show will feature Freeman and Killer T at Jongwe Corner Chinhoyi, followed by Jah Prayzah on New Years Day at Jongwe Corner Harare.\n\nWith this busy schedule, my team is working hard to ensure the safety of our fans. I always prioritise their well-being, as they have supported me throughout my career. We want to celebrate together in a safe environment, he stated.\n\nDee Nosh from DTL Entertainment also shared his thoughts, as he hosts the Kadoma Shut Down Gig on December 31, featuring Tocky Vibes, Bling 4, Madedido, Killer T, and Enzo Ishall.\n\nIf it rains, we will still hold the show. However, we will set up enough tents to ensure our fans safety.\n\nWe dont take our fans for granted, as they are the reason we have come this far. We welcome reports that the tropical cyclone wont have the same impact, he said.\n\nSome venue owners in Harare remain unconcerned about the weather.\n\nOne such venue, Theatre in the Park at Harare Gardens, will host performances by Mokoomba and Gwevedzi on Boxing Day, ensuring a secure and enjoyable experience for attendees.\n\nThe Harare International Conference Centre (HICC), a popular venue for gospel events, will also be in the spotlight when it hosts the ANOT 2024 Concert on January 1, 2025, featuring performances by Janet Manyowa, Takesure Zamar, Bridget Ndanga, Pastor Bonnie, Dr Tumi, Everton Mlalazi, Lebo Sekgobela, Patience Masiyambiri, Pastor Bonnie Deuschle, Ellard, and Sharon Cherayi.\n\nMacheso, who will be performing from today until New Years Day, is also prepared.\n\nWe always collaborate with venue owners to ensure they dont incur losses.\n\nWe advise them to stay informed about the weather forecast, and we hope for their cooperation.\n\nOn our part, we will provide tents and security to keep our fans safe, said Machesos publicist, Tichaona Makahamadze.\n\nPeter Moyo, who has a series of shows lined up from today until January 1, 2025, added:\n\nWe were informed about this adverse weather pattern, and we are prepared for any situation. Ultimately, we leave everything in Gods hands, as He is our protector. We invite fans to join us in ushering in the festive season.\n\n",

This initiative aims to ensure a total transformation of Zimpapers as an institution.\n\nThe transformation, he said, was essential as the company strived towards becoming an upper-middle-income society.\n\nDr Muswere outlined key aspects of the transformative journey, including cultural, behavioural, digital and business transformation.\n\nFor digital transformation to take place, the cultural transformation is to take the lead. The behavioural transformation is to take the lead as well, he said.\n\nThese four aspects in terms of the transformation of Zimpapers will ensure that the institution continues to grow.\n\nHe said Zimpapers must adapt to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe readership now focuses on traffic, content, and packaging. The old print media business model is declining, even though some segments still prefer physical copies, he said.\n\nThe board, management, and staff must strategically shift towards the complete digitalisation of Zimpapers. With approximately 8 million registered telecom subscribers and declining newspaper circulation, it is clear that we need to embrace the digital path.\n\nHowever, in this Fourth Industrial Revolution, innovation is crucial, as necessity drives invention.\n\nDr Muswere added effective collaboration among the board, management, and staff is essential for the success of the digital transformation journey.\n\nTo drive Zimpapers as an institution, Dr Muswere emphasised the need to adapt to market trends by packaging content digitally.\n\nDrawing lessons from the successful Kenyan model, Zimpapers Group CEO Mr Pikirayi Deketeke said it can guide the entity towards full digital implementation.\n\nThis initiative responds to the rapidly changing media landscape, where digital consumption is increasingly the norm.\n\nDr Muswere, along with his Deputy, Dr Omphile Marupi, and Permanent Secretary Mr Nick Mangwana, toured the groups new bookstore and coffee shop.\n\nThe minister also participated in interviews with ZTN Prime and Capitalk, discussing the importance of embracing digital transformation for media entities.\n\n",
