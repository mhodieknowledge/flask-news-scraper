            "content": "Conrad Mupesa, Mashonaland West Bureau\n\nZANU PF is ready to amend the Constitution and mobilise its members to resoundingly vote in favour of the amendment in a referendum to pave way for President Mnangagwa to lead the country until 2030, Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister and the revolutionary partys Politburo member, Cde Ziyambi Ziyambi, has said.\n\nThe ruling partys Mashonaland West Province, which held a Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC) meeting in Chinhoyi on Saturday, has announced a significant growth in its membership, boasting over 600 000 registered members across six political administrative districts.\n\nThe development puts the party in good stead ahead of a possible referendum to extend President Mnangagwas term of office.\n\nAccording to the 2022 national census, Mashonaland Wests population was about 1,8 million.\n\nAs of 2023, around 700 000 people were on the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) voters roll.\n\nWhile the Referendum process does not use the voters roll, with anyone aged 18 and above needing only to produce a national identity card or a passport to cast their ballot, Zanu PF remains confident in its ability to outpace opposing forces on the back of a recent surge in membership.\n\nDistricts such as Hurungwe, Zvimba, and Makonde have seen a marked increase in membership recruitment, with the party actively working to attract especially first-time voters in all areas.\n\nThis grassroots mobilisation exercise is seen as critical in solidifying Zanu PFs influence ahead of the Referendum.\n\nZanu PF Mashonaland West provincial commissar, Cde Joachim Yotamu, presented a report on the partys cell registration and the impending verification process.\n\nIt is at the same meeting that Cde Ziyambi expressed confidence in the partys readiness to amend the Constitution to facilitate an extension of President Mnangagwas term.\n\nAs we are now working on amending the law to extend President Mnangagwas term of office until 2030, we have to work together, said Cde Ziyambi.\n\nThe figures show that in Mashonaland West, we already have an advantage once the process is taken to the people for a Referendum.\n\nCde Ziyambi highlighted the significance of the partys growing membership.\n\nWe now have 600 000 Zanu PF members in the province. In 2023, the province had 700 000 people on the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) voters roll.\n\nEven those that are opposing the idea will not stand a chance against us; Zanu PF has the upper hand already, he said.\n\nCde Ziyambi said people at the grassroots level initiated the resolution for the extension of the Presidents term, which was among many issues discussed during the consolidated conference resolutions.\n\nThe grassroots are the ones that indicated the resolution among other issues that they wanted to be dealt with at the conference. These were discussed at the district and provincial levels, leading up to consolidated conference resolutions.\n\nThe President has no say; because we want him to witness his Vision 2030 come to fruition, he added, receiving thunderous applause from the attendees.\n\nDelegates then urged the Government to proceed with the necessary constitutional amendments.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has previously expressed willingness to step down when his second term expires in 2028, but party members say as a listening leader, the President should accept their request to continue leading ZANU PF andthe country.\n\nEven delegates to last years 21st ZANU PF Annual National Peoples Conference in Bulawayo unanimously endorsed the resolution to extend President Mnangagwas term.\n\nSome opposition CCC members have also thrown their weight behind the call to extend the Presidents term so that he can oversee the attainment of Vision 2030 of an empowered and prosperous upper-middle-income society.\n\nCde Ziyambi took advantage of the Zanu PF PCC to highlight another key aspect of President Mnangagwas agenda of providing title deeds to Zimbabweans.\n\nThe other reason why we want the President to continue is that he has to fulfill his vision of making Zimbabweans property owners.\n\nThe issuance of title deeds to landowners is part of this process. He is also going to make sure that those in urban areas who have had houses without title deeds, benefit, he said.\n\nThe meeting also saw contributions from Cde Webster Shamu, ZANU PFs national deputy commissar, and Cde Happison Muchechetere, chairman of the Mashonaland West War Veterans League.\n\nThey discussed the new land tenure process, asserting that it completes the liberation struggle from white minority rule.\n\nZanu PF provincial chairman, Cde Mary Mliswa Chikoka, assured the partys national leadership that once the process to extend President Mnangagwas term begins, it will be successful. She also warned party members against misusing social media.\n\nLets desist from social media abuse and getting involved in unofficial social media groups. We must defend our party at all costs. We will not tolerate indiscipline from members who will use social media to attack the leadership.\n\nAs Mashonaland West, we have one position, and this is that our President, Cde Mnangagwa, should continue until 2030 to fulfill his vision. We are on the same page as a province, she said.\n\nThe PCC meeting also provided a platform for Zanu-PF Central Committee Member Cde Marian Chombo, who is the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, to share success stories from the province recorded in 2024.\n\nAmong the notable achievements were increased production of tobacco and wheat, along with a surge in investors in the manufacturing sector.\n\n",

            "content": "Nqobile Tshili, Bulawayo Bureau\n\nCHIEF Justice Luke Malaba has directed the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) to train traditional leaders on legal and ethical standards so that as judicial officers they treat litigants with dignity and respect instead of threats or insults.\n\nConcerns have been raised about traditional leaders that insult or threaten their subjects when handling disputes.\n\nIn one instance last year, a traditional leader was recorded threatening to assault a subject.\n\nAdditionally, some litigants have challenged decisions made by chiefs courts, highlighting tensions between customary and common law systems.\n\nSpeaking during the opening of the 2025 Legal Year recently, Chief Justice Malaba stressed the importance of equipping chiefs with the skills necessary to administer justice fairly and within the confines of the law.\n\nI have directed the JSC secretary to initiate engagements with the National Council of Chiefs with specific focus on the training of chiefs in respect of their conduct at their courts. The idea is to empower chiefs with the necessary skills for hearing and determining disputes at their courts, he said.\n\nChief Justice Malaba said traditional leaders must recognise the principles of law that govern all judicial proceedings and uphold the rights and dignity of litigants.\n\nLitigants seeking justice from customary law courts deserve to be treated with dignity. They must never be insulted by the presiding persons, he said.\n\nChief Justice Malaba described traditional leaders as key players in the justice delivery system, particularly in alternative dispute resolution through customary law.\n\nChiefs preside over customary law courts and are responsible for delivering justice in accordance with customary law. Sections 162 and 163 of the Constitution recognise customary law courts and their presiding officers as part of the judiciary. These courts and their officers are bound by the same ethical standards and constitutional principles as other judicial institutions, he said.\n\nWhile traditional leaders do not fall directly under the JSC, the commission is tasked with ensuring that all courts, including customary law courts, operate efficiently and fairly. The numerous functions a chief is entitled to perform are set out in the Traditional Leaders Act. This position is consistent with the provisions of the Constitution setting out in broad terms the functions of traditional leaders recognised as an institution under customary law in terms of the Constitution, said Chief Justice Malaba.\n\nHe said JSC must ensure that justice is legally and properly dispensed in all courts, adding that public confidence in the justice system, including customary law courts, depends on the protection of fundamental human rights.\n\nNational Council of Chiefs president, Chief Mtshane Khumalo, lauded the move, highlighting the lack of training for traditional leaders in recent years.\n\nHe said it was pleasing that following Chief Justice Malabas statement, officials have sprung to action and a meeting has been held to kick-start the process.\n\nIm just coming from a workshop on how the process will be carried out. We have had some media reports where the conduct of chiefs has been condemned as some of the chiefs were said to be threatening those who appeared before them, said Chief Mtshane Khumalo.\n\nSince 2021, there has been no training for chiefs yet many have been appointed during this period and lack knowledge on how to handle court sessions. The training will serve as a refresher for those previously trained and a critical introduction for new appointees.\n\nChief Mtshane Khumalo said a meeting has already been held to plan the training programme.\n\nWe have had media reports condemning the conduct of some chiefs who threaten litigants. This training will address such issues and ensure chiefs are well-versed in customary law and the Customary Act. Previously, the Office of the Chief Magistrate provided guidance on conducting court sessions, including court composition, he added.\n\n",

This includes five individuals who were allegedly involved in illegal importation of cars.\n\nAt the centre of the scandal are Tambudzayi Yvone Musoni, Tapiwa Gono, Maxwell Mukaro, Demetrio Manhango, and Dilan Chigama.\n\nA statement issued by the NPA last week revealed that Tapiwa Gono unlawfully imported a Nissan Note (registration number AGC2772) using the details of a civil servant.\n\nThis was done under the guise of being a trainee nurse, using a counterfeit rebate letter that bore the reference for Trust Gave, causing a loss of US$4 128 to the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra).\n\nAnother significant case involves Elvis Murauro, who bought a Honda Fit unlawfully which was imported by Maxwell Mukaro.\n\nMukaro allegedly used a rebate letter (number 9/28/3/448/21) despite having no record of applying for a rebate at the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion.\n\nThis led to a loss of ZWL396 935.19 for Zimra.\n\nFurther, Demetrio Manhango illegally imported another Honda Fit (registration number AGC1714) using the civil servant rebate scheme.\n\nHe exploited a rebate letter (number 9/28/3-4463/22) belonging to one Alice Benhura, resulting in a loss of ZWL2 656 630.25 to Zimra.\n\nThe case of Tambudzayi Yvonne Musoni highlights the extent of the abuse.\n\nA former employee at Zimra, she allegedly hacked her bosss electronic signature to fraudulently approve the importation of more than 400 vehicles into Zimbabwe under the civil servants rebate scheme.\n\nThis incident raises serious questions about the integrity of the systems in place to regulate such activities.\n\nThe NPAZ says it is actively working to recover funds lost due to these fraudulent activities.\n\nWe are going after those who abused the rebate scheme to recover all losses that resulted from their actions, said Justice Matanda-Moyo.\n\nShe reiterated the importance of accountability in Government operations, saying the fight against corruption remains a top priority.\n\nThe vehicle rebate scheme was originally established to provide civil servants with an opportunity to buy vehicles at a lower cost, facilitating personal transportation and improving their quality of life.\n\nHowever, the rampant abuse of the programme has not only undermined its purpose, but also resulted in significant losses to the Government.\n\nA joint operation by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) and Zimra has revealed that over 3 000 vehicles were illegally imported through the abuse of tax rebates introduced for civil servants in 2019.\n\nThe extensive investigation demonstrates the scale of the problem and the need for stringent measures to prevent future abuses.\n\nMr Mutangadura said as authorities continue to uncover more fraudulent activities, the prospect of further prosecutions looms large.\n\nWe are determined to ensure that anyone involved in these activities is brought to justice, he said.\n\nMr Mutangadura emphasised that Government is committed to restoring public trust and integrity in the operations of the civil service.\n\nIn light of these developments, the Government is now focusing on implementing stricter regulations and oversight mechanisms to prevent similar abuses in future.\n\nThe NPAZ is working closely with Zimra and other relevant agencies to enhance monitoring and enforcement capabilities.\n\n",

Police are treating the case as suicide and investigations are underway, she said.\n\nAccording to people close to Mr Madzikatire, two days before his death, he posted a troubling message on his WhatsApp status: If I leave this world u (you) will not say I am a coward, you better call me a coward, and I have no choice.\n\nA friend of Mr Madzikatire, who declined to be named, said although the message appeared to hint at suicidal thoughts, it was not taken seriously.\n\nSometimes people post messages that make it appear as if they are suicidal, but we didnt take it seriously. We dont really know what happened, whether it was suicide or something else, but his WhatsApp messages were disturbing, the friend said.\n\nWorkers at Samaz Butchery, one of Mr Madzikatires businesses, recalled seeing their boss on Saturday around 5pm when he delivered meat to the Luveve outlet in his black Mercedes Benz.\n\nHe was accompanied by a young woman who stayed behind in the car while he unloaded the meat.\n\nWe were alerted by one of his friends that he had shot himself outside the womans house in Cowdray Park.

            "content": "WITH rains now falling after a late start to the season, Zimbabwes economic growth is expected to hit 6,2 percent this year according to the World Bank, well above the 4,1 percent sub-Saharan African average and around the level already predicted by the Government.\n\nThe importance of the World Bank prediction, which backs the Governments own 6 percent, is that it shows the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion is, if anything, exceptionally prudent when compiling its figures and predictions and does not resort to wishful thinking or political propaganda.\n\nIt reports facts and is professional in its estimates and predictions.\n\nSince assuming office, the Second Republic has been open with both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, ensuring that they have access to national economic figures, which are hardly a secret, and can check how the Zimbabwe Government follows its laid-down policies of fiscal and monetary discipline.\n\nWhile Zimbabwe has been locked out of much multilateral financing through the illegal financial sanctions, it has restored relations with the major multilateral finance organisations and has adopted policies that will be needed once we can once again access the capital funding that we require.\n\nPrivate sector investors are now a major part of the new Zimbabwean economy, also want to know how the Government is managing the economy, and when the figures are confirmed by the World Bank or IMF this is a bit like a favourable audit report in the private sector, a routine check that you are dealing with people who know what they are doing and honour their word.\n\nThe slump in growth last year to two percent was almost entirely due to the worst drought for 43 years and the resulting major decline in dryland agriculture.\n\nAgriculture had negative growth, quite sharp negative growth, and while this was partly counterbalanced by growth in all other sectors, hence the final total of two percent growth, obviously the dip in one of the major sectors would have an effect.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that despite the very serious drought and crash in harvests of many crops, the economy still grew in total, showing the robustness of the economy we have now achieved.\n\nThis growth also took into account the fall in prices of most minerals except gold, so the growth in mining output was driven more by increased volumes and more local processing to add value than by prices.\n\nWhile the 6,2 percent growth predicted for this year assumes a reasonable season for the summer dryland farmers, since a chunk of that growth is restoring harvests and then setting some new records in output, it is not reliant on that recovery.\n\nWe have had back-to-back droughts in the past and if we had hit that this season it would simply have meant agriculture would not grow much, rather than decline, and so the full effect of the growth in mining, manufacturing, tourism and services would be seen without any further decline in farming.\n\nIn fact the drought has helped to accelerate the growth in irrigation, as it has now become obvious that we cannot rely, year after year and season from season, on rain-fed farming.\n\nWe need to grow at least our own food even in a drought year, and we need to give ever larger percentages of our farming families access to irrigation, or at least supplementary irrigation, so they can cope with dry spells and drops in rainfall.\n\nThere are growing gaps between farmers with and without access to irrigation.\n\nEven this season, farmers with irrigation managed to establish crops earlier and get through the early and middle December dry spell with losses as they switched on the supplementary irrigation.\n\nThey are now using free rain, rather than paying for irrigation, helping to control their costs, but also demonstrating the continuing need for improving access to at least partial irrigation for all farmers.\n\nNormally a lot more land can be given supplementary irrigation than full irrigation, since even in the worst drought at least half the normal rain falls and usually we do better than that, even in bad years.\n\nBut this does require more flexibility in the infrastructure so that modest amounts of irrigation water can irrigate more hectares when there is at least some rain. Irrigation is not all or nothing.\n\nMore rain also increases energy generation. The two Kariba power stations were operating as basically drought flows run-of-river schemes for much of last year, as there was nothing worthwhile in storage above the minimum levels needed to ensure the valves leading to the turbine were under water.\n\nRun-of-river means that what came over the Victoria Falls during the dry seasons was what flowed into the lake and what could then exit the lake through the two power stations.\n\nThis allowed, with the drought hit flows, each to generate just 124,5MW, with Zimbabwe using the equivalent of one of the original six turbines and nothing from the newer two, and Zambia cutting back to around 80 percent of one of its slightly larger original turbines and nothing from the new ones.\n\nWith even moderately better rains in the main catchment, southeast Angola, there will be a stronger flowing river as well as some floods adding to the storage.\n\nAnd quite a bit of the private generation capacity is coming on stream this year in Zimbabwe, adding to growth and far more importantly ensuring that other sectors, and in particular mining and manufacturing, can grow without energy bottlenecks.\n\nInvestors need to know there will be electricity, or need to take into account the need to generate some of their own requirements which in turn requires easy registration and building of power stations, solar or coal. The Government has managed to meet those conditions and has sorted out pricing formulas that make private power stations a worthwhile investment without crippling the eventual customers.\n\n",

            "content": "Business Reporter\n\nFinance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube has called for the creation of centres for entrepreneurship within higher learning institutions as part of the value chain in the nurturing of entrepreneurs.\n\nMinister Ncube said entrepreneurship centres would play a crucial role by providing training and facilitating collaborations between aspiring entrepreneurs and venture capital companies.\n\nMoreover, the centres would guide aspiring entrepreneurs in developing viable business plans.\n\nMinister Ncube made the remarks during the official launch of the National Venture Capital Company of Zimbabwe (NVCCZ), a vehicle designed to support and assist start-up businesses, in Harare last week.\n\nWe need to create an entrepreneurship ecosystem and I feel that it is the next step that we need to take, said Minister Ncube.\n\nCentres for entrepreneurship are crucial hubs within higher learning institutions.\n\nThey play a vital role in nurturing entrepreneurial talent by providing training, mentorship, access to resources and opportunities for collaboration.\n\nThe centres often connect aspiring entrepreneurs with industry professionals, investors and potential partners, fostering innovation and driving economic growth.\n\nMinister Ncube underscored the Governments commitment to fostering innovation, growth, and prosperity by providing crucial funding and support to startups and early-stage businesses through the establishment of the NVCCZ.\n\nHe said the NVCCZ was a vital initiative aimed at bridging the funding gap faced by startups and early-stage businesses.\n\nVenture capital firms invest in early-stage companies with high growth potential.\n\nThe firms may not be profitable yet but have innovative ideas and disruptive technologies.\n\nThey startups develop their business models, secure further funding, and ultimately achieve a successful exit through acquisition by a larger company.\n\nTheir mission is to provide patient capital, mentorship, and strategic guidance to high growth potential ventures, enabling them to scale up and compete globally, said Minister Ncube.\n\nWe are committed to supporting innovative ideas, creating jobs, contributing to the countrys economic development.\n\nMinister Ncube paid tribute to President Mnangagwa, whom he described as a passionate advocate for innovation.\n\nHis commitment to innovation has been demonstrated through the establishment of innovation hubs at higher learning institutions.\n\nAs such, Minister Ncube said NVCCZ would actively partner with innovation hubs to identify and support promising entrepreneurs within these ecosystems.\n\nHis Excellency is very passionate about these innovation hubs, said Minister Ncube.\n\nAnd we are just bridging the gap through the venture fund to provide the capital that is needed for them to move to the next stage.\n\nNVCCZ chief executive Mr Tinotenda Kambasha said venturing into the venture capital landscape would play a crucial role in identifying and supporting entrepreneurs with innovative solutions to address pressing national challenges.\n\nHe said by actively engaging with and investing in promising startups, NVCCZ would contribute significantly to fostering a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem that drives economic growth and development.\n\nThree projects were showcased during the launch.\n\nThepo Manganda, founder of PureAid Agroprocessors, unveiled his company involved in processing tomatoes into powder to minimise post-harvest losses for small-scale farmers.\n\nBy drying and packaging tomatoes, they extend shelf life up to 18 months.\n\nMr Manganda noted that Zimbabwean farmers experience significant post-harvest losses, potentially reaching 47 percent annually, due to limited processing capabilities, inadequate market access and market manipulation.\n\nMs Agatha Mandova, a final-year nursing student, founded KumbaCare, a telemedicine application designed to improve access to affordable healthcare in ruralZimbabwe.\n\nRecognising the challenges of limited patient-doctor ratios and long travel distances for specialised care, KumbaCare aims to bridge this gap.\n\nKumbaCare also offers an embedded insurance plan called One Health.\n\nFor just one dollar per month, patients gain access to medication valued at US$30 and can consult with a doctor.\n\nTo ensure accessibility, KumbaCare is developing a USSD platform to cater to patients in underserved areas and those without smartphones to ensure that geographical location and device ownership do not impede access to our high-quality healthcare services.\n\nBy 2030, KumbaCare aspires to impact the lives of five million people and establish 1 000 virtual clinics.\n\nMobility for Africa, an electric scooter startup, aims to address the significant burden of manual labour, particularly for women in rural Africa.\n\nInspired by personal experiences in rural Zambia, founder Ms Shantha Bloementhe said Mobility for Africa has developed robust, low-speed tricycles specifically designed for off-road conditions in rural areas.\n\nThe tricycles have successfully undergone rigorous testing in challenging terrains, including the Honde Valley.\n\nThe tricycles can be utilised for transporting firewood, water, and agricultural produce, tasks traditionally undertaken by women in many parts of Africa.\n\nMr Kambasha said the projects showcased during the launch served as a powerful testament to the transformative potential of venture capital firms in driving economic growth and positively impacting human lives.\n\n",

            "content": "Freedom Mupanedemo, Zimpapers Politics Hub\n\nLast December, as Kwekwe endured record-breaking scorching temperatures, the usually vibrant Sherwood Block farmlands succumbed to the unforgiving heat, transforming into a desolate expanse of grey-tinted, parched grass.\n\nMotorists traversing this stretch were greeted by an unsettling sight: arid and cracked farmlands lining either side of the road, their desolation only punctuated by the hope farmers clung to for the rains.\n\nThe silence was palpable, broken only by the rustling of dry shrubbery and the occasional chirps of birds perched atop barren trees, an ominous prelude to a prolonged dry spell.\n\nYet, as the road wound deeper into the Sherwood Block, an astonishing scene unfolded: a lush green expanse stretched endlessly into the horizon.\n\nThriving maize, soya, and potato crops stood tall under the sun, watered by rotating centre pivots that sprayed life-sustaining mist into the air. This oasis of vitality belonged to Pricabe Farm  a masterpiece of modern agriculture.\n\nAt the heart of the farm, tractors hummed as they transported hay to feed an impressive herd of cattle.\n\nAmong these were the majestic Ankole breed, with their sleek, shiny coats and impressive horns. Beyond the paddocks, a serene pond glimmered in the sunlight, its surface occasionally disrupted by bream leaping from the water.\n\nOwned by the First Family, Pricabe Farm is an example of farming done right. It is a bustling hub of activity, driven by precision, innovation, and hard work.\n\nWith over 400 hectares of thriving maize, 150 hectares of soya, and 100 hectares of potatoes under cultivation, the farm stands as a testament to agricultural excellence.\n\nMr Patrick Mnangagwa, the farm manager, describes the President as an ardent farmer who remains actively involved despite his demanding responsibilities leading the country, and leading SADC.\n\nThe President is always hands-on, says Mr Mnangagwa during a recent field tour.\n\nAt the slightest opportunity, he visits the farm to inspect progress and offer guidance. Farming is his passion.\n\nWith advanced farming techniques and investments in mechanised technology, Pricabe Farm achieves impressive yields. Mr Mnangagwa estimates the maize crop alone will deliver between 11-15 tonnes per hectare.\n\nWith Pricabe Farm delivering over 4 000 tonnes of maize to the Grain Marketing Board every year, the President is contributing significantly to the countrys maize needs which stands at 2,25 million tonnes per year.\n\nThe farm has also been one of the major contributors to the country agricultural GDP.\n\nAgriculture contributes between 11 percent and 19 percent to Zimbabwes Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nIt is a key part of the countrys economy, providing jobs for about 70 percent of the population and supplying around 60 percent 1of the raw materials for manufacturing.\n\nThe intensive, high-tech rotational farming system optimises land use while maintaining sustainability. It has drawn visitors from across the spectrum, including ministers, business leaders, foreign dignitaries, and opposition politicians.\n\nOpposition leader Mr Sengezo Tshabangu, during a recent visit, lauded the farms production as a marvel and an example for every Zimbabwean farmer to emulate.\n\nAccompanied by former Deputy Prime Minister Dr Thokozani Khupe, Tshabangu praised President Mnangagwas leadership and contribution to the nations food security.\n\nHe is leading by example, Tshabangu remarked. This kind of dedication is commendable.\n\nDr Khupe highlighted the farms critical role in bolstering the economy and ensuring food security.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa himself has frequently spoken of his deep-rooted passion for farming. Despite his tight schedule, weekends often find him at Pricabe Farm, ensuring operations run seamlessly.\n\nWe have invested heavily in mechanised technology and skilled training for our team, the President shared during a field day event.\n\nOur aim is to achieve maximum yields and showcase what is possible with commitment and innovation.\n\nPricabe is more than just a farm. By transforming arid land into a thriving agricultural powerhouse, the First Family is drawing an inspiring blueprint for Zimbabwean farmers.\n\nIt demonstrates that with innovation and dedication, Zimbabwes farming sector can reach new heights, paving the way for a more resilient and prosperous agricultural economy.\n\n",
