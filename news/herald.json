            "content": "Herald Reporter\n\nA local women empowerment lobby group of survivors of gender-based violence has empowered over 160 women by providing resources for mental wellness, career development, and educational opportunities.\n\nThe Selfless Sisters Trust, with more than 200 members, primarily consists of survivors of GBV, rape, and those who have attempted suicide.\n\nThey aim to empower others by sharing their experiences and demonstrating how to overcome similar challenges.\n\nOn Sunday, the organisation hosted an event in Harare where it awarded start-up funding to five young women and offered counselling services to approximately 20 others.\n\nFounding president of Selfless Sisters Trust Ms Irene Sami, who is based in the United States, shared her motivations.\n\nI never want to see any woman go through the same hardships that I endured. The horror I experienced during my childhood compelled me to form this organisation, as I was aware that many others were in need and required assistance.\n\nAt just 15, Ms Sami took on the responsibility of caring for her siblings after losing her grandmother. By age 19, she moved to Harare to find work, facing numerous challenges along the way, including an unplanned pregnancy.\n\nI struggled until I was able to educate myself, and eventually, I made my way to the United States, where I now work in a restaurant, she said.\n\nBefore her move, Ms Sami had established a car wash and a restaurant operated by survivors of GBV, which led to the founding of the Selfless Sisters Trust in 2021.\n\nMs Rudo Hariseni, a community leader within the Trust, emphasised the importance of emotional support.\n\nWhat motivates me is the need to create awareness and provide emotional support for women. Many women are going through trauma, depression, and other challenges that they cannot share with anyone, she said.\n\nA survivor, who chose to remain anonymous, recounted her traumatic experience.\n\nAt 19, I was drugged and raped by my boyfriend. I spent six months in the hospital, where doctors worked to remove the drugs from my system. I attempted suicide twice, but I survived.\n\nNow, my dream is to ensure no one else suffers the same trauma, she said.\n\nThe event not only provided funding to aspiring entrepreneurs, but also fostered a supportive community. The Selfless Sisters Trust continues to offer counselling and job placement assistance, impacting many womens lives and demonstrating that healing is possible through shared experiences and support.\n\n",
