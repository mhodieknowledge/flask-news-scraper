Undoubtedly, the ongoing engagements have opened new frontiers of cooperation and partnerships. I commend you all for your role in advancing this focus area.\n\nTogether, let us do more as we entrench a culture of dialogue in our international relations cooperation frameworks, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nStill on the issue of dialogue, President Mnangagwa added: Zimbabwe remains open for dialogue aimed at the total removal of illegal sanctions.\n\nThe illegal economic sanctions, coupled with the prevalence of climate change-induced natural disasters and weather phenomenon, are negatively impacting our economy. However, domestic resource mobilisation, Diaspora remittances and inflows of foreign direct investments are augmenting the national fiscus.\n\nOur people and the economy are demonstrating extraordinary resilience, unity of purpose, innovation and resourcefulness, he said.\n\nThe President thanked SADC and other partners for their continued support in calling for the illegal embargoes unequivocal removal.\n\nI extend gratitude to our SADC family and African brothers and sisters for their principled support and solidarity as they amplify calls for the lifting of sanctions.\n\nWe also recognise the support we are receiving from the Group of Friends in Defence of the United Nations Charter, the Like-Minded Group and Non-Aligned Movement, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe reaffirmed Governments commitment to fostering inclusive growth, consolidating democracy and constitutionalism, while ensuring peace and stability for the overall economic prosperity of the general citizenry.\n\nThrough our multifaceted and people-centred development strategies, we are lifting more of our people out of poverty into prosperity. We look forward to journey this exciting path with you and the countries as well as organisations you represent.\n\nTogether, let us navigate the complex challenges affecting our world and the immense opportunities presented before us, he said.\n\nYesterdays gathering of ambassadors and international organisations facilitated closer interaction between the heads of missions and the Government.\n\nAs such, the President rallied them to submit objective and factual reports about Zimbabwe to their countries.\n\nMay you find the satisfaction and pride in taking our relations to a new level. Our doors remain open and arms outstretched as we dialogue and work in harmony towards a shared prosperity and brighter future for our peoples, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nZimbabwe, he said, maintained its stance as a friend to all and enemy to none, emphasising that the country was very much open for business.\n\nWe are open for business, and your nationals are welcome to pursue investments in our mining sector. Further, leveraging our strategic central location in the southern region, we are determined to work with our neighbours and investors to expand and modernise the North-South Corridor to enhance global supply chains and logistics, said the President.\n\nAt the broader international level, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was committed to the protection of multilateralism and upholding the principles of the United Nations Charter, while rallying for support in its bid for a non-permanent United Nations Security Council seat.\n\nThe principles of equality and respect for each others interests should always guide us in our interactions. There are no big or small nations. Zimbabwes candidature for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council for the term 2027 to 2028, has been endorsed by SADC and the African Union.\n\nOur candidacy is deeply rooted in our commitment to global peace and security, an inclusive, fair and equitable international rule-based system, said the President.\n\nHe said the Second Republic was undertaking reforms across the board to ensure the countrys attainment of upper-middle-class economic status by 2030.\n\nThis has resulted in various political, economic and legislative reforms as well as the implementation of a broad array of people-centred projects to guarantee household food security, improve incomes and develop critical enablers to propel the modernisation and industrialisation of our economy.\n\nThe projected recovery in agriculture output is expected to drive economic growth to 6 percent, buoyed by the expected bumper harvest, following a successful summer season, said the President.\n\nHe appraised the diplomats on some of the initiatives being rolled out by Government towards the realisation of national goals.\n\nGovernment introduced the concept of village business units and nutritional gardens. Under the Presidential Drilling Programme, we are drilling boreholes in all our 35 000 villages.\n\nWe, thus, invite your missions to partner these initiatives from the perspective of training and capacity building as well as value addition and sourcing of export markets as we promote market driven productivity.\n\nUnder our agriculture transformation strategy and the village business unit concept, Zimbabwe envisions improved incomes and higher standards of living for our grassroots communities and to also contribute to global food security and nutrition, said the President.\n\nIn mitigating climate change, we are expanding dam construction, water conveyancing and resuscitating irrigation schemes. These initiatives provide scope for further partnerships, cooperation, and investments. The growth of the agriculture sector, as the bedrock of our agriculture-based industry, entails the need for retooling, expansion and diversification of our manufacturing sector. I challenge you, Your Excellencies, in your missions, to promote investments along related value chains.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa acknowledged the role played by the ambassadors in promoting Zimbabwe as a favourable and enjoyable tourist destination.\n\nOur national tourism sector has room for expansion across the provinces of our country I encourage you to scale up the promotion of investments and people to people exchanges between Zimbabwe and your jurisdictions, he said.\n\nAfrica, the SADC region and Zimbabwe, said the President, have re- purposed their development towards the modernisation, value addition, and industrialisation of their economies.\n\nRiding on our abundant natural resources, science, technology and innovation solutions, I exhort your missions to deliberately promote cooperation from your capitals around these aspects, as we create stronger synergies for the Africa we all want.\n\nMeanwhile, my Government looks forward to positive outcomes of engagements with the international community under the arrears clearance and debt resolution process, he said.\n\nOn last years El Nino-induced drought, the President said: The humanitarian aid, technical expertise and moral support received last year, from some of your countries and organisations, following my declaration of the El-Nino induced drought as a national disaster, was timely and greatly appreciated. These acts of kindness remind us of the power of unity in overcoming challenges.\n\nAs the current SADC Chair, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe wouldcontinue promoting innovation to unlock opportunities for sustainable economic growth and development towards an industrialised SADC.\n\nOn the peace and security challenges in the region, particularly in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, he said Zimbabwe, was playing its part through SADC and East African Community initiatives, to find lasting peace.\n\nWe continue to call for an immediate ceasefire and the cessation of hostilities as well as the pursuit of dialogue, as a panacea for sustainable peace and stability in the region. We once again appeal for the provision of humanitarian assistance to the displaced persons from the international community, he said.\n\nOn his part, the Dean of the diplomatic corps, Rwandan Ambassador James Musoni, said they would continue rallying behind President Mnangagwas leadership.\n\n",
