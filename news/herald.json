We must work towards formalisation of the informal economy, which according to the International Labour Organisation, is around 58.8 percent in Africa.\n\nAddressing informality through appropriate policies and strategies is important for promoting decent work, reducing poverty and achieving sustainable development.\n\nIn addition, the integration of small to medium enterprises into the formal economy is important given their role as engines of job creation and innovation in our region, said Mr Masanga.\n\nHe said there is need to create an environment that fosters innovation, entrepreneurship and sustainable job creation.\n\nThe meeting continues with closed-door meetings that will culminate in the ministerial session on Thursday.\n\n",
