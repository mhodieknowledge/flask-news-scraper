Wherever you are, make it comfortable for you so that if you are at home or in your office, you can use your smartphone, you can access a city council waiting list, be able to access your position if you are on the waiting list or who is on the waiting list.\n\nOr if you are looking for accommodation, whether its a rental, temporary accommodation, or its rented apartment accommodation, or its (even) accommodation to be bought, instead of waiting for papers to advertise. This is where we are going, this is what Vision 2030 is directing us to do. We must start it now.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa rallied his Ministers to expedite the adoption of new technologies in their ministries this year, as this would ensure effective service delivery for Zimbabweans.\n\nThe digital technology revolution is the cornerstone of modernisation, industrialisation and efficient service delivery to drive sustainable economic growth.\n\nInroads in the digitalisation of Government information and services are occurring at a worryingly slow pace.\n\nIt is a misnomer that with the abundant ICT skills and capacities among young people, our Government has only a few functional and up-to-date Ministry websites. More should be done to improve this situation, said the President at the last Cabinet meeting of 2024.\n\n",

As a result, the national average dam level has risen to 59,1 percent, representing a 1,59 percent increase since December 30.\n\nDespite the recent increase, the current national dam level average of 59,1 percent still lags behind last years level of 78 percent recorded during the same period.\n\nAs a result, water users are urged to maintain conservative and efficient water usage practices, read the statement.\n\nWater levels were higher this time last year because the previous season had been particularly good in terms of rainfall. The drought in the last season meant that levels were lower when the season ended and that irrigation demand was higher.\n\nThe water authority also advised individuals and entities using dam water for non-essential purposes, such as irrigating summer crops to comply with water abstraction agreements and adhere to relevant laws regulating water use.\n\nIn Gwayi catchment, the dam levels vary significantly. Ngwenya Dam is at 91,6 percent capacity, while Pollards Dam is at 93,2 percent. Insukamini Dam holds 56,3 percent, and Bubi-Lupane Dam is at 35,1 percent. Notably, Khami Dam has reached full capacity at 100 percent, ZINWA said.\n\nIn the Manyame catchment area, Chivero is at 72,1 percent capacity, while Manyame Dam has reached 74,1 percent.\n\nHarava Dam holds 16,3 percent, while Biri Dam holds 75 percent, and Mazvikadei Dam is at 66,6 percent.\n\nFor dams on the Mazowe catchment, Mazowe Dam is at 28 percent, Kushinga-Phikhelela Dam at 26,9 percent, Masembura Dam at 78,6 percent capacity and Arcadia Dam at 60,7 percent.\n\n",

            "content": "Fidelis Munyoro-Chief Court Reporter\n\nThe seven-year contractual saga between the National Social Security Authority (NSSA) and a developer it once contracted, Housing Cooperation Zimbabwe (HCZ), has finally reached its conclusion, with the Supreme Court ruling in favour of NSSA.\n\nThis multi-million dollar dispute, once entrenched in the corridors of arbitration centres and judicial chambers, has been laid to rest after the Supreme Court overturned a High Court ruling that had awarded HCZ a staggering US$22 million plus interest in damages for lost profits.\n\nThis was awarded by the first arbitrator who, said the court, erred in allowing a consequential damages claim that was specifically barred by the initial contract with NSSA.\n\nThe court criticised NSSA for sending a fairly junior official to the arbitration hearings. The High Court erred, said the Supreme Court, in confirming this erroneous award and not seeing that NSSA was objecting over contract law, not seeking a special favour as a public entity.\n\nThe dispute revolved around a botched deal for the construction of 8 000 houses and flats in Caledonia, Harare, at a total cost of US$304 million.\n\nA week after its formation in 2017, HCZ, a company co-founded by Adam Molai and Stephen Duggan, was handed the colossalproject.\n\nHowever, the ambitious partnership faced problems, culminating in HCZ suing NSSA for breach of contract before an arbitrator, who ruled in its favour.\n\nThat decision which HCZ sought to register in the High Court, ignited a legal battle that raged for years.\n\nAt the centre of the dispute lay the arbitrators award of damages for loss of profit that NSSA vehemently argued were not contemplated in the contract.\n\nNSSA contended that the arbitrator, senior private lawyer Mr Peter Carnegie Lloyd, had effectively rewritten the agreement by awarding consequential damages expressly excluded under clause 22.1 of the contract.\n\nThe authority further decried the award as a gross violation of public policy, asserting that such damages could not have been within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting.\n\nThe High Court, however, ruled in favour of HCZ, dismissing NSSAs objections and ordering the registration of the arbitral award.\n\nThis ruling, NSSA argued, was flawed on multiple fronts. Not only had the High Court failed to interrogate the arbitrators findings critically, but it also misconstrued NSSAs legal argument as a plea for sympathy, mischaracterising the authoritys position as an appeal to its public nature and the protection of taxpayers funds.\n\nNSSA, insisted that its stance was rooted in clear contractual principles, that a party cannot claim damages outside the express terms of the agreement.\n\nThe matter escalated to the Supreme Court, where the appeal panel of three judges Justice Antonia Guvava, Justice Tendayi Uchena, and Justice Samuel Kudya, delivered a judgment that not only vindicated NSSA, but also underscored the sanctity of contractual terms.\n\nJustice Guvava, writing for the court, stressed that an arbitral award must be set aside if it is so manifestly erroneous that it brings about a grave injustice.\n\nShe noted that the damages awarded by the arbitrator were clearly consequential in nature and so prohibited by the parties agreement.\n\nThe lower court, she said, had erred in failing to recognise this fundamental breach of public policy.\n\nJustice Guvava dismantled the High Courts reasoning, pointing out that the judge had aligned too readily with the arbitrators findings without subjecting them to the scrutiny demanded by NSSAs objections.\n\nThe damages claimed by HCZ, she explained, were not general damages, as the lower court had classified them, but special or consequential damages that clause 22.1 of the agreement explicitly barred.\n\nAs such, the arbitral award stood in stark contravention of the contract, a fatal flaw that rendered it untenable.\n\nThe Supreme Courts ruling also rebuked the procedural missteps that marred NSSAs initial arbitration hearing.\n\nThe authority had sent a relatively junior officer to represent it, a decision that Justice Guvava described as resulting in damaging concessions and a failure to effectively challenge HCZs claims.\n\nYet, despite this miscalculation, the court held that the arbitrators decision could not stand when measured against the high bar of public policy.\n\nThe appeal will succeed on this basis, declared Justice Guvava.\n\nThe issue of the registration of the award, therefore, falls away, as there is no longer an award to register.\n\nNoting that the High Courts errors extended to its treatment of the application to set aside the award, she allowed NSSAs appeal with costs, closing the chapter on a contentious and high stakes legal battle.\n\nAdvocate Thabani Mpofu, instructed by Mawere and Sibanda, argued the case on behalf of NSSA, while Advocate Daniel Tivadar, under the instruction of Zigomo Legal Practitioners, represented HCZ.\n\n",

We expect the marketing season to start early. We faced issues where farmers had to replant seedlings lost to a heatwave that affected the country. If we continue receiving rains, we remain positive about meeting our annual target, he said.\n\nIn addition, Mr Dune noted a significant migration of labour to tobacco farms, particularly in dry areas like Binga and Muzarabani, where families are seeking sustenance.\n\nIn a related development, Lands, Agriculture, Water, Fisheries and Rural Development Minister Dr Anxious Masuka has extended the deadline for destroying tobacco seedbeds to January 15 to take into account the dry spell and the delay imposed on many dryland farmers until reasonable rains started falling around Christmas.\n\nThe Plant Pests and Diseases (Tobacco) Regulations of 1979 typically mandate destruction by December 31 to disrupt pest life cycles.\n\nHowever, due to a prolonged dry spell, farmers relying on rain-fed tobacco could not transplant in time.\n\nThe Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB) advocated for this extension to help farmers preserve their investments and reap the benefits of their hard work. Late December rains have brought relief and optimism for dryland tobacco growers, marking a turning point for the present season.\n\nAccording to TIMB statistics, as of December 27, growers had transplanted 84 661 hectares, surpassing the 82 392 hectares recorded during the same period in 2023.

            "content": "Ivan Zhakata-Herald Correspondent\n\nThe Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) has welcomed and celebrated the historic signing into law of the Death Penalty Abolition Act, 2024.\n\nIn a statement, the Commission said the landmark step is a significant milestone in Zimbabwes commitment to upholding the sanctity of human life, as enshrined in Section 48 of the Constitution, which protects the right to life, alongside sections 51 and 53 which respectively guarantee the rights to dignity and freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman and degradingtreatment.\n\nIt said the new Act eliminates the death penalty in Zimbabwe, ensuring no person shall be sentenced to death or executed.\n\nThis legislative development aligns with modern human rights standards and reflects the global trend towards the abolition of the death penalty, reads the statement.\n\nZimbabwe now joins a growing number of nations that have recognised the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of their past actions. The ZHRC applauds the inclusive and compassionate approach taken in the transitional provisions of the Act, ensuring prisoners under sentence of death are afforded legal representation and the opportunity for clemency.\n\nThis approach underlines the importance of rehabilitation over retribution in Zimbabwes justice system. The ZHRC highly commends the unity of purpose demonstrated by the leadership across the political divide, notably, Mr Edwin Mushoriwa who introduced the Private Members Bill in November 2023, Minister of Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Ziyambi Ziyambi who facilitated the passage, Members of Parliament as a whole, and President Mnangagwa who signed the Bill into law.\n\nThe Commission has urged the political leadership to maintain the unity for the sake of promoting human rights in Zimbabwe.\n\nIt said the abolition of the death penalty is a monumental achievement for human rights in Zimbabwe as it resonates with the fundamental principles of equality, justice and mercy, which are cornerstones of a democratic society.\n\nThis development also reinforces Zimbabwes alignment with international human rights instruments such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, reads the statement.\n\nThe ZHRC recognises the challenges of addressing grave crimes, but firmly maintains that the death penalty is not the solution. Evidence worldwide shows that the death penalty does not deter crime more effectively than other punishment.\n\nInstead, its abolition allows for a more humane and restorative justice system. As we celebrate this significant milestone, the ZHRC reiterates its commitment to promoting the protection of human rights and advocating for the reform of laws and policies to create a fairer and more just society.\n\nThe Commission has also called on all stakeholders, Government bodies, civil society and citizens to support the full implementation of the Act and to work collectively towards building a Zimbabwe where justice, equality and respect for life prevail.\n\nAs a matter of priority, the ZHRC urges the responsible authorities to ensure expeditious and fair re-sentencing of those on the death row, and will monitor such process.\n\nThis milestone achievement symbolises Zimbabwes commitment to upholding constitutional, regional and international human rights standards. In that vein, the ZHRC therefore, urges the Government of Zimbabwe to maintain the momentum and ratify outstanding treaties, particularly the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and the UN Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CED).\n\n",

            "content": "Joseph Madzimure-Senior Reporter\n\nTHE Government has stepped up efforts to regularise informal settlements across the country, Local Government and Public Works Minister Daniel Garwe has said.\n\nIt has also put in place a regularisation policy managed by the Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities together with the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works.\n\nSpeaking at a Ministers Meet the Media briefing organised by the Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting and Publicity Services in Harare yesterday, Minister Garwe said the Government would expedite the regularisation of all the informal settlements to realise Vision 2030.\n\nWe have no choice; we need to regularise all the informal settlements that are within the country. If we are to speak of an upper middle-income status by 2030, we need to make conscious decisions not only as central Government but as Zimbabweans to ensure that we regularise. How do we start it: it starts with you and me.\n\nMinister Garwe said people must not to buy land from land barons, since all State land belongs to the Government.\n\nPlease stop buying land from land barons, thats the first call for regularisation. We now have structures put in place to ensure that you can come to the Ministry of Local Government and your local authority and be able to get information on the availability of a stand in the area of your choice if there are there, so stop buying land from criminals.\n\nFor the areas that already exist as informal settlements such as Caledonia to the east of Harare and the swathe of settlements across Harare South, Minister Garwe said Government had put in place a budget to ensure they engaged developers who would develop the area.\n\nThose who would be getting the title deeds would be able to use these as security to get the mortgages they needed to pay for services such as roads, water and sewers.\n\nWe now have a budget in place to ensure that we engage the developers so that they provide roads, water, and the sewer that is required to regularise those areas.\n\nWe want residents to participate. They desire to have a title deed. They can only get a title deed if they pay for the land first. The land belongs to the State. Even if you are living on a stand that is half a metre by half a metre, you pay for the land first, Minister Garwe said.\n\nAfter paying for the land you are now requested to pay for the road construction that covers the 500 metres in your area of concern, the water for the same distance of that same area and the sewer of your area.\n\nThe money does not go to the Government coffers; it will go to a bank or an insurance company or building societies that have the responsibility to offer mortgage facilities for the same beneficiaries that are on the land.\n\nProper regularisation, he said, ultimately enabled the building of modern smart infrastructure which would increase property values as regulated and organised neighbourhoods were more desirable places to live and work.\n\nMinister Garwe said sanitisation was closely linked to economic development as poor sanitary practices can lead to increased healthcare costs, lost productivity due to illness, and a burden on the public health system.\n\n",
