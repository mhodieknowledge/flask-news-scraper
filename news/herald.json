            "content": "Prosper Dembedza-Herald Correspondent\n\nLittlerock International Schools executive principal Chamunorwa Gracious Dahwa and bursar Ms Tambudzai Majuru have appeared in court on allegations of defrauding their employer of US$289 997.\n\nMajuru and Dahwa were facing two counts of fraud when they appeared before Harare magistrate Mr Donald Ndirowei.\n\nThey both pleaded guilty prompting the magistrate to defer the matter to Thursday for sentencing.\n\nIt is the States case that Dahwa and Majuru connived to steal the schools funds. The court heard that Majuru was responsible for buying receipt books and receipting funds received from parents who had their children enrolled at the school while Dahwa was an executive principal responsible for the overall management of school affairs in Harare and Norton,\n\nMajuru ordered a receipt book bearing the Littlerock International School logo with serial numbers 201 to 400 from DH Solutions (Private) Limited, Harare but did not declare this to the school.\n\nThe court heard that on 308 occasions, Majuru received money on behalf of the school and receipted it on the schedule.\n\nInstead of remitting the funds to the school authority, she connived with Dahwa and they converted the funds to their own use.\n\nOn June 7, 2024, the complainant got a tip off about the theft and filed a police report. On June 8 2024, detectives went to Dahwas residence with Majuru where a search was conducted leading to the recovery of a receipt book serial numbers 201 to 400.\n\nThe receipt book was used to receipt school funds amounting to US$80 073 The book was seized on exhibit seizure confirmation receipt number 0110747 and Majuru signed for it. Majuru was subsequently arrested and she implicated accused Dahwa.\n\nFurther investigations carried out revealed that Majuru ordered receipt books from DH Solutions Private Limited, Harare for receipting of school funds as per her routine duties.\n\nDuring the same period, she ordered duplicate receipt books from the same company bearing the same serial numbers to commit the offence.\n\nThey receipted some of the money they received in the official receipt books and remitted the money to the school authority.\n\nMajuru and Dahwa receipted the funds they received on duplicate receipt books and converted the money to personal use.\n\nThe accused persons then destroyed the duplicate receipt books to conceal evidence. During the course of investigations, some parents of students submitted receipts to the school authority.\n\nIt was established that information on the said receipts was authored by Majuru but do not match official receipts and all the money included therein was never remitted to the school authority.\n\nOn July 9, 2024, the recovered receipt book serial numbers 201 to 400 and the exhibits seizure confirmation receipt number 0110747 were taken to the Questioned Document Examiner for forensics.\n\nThe forensic expert concluded that the receipt book in question was authored and signed by Majuru. She also signed on the exhibits seizure confirmation receipt number 0110747 as acknowledgment of the recovery of the receipt book.\n\nThe recovered receipt book serial numbers 201 to 400, copies of duplicate receipts, copies of official receipts with unremitted funds, exhibits seizure confirmation receipt number 0110747 and forensic report from the Questioned Document Examiner and an audit report may be produced in court as exhibits.\n\nThe total value of money misappropriated by the accused persons was US$289 997 and nothing was recovered.\n\nFrom the misappropriated funds, US$150 847 was confirmed and verified through available records while the remainder of US$139 150 was not accounted for since it was recorded in the duplicate receipt book that was destroyed.\n\n",

This is nothing short of a war crime, and the international community must act immediately.The humanitarian situation in the affected areas has deteriorated significantly, with reports of widespread destruction.According to Palestinian officials, more than 15 000 people have been forcibly displaced in Jenin alone, as Israeli airstrikes and military raids continue to devastate civilian infrastructure.Eyewitness accounts from Jenin describe scenes of chaos and destruction, with residents left homeless amid the rubble.Israeli forces have also besieged the Martyr Thabet Thabet Governmental Hospital and the Israa Specialized Hospital, severely hampering medical crews ability to assist the wounded.This is a clear violation of international humanitarian law, Ambassador Almassri said.Targeting medical facilities and obstructing ambulances is a crime under the Geneva Conventions. Israel must be held accountable for these atrocities.The Palestinian leadership has formally requested an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to address the situation.However, previous attempts to hold Israel accountable have often faced diplomatic roadblocks, particularly from its key allies.Political analysts suggest that unless international pressure intensifies, the cycle of violence and forced displacement will continue unchecked.Rights organisations, including the United Nations and Amnesty International, have previously condemned Israels actions in the occupied territories, but enforcement mechanisms remain weak.The world cannot stand idly while Israel continues its systematic campaign against the Palestinian people, Ambassador Almassri said.We demand immediate action to stop these war crimes and ensure justice for our people.As tension rises in the region, protests have erupted in several cities worldwide, with demonstrators calling for an end to Israeli aggression and stronger global condemnation.\n\n",
