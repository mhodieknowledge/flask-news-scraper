            "content": "Yeukai Karengezeka\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nSUSPENDED Council for Legal Education (CLE) executive secretary, Huggins Duri, and lawyer Linda Kovi have been acquitted of fraud charges after a full trial at the Harare Magistrates Court.\n\nRegional magistrate Mr Lazini Ncube ruled that the State had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and provided insufficient evidence to support the allegations.\n\nMoreover, the main witness, Ms Shorai Mupunga was not credible.\n\nThe two were cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe case centered around allegations that Kovi and Duri conspired to fraudulently obtain a certificate of completion, which allowed the former to be admitted as a legal practitioner in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe complainant in the matter was the State, represented by CLE finance and administration manager Mr Joe Zimba.\n\nKovi (34), an administrator at Kanoti and Partners, graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Africa in Lusaka, Zambia.\n\nTo practice law in Zimbabwe, she needed to obtain a conversion certificate from CLE after passing a series of prescribed examinations.\n\nAccording to the State, Kovi registered with the CLE in 2020 and sat for four modules Common Law I & II, Criminal Procedure, and Evidence.\n\nShe only passed Common Law II with 54 percent and failed the remaining three modules. She later registered for three additional modules Civil Procedure, Statutes, and Ethics but failed them all.\n\nInvestigations also revealed that she never wrote the Bookkeeping module, a requirement for certification.\n\nThe prosecution alleged that Kovi then approached Duri, who was the CLE executive secretary at the time, and sought his assistance in fraudulently obtaining a practicing certificate.\n\nDuri purportedly instructed a CLE official, Ms Mupunga, to include Kovis name on the list of those eligible for certification, despite her failing the required modules.\n\nA certificate of completion was allegedly processed, signed by the chairman of the Board of Examinations, and collected by Duri.\n\nThis certificate enabled Kovi to be admitted as a legal practitioner before the High Court of Zimbabwe.\n\n",

Roads were opened while most developments were already at an advanced stage.\n\nHowever, the accused persons started illegally selling and allocating stands in the area. Mr Pasades company allegedly went to court and acquired a High Court order which gave it the authority to remove the illegally settled people.\n\nHowever, the accused persons did not vacate the stands, contrary to the court order. It is the States case that on November 2023, the High Court issued a provisional order against Eastwind Trust.\n\nAfter the order was granted, the accused were served by the Sheriff, but continued invading the area in violation of the order.\n\nThe complainant is Homegram Investments Limited, represented by Mr Pasade.\n\n",
