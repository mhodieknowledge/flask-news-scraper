            "content": "Richard Muponde-Zimpapers Politics Hub\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) will soon swoop on businesses and individuals hoarding money in cash deposit boxes in banks, homes and business premises.\n\nAuthorities are concerned that such practices leave millions of dollars lying idle, starving the economy of much-needed cash for transactions.\n\nAnnouncing his 2025 Monetary Policy Statement in February, RBZ Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu described the practice of hoarding cash in banks or company premises as financial disintermediation, which he said was stifling economic growth by depriving economic agents of much-needed liquidity.\n\nSome manufacturers, he said, were supplying goods to the informal market but were not banking the proceeds. Instead, they were keeping these funds in cash deposit boxes, which violates the Anti-Money Laundering Act.\n\nDr Mushayavanhu said the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the RBZ would take action to address this malpractice.\n\nFIU director-general, Mr Oliver Chiperesa, confirmed the impending blitz, citing concerns raised by Dr Mushayavanhu.\n\nYou may recall that during the presentation of his 2025 Monetary Policy Statement, the RBZ Governor mentioned that businesses and individuals, especially manufacturers and informal retailers, were hoarding millions of dollars in their cash deposit boxes. This is depriving the economy of the much-needed liquidity, Mr Chiperesa said.\n\nWe are currently working on the regulations to ensure that we conduct this blitz within the confines of the law. Normally, cash deposit boxes are used to keep important documents, but the current trend is that they are being used to store large sums of money outside the banking system, which is illegal according to the Anti-Money Laundering Act.\n\nHe said it was encouraging to see improved use of the official banking system, which promotes free financial flows.\n\nWe want to encourage growth and ensure that all transactions are accounted for in line with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism regulations. We were removed from the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) grey list because of the clean flow of money in our economy, and we want to maintain that achievement to support economic growth through attracting Foreign Direct Investment, Mr Chiperesa said.\n\nThe FIU recently strengthened its operations by opening offices in Bulawayo to bolster ZiG stability.\n\nHowever, the widespread hoarding of millions of dollars in cash deposit boxes was a major challenge as it threatened financial stability.\n\nCurrently, as Dr Mushayavanhu indicated, there was stability in the market and the continued stability of Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) was expected to lead to more transactions being conducted in local currency.\n\nThese transactions are expected to include fuel sales as the market begins to embrace ZiG as a store of value and a reliable medium of exchange.\n\nDr Mushayavanhu also emphasised that keeping large sums of cash was an unnecessary risk given the upward revision in limits on prepaid credit and attractive interest rates on savings.\n\nAs part of efforts to promote a culture of saving and bolster confidence in the local banking sector, the RBZ has implemented an incremental rise in interest rates on savingsaccounts.\n\nThe stability of ZiG has led to an increase in local currency transactions and deposits, signalling confidence and acceptance of the local currency by the market.\n\nThis development has also resulted in the proportion of local currency deposits held by banks increasing from less than 10 percent before the introduction of ZiG to current levels of around 15percent.\n\nThe RBZ also requires 50 percent of quarterly payments dates (QPDs) by corporates to be settled in local currency, as part of measures to promote the use and stability of the ZiG currency.\n\n",

We are here and we can witness that peace and tranquillity continues to exist in our country, Dr Muswere said.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of collective responsibility in achieving national development goals and assured the nation that the security sector remained vigilant in addressing such activities.\n\nZimbabweans have got a shared responsibility in order to achieve Vision 2030 which seeks to achieve an upper middle society by the year 2030, said Dr Muswere.\n\nA planned demonstration that had been called for Monday by former Zanu-PF Central Committee member, Geza, was a monumental flop as Zimbabweans chose to uphold the peace and tranquillity prevailing in the country.\n\nPeace prevailed nationwide, with no meaningful demonstrations recorded as it was business as usual.\n\nSchools were open and learners attended classes as usual.\n\nNational police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the situation was generally calm countrywide.\n\n",

Part of these steps include budget allocation, budget reprioritisation, national health insurance and others to ensure that our health programmes continue to function and to serve our people as before.\n\nI am glad that the move by the United States government came when we were already engaged in processes to develop an HIV sustainability plan, which will be ready soon.\n\nDr Maunganidze said the media, especially editors, should inform the nation about the funding gaps, the discussions and decisions needed to be taken to ensure the Governments response is sustainable and meets the expectations of our people without leaving anyone behind.\n\nYour power is not just in informing and educating but in setting the national policy agenda, reframing narratives and advocating for the health and social transformation envisioned by the Second Republic.\n\nAs a Ministry and working together with the National AIDS Council in this regard, we are aware that the health and well-being of our nation will strongly benefit from this engagement today.\n\nI therefore want to challenge you continue educating the public with accurate, science-backed information, eliminate stigma through responsible, inclusive reporting and to amplify the voices of those living with HIV, ensuring their stories are told with dignity, he said.\n\nDr Maunganidze added that as the nation moves towards the goal of ending AIDS by 2030, his ministry will continue to strengthen partnerships with the media.\n\nAccurate and timely information has always been a vital resource in public health, which policy makers, media practitioners and the public prioritise, he explained.\n\nThe workshop has been convened, rooted in the need to ensure the media continue to prioritise HIV and related morbidities within their coverage and reportage.\n\nGovernment says without correct and timely information, the public is left to the perils of inaccurate information often peddled by social media.\n\nYour role is profound in facilitating accurate, objective, and sensitive reporting, debunking myths, and promoting awareness through responsible media coverage, ultimately contributing to public health and well-being, said Dr Maunganidze.\n\n",

To have Cde Tagwirei in the ranks of Zanu PF in Harare province is a noble thing, more so at the stage where the reforms of the President have taken traction. We are beginning to see big investors coming from outside, he said.\n\nCde Mutsvangwa likened Cde Tagwireis potential influence on Zanu PF and the nation to that of billionaire Mr Elon Musk, who serves as an advisor to United States President Donald Trump.\n\nFor him to become part of the Zanu PF leadership, his vast business experience, his entrepreneurial argument will also enrich the proceedings of Harare province.\n\nIf I can draw allusions, we can see how Elon Musk, a senior advisor to President Trump and other business people have enriched the second term of President Trump. And just last week, the American leadership and the Chinese leadership were having a meeting with his business class.\n\nAll the new entrepreneurs who are deep-seeker entrepreneurs in artificial intelligence and a gamut of other Chinese business people in robotics, in drones, across the board, were in attendance. So the business class is a good thing for it to be identified with the ruling party, he said.\n\nCde Mutsvangwa said collaboration with business leaders like Cde Tagwirei will be key to achieving Vision 2030.\n\nIt is a timely move for Cde Tagwirei to come to the party, and we hope that his example will be followed by more and more business people.We, of course, take pride in that we are a mass membership party because we are democratic, but we also want to be enriched by ideas of those people who are in charge of producing goods and services within the country, within the region and for the global marketplace, he said.\n\nWe want them to be in Zanu PF so that they fertilise the entrepreneurial discourse which may be going on at any particular time. We welcome Cde Tagwirei, well done Harare province for embracing him.\n\nCde Mutsvangwa implored Zanu PF Harare province members to give Cde Tagwirei as much support as they can for him to flourish in politics.\n\nI also hope he learns as much as he can about the ethos of Zanu PF as a party of the permanent Zimbabwe revolution, a party which aspires to make sure that there is shared progress and common prosperity, he said.\n\nZanu PF Harare province chairperson Cde Godwills Masimirembwa confirmed that the recommendation for Cde Tagwireis co-option had been submitted to the party Secretary General Cde Obert Mpofu who will provide further guidance on the next steps.\n\n",

These efforts are in sync with President Mnangagwas Vision 2030, focusing on inclusive economic development and empowerment.\n\nDr Tungwarara has been instrumental in launching the War Veterans Welfare Fund, which is designed to honour and support those who participated in Zimbabwes liberation struggle.\n\nHe announced a nationwide allocation of $1,5 million, with each of Zimbabwes 10 provinces receiving $150 000.\n\nThis interest-free fund is designed to support short-term projects that empower war veterans and contribute to the countrys economic growth.\n\nBeyond financial assistance, each veteran is set to receive a rural house and a borehole at their homestead, enhancing their living conditions and promoting economic self-sufficiency.\n\nAlso recognising the pivotal role of youths in national development, Dr Tungwarara is overseeing the Youth Fund, an initiative providing financial support, training, and mentorship to young Zimbabweans.\n\nThis programme aims to empower the next generation of leaders and entrepreneurs, enabling them to pursue innovative ventures and contribute meaningfully to the nations economic landscape.\n\nOn rural development, Dr Tungwarara has played a key role in the establishment of Village Business Units (VBUs) under the Presidential Rural Development Programme.\n\nThese VBUs are registered rural enterprises designed to stimulate economic activity and improve livelihoods in rural communities.\n\nEach unit typically consists of a one-hectare plot equipped with irrigation systems, greenhouses, and other agricultural infrastructure, enabling villages to produce and market agricultural products effectively.\n\nTo accelerate the setup of these units, contractors have been deployed to fast-track the construction of solar-powered boreholes in rural districts.\n\nThe Governments ambitious plan aims to establish 10 000 VBUs by the end of the year, each comprising a solar-powered borehole, storage tanks, a drip-irrigated horticulture garden, and fish ponds.\n\n",

            "content": "HARARE City Council is still paying its top officials, and in particular the town clerk and departmental heads, far above the pay scales approved by the Local Government Board, especially once all allowances are factored in.\n\nThis board, appointed by the Government, keeps a watchful eye on what all local authorities are doing and has set a sliding scale of pay schedules for top administrative staff that take into account the size of the city, town or rural district council that the administrators work for, and the sort of qualifications they are expected to hold.\n\nThis is meant to create a reasonably uniform structure for local government across the country.\n\nIt also stops a council from trying to economise by hiring sub-standard staff at ultra-low pay, as well as attacking what is now seen in Harare of senior staff padding their pay.\n\nGenerally the pay scales and qualifications for local government are supposed to be in line with those for civil servants in central government, so that everyone in the public sector is in the same sort of groups.\n\nIt is fairly obvious that the low calibre of so many city councillors in Harare in recent years, a problem that a succession of mayors from the same opposition party as the majority of councillors have highlighted in recent years, has allowed senior officials to run rings around their supposed masters when it comes to employment contracts.\n\nThe fact that the same officials have been happy to sign off the allowances paid to councillors for attending meetings, and arrange workshops with large subsistence and travel allowances for councillors in resorts some distance from Harare, suggests there could well be a bit of mutual back scratching when it comes to city finances.\n\nThe reason for zero action on the directives of the Local Government Board is obvious: the administrative officials who are supposed to implement the directive and draw up the approved conditions of service and pay scales to replace those declared null and void are precisely the same people who have been living in clover on the inflated scales.\n\nSo Harare continues to pay US$500 000 a month in salaries and allowances to its top officials, with the town clerk able to pull in US$30 000 a month. Besides this ordinary high pay, the top officials also benefit from some other fancy perks, such as holiday allowances which include travel and hotel costs for resorts in Zimbabwe, in the region and worldwide.\n\nMiddle and lower level council staff, and this includes the technical staff battling to keep basic services functioning even when the council cannot provide the capital equipment and the money for things like water treatment chemicals, are not being overpaid and are on the sort of standard pay scales for their levels of responsibility and qualifications found through the public sector.\n\nKnowing now, thanks to evidence presented to the Commission of Inquiry into the affairs of Harare City Council, what was going on, the senior management suites cannot be fostering staff morale that wonderful in the municipal offices.\n\nOrdinary staff have had delayed pay days and all sorts of other problems even getting what they are owed, thanks to the way liquid cash is siphoned off to the top dogs.\n\nWe suspect that when the pay of top council officials was being pushed up beyond the limits set by the Local Government Board, the usual arguments were presented, that high level staff would leave the councils service for the private sector if they were not paid this sort of money and given these sort of perks.\n\nWell, considering how the top officials, with perhaps one or two exceptions, are ruining the city, most residents would be happy to see them storm out and join the private sector, although we suspect that having high-end city council service on your CV is unlikely to produce job offers at anything like the salaries they now earn. Residents would cheer as they walked out.\n\nThe Local Government Board may have to intervene more decisively if the Harare City Council, guided by its own defaulting officials, does not draw up a proper grading framework and salary scales.\n\nThis might mean sending in a team borrowed from the Public Service Commission who would know the public sector grading structure inside out and would be able to quickly draw up an appropriate grading and salary structure for Harare City Council.\n\nIndeed, even if Harare is prepared to do the work itself, it would seem sensible for it to get technical advice from the Local Government Board and the Public Service Commission so that it gets it right on the first attempt, rather than having a structure going backwards and forwards between the board and the council until the present crowd of city officials have all reached retirement age.\n\nAt the same time, the council, backed by the board or even directed by the board, should be implementing the sort of performance contracts for its top officials that the President considers so essential for the top layers of the civil service.\n\nUnder-performing officials, especially of they are seriously under-performing, could be reassigned to posts more suitable for their talents, or encouraged to leave council service.\n\nAt the same time, some sort of basic qualifications need to be laid down for local government councillors, especially those on the councils of complex organisations like a major city. In the past, city councillors were usually people who would have made their mark in life, in a profession or in business, and want to give back to their community or at least sort out what they saw as irritating deficiencies.\n\nThese days a lot of councillors try to live off their allowances, which were originally paid so that councillors were not out of pocket for expenses, being able to buy petrol to drive to meetings and pay their phone bills when replying to residents queries and the like.\n\nRegardless of party, councillors should have some basic skills and professional background if they are to be any good.\n\n",
