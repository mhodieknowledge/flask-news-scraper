The Department of Immigration does not require the services of agents, hence every traveller should present himself or herself for clearance.\n\nIf there are challenges, please request to see the supervisors who are readily available for assistance. We also urge parents to ensure that their children are accompanied by reliable relatives as opposed to giving them to bus crews, he said.\n\nSouth Africas Commissioner of the Border Management Authority (BMA), Dr Michael Masiapato said they have noted a significant increase in traveller movements across all ports of entry as the peak holiday season approaches.\n\nWe are aware of the increased traveller volumes, which are normally experienced around this time. We are working closely with all stakeholders to manage operations efficiently and reduce waiting times, he said.\n\nOur teams on the ground are working tirelessly to manage the flow of people and to ensure that everyone is assisted as quickly as possible.\n\n",
