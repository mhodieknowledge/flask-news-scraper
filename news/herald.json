This is when I met my first producers, Nyasha Timbe and Mr Noxa, Shellah recalled.\n\nTo date, Shellah has released two projects, each with different outcomes, but he maintains a positive outlook.\n\nA third project is expected before the end of the first quarter of this year.\n\nHis single Urigamba has remained on Power FM Zimbabwes Top 40 charts for two consecutive weeks.\n\nHaving mastered the art of resilience, Shellah serves as an inspiration and motivation for emerging and aspiring artists.\n\nMy main aim is to spread positive messages to everyone, promote love, and eradicate hate, he said.\n\nMy advice to upcoming artists is to exercise patience and embrace hard work.\n\nBorn and raised in Kambuzuma, Harare, the Afro-fusion musician attended Wadzanai Primary School and Kambuzuma 1 High School.\n\n",

            "content": "Farirai Machivenyika and Wallace Ruzvidzo\n\nAll ministries should ensure that business does not suffer from prohibitive regulations as well as punitive administrative licences and fees, President Mnangagwa has said.\n\nIn his address at the First Meeting of the 2025 Cabinet Year on Tuesday, the President said instead of being restrictive, fees, licences, permits and regulations should promote economic development.\n\nTo enhance the overall performance of our economy, the Ease of Doing Business Agenda continues to be an important aspect of our programming.\n\nIn that regard, concerted efforts must be made to revisit all the areas that hinder the start or growth of all investments, whether local or foreign.\n\nI commend the entrepreneurial spirit among our people. By nature, Zimbabweans are hardworking, he said.\n\nTowards that end, Parliaments Portfolio Committee on Industry and Commerce yesterday convened to discuss the challenges faced by manufacturers and retailers in the formal sectors.\n\nConfederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) chief economist, Dr Cornelius Dube, said there was need for legislation requiring Government ministries, departments and agencies to procure a specific percentage of their goods and services from local suppliers to boost the economy.\n\nGovernment should come up with legislation or a statutory instrument that compels it to buy a prescribed threshold for its goods and services from local suppliers, he said.\n\nDr Dube argued that this measure would enhance competitiveness and boost demand for local products.\n\nConfederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) president Mr Denford Mutashu highlighted the unfair competition posed by informal traders.\n\nThere are a lot of regulations and cost centres that we are facing as formal traders that those in the informal sectors are not paying. This makes our prices uncompetitive.\n\nThe closure of formal businesses could negatively impact other sectors, such as banking and finance, due to a decline in deposits, he said.\n\nIn her presentation, chief executive officer of the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) Ms Rosemary Mpofu-Chikarakara stressed the importance of addressing exchange rate discrepancies, foreign exchange shortages, and market distortions that encourage arbitrage.\n\nThe CCZ also wants smuggling stopped.\n\nIssues of porous border posts also need to be seriously dealt with and punitive (and) deterrent measures such as jail terms need to be introduced in order to curb these challenges.\n\nGovernment and the affected businesses can partner and aggressively invest and deploy advanced monitoring technologies, including drones, CCTV, and automated scanning systems, at all major border posts.\n\nAll imported products should abide by the rules, with no exemptions of who is importing. As long as there are other importers who are exempted from paying duty, loopholes will always be created and these products will then find their way both in the formal and informal market, creating an unfair playing field with the businesses that pay duties, the CCZ said.\n\nPortfolio Committee chairperson Cde Clemence Chiduwa acknowledged the concerns raised at the meeting.\n\nWe have taken note of the presentations and we will compile a report that we will table in the House for debate, he said.\n\nThe Committee aims to find viable solutions to support the local industry and create a fair competitive environment.\n\nThe Government and the Reserve Bank have taken taken steps to formalise the informal sector as part of broader measures outlined in the 2025 Monetary Policy Statement announced last Thursday, aimed at enhancing Government tax revenues and stabilising the economy.\n\nA week earlier, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Professor Mthuli Ncube announced measures to rein the burgeoning informal sector that was threatening the survival of formal businesses.\n\nThe RBZ Monetary Policy emphasises the need for both the informal and formal sectors to align, creating a more cohesive economic environment.\n\nRBZ Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu is advocating for the integration of informal businesses into a system that includes dual currencies, bank accounts, and electronic payments, which is essential for achieving the Governments economic goals.\n\nUnder the new regulations, items on a list of commonly smuggled goods will be presumed smuggled unless merchants can provide valid customs clearance.\n\nThis initiative places pressure on businesses to ensure compliance and legitimacy in their operations.\n\nGovernment will implement a presumptive retail-level VAT that manufacturers must collect when selling to small or informal businesses lacking tax clearance certificates.\n\nThis measure restricts wholesalers from engaging with unlicensed entities, further pushing informal businesses towards formalisation.\n\n",

It is pleasing that the Aero India show continues to grow in scope offering us great opportunities to witness the latest innovations and technologies in the aviation and defence industry. Military technology is indeed increasingly becoming integral to global peace and security given the non-traditional threats that are bedevilling our globe, said Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri.\n\nIt is pleasing that the conclave is coming at a time when India-Africa relations are growing from strength to strength as demonstrated by the continued participation of African countries at this event, she said.\n\nOur meeting is taking place on the backdrop of a shifting geopolitical environment and the rise in conflicts in many parts of the world, mainly in the Middle East and parts of Africa, said Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri.\n\nShe highlighted that these catastrophes confronting the world, were reversing the gains that have been made in the attainment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, thereby exposing vulnerable groups.\n\nThe global peace and security environment is being made more complex by the increasing recurrence of natural disasters with most emanating from climate change, she said.\n\nThis is rolling back socio-economic achievements made in recent years towards the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals and are impacting the vulnerable most, that is women, children, the disabled and the elderly, she added.\n\nMinister Muchinguri-Kashiri said recurring droughts owing to the adverse effects of climate change were increasing vulnerability among people.\n\nThese unwelcome developments require the defence forces to think outside the box.\n\nIn recent years, Southern Africa, in particular, has experienced severe droughts and flooding caused by cyclones. During the 2023-2024 rain season, the region experienced the worst drought in living memory.\n\nThe current season experienced floods that destroyed some parts of our region. This development prompted members of the defence forces to be increasingly involved in national and regional disaster preparedness mechanisms, and this calls for the modernisation and redesigning of our defence forces.\n\nThis new phenomenon requires mutual bilateral and multilateral cooperation for us to exchange experiences and best practices, she said. Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri lauded the India-Africa relations that were facilitating economic growth through forums like the BRICS+.\n\nIndia has been increasingly investing in Africa and also leading in the opening of markets for African goods and services, and in addition, continues to avail fair credit lines through its membership of the BRICS.\n\nTrade relations between the Republic of India and Africa are underpinned by diverse economic engagements with both governments and the private sector. As a result, trade between India and Africa continues to grow, making India our Africas third largest trading partner, after China and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri signed a memorandum of understanding on behalf of the Government with Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.\n\n",
