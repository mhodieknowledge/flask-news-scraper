They could stagger movement and upon reaching the border we have marshals directing them to various terminals where they will get customised services depending on their needs.\n\n",

            "content": "Edgar Vhera\n\nAgriculture Specialist Writer\n\nZIMBABWE is set to double Shisha tobacco production from 400 tonnes last year to 800 tonnes this season as harvesting, curing and marketing of the crop intensifies.\n\nProduction of the crop has presented farmers with more investment opportunities to widen their farming business ventures as part of the Tobacco Value Chain Transformation Plan (TVCTP).\n\nThe crop is being produced under contract farming being spearheaded by Cavendish Lloyd Zimbabwe Pvt Ltd (CLZ).\n\nCLZ chief executive officer, Dr Rebecca Manford, said a 100 percent increase in production was likely this year as marketing intensified.\n\nWe are projecting a total of 800 000 kilogrammes of cured Shisha tobacco by the end of the season, a significant increase from last years 400 000kg. The price for the crop has remained strong, with the highest price recorded so far at US$5,75 per kg, an increase from last seasons US$5,70, she said.\n\nThe increase in production was attributed to adoption of good agronomic practices, collaboration between growers and technicians and favourable weather conditions.\n\nThe area under production has however, risen by only 25 percent from 388 to 485 hectares.\n\nThe 2023-24 season was negatively affected by the El Nino drought which severely cut yields.\n\nDr Manford said there had been an increase in the number of growers in the inception year of commercial production in the 2022-23 season from 65 last season to the current 125.\n\nThis improvement is reflective of the increasing recognition among tobacco growers of the lucrative potential of Shisha tobacco, she said.\n\nThe crop is being grown by commercial, semi-commercial and small-scale growers.\n\nHarvesting of the irrigated crop started mid-December last year, with the dryland crop now being reaped.\n\nShisha production is done following ethical practices and environmental responsibility, in line with both global standards and its own values.\n\nIn our 2024 contracting season, we continued to champion sustainable agriculture by actively discouraging child labour across all our farming operations. We maintain strict compliance standards and work closely with our growers to ensure safe and fair working conditions, Dr Manford highlighted.\n\nMarondera farmer, Mr Kuda Kudenga of Dombie Farm who planted 25 hectares this year up from last years 15, was upbeat that this was going to be a rewarding year for him judging by the good quality of his crop.\n\nI am going to conduct my first sales in two weeks time on the cured crop as I intensify harvesting of the remaining fields.\n\nThe crop quality is top notch as a result of the favourable rainfall this season and experience in its growing through adherence to GAPs, he said.\n\nLast year Mr Kudenga produced 42, 5 tonnes at an average yield of 2, 8 tonnes per hectare and received an average price of US$4, 20 per kg with a high of US$5, 70 a feat which he expects to surpass this year.\n\nAfter successful variety and agronomic trials conducted by Kutsaga Research since 2021, the first commercial Shisha crop was grown in the 2022/23 season.\n\nShisha is also a flue-cured tobacco.\n\nThe variety is imported and has its own characteristics, produced under different agronomic practices, all designed to influence nicotine and sugar levels.\n\n",

In the barren areas, we have sunflowers, sorghum, cowpeas and in the high rainfall areas, we have brought in new varieties which suit the climate change, he said.\n\nGovernment, the Dep Minister said, will supply farmers with the required varieties for the whole country while soil pH testing will help them make informed decisions about crop selection and management.\n\nBy September 15, our farmers should start receiving inputs, especially those who are irrigating.\n\nAnd by mid-November, every farmer should have his or her seed at the doorstep of their fields.
