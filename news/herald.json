Recent efforts have resulted in the interception of numerous buses loaded with smuggled goods.\n\nAccording to security officials, smugglers are avoiding the border and are using the border flanks. To enhance surveillance, authorities are deploying high-tech security systems, including drone surveillance.\n\nSince the introduction of these systems as well as fast cargo scanners, Zimra has been able to intercept more smuggled goods.\n\nDrones and scanners are set to be deployed to other entry border posts like Forbes and Chirundu.\n\n",
