We are now targeting to do nothing less than 40 tonnes.\n\nShe also commended the Second Republic for creating a favourable business environment for small-scale miners.\n\nAs small-scale miners, we are quite privileged to be living in this era, where our contributions are also taken into consideration as part of the mainstream economy.\n\n",

The resources he offered were invaluable and all for free, she said.\n\nMs Sithole, a strong advocate for home schooling, expressed her pride and joy in Vickys achievement.\n\nIf you can, try it. It can make a difference. I didnt hesitate to support my daughter in this new method of learning. She was assessed by teachers from Entumbane High School before being allowed to drop out of formal education completely, she said.I am a happy mother that everything worked out well.\n\nVicky hopes her story will inspire other students to pursue their educational dreams despite challenges.
