            "content": "Wallace Ruzvidzo-Herald Reporter\n\nPRESIDENT Mnangagwa has implored students on Government-to-Government scholarship programmes outside the country to fly the Zimbabwean flag high as they are not just going to study, but represent the country as its ambassadors.\n\nYesterday, the President saw off five beneficiaries of an Algerian scholarship programme extended to him by his counterpart, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune.\n\nThe beneficiaries are Natasha Deni, Bukhosi Maphosa, Albert Jakarasi, Melogina Mano and Tinovimbanashe Kamutero.\n\nThey will be studying in various fields, including Science, Technology, Engineering and Medicine, areas which the President said were crucial in Zimbabwes development matrix.\n\nIn his remarks at State House in Harare, the President charged the students to make the country proud in their endeavours.\n\nYou are now ambassadors of our motherland, Zimbabwe, as you go for this programme in Science, Technology, Engineering and Medicine.\n\nThese are very critical fields for developing countries like Zimbabwe, so you must consider yourselves very lucky to have been selected. When you are there, you individually and collectively become ambassadors of our country. So, never think that you are an individual, wherever you are, you are actually representing us, he said.\n\nZimbabweans are known the world over for their hard work and tenacity, something President Mnangagwa said the students should showcase.\n\nMukanyadzisa muri ikoko, hamuna kunyadzisa vabereki venyu chete, matonyadzisa nesuwo ende kana madaro tinozonetsekana mangwana kuti titume here vamwe (If you act in an unbecoming manner during your stay in Algeria, know that you have not only let your parents down, but the nation at large and it will be difficult for us to send more students).\n\nSaka garai muchiziva kuti wakamirira nyika, hauna kuzvimirira pachako (You should always know that you are representing the country, you are not representing yourself).\n\nYou must go ahead and show the values of hard work. You must show that you are coming from a hard-working country. You must commit yourself to why you are there, he said.\n\nYou must go there with determination and courage and a sense of pride. Wherever Zimbabwean students go, they perform very well, we have that record across the world.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the scholarships were a testament to the cordial relations between Harare and Algiers.\n\nZimbabwe and Algeria have a longstanding relationship that continues to deepen. We have consolidated our relations and this is why we have this offer because our relationship is strengthening and is becoming more and more comprehensive.\n\nI wish to congratulate you students on your study assignment in Algeria.\n\nWe have a very long standing relationship with Algeria and the students that have gone before you behaved very well and upheld the good relations between us (Zimbabwe and Algeria), he said.\n\nI hope you will not be the group that will spoil that relationshipif that happens, our prisons are not full.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa shared a lighter moment with the students.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa poses for a group photograph with Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Professor Amon Murwira (fourth from left), Algerian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mohamed Seoudi (fifth from right), his deputy Mohamed Mehdi (fourth from right), students leaving for Algeria on scholarship and their parents at State House in Harare yesterday.Picture: Kudakwashe Hunda.\n\nJust think of it as you are representing ED, its a tall order so you must always keep that in mind. As you represent us in foreign lands, you should know you are not representing yourself. You are representing us.\n\nAnd before you sleep, you should pray and say, I am representing ED so I must do my best, said the President light-heartedly.\n\n . . . when you come back here, its either I will give you a red carpet and congratulate you or you spend a few days behind bars for misrepresenting us.\n\nHe also encouraged the students to cherish the scholarship opportunity as it was not something to take for granted.\n\nSo as you go ahead, you must embrace every opportunity you find so that you can bring such experience back home for the benefit of developing our country. You are only very few.\n\nThe students in this country of your age, with your qualifications, are so many, but you have been found fit to take up this challenge.\n\nYou have been given guidance byyour parents that you will not be representing your families but Zimbabwe, the President said.\n\nAs beneficiaries of the cordial relations between Zimbabwe and Algeria, President Mnangagwa encouraged the students to hoist the countrys flag high as this would see more scholarship opportunities being availed.\n\nYou see, these scholarships are a testament to the relationship between Zimbabwe and Algeria.\n\nIf you carry yourself in high esteem during your time there we will certainly get more scholarships because of our good mannerisms. If you do not represent us well then they will just reduce the number, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa also had some words for the students parents and guardians who were present during the send-off.\n\nTo the parents, do not expect financial benefits while the children are in Algeria, these children are going to school so you are the ones who should actually send them money, he said.\n\nAlgerian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mohamed Seoudi said Zimbabwe was more than a friend to Algeria hence the continuous extension of scholarships.\n\nOur relations (with Zimbabwe) are going on excellently and what is better than the building of human resources? That is why Algeria is giving Zimbabwe more than 100 scholarships each year including these ones extended to the President from his brother (Algerian President).\n\nLike the President says, nyika inovakwa nevene vayo. Algeria is very committed to countries on the African continent like Zimbabwe who are more than friends to us, he said.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries, Natasha Deni, said she was elated to have been accorded the scholarship.\n\nI am 20 and I was overjoyed, excited and most of all grateful to God for awarding me this opportunity and also to the President for this scholarship opportunity, she said.\n\nAnother student, Melogina Mano, said she was grateful for the opportunity.\n\nI am very happy because this is not an opportunity accorded to many, she said.\n\n",

We know that decentralisation and devolution are part of the revolution that the Second Republic has put in motion and ensured that it becomes a success story, he said.\n\nDr Muswere said through decentralisation, Manicaland had hosted Independence Day celebrations in Murambinda, Buhera.\n\nAdv Mugadza said the opening of the Natpharm warehouse had addressed logistical challenges in the storage of medicines.\n\nWe are now able to safely store drugs and ensure their availability at our hospitals and clinics. We are also now in a position to store drugs coming through Beira, he said.\n\nManicaland Provincial Registrar Ms Joyce Munamati said their new offices would be completed in the first quarter of this year.\n\nThe construction of the building is expected to be complete by the end of the first quarter. The construction of the new offices is being donein line with the devolution policy and President Mnangagwas mantra of leaving no one and no place behind, she said.\n\nCurrently, the Registry is operating from wooden cabins, with some Mutare residents travelling toMarondera or Chipinge to obtain identity documents.\n\nAllied Timbers chief operations officer, Mr Ian Zimunya, said their operations had benefitted from equipment procured from Belarus.\n\nWe are now operating at between 80 and 85 percent through equipment procured from Belarus, he said.\n\nAt GMB, Engineer Willard Chirunga said they expect to complete the first silo before the end of the year.\n\nWe hope to complete the foundation works by April and install the prefabricated materials by October, he said.\n\n",

We are now taking action. Yesterday, we met with our investors to refine our tripartite partnership.\n\nMinister Garwe indicated that the Ministry and the City of Harare are taking decisive steps, as directed by President Mnangagwa, to deliver world-class services to residents by 2030.\n\nHe reassured the public that while technology may raise concerns about increased rates, it could actually lower delivery costs, aiming for globally effective solutions that ensure affordability.\n\nWhile technology often raises concerns about increased rates, we want to reassure the public that it can actually lower delivery costs. Our goal is to implement globally effective technology that ensures affordable, world-class services for everyone, said Minister Garwe.\n\nHarare Mayor Councillor Jacob Mafume highlighted the necessity of collaboration for the development of the capital city.\n\nA capital city cannot be built by the city alone; it requires the support of central Government and the private sector.\n\nHe drew parallels with successful cities like Kigali in Rwanda and New Cairo in Egypt, underscoring the importance of synergies in meeting citizens needs and emphasising that water and sewage services transcend political affiliations.\n\nCities we admire, like Kigali and New Cairo, were built through collaboration between municipalities and central Governments. We see no contradiction in working together to align with citizens needs.\n\nMr Clark Dai, deputy managing director of Hangzhou Laison Technology, expressed enthusiasm for the project, saying their smart water management system will serve as a benchmark not only for Harare but for Southern Africa.\n\nWe have developed a reliable, practical, and advanced system aimed at improving efficiency and addressing the challenges of non-buried water, he said.\n\nMr Brendon Jere, chief executive officer of Helcraw Electrical, said the water plant, distribution, and billing system are part of a comprehensive plan to ensure water reaches all residents of Harare sustainably and intelligently.\n\nThis initiative signifies a collaborative effort to tackle critical water supply challenges in Harare, with the new water treatment plant expected to set a standard for similar projects across Southern Africa.\n\n",

            "content": "Precious Manomano-Herald Reporter\n\nSmallholder farmers are essential to the nations agricultural production, playing a critical role in driving economic growth and expanding export opportunities, Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development Permanent Secretary Professor Obert Jiri has said.\n\nThe farmers cultivate 1,4 million hectares of maize, representing approximately 70 percent of the grain marketed in the country.\n\nSmallholder farmers are not just participants in agriculture, they are the backbone of our agricultural sector. The contributions of smallholder farmers extend well beyond maize, he said.\n\nThey account for over 60 percent of the nations wheat output and have been instrumental in revitalising the tobacco sector, which has historically been a cornerstone of Zimbabwes economy.\n\nProf Jiri said Government prioritises programmes tailored specifically to support smallholder farmers, who manage smaller plots yet produce significant yields.\n\nThe success we are witnessing in the tobacco industry is largely driven by small-scale farmers who manage smaller plots of land, he said.\n\nOne of the key initiatives supporting these farmers is the Tobacco Transformation Plan, which aims for a production target of 300 million kilogrammes.\n\nLast seasons drought posed challenges, limiting yields to 236 million kilogrammes.\n\nHowever, this season shows promising signs of recovery, with an increase in both irrigated and dryland tobacco production.\n\nProf Jiri expressed optimism following good rains.\n\nWith the right conditions, we can achieve close to our 300 million kilogrammes target this season, he said.\n\nTo further support rain-fed farmers, the planting season for dryland tobacco has been extended to ensure that farmers relying on rainfall can still plant their crops.\n\nThis extension is crucial in helping farmers adapt to changing climate conditions, allowing them to mitigate risks associated with drought and inconsistent weather patterns.\n\nHe said the emphasis on processing tobacco into finished products, such as cigarettes, is also vital for enhancing agricultural profitability.\n\nThe total revenue generated from tobacco exceeds US$60 billion, with farmers benefiting around US$1 billion of that.\n\nWe must focus on establishing these value-added industries to enhance our agricultural profitability, he said.\n\nThe Governments commitment to value addition does not stop with tobacco. Similar strategies are being advocated for other agricultural sectors, such as cotton.\n\nProf Jiri said there is need to process raw lint into clothing products instead of exporting it unprocessed, saying the approach aims to create jobs and boost local industries, ultimately strengthening the agricultural sector.\n\nSmallholder farmers are also making strides with other crops. This season, they have planted 1,7 million hectares of maize out of a targeted 1,8 million hectares, with encouragement to utilise short-duration varieties for better yields.\n\nTraditional grains are projected to exceed their target of 500 000 hectares, reflecting the farmers adaptability and commitment to diversifying their production.\n\nProf Jiri highlighted that the success of smallholder farmers is not only crucial for meeting local food demands, but also for enhancing Zimbabwes export capacity.\n\nWhen we empower our smallholder farmers, we are not just feeding our nation; we are also positioning ourselves in the global market, he stated.\n\nFurthermore, the Government is working to provide better input packages for cotton farmers to ensure they achieve viable yields.\n\nThis, he said, is essential for farmers to earn a good price at auction markets when they export their products.\n\n",

So, they shouldnt deworm their livestock if they have poor blood conditions. We encourage farmers to deworm animals with a blood condition of 3 and above, he said.\n\nTo combat the expected rise in foodborne diseases, DVS will also increase inspections and certifications of abattoirs and milk processing plants to ensure the safety of animal-derived foods.\n\nThe department is committed to upscaling veterinary public health operations for beef and pork.\n\nDr Makaya further urged farmers to vaccinate their livestock against lumpy skin disease and take preventive measures against soil-borne diseases like blackleg and anthrax.\n\nHe highlighted the critical role of regular dipping, encouraging farmers to dip their animals weekly as advised by extension staff to mitigate the prevalence of tick-borne diseases.\n\nWith these comprehensive measures in place, the Government aims to support farmers in safeguarding their livestock and tackling the challenges posed by the rainy season, to boost the health and productivity of the livestock industry during this critical period.\n\n",

            "content": "THE opposition-led unrest in Mozambique has spawned disruptions and delays on transport routes and energy exports to neighbouring countries. It needs to stop now.\n\nSADC, as it does once the election process is over and the relevant national courts have considered all electoral petitions and objections and made their final ruling, has endorsed the election.\n\nMozambiques neighbours have held firmly to the position that the people of Mozambique have spoken and had the wishes of the majority confirmed.\n\nBut despite exhausting all channels to first contest the election and then the results, the opposition and groups of its supporters have still refused to accept the outcome and the fact that they were out-voted and lost.\n\nMost of the unrest is in the major cities of Maputo and in particular Beira and surrounding areas. This is why neighbours, and especially Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi, who rely on these major ports for so much of their trade, have been hit hard.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa, the SADC chairperson, last month congratulated incoming President Daniel Chapo and his Frelimo party on their victory, carefully waiting until the Mozambican courts had dealt with all objections since the winners could not be confirmed until all processes had been completed.\n\nThe SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security this week held an Extraordinary Summit, with all three Presidents who sit on it governing countries that directly border Mozambique, so having special interest in a return to peace in that country.\n\nPresident Samia Suluhu Hassan of Tanzania chaired the meeting attended by President Hakainde Hichilema of Zambia and President Lazarus Chakwera of Malawi.\n\nThe Troika had exceptionally detailed interest in resolving the dispute.\n\nThere has been a tendency among some opposition parties losing elections in the SADC region to seek support from neighbouring countries, especially those where a previous opposition leader has won an election recently and become the new President.\n\nIf the Mozambican opposition were hoping this route would work they were disappointed. Both President Chakwera in 2020 and President Hichilema in 2022 defeated the previous incumbents in their countries. But both are firm believers in the rule of law and the right of voters to choose and so have endorsed the Mozambican elections along with the rest of the region.\n\nSADC countries do not dictate who wins elections and who loses. They accept the final results, the ones confirmed by the national courts. These nations are perfectly aware that sometimes the incumbent wins and sometimes the opposition wins. It all depends on the voters. And sometimes, as was seen in Malawi, a former ruling party returns to power after a spell on the opposition benches. We are all democracies.\n\nThe Troika made it clear that the violence must cease and the regional trade routes allowed to function properly. But they were then prepared to mobilise the Panel of Elders, with the ministerial committee of the Troika, to help the Mozambican Government and opposition move away from the present confrontation.\n\nThis has been effective in other countries in the past, with the Elders largely getting the losers to accept their loss, but then making sure that the winners are extra careful not to trample on anyones rights. However, this is not actually a problem in modern SADC since the opposition has always continued to function and been able to contest elections with their full rights.\n\nA lot of the work of such panels is to help provide neutral ground for discussions and make suggestions where this might be useful to keep people talking, since SADC is not going to overturn modern elections, but is entitled to help all groups in a country at least work together on essentials.\n\nBoth SADC with President Mnangagwas earlier statement and now the Troika have called upon Mozambicans to accept the results.\n\nThe opposition has exhausted all legal routes and so needs to calm its supporters and stop the violence.\n\nAfter this weeks Troika meeting, Dr Hassan highlighted that the region could not ignore the crisis in Mozambique, especially when it affected the socio-economic fabric of the entire region.\n\nPresident Hichilema also stressed the need for the whole of SADC to support collective action to restore peace and security, and highlighted the damage that the Mozambique unrest was causing, especially with immediate neighbours.\n\nWhen the Mozambican courts ruled that the elections in October were valid and that incoming President Chapo won the Presidency and Frelimo won the parliamentary elections, both by a significant margin, it was not some sort of instant decision.\n\nThe legal processes and then the court hearings and the court discussions took two months, since the courts had to plough through the many objections made by the main opposition party and consider what was said.\n\nSometimes this happens in a democracy but when it does there must still be a final result, or at least a final decision, and that has now happened in Mozambique.\n\nOpposition leader Venancio Mondlane, who returned to Maputo from exile yesterday, must stop pandering to the whims and caprices of foreign handlers and put his country first.\n\nHis presence in Mozambique must not inflame tensions and stoke the embers of violence as the country needs to move forward in peace and harmony.\n\n",
