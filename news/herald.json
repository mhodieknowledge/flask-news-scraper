            "content": "Farirai Machivenyika and Wallace Ruzvidzo\n\nAll ministries should ensure that business does not suffer from prohibitive regulations as well as punitive administrative licences and fees, President Mnangagwa has said.\n\nIn his address at the First Meeting of the 2025 Cabinet Year on Tuesday, the President said instead of being restrictive, fees, licences, permits and regulations should promote economic development.\n\nTo enhance the overall performance of our economy, the Ease of Doing Business Agenda continues to be an important aspect of our programming.\n\nIn that regard, concerted efforts must be made to revisit all the areas that hinder the start or growth of all investments, whether local or foreign.\n\nI commend the entrepreneurial spirit among our people. By nature, Zimbabweans are hardworking, he said.\n\nTowards that end, Parliaments Portfolio Committee on Industry and Commerce yesterday convened to discuss the challenges faced by manufacturers and retailers in the formal sectors.\n\nConfederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) chief economist, Dr Cornelius Dube, said there was need for legislation requiring Government ministries, departments and agencies to procure a specific percentage of their goods and services from local suppliers to boost the economy.\n\nGovernment should come up with legislation or a statutory instrument that compels it to buy a prescribed threshold for its goods and services from local suppliers, he said.\n\nDr Dube argued that this measure would enhance competitiveness and boost demand for local products.\n\nConfederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) president Mr Denford Mutashu highlighted the unfair competition posed by informal traders.\n\nThere are a lot of regulations and cost centres that we are facing as formal traders that those in the informal sectors are not paying. This makes our prices uncompetitive.\n\nThe closure of formal businesses could negatively impact other sectors, such as banking and finance, due to a decline in deposits, he said.\n\nIn her presentation, chief executive officer of the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) Ms Rosemary Mpofu-Chikarakara stressed the importance of addressing exchange rate discrepancies, foreign exchange shortages, and market distortions that encourage arbitrage.\n\nThe CCZ also wants smuggling stopped.\n\nIssues of porous border posts also need to be seriously dealt with and punitive (and) deterrent measures such as jail terms need to be introduced in order to curb these challenges.\n\nGovernment and the affected businesses can partner and aggressively invest and deploy advanced monitoring technologies, including drones, CCTV, and automated scanning systems, at all major border posts.\n\nAll imported products should abide by the rules, with no exemptions of who is importing. As long as there are other importers who are exempted from paying duty, loopholes will always be created and these products will then find their way both in the formal and informal market, creating an unfair playing field with the businesses that pay duties, the CCZ said.\n\nPortfolio Committee chairperson Cde Clemence Chiduwa acknowledged the concerns raised at the meeting.\n\nWe have taken note of the presentations and we will compile a report that we will table in the House for debate, he said.\n\nThe Committee aims to find viable solutions to support the local industry and create a fair competitive environment.\n\nThe Government and the Reserve Bank have taken taken steps to formalise the informal sector as part of broader measures outlined in the 2025 Monetary Policy Statement announced last Thursday, aimed at enhancing Government tax revenues and stabilising the economy.\n\nA week earlier, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Professor Mthuli Ncube announced measures to rein the burgeoning informal sector that was threatening the survival of formal businesses.\n\nThe RBZ Monetary Policy emphasises the need for both the informal and formal sectors to align, creating a more cohesive economic environment.\n\nRBZ Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu is advocating for the integration of informal businesses into a system that includes dual currencies, bank accounts, and electronic payments, which is essential for achieving the Governments economic goals.\n\nUnder the new regulations, items on a list of commonly smuggled goods will be presumed smuggled unless merchants can provide valid customs clearance.\n\nThis initiative places pressure on businesses to ensure compliance and legitimacy in their operations.\n\nGovernment will implement a presumptive retail-level VAT that manufacturers must collect when selling to small or informal businesses lacking tax clearance certificates.\n\nThis measure restricts wholesalers from engaging with unlicensed entities, further pushing informal businesses towards formalisation.\n\n",

It is pleasing that the Aero India show continues to grow in scope offering us great opportunities to witness the latest innovations and technologies in the aviation and defence industry. Military technology is indeed increasingly becoming integral to global peace and security given the non-traditional threats that are bedevilling our globe, said Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri.\n\nIt is pleasing that the conclave is coming at a time when India-Africa relations are growing from strength to strength as demonstrated by the continued participation of African countries at this event, she said.\n\nOur meeting is taking place on the backdrop of a shifting geopolitical environment and the rise in conflicts in many parts of the world, mainly in the Middle East and parts of Africa, said Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri.\n\nShe highlighted that these catastrophes confronting the world, were reversing the gains that have been made in the attainment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, thereby exposing vulnerable groups.\n\nThe global peace and security environment is being made more complex by the increasing recurrence of natural disasters with most emanating from climate change, she said.\n\nThis is rolling back socio-economic achievements made in recent years towards the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals and are impacting the vulnerable most, that is women, children, the disabled and the elderly, she added.\n\nMinister Muchinguri-Kashiri said recurring droughts owing to the adverse effects of climate change were increasing vulnerability among people.\n\nThese unwelcome developments require the defence forces to think outside the box.\n\nIn recent years, Southern Africa, in particular, has experienced severe droughts and flooding caused by cyclones. During the 2023-2024 rain season, the region experienced the worst drought in living memory.\n\nThe current season experienced floods that destroyed some parts of our region. This development prompted members of the defence forces to be increasingly involved in national and regional disaster preparedness mechanisms, and this calls for the modernisation and redesigning of our defence forces.\n\nThis new phenomenon requires mutual bilateral and multilateral cooperation for us to exchange experiences and best practices, she said. Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri lauded the India-Africa relations that were facilitating economic growth through forums like the BRICS+.\n\nIndia has been increasingly investing in Africa and also leading in the opening of markets for African goods and services, and in addition, continues to avail fair credit lines through its membership of the BRICS.\n\nTrade relations between the Republic of India and Africa are underpinned by diverse economic engagements with both governments and the private sector. As a result, trade between India and Africa continues to grow, making India our Africas third largest trading partner, after China and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri signed a memorandum of understanding on behalf of the Government with Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.\n\n",

This was driven by expectations of the Federal Reserve pausing its interest rate hikes, further weakening the dollar.\n\nContinuing geopolitical risks and golds growing attractiveness as a safe-haven asset also contributed.\n\nGlobal gold prices have remained steady in early 2025, maintaining the upward trajectory of recent years.\n\nThe gold coins are sold through the Reserve Bank and its subsidiaries, Fidelity Gold Refinery and Aurex. The coins can also be traded through local commercial banks and selected international banking partners.\n\n",

Because, you know, what I experienced in some organisations, there are plenty of nice ideas, and words, but the reality is not there.\n\nAnd when speaking about respect, they are introducing other ideological elements, they are even confusing the people and introducing other problems, he said.\n\nHe further thanked the First Lady for her programmes aimed at grooming todays youth saying that children needed to be raised properly and shown the correct path.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa exchange gifts with Vatican Ambassador Archbishop Janusz Urbanczyk, the Apostolic Nuncio to Zimbabwe at Zimbabwe House on Tuesday.  Pictures: John Manzongo\n\nThe ambassador had the privilege of touring the National Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Call Centre in the Office of the First Lady where victims of violence are assisted and linked to relevant organisations depending on their needs.\n\nThe 575 helpline is the brainchild of Amai Mnangagwa, who has taken the bull by its horns and pledged to curb domestic violence.\n\nThe ambassador showered praises on the First Lady for establishing the GBV call centre to end violence.\n\nViolence is always negative and it destroys families, destroying the normal situation. So, we must understand and try to help the weaker part. Women are always weaker and we must respect them and we must pay tribute, so it is important to have a Centre like this one to address domestic violence and violence against children. This is a place where we can collect data and completely help victims of gender-based violence, he said.\n\nCommenting on his meeting with the mother of the nation, the ambassador said: It was for me a great joy that I was able to come to see and greet personally the hardworking First Lady.\n\nRecognising her for all this work that she has been doing and continues doing for the country and trying to address the concerns of the people mainly women and children.\n\nEarlier, during the meeting, the ambassador told the First Lady his willingness to learn Shona and achieve a high degree of proficiency in it.\n\nHe said he was settling well in the country.\n\nIve been here for just over nine months, so its not that long since I came to stay here. I have been here for a short time and its my desire to stay here longer. I would like to learn Shona, he said.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa interacts with Vatican Ambassador Archbishop Janusz Urbanczyk, the Apostolic Nuncio to Zimbabwe during a courtesy call at Zimbabwe House on Tuesday\n\nDr Mnangagwa responded by saying, Shona is so simple and that will be very good for you because you will be able now to communicate with everybody even with those in rural areas.\n\nThe First Lady warmly welcomed Archbishop Janusz Urbancyzk.\n\nI welcome you with a warm heart that your appointment to come here to work with us is very important for the whole country and myself as Amai, as a mother I feel greatly honoured that you have come to see me which is very important. In every given family, the mother is the first person to see at home because she is always there looking after the family. I welcome you on behalf of Zimbabwe. I know you have met so many people in Government, but on my part here I thank you very much. I am so humbled, Dr Mnangagwa said.\n\nThe ambassador gave a brief background about his family, including the fact that he is the only boy in a family of five.\n\nThank you and I agree wholly with you about the importance of a mother. Imagine that in my family, we are five siblings but I am the only boy.\n\nMy older sisters took care of me, so I was raised alongside my sisters. I did all the work, and house chores as a boy and I would not fail to do something because I am a boy. My sisters would make sure I even cleaned the house. I would do all kinds of work in the house just like my sisters, he said.\n\nThe First Lady said she was working along the same lines to ensure both girls and boys knew all tasks around the home.\n\nThat is what we are now also training our children here, the boy child and the girl child that you should do the same because when you grow up you have to know all these chores because when you come of age you will lead your family, but the background is very important.\n\nBut your sisters were looking after you showing motherly care and they were protecting you, also teaching you that life goes this way. We have time to do that in our country as well, that all the work that is done at home every child must do, she said.\n\nThe ambassador said it was critical for children to be groomed and shown the correct path, including on dressing for their own benefit in the future.\n\nInstilling the correct values in children, he said, helps them stay away from drugs and other harmful activities.\n\nSpeaking on the respect of women, the ambassador said equality was fundamental.\n\nIn some countries that I worked in, they are speaking, discussing womens equality and empowerment but they are not respecting seriously the importance of women, the role of the women in the family, in the society and the country. Countries must maintain peace and shun war because the weaker ones, women, suffer the most. I am happy that it is a different situation in Zimbabwe as women here are being empowered and there is gender equality, he said.\n\nThe First Lady weighed in saying indeed it was important to recognise women.\n\nShe concurred with the ambassador that in times of war, it is women and children who bear the brunt.\n\nAll that women need is respect and to be empowered, so that they fend for their children, the husband being there or not, she needs to be empowered to look after her family. So, if there is no respect, there is no empowerment to talk about, the First Lady said.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-government-pro-business-for-all-enterprises/",
            "content": "The Second Republic has been committed to making sure Zimbabwe has a pro-business environment for everyone, and that means for large firms and for micro, small and medium businesses, with all sectors able to grow and flourish.\n\nThe Cabinet stressed this pro-business stance this week and is committed to creating a friendly environment, but one where all enterprises are registered and licensed and all who should be paying taxes are compliant.\n\nIt is important to note, in light of some of the statements from some in the formal business sector, that the Government is not playing favourites.\n\nIts policy is to see high rates of economic growth led by the private sector, but is not particularly concerned over who in the private sector is leading the growth.\n\nIt is not going to rescue inefficient businesses or those that are losing out to competition.\n\nIf a business closes then perhaps someone better will agree to buy the assets, otherwise new businesses and more successful competitors will move into the gap and growth still moves forward and new jobs are still being created.\n\nWhile formalisation of the present informal sections of the economy will help larger formal businesses by levelling the competition playing field, the prime reason for the Governments formalisation drive has been to make sure that all businesses are licensed, have registered with Zimra and are paying whatever taxes might fall due.\n\nNot only will the measures increase tax revenue, and although each micro or small business might not pay very much, and some people operating as a single trader will still see all their profit inside the zero percent tax bracket, the combined tax payments from so many tens of thousands of small businesses will add a noticeable sum to the tax revenue.\n\nThe Reserve Bank is keen to see all businesses using electronic money, ending so many problems that seem to rise when banknotes only are used, from tax evasion to smuggling out capital sums. Hence the new requirement that all businesses must have a point-of-sale machine able to use ZiG and foreign currency and must have a bank  account.\n\nThe small business sector, where so many of these informal businesses are located, seems to be badly represented by the main organisations representing organised formal industry and all aspects of commerce. And as they find themselves being formalised they need to find their voice as well.\n\nFor a start, business licences need to bear some relationship to the size of the concern.\n\nSmall businesses in small premises should not be paying as much as a huge supermarket branch, for example.\n\nModern databases and other technology offer easy ways of having a something approaching a graduated set of fees for business licences.\n\nWith so many not buying licences in the first place, this has not really been as issue.\n\nAs the formalisation enforcement proceeds, someone needs to be making sure the voices of the little businesses are heard as the voices of the large businesses are already being heard.\n\nThe tax law seems to be far better aligned to making sure that each type of taxpayer is covered and can submit taxes without too much difficulty.\n\nTiny undertakings are permitted to keep fairly simple accounts, nothing much more than lists of payments in and payments out, so the basic profit, on which tax is paid, can be calculated.\n\nAs the business grows the accounts need to become more complex, but few in the informal sector have yet reached the stage of having to register for VAT and calculate and pay this tax in two currencies. By that stage, these businesses will be large enough to need a properly qualified bookkeeper to keep track of everything.\n\nThe Cabinet this week confirmed that while it wants small businesses formalised, these enterprises are included in its business friendly policies, sometimes with extra benefits. The Government is trying to fill gaps such as the micro finance and small-scale loans many small businesses need, and where the formal banking sector is not really responsive.\n\nThe new Mbare Musika, temporary as it is, is a clear demonstration of the Government policy of moving the pro-business stance and support right the way down to the smallest entities and making sure they have the facilities and environment, including secure space without extortion, to conduct their trade.\n\nComplaints from the formal sector are sometimes justified, such as the problem in some sectors of the need for multiple licensing, rather than having just one simple licence, and sometimes falling under multiple sets of regulations.\n\nThe Government is committed to making it easier to do business and in these sort of cases it should be possible to eliminate over-complex regulation, or at least simplify the regulations so they are all in one place and are easy to understand.\n\nBut established and formal businesses need to remember that no one is promising success to every business, although all are wished well, and there is no guarantee of eternal life in the business world. Companies come and go, and in the end what matters in the end is the growth of business and thus of the economy.\n\nWe also see new types of business enter the economy. For just one example, at the turn of the century running a phone shop was quite a good small business.\n\nThey disappeared as mobile phones proliferated, and now we have hundreds of small businesses selling and repairing phones.\n\nThe loss of the phone shops was covered many times by the new businesses.\n\n",

            "content": "Crime Reporter\n\nPolice have launched a manhunt for controversial war veteran Cde Blessed Runesu Geza in connection with four criminal charges, including that of undermining the authority of the President.\n\nThe accused has been holding Press conferences attacking the President.\n\nIn a statement, national police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi warned that anyone who could be hiding the suspect or assisting him to evade police will be liable for arrest and subsequent prosecution.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police is seeking information on the location and subsequent questioning of a suspect, Blessed Geza Runesu, alias Bombshell. The suspect is facing four counts of criminal charges as outlined; theft allegations as defined in Section 113 of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, Chapter 9 23, he said.\n\nComm Nyathi said Cde Geza is also facing two counts of contravening Section 33 (2) (a) (ii) of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, Chapter 9: 23, that is Undermining the Authority of or Insulting the President.\n\nHe is also facing another count of contravening Section 187 of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, Chapter 9:23, that is Incitement to commit public violence. The Zimbabwe Republic Police reiterates that anyone who is harbouring the suspect or assisting him to evade police questioning will be equally liable for arrest and subsequent prosecution.\n\nAnyone with information should contact the National Complaints Desk on telephone number (0242) 703631 or WhatsApp on 0712 800197, Comm Nyathi said.\n\nAccording to reports, Cde Geza, riding on his political clout, reportedly invaded Harare Safari Lodge in 2020, stripped it of assets like cars and kicked out employees of the former owner, Mr Brett Allan McDonald.\n\nNow, Cde Geza finds himself facing a civil case after allegedly refusing to pay US$1,5 million for Harare Safari Lodge, a property situated on the picturesque banks of Lake Chivero, which he purportedly acquired four years ago.\n\nCde Geza claims the land in question is State property, rendering it unsellable. The controversy stems from an agreement between Cde Geza and the lodges owner, Mr McDonald. Under the terms, Cde Geza was to buy Mr McDonalds entire shareholding in the resort for US$1,5 million, with payment stipulated to be made within two weeks.\n\nHowever, Cde Geza is accused of failing to honour the agreement, not paying a single cent since the deals conclusion.\n\nDespite his non-payment, Cde Geza is said to have moved onto the property, located on Mclliwane 21 Farm, without Mr McDonalds consent. He has reportedly taken up residence and is enjoying full use of the lodge.\n\nIn another cases, Cde Geza was also caught in a web of fraud, perjury, and corruption after he failed to pay US$1 250 000 for a piece of land in Harare and is now hounding prosecutors and police officers involved in the case through open intimidation and harassment.\n\nSeveral prosecutors and police officers have opted out of the case after receiving death threats from the renegade and controversial war veteran, who is locked in a legal battle over the sale of a plot in Harare with former ARDA chairman Mr Basil Nyabadza.\n\nAccording to documents gleaned from court records, in 2020 Cde Geza and Cde Nyabadza entered into a deal for the sale of a portion of land on Plot 5 Spitzkop Harare, for US$1 362 000.\n\nCde Geza made staggered payments totalling US$112 000, and made a commitment that the balance, totalling US$1 250 000 would be paid before October 2021.\n\nConcomitantly, he made an undertaking that he would pay US$100 000 as cash deposit, in instalments of US$25 000, that were to be paid on November 19, 2020, December 10, 2020, December 31, 2020 and January 21, 2021.\n\nDespite making the commitments, Cde Geza did not make any, but then lied under oath that he had settled his debts with Mr Nyabadza.\n\n",

Former South African President Jacob Zumas party, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), has filed a complaint against white Afrikaner minority group AfriForum, accusing it of treason after US President Donald Trump cut aid to the country over a controversial new law.\n\nThe opposition MK Party announced the move claiming AfriForum has deliberately lobbied foreign powers to undermine South Africas sovereignty and economic interests.\n\nTheir betrayal is nothing less than an act of economic sabotage, a direct assault on our nations independence and a dangerous attempt to undermine the will of the people, the party said in a statement.\n\nLast week, Trump ordered a halt to any financial assistance to South Africa, citing an expropriation law Pretoria has passed to address racial disparities in land ownership and its genocide case against US ally Israel.\n\nThe US president accused Pretoria of shocking disregard of its citizens rights and alleged that newly adopted legislation allows the government to confiscate agricultural property from Afrikaners without compensation.\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa has rejected the claims, insisting that his government has not confiscated any land.\n\nAfrikaners are descendants of European colonists, mostly from the Netherlands, who arrived in what would become modern South Africa in the 17th century.\n\nAfricas most advanced economy extended voting rights to all adults in 1994 and ended decades of apartheid, but white farmers still own the majority of land in the country.\n\nPretoria has set a target of transferring 30 percent of farmland to black farmers by 2030.\n\nAfriForum has lobbied against the legislation in the US and through media campaigns, claiming it violates property rights.\n\nOn February 3, the non-profit group warned that it will ask Washington to impose sanctions on Ramaphosa and members of his party, the African National Congress (ANC), instead of punishing South Africas residents.\n\nOn Monday, the MK party, a member of the Progressive Caucus, an alliance that opposes Ramaphosas Government of National Unity (GNU) in parliament, referred to AfriForum as an enemy of the South African people.\n\nTheir latest act of treachery  lobbying the US government to impose punitive economic measures on South Africa  is a deliberate attempt to weaken our state through external pressure, MK stated.\n\nAfriForum has a long and disgraceful history of opposing South Africas democratic transformation, shielding the racist economic interests of the privileged European settler elite while disregarding the suffering of the oppressed majority, it added.\n\nThe party  whose leader Zuma is already at odds with the ANC following his expulsion for leading the MK in last years elections  says it submitted a case against AfriForum at Cape Towns central police station.\n\nIn response, AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel called the charges absurd.\n\nFalse allegations that AfriForum has spread misleading information about the Expropriation Act and that this is the reason for the US action against South Africa are blatant lies, he said.\n\nAfriForum, a non-profit civil rights organisation founded in 2006, was created to call up Afrikaners to participate in public debate and actions outside of the sphere of party politics, according to their web-site.

The EU is unable to fulfill Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenskys request for 200,000 peacekeepers to enforce a potential ceasefire with Russia, a senior bloc official told New York Times officials in an article published on Tuesday.\n\nZelensky has advocated for a substantial European peacekeeping force of some 200,000 troops to uphold a potential ceasefire and deter future Russian offensives.\n\nAnalysts cited by the New York Times consider this figure unattainable, noting that deploying even 40,000 troops would be challenging and could still fall short of providing an effective solution.\n\nA senior European official said that the continent doesnt even have 200,000 troops to offer, and that any boots on the ground must have American support, especially faced with the worlds second-largest nuclear power, Russia, the NYT reported.\n\nIf not, they would be permanently vulnerable to Russian efforts to undermine the alliances political and military credibility.\n\nRecent reports by the Financial Times and Politico also indicate that while Kiev has publicly called for 200,000 peacekeepers, it realistically anticipates a deployment of 40,000 to 50,000 troops.\n\nThe outlets suggested that the lower figure is more feasible, though the EU would still face difficulties assembling a force.\n\nMoscow opposes the introduction of international peacekeepers in Ukraine. Russian officials have argued that the move could escalate tensions and complicate efforts to resolve the conflict.\n\nEarlier this week, Russian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia stated that any deployment of peacekeepers to Ukraine without Moscows consent would be illegal, warning that they would be considered legitimate targets.\n\nIn an interview, he called the rumors about the possible deployment of peacekeepers bizarre, noting that they cannot operate without a mandate from the UN Security Council, which Russia is a part of and where it holds the right of veto.\n\nRussia remains opposed to a freezing of the Ukraine conflict and the introduction of peacekeeping forces, insisting that the only way to resolve it is to address the root causes of the conflict.\n\nMoscow insists that Kiev must commit to permanent neutrality, demilitarisation, and denazification, while acknowledging the territorial realities on the ground.
