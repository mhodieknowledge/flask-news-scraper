After his release from prison, Cde Chigudu crossed into Zambia, reunited with his fellow comrades and resumed his duties and chores of the armed war of liberation.\n\nCde Chigudu was a principled cadre who served the ruling ZANU PF Party and the Government with unquestionable allegiance, loyalty and dedication, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa described him as a fountain of wisdom who offered wise counsel and advice in conducting both party and Government business, drawing from his vast experiences.\n\nOn behalf of the party, ZANU PF, Government, my family and on my behalf, I wish to express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the Chigudu Family on this sad loss.\n\nMay the family derive comfort from the contribution he made to this great nation. In recognition of his immense contribution to our nation, both before and after Independence, the ZANU PF Politburo agreed to accord him the status of national hero. May his dear soul rest in eternal peace, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nIn his message to mourners yesterday, Cde Mandiwanzira, who is also Nyanga South legislator, said there was unanimity among Politburo members when the issue of the hero status of Cde Chigudu came up for discussion.\n\nI have come here with a message from His Excellency, President Mnangagwa, who said he was deeply touched by the death of Cde Chigudu. He said Cde Chigudu ought to be conferred with the highest honour of a national hero owing to his contribution.\n\nWhen President Mnangagwa consulted his colleagues, there was unanimity that he deserved to be a national hero, said Cde Mandiwanzira.\n\nHe said Cde Chigudu remained principled and never wavered up until the end.\n\nUnlike cadres who made huge contributions but later deviated from the ethos of the liberation struggle, Cde Chigudu remained steadfast, said Cde Mandiwanzira.\n\nCde Chigudus brother, Mr Tafiramambo Chigudu, said the family felt humbled by the decision of the party and Government to confer their relative the highest honour.\n\nI want to thank the President, the party and the Government for the honour conferred on our relative.\n\nWe do not take this honour for granted because not every person is granted that honour. We are elated as a family, said Mr Chigudu.\n\nIn an interview, his widow, Mrs Ester Chigudu, described him as a loving husband and father.\n\nHe helped a lot of people in the family even within the extended family. His death is quite painful. He has been unwell for a long time, she said.\n\nHis daughter, Rudo, said her father was determined to see them prosper and do well in education.\n\nCde Chigudu was born on August 13, 1942. He had his early education at Chigudu School, Cyrene Mission and Harare Secondary School where he was expelled in 1964 because of his political activism.\n\nHe left the country in 1964 and went to Zambia under ZAPU. He then trained guerilla warfare in the Democratic Republic of Korea as a ZIPRA cadre.\n\nUpon his return he was deployed in the country as an intelligence officer. In May 1965, he was captured and detained in Gonakudzingwa, Gweru and finally Whawha.\n\nHe was in detention for 12 years and was released in 1977 and exiled. He went to the UK and was enrolled at Exeter University where he studied law between 1978 and 1981.\n\nOn coming home, he joined the civil service, first as under Secretary (Legal Affairs) Ministry of Transport from 1981. He was appointed Deputy Secretary for the Ministry of Home Affairs and then Permanent Secretary in the same Ministry from 1994 to 2004.\n\nHe later became Permanent Secretary for Mines and Mining Development from 2004 to 2005. He was then appointed Governor and Resident Minister of Manicaland in 2005 and retired in 2008.\n\nHe is the former ZANU PF provincial chairman of Manicaland and worked as a senior consultant under the United Nations Development Programme to structure the Ministry of Interior for South Sudan.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was farming in Makoni District.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Mrs Esther Chigudu and seven children.\n\nMourners are gathered at Number 9, Belsize Close, Northwood, Mount Pleasant in Harare.\n\n",

Congratulations, Mr President, he said.\n\nIn his 10 years of astute and steadfast service to our continent and the peoples of Africa, Dr Adesina has made us shift our perspectives towards the meaning of development finance. He reignited, among us, a new sense of hope and confidence in what we can achieve as an African people, leveraging on our resources.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa urged the youth and future generations to emulate the passion for Africas development exhibited by Dr Adesina.\n\nThe President appointed the AfDB chief as the Champion of Zimbabwes arrears clearance and debt resolution platform in 2022, a task he undertook with impeccable zeal and commitment.\n\nThis being his farewell year, I challenge current and future generations, the youth and women, to cherish the work of Dr Adesina and many other illustrious sons and daughters of Africa, as we work hard to realise a thriving and prosperous continent.\n\nThrough unity, hard honest work, innovation and resilience, we can realise a modern and industrialised Africa, that is truly food and energy secure, peaceful and independent.\n\nIn 2022, I was pleased to appoint Dr Adesina as the official Champion of the Zimbabwe Arrears Clearance and Debt Resolution process. He has undertaken this arduous task on behalf of my administration with impeccable zeal and commitment, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nAs the Champion of Zimbabwes arrears clearance and debt resolution process, Dr Adesina saw through constructive dialogue and the bringing together of all parties concerned. This has aided the Second Republic in deepening its engagement and re-engagement within the comity of nations.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe, as an agro-based economy, had benefitted immensely from Dr Adesinas agriculture credentials and mission to transform Africas rural farmlands into regions of prosperity.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Banks flagship, Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) was launched, delivering climate-smart and weather-resilient staple seeds to more than 40 million smallholder farmers across 30 countries on the continent.\n\nThis is set to see Africa produce an extra 120 million tonnes of food by the end of 2025, he said.\n\nUnder Dr Adesinas leadership, the continents premier development finance institution had grown into a global, award-winning brand.\n\nResultantly, the bank has become a reputable development finance partner of choice. Under his leadership, the African Development Bank Group has emerged as a global champion of inclusive green growth food security, climate-smart infrastructure, energy access for millions of Africans and financial innovation, he said.\n\nThe President went on to describe Dr Adesina as an iconic, true son of Africa.\n\nHaving known and interacted with Dr Adesina for many years, I applaud the numerous milestones he has achieved during his illustrious career.\n\nHe stands tall as one of the iconic and true sons of Africa, always advancing Africas cause and interests. Undoubtedly, his footprint and impact on Africa to realise its development aspirations will remain indelible\n\nMr President, Africa, and Zimbabwe, express their profound gratitude and thank you for your selfless, bold, decisive and dedicated service to our mother continent of Africa and her peoples.\n\nCongratulations once again, Your Excellency, Dr Adesina, for your exceptional leadership during your tenure at the helm of the African Development Bank. I wish you continued success in the years ahead, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nSince assuming the reins at the AfDB in 2015, Dr Adesina, a World Food Prize laureate, has been instrumental in attracting global investment, spearheading innovative development strategies, and consistently positioning Africa as a continent of immense potential and opportunity.\n\n",

            "content": "Zvamaida Murwira, Senior Reporter\n\nThe National Prosecuting Authority will issue the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) with prosecutorial certificates should they want to prosecute cases.\n\nFor the certificates to be issued, ZACC must be prepared to adhere to prosecutorial guidelines which include a separate prosecution team from the investigators doing the court work.\n\nIn an interview, Prosecutor General Justice Loice Matanda-Moyo said she believed in team work and had no problem with issuing prosecuting certificates to ZACC or any other competent authority.\n\nOver the years, ZACC has been saying it wanted prosecutorial powers as part of efforts to effectively deal with the corruption scourge in the country.\n\nThe investigating arm said the prosecution of cases was sometimes stalled at the NPA, an arm which is also seized with other crimes that might not be related to corruption.\n\nIn an interview this week, Justice Matanda-Moyo said she had no problem issuing prosecuting certificates to ZACC.\n\nIf they want to prosecute matters, they can approach me, I have got powers to issue prosecution certificates, as long as they have a set department which is different from investigations so that we do not have an outcry from the public to say the same person who is investigating is the same person prosecuting, said Justice Matanda-Moyo.\n\nSo I do not see any problem. Because as NPA, we do not hoard the right to prosecute.\n\nI believe in teamwork, so the more people we have on board, the better.\n\nAs long as they report to the Prosecutor General and are bound by our prosecutorial guidelines, follow the guidelines on how we prosecute matters and how we reach decisions on whether a matter can be prosecuted or a matter cannot be prosecuted.\n\nIt is simply a question of that distinction so that there will be no outcry. Personally I do not hold views against getting lawyers from ZACC to prosecute matters here at NPA.\n\nShe said as NPA, they sometimes prioritise crimes that might be prevalent at a given time such as armed robberies and murder and might focus on such crimes ahead of other crimes in their effort to make society safe.\n\nIf another arm, which might be competent in prosecuting crime comes forth, she said, there was nothing wrong with that.\n\nThere might be times when cases of armed robbery are prevalent like now or murder cases might be rife, so we might take a deliberate position to concentrate on such cases, said Justice Matanda-Moyo.\n\nZACC has in the past said it was keen to have prosecutorial powers conferred on it to speed up corruption cases.\n\nThey have also argued that they sometimes did not agree with decisions not to prosecute cases that would have been submitted to the NPA.\n\nZACC has said it was surprised to see prosecutions declined when in their view, they would have attended to all possible areas of the law.\n\nIt was on that basis that ZACC felt that it required prosecuting powers to help expedite cases and push them before courts of law.\n\nLately, the NPA and ZACC have been at loggerheads, after the former withdrew charges against Harare City Council Town Clerk Hosiah Chisango and four others over a $9 million street lights tender.\n\nZACC felt that Chisango and the five others have a case to answer and is now preparing new charges against them.\n\n",
