To this end, this past week saw my administration concretise the constitutionally enshrined obligation to give rights to every Zimbabwean citizen to hold and occupy agricultural land.\n\nHence, the bold decision to empower the beneficiaries of the Land Reform Programme through the issuance of Deeds of Transfer that will unlock the value of our land.\n\nThrough this historic act, these new tenure documents will be issued to the over 23 500 A2 and over 360 000 A1 farmers.\n\nThe celebration of this years Unity Day is, therefore, equally a jubilant occasion affirming that the land is now irreversibly with its people, and the people with their land, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nUnity, patriotism, peace, love and respect, he said, remain indispensable values in the countrys development matrix.\n\nTherefore, the President called on all citizens to commemorate the national Unity Day with sober reflections and recommit to the rich national heritage embodied in the historic accord of 1987.\n\nNever, never, never again, should anything ever divide us. United we must stand, strong and solid as the walls of Great Zimbabwe, from which we derive our nations name.\n\nHand in hand, in unity, from village to the provincial level; sector by sector and industry by industry, Vision 2030 shall surely become a reality, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe also wished the nation merry festivities, but implored everyone to exercise caution.\n\nAs we celebrate this important national holiday, let us do so responsibly and safely, especially for the travelling and commuting public.\n\nOn my own behalf, that of Government and indeed my family, I wish all fellow citizens, at home and abroad, a merry Christmas and a prosperous 2025.\n\nMay the new year ahead bring hope and greater prosperity for our motherland, Zimbabwe, President Mnangagwa said.\n\n",

In the same vein, may I take this opportunity to strongly warn parents and guardians who allow minors under the guise of merry making to partake in beer drinking orgies.\n\nAs the public embarks on various activities during this festive period, families, business persons and institutions should avoid carrying or keeping large sums of money at home or offices to curb robbery and other related violent criminal acts, Comm-Gen Matanga said.\n\nHe said police will also take action on those engaging in drug and substance abuse, adding that as the public celebrates the cross-over into the New Year, individuals, institutions and businesspersons must adhere to the provisions of the law on the use of fireworks, fire crackers and other gadgets that may disturb the safety and security of the people.\n\nAs required under the countrys laws, the use of fireworks should be notified to the local authorities and police well on time, Comm-Gen Matanga said.\n\n",

If we do that, we would have succeeded in climate-proofing our agriculture, said Prof Jiri.\n\nWriting on his X post, Prof Jiri said: Transforming Zimbabwe into a weather-independent food hub remains a core priority of the Ministry. On Monday, nine irrigation investment deals were finalised, marking a significant step towards achieving this critical goal.\n\nThis comes in the wake of the official opening of the National Irrigation Investment Conference by President Mnangagwa earlier this year, where after noting that the El Nino-drought has not spared Zimbabwe, he called for more targeted interventions to ensure that the country and Africa at large become food secure once again.\n\nIt is now urgent and imperative for us to think outside the box to de-risk our nation from the vagaries of climate change. Similarly, stakeholders and communities alike should accelerate the implementation and adoption of mechanisms to climate-proof our agriculture sector, beginning at the household level, he said.\n\nThe country secured over US$227 million in two investment deals for irrigation projects at the Zimbabwe Irrigation Investment Conference.\n\nAnother US$1.5 billion in funding was secured to develop major dams such as Musami Dam and the completion of the Gwayi-Shangani pipeline, among several other key infrastructure projects.\n\nThe concept is not so much centred on infrastructure but rather on what the water captured within that infrastructure is intended to do, President Mnangagwa stressed as he has led the country to adopt a new ethos and philosophy: a dam as an economy to accelerate economic development.\n\nThe dam as an economy philosophy has expanded the project scope to include dam construction, irrigation development, hydroelectricity generation, potable water and fisheries development as fundamental project tenets to accelerate rural development for the attainment of Vision 2030, aiming to elevate and improve livelihoods while leaving no one and no place behind.\n\nThe ambitious dam projects are expected to expand the countrys irrigated land from the current 217 000 hectares to 496 000 hectares in the present phase, guaranteeing national food security and resilience against climate change.\n\n",
