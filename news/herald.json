Nujoma served as Namibias first president between 1990 and 2005. He was among the last African remaining revolutionaries of his era. Mbumba said the Founding Father lived a long and consequential life during which he served the people of his beloved country. Nujoma heroically marshalled the Namibian people during the darkest hours of the liberation struggle until the attainment of freedom and independence from Apartheid South Africa on 21 March 1990.\n\nPresident Nangolo Mbumba hailed founding president Sam Nujoma as a visionary leader, who provided maximum leadership to the Namibian nation.\n\nAnnouncing Nujomas passing on Sunday morning, he said Nujoma did not only blaze the trail to freedom but also inspired Namibians to rise and become masters of this vast land of our ancestors\n\nDuring this period of national mourning, we should be comforted by the unmatched leadership and extraordinary contributions of President Nujoma to the liberation struggle, as well as the development and unity of the Namibian people, he remarked.\n\nMbumba conveyed his condolences to the Founding First Lady Kovambo Nujoma, labour minister Utoni Nujoma, the children, and the entire Nujoma and Kondombolo family.\n\nOur Founding Father heroically marshalled the Namibian people during the darkest hours of our liberation struggle until the attainment of freedom and independence on 21 March 1990, Mbumba said.\n\nNujoma passed on at the age of 95 on Saturday at 23h45 in Windhoek. The Namibian liberation hero led a protracted battle against Apartheid. He championed Namibias independence from colonial rule.\n\nAs head of Swapo between 1960 until 2007, Nujoma remained a stoic figure in Namibian history. He is highly revered for his unwavering stance through the countrys struggle for liberation.\n\nHe remained an influential figure in Namibian politics after independence, serving as the countrys first president for three terms between 1990 and 2005.\n\nA Pan-Africanist to the core, Nujoma remained one of Africas last greats, liberation heroes who sacrificed their youths to bring independence to their countries.\n\nThis includes the crop of Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Samora Machel of Mozambique, Nelson Mandela of South Africa, and Jos Eduardo dos Santos of Angola.\n\nA period of national mourning and burial arrangements are expected to be announced soon.

After his release from prison, Cde Chigudu crossed into Zambia, reunited with his fellow comrades and resumed his duties and chores of the armed war of liberation.\n\nCde Chigudu was a principled cadre who served the ruling ZANU PF Party and the Government with unquestionable allegiance, loyalty and dedication, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa described him as a fountain of wisdom who offered wise counsel and advice in conducting both party and Government business, drawing from his vast experiences.\n\nOn behalf of the party, ZANU PF, Government, my family and on my behalf, I wish to express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the Chigudu Family on this sad loss.\n\nMay the family derive comfort from the contribution he made to this great nation. In recognition of his immense contribution to our nation, both before and after Independence, the ZANU PF Politburo agreed to accord him the status of national hero. May his dear soul rest in eternal peace, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nIn his message to mourners yesterday, Cde Mandiwanzira, who is also Nyanga South legislator, said there was unanimity among Politburo members when the issue of the hero status of Cde Chigudu came up for discussion.\n\nI have come here with a message from His Excellency, President Mnangagwa, who said he was deeply touched by the death of Cde Chigudu. He said Cde Chigudu ought to be conferred with the highest honour of a national hero owing to his contribution.\n\nWhen President Mnangagwa consulted his colleagues, there was unanimity that he deserved to be a national hero, said Cde Mandiwanzira.\n\nHe said Cde Chigudu remained principled and never wavered up until the end.\n\nUnlike cadres who made huge contributions but later deviated from the ethos of the liberation struggle, Cde Chigudu remained steadfast, said Cde Mandiwanzira.\n\nCde Chigudus brother, Mr Tafiramambo Chigudu, said the family felt humbled by the decision of the party and Government to confer their relative the highest honour.\n\nI want to thank the President, the party and the Government for the honour conferred on our relative.\n\nWe do not take this honour for granted because not every person is granted that honour. We are elated as a family, said Mr Chigudu.\n\nIn an interview, his widow, Mrs Ester Chigudu, described him as a loving husband and father.\n\nHe helped a lot of people in the family even within the extended family. His death is quite painful. He has been unwell for a long time, she said.\n\nHis daughter, Rudo, said her father was determined to see them prosper and do well in education.\n\nCde Chigudu was born on August 13, 1942. He had his early education at Chigudu School, Cyrene Mission and Harare Secondary School where he was expelled in 1964 because of his political activism.\n\nHe left the country in 1964 and went to Zambia under ZAPU. He then trained guerilla warfare in the Democratic Republic of Korea as a ZIPRA cadre.\n\nUpon his return he was deployed in the country as an intelligence officer. In May 1965, he was captured and detained in Gonakudzingwa, Gweru and finally Whawha.\n\nHe was in detention for 12 years and was released in 1977 and exiled. He went to the UK and was enrolled at Exeter University where he studied law between 1978 and 1981.\n\nOn coming home, he joined the civil service, first as under Secretary (Legal Affairs) Ministry of Transport from 1981. He was appointed Deputy Secretary for the Ministry of Home Affairs and then Permanent Secretary in the same Ministry from 1994 to 2004.\n\nHe later became Permanent Secretary for Mines and Mining Development from 2004 to 2005. He was then appointed Governor and Resident Minister of Manicaland in 2005 and retired in 2008.\n\nHe is the former ZANU PF provincial chairman of Manicaland and worked as a senior consultant under the United Nations Development Programme to structure the Ministry of Interior for South Sudan.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was farming in Makoni District.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Mrs Esther Chigudu and seven children.\n\nMourners are gathered at Number 9, Belsize Close, Northwood, Mount Pleasant in Harare.\n\n",
