We also have to know that Zimbabwe is a democracy guided by the will of the people.\n\nSo, if the people say they want the Presidents term extended, so be it, thats what democracy is all about, he said.\n\nMinister Ziyambi said while President Mnangagwa had said he wanted to step down as required by the Constitution, the people who voted him into office have indicated that they want him to stay on.\n\nOnce the people who voted him into office have spoken, the necessary legal requirements will be put in place. What I can say is it is possible to make the necessary constitutional amendments, Minister Ziyambi added.\n\nLast year at its conference in Bulawayo, Zanu PF made a resolution that the Presidents term be extended so that he can see to fruition the various development projects he has initiated over the past fewyears.\n\nThe main opposition Citizens Coalition for Change has also thrown its weight behind the proposal to extend the Presidents term.\n\nSpeaking during a tour by Parliamentarians of the First Familys Pricabe Farm in Kwekwe at the weekend, leader of the opposition in Parliament, Mr Sengezo Tshabangu, said: If we approve your (President Mnangagwa) stay in power and the people of Zimbabwe are happy, let it be.\n\nMr Tshabangu said President Mnangagwa was leading by example in all areas, hence he must be supported.\n\nWe are Zimbabweans, we should be singing together, playing together, celebrating together. When I walk out of here (Pricabe Farm) I will face criticism and it does not matter because it improves us as Zimbabweans.\n\n. . . when we go to Parliament, I can assure you that we are going to unpack the blueprint to bring the people of Zimbabwe together. We need to coexist and live together, he said.\n\nAcross the country, all Zanu PF structures have voiced their support for President Mnangagwas term extension as he has delivered tangible results that resonate with the masses.\n\n",

The vision is not individualistic, it is a vision that the country has to focus on, Mr Mureriwa said.\n\nAnother political analyst, Dr Leopold Chakanyuka, said President Mnangagwa had ushered in a new era of political maturity in Zimbabwes political landscape.\n\nThe visit on Sunday by both Zanu PF and CCC Members of Parliament symbolises the highest level of political maturity that we have attained as a country.\n\nWe can unite where necessary and criticise where necessary, doing it constructively. The visit shows that as Zimbabweans we are pushing towards one common agenda which I think is very important, he said\n\nDr Chakanyuka commended the opposition for forgoing selfish political interests and choosing national development.\n\nWe need to appreciate the opposition for realising that we are Zimbabweans first before we become political parties, he said.\n\nIn his address to the Parliamentarians, President Mnangagwa urged opposition legislators to actively scrutinise and hold the ruling party Zanu PF Members of Parliament to account so that they deliver for the general citizenry.\n\nThe President said the opposition legislators should give their ruling party counterparts a hard time in Parliament to build and develop Zimbabwe.\n\nBecause of his open-door policy, another political analyst Mr Rutendo Matinyarare, said the President had successfully unified political parties in the country.\n\nThis, he said, would see all political players joining forces in the development of the country.\n\nI think that the President has been successfully able to bring unity to the political parties. He is breaking the polarisation that we have seen for many years in our country, uniting different political opponents to make them focus on the national interest and the one goal of building a better Zimbabwe.\n\nI would assume that, that is why some of the opposition members are saying let us hold on and hold off elections while we unite and build our country better to take us forward. I think that is very commendable, Mr Matinyarare said.\n\nHe said President Mnangagwa had demonstrated that he is a unifying leader by giving the legislators an opportunity to get a feel of his successful farming operation.\n\nI think the President has shown a very great sign of leadership. He is showing leadership in terms of farming, showing by example, what land in Zimbabwe is supposed to be used for, he said.\n\nFollowing his election victory last year, the President, in his inauguration speech, said: Now that elections are behind us, we must now focus on addressing the economic challenges facing our country.\n\n",

We embarked on this operation upon identifying a significant problem. It is a multi-phase initiative aimed at enforcing traffic laws. While we have made progress, there is still much work to be done. This operation is not limited to a specific timeframe; it will persist as long as violations occur, said Comm Dube.\n\nAnd so far, I can safely say a milestone has been achieved, though not happily expected. Sadly, I heard from social media that some were saying, the operation will run up to the 25th of January. May I inform the nation that this operation is there to stay. It is there to stay for as long as we have these violations that are taking place on the ground.\n\nHe expressed concern over reports of corrupt activities involving kombi crews and police officers, warning that the law would be enforced against anyone involved in such practices.\n\nOn his part, Comm Chikunguru reiterated the importance of the meeting, saying it provided an opportunity to update operators on police plans and collaborate to tackle existing challenges.\n\nFirstly, I would like to draw your attention to our ongoing operation against mushikashika. We are resolute in our determination to restore orderliness and sanity in the manner in which passengers are picked up and dropped off. Let me be clear: we will take a no-mercy stance against those who continue to disregard designated bus termini. I urge you all to comply with the regulations and use the designated bus termini to ensure your safety, he said.\n\nComm Chikunguru said they had intensified their traffic enforcement efforts in the city, with the primary focus to remove unroadworthy vehicles from the roads.\n\nThis means that all vehicles, including passenger transport vehicles, that are unfit for road use risk being impounded.\n\nWe urge you to ensure that your vehicles meet the required safety standards to avoid any disruptions to your operations.\n\nThirdly, I am compelled tocomment on the conduct of some of our drivers and conductors. Its alarming to note that some drivers engage in reckless behaviour, posing a significant threat to the safety of passengers and other road users. This behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.\n\nWe urge you to take immediate action to address this issue and ensure that your drivers and conductors adhere to the highest standards of professionalism and safety, Comm Chikunguru said.\n\nHe said the Police Service also has a zero tolerance to corruption and that the law will not spare anyone involved in such acts.\n\nComm Nyathi underscored the need for operators to obey traffic regulations and ensure their vehicles are properly registered.\n\nRepresenting transporters, Dr Nhanhanga said the meeting sought to find solutions to reduce road accidents and enhance safety.\n\nHe called for measures to curb rampant corruption on the roads, highlighting ongoing engagements with the Ministry of Transport to deploy law enforcement officers at bus terminuses for inspections.\n\nGHACO chairman Mr Katsvairo noted their associations discussions with Harare City Council regarding illegal pick-up points used by pirate taxis, which contribute to corruption.\n\n",

We have observed that all schools have their schemes of work in place. Lessons began promptly at 7:30am, and significant progress has been made. Teachers have also engaged in lesson planning, especially concerning the new heritage-based curriculum.\n\nHe was impressed with the level of planning, as teachers had integrated new teaching approaches, reflecting their hard work.\n\nMinister Moyo applauded the 2024 results at the schools he toured, with Shingai Primary School achieving 87 percent, Borrowdale Primary School 95 percent and Churchill High School attaining a 95 percent pass rate in their A-level results.\n\nHe urged schools to sustain their hard work and to focus not only on planning but also on cleanliness and adherence to standard operating procedures.\n\nIn light of the cholera outbreaks in Mashonaland Central, the Minister said it is essential to ensure that all schools have running water and protective measures to fight the disease.\n\nMinister Moyo said the ministry is going to launch investigations into schools that have been reported by parents for violating Governments Statutes.\n\nHead of Borrowdale Primary school, Mr Charles Chisekombwachevana, said the school is fully prepared, having started the implementation of the HBC last year with Grades ECD up to Grade 5 already learning it.\n\nHe said the only exception is Grade 7, which is continuing with last years curriculum.\n\nAs for teacher training on HBC, Mr Chisekombwachevana said most have been trained.\n\nOne teacher completed a full three-day training, while I attended a one-day session and have been coaching the staff on HBC. Although more training is needed, we are actively progressing and have already begun the implementation, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Bulawayo Bureau\n\nTHE High Court opened for the 2025 legal year on Monday, with 165 murder cases scheduled for trial in Bulawayo and the Gweru circuit.\n\nAmong the cases to be heard during the first term is the trial of two Beitbridge-based police officers accused of killing a suspect, dismembering his body, and hiding the remains under a bridge to cover up their alleged crime.\n\nThe officers, Xander Siyasayi and Daniel Peyan, reportedly detained and killed Blessing Nare in 2021 after cash went missing from a bottle store in Toporo Village.\n\nThe court will also hear the case of three armed robbery suspects linked to a series of robberies and the murder of Lobengula West businessman, Langelihle Dube, in June 2022.\n\nThe suspectsBrian Moyo alias Smally, Lucky Sibanda alias Makhekhe, and Kelvin Njabulo Dubeallegedly attacked Mr Dube at his home, leaving him for dead and stealing cellphones and US$25.\n\nAnother high-profile case involves three Beitbridge-based Zimbabwe National Army members accused of fatally shooting Zion Christian Church (ZCC) worshipper Jervas Masvina in July 2019. Masvina and other worshippers were holding an all-night prayer in a bushy area along the Limpopo River when the incident occurred.\n\nThe court will preside over the case of Ndabayezulu Ncube of Gwanda, accused of killing his wife, Nokuthula Khumalo, in June 2017. Ncube allegedly struck his wife with a hoe after she reportedly denied him conjugal rights.\n\nIn the Midlands Province, 82 murder cases are set to be heard by five High Court judges during the 2025 circuit. Two judges will handle 35 cases in Gokwe, while three judges will oversee 47 cases in Gweru. The circuit begins on January 20 and is expected to run for two weeks.\n\nTo ensure a smooth process, arrangements have been made for transport and witness quarters in both Gweru and Gokwe.\n\nThis deployment is a significant move to address the backlog of murder cases in the region.\n\nMidlands provincial public prosecutor, Mr Samuel Pedzisayi, said a team of five High Court judges will preside over the provinces first term of the 2025 High Court circuit.\n\nThree judges will be deployed for Gweru and two for Gokwe. There are no high-profile cases, said Mr Pedzisayi.\n\nHe said when the High Court sat last term, they managed to complete 137 cases.\n\nSpeaking at the official opening of the 2025 legal year in Bulawayo, Chief Justice Luke Malaba, expressed concern over the high number of unresolved murder cases in the Midlands.\n\nHe noted that the Bulawayo High Court had to sit on circuit in Gweru to clear 137 cases last year.\n\nThe Chief Justice said the high number of murder cases in the Midlands prompted the JSC to set up an extraordinary circuit as the public was now losing confidence in the justice system.\n\nStakeholders brought to my attention the high number of murder cases in the Midlands province which were taking too long to be finalised by the High Court in Bulawayo. The numbers were so high that sooner than later the public was likely to lose confidence that the courts could protect them, he said.\n\nIt became necessary for the Office of the Chief Justice to intervene. I directed the setting up of an extraordinary High Court circuit session in the Midlands Province which saw the deployment of five judges in the province to deal with the murder cases.\n\nChief Justice Malaba commended the judiciary and other stakeholders for their efforts.\n\nA total of 137 cases were completed. I wrote letters of commendation to the Judge President and all judges who participated in the extraordinary circuit sitting. Collaboration among the judiciary, prosecutors, legal practitioners, and police ensured the wheels of justice were not derailed, he said.\n\nUntil now I have not found the appropriate occasion to also thank the Prosecutor General and her team; the Law Society of Zimbabwe and through it, all legal practitioners who participated by representing accused persons either through the pro-deo appointment system or after being engaged as practitioners of choice by their clients, the Commissioner-General of the Zimbabwe Republic Police and all officers under his command.\n\n",

It will be a small delegation, but representing all the five regions of this continent to visit those countries that have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe and impress upon them that these sanctions are retrogressive.\n\nThese sanctions do not benefit anyone, including those who are imposing them. And the effects on this country are indeed, as you know, illegal, unfair, and that we condemn them.\n\nSo, Pan-African Parliament condemned the sanctions, and we are sending a delegation across those countries that continue to impose sanctions, he said.\n\nProf Murwira said Zimbabwe was a Pan-African country, as enshrined in the law of the land.\n\nAs such, the country was committed to supporting PAP in its endeavours.\n\nZimbabwes posture towards Africa in the Pan-African Parliament is governed by our own constitution. Section 12, subsection 2 of our constitution makes it mandatory that we are Pan-African and by that, our disposition towards the Pan-African Parliament is that of absolute and maximum support to the best that we can as a country.\n\nTherefore, the visit and the updates that were being given by Senator Chief president Charumbira are very important for us to shape how we can contribute meaningfully to the progress of the Pan-African Parliament as a Pan-African institution, he said.\n\nSanctions imposed on Zimbabwe, said Prof Murwira, were a violation of the countrys rights.\n\nAnd again, it is very important that the peaceful co-existence of Zimbabwe within the international world and the peaceful resolution of conflicts across the world is also constitutionally mandated as part of our posture to the world as Zimbabwe.\n\nSo that is why we were discussing about conflicts, how to prevent those conflicts, how to respect the laws that govern international relations, including these issues that we have been talking about, issues of illegal sanctioning.\n\nBecause as you know, again, section 12, subsection 1 of the constitution, Zimbabwe upholds the tenets of international law.\n\nAnd any violation of that is basically a violation of Zimbabwes rights, and we speak against it from a legal and a constitutional point of view, he said.\n\nThe Foreign Affairs Minister said Zimbabwe was committed to playing its role in advancing peace and prosperity initiatives on the continent.\n\nBut we always say peace and prosperity, integrity of this nation, dignity of this nation for prosperity are the founding values of our foreign policy.\n\nAnd you would know from His Excellency President ED Mnangagwas posture and doctrine is the that of peace, prosperity, doctrine of hard work, doctrine of dignity of the people of Zimbabwe, and within the African continent and the people of Africa.\n\nThat is why we talk about being open for business, that is why we talk about leaving no one and no place behind.\n\nSo, in this case, on the African continent, it is our primary goal to make sure that our relations with Africa, with ourselves, with the Pan African Parliament are of an excellent nature, he said.\n\nWestern countries imposed illegal economic sanctions on Zimbabwe at the turn of the millennium as punishment for the land reform programme that corrected colonial land inequities.\n\n",

            "content": "FOR a justice delivery system to work, it has to be effective. Five senior judges said as much at the opening of the new Legal Year in all centres where there is a resident High Court judge. Everyone involved in the system has to be both efficient, properly staffed and collaborating.\n\nChief Justice Luke Malaba and the other judges did note that the courts themselves are now working at a far higher level of efficiency than was seen a few years ago, have cleared backlogs and are being measured for their efficiency.\n\nThe Judicial Service Commission, which is headed by the Chief Justice himself and brings together representatives of other judges, magistrates and the legal profession as well as suitable lay members who can raise the sort of questions that those outside the legal world want considered, has been relentless in its pursuit of building excellence and accessibility.\n\nThere has been a continuous programme to add to the chain of magistrates courts and most towns of any size now have a resident magistrate with the larger and more isolated suburbs of big cities now also getting a permanent court in their midst. The fact that the legal year opened in five High Court buildings shows that far more civil law, as well as the top end of criminal law, is now being decided closer to the people who are involved.\n\nThe Judicial Service Commission has also implemented a performance management system to gauge the effectiveness of every judge and magistrate. This must measure both the amount of work every judicial officer does, as well as its quality, which the judiciary can do perhaps more easily than others since a magistrate or judge who has very few decisions changed on appeal or review is obviously doing well.\n\nThe review system, whereby all the more serious criminal cases decided by magistrates are routinely checked over by a judge or a pair of judges, along with the sentencing guidelines promulgated by the commission, means we are seeing far greater uniformity and so fairness in the courts along with a rigid adherence to the law and the Constitutional safeguards.\n\nBoth the Chief Justice, and Deputy Chief Justice Elizabeth Gwaunza, also brought up the potential for corruption in the judicial systems and the continuing need to make sure that it simply did not happen and that all responsible for dispensing justice led exemplary lives in both public and private. Zero tolerance has produced results.\n\nThe spread of the judicial services has also seen the welcome opportunities for qualified legal practitioners to move out of the big cities and offer legal services in many smaller centres, the possibility of court work added to the routine attorney work making this sort of business viable and competitive.\n\nThe Chief Justice and his colleagues addressed the need for all involved in the criminal justice system to be fully efficient and to work together. There are obvious limits, since magistrates and judges decide guilt or innocence while police investigate crime and the prosecutors present the cases. Collaboration obviously does not mean that the judiciary move away from independence.\n\nBut it does mean that we should not have endless delays while evidence is assembled by the police or cases are prepared by the prosecutors or witnesses are tracked down and properly summoned with adequate warning.\n\nSome delays are unavoidable, and some are even generated by defence lawyers who seem to have been instructed to postpone the day of reckoning until everyone involved has died of old age. But we see cases where it seems to take almost forever for the police to assemble evidence, and the prosecutors seem ill prepared to present their cases.\n\nThe new National Council on the Administration of the Criminal Justice System, chaired by the head of the High Court Judge president Mary Zimba-Dube and including, with others, Prosecutor General Justice Loice Mutanda-Moyo, is designed to make sure that the administration works properly and better so that the accused are not left for long periods in a state of limbo before their guilt or innocence is established.\n\nWe have argued before that prosecutors and the police should work more closely in assembling cases, as is done in a range of other countries, so that holes in a case are identified earlier and the correct charges are laid that are supported by evidence. Prosecutors are not trained investigators but they need the facts, and police are not trained lawyers, but need to know what to look for so the correct charge is laid and a reasonable case assembled.\n\nIt is in these earlier stages that the mistake of arresting the wrong person can be sorted out and the investigation widened to find the actual perpetrator. In almost all criminal cases there is no doubt that a crime has been committed, although there are some crimes where this needs to be established if they reach the trial stage.\n\nThe main question for the investigation is finding who committed it and the main question for the courts is whether the evidence assembled and presented proves beyond reasonable doubt that the person before the court is the person who committed the crime. This is a fairly obvious concept but it does mean high levels of skill and efficiency right down the chain to the constable who receives the first crime report.\n\nIt has been said that justice delayed is justice denied, at least to someone who might well be the victim of crime. This is a bit of an exaggeration but it does highlight the need to ensure that everyone involved must move forward at due deliberate speed so that everything for investigation, prosecution, defence and final decision is done properly, fairly and correctly.\n\n",
