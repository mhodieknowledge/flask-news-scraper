            "url": "https://www.herald.co.zw/constitutional-amendment-to-allow-trump-third-term-introduced/",
            "content": "A REPUBLICAN House member has introduced a resolution to amend the United States Constitution to allow President Donald Trump, and any other future President, to be elected to a third term in the White House.\n\nPresident Trump has proven himself to be the only figure in modern history capable of reversing our nations decay and restoring America to greatness, and he must be given the time necessary to accomplish that goal, said Representative Andy Ogles of Tennessee on Thursday, who proposed extending the current maximum of two elected terms.\n\nIt is imperative that we provide President Trump with every resource necessary to correct the disastrous course set by the Biden administration, Ogles said in a statement.\n\nHe is dedicated to restoring the republic and saving our country, and we, as legislators and as states, must do everything in our power to support him, said Ogles, a hard-line conservative who is serving his second term in the House.\n\nI am proposing an amendment to the Constitution to revise the limitations imposed by the 22nd Amendment on presidential terms, he added.\n\nOgles move came three days after Trump was sworn in for a second, non-consecutive term  becoming only the second US president to accomplish that feat.\n\nAnd the resolution comes two months after Representative Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, introduced a House resolution that reaffirms that the 22nd Amendment applies to two terms in the aggregate as President of the United States, and that the amendment applies to the 78-year-old Trump.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Ogles resolution.\n\nFor a resolution to amend the Constitution to be sent to the Archivist of the United States, it must receive a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. If that is done, three-fourths of the states  38  must ratify the amendment for it to become part of the Constitution.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment of the Constitution states in part, No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\n\nOgles resolution seeks to revise this to read, No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than three times.\n\nThe original amendment also states, No person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\n\nIn his statement Thursday, Ogles said the resolution he was introducing would allow President Trump to serve three terms, ensuring that we can sustain the bold leadership our nation so desperately needs.\n\nProposed in 1947 and ratified in 1951, the 22nd Amendment was authored to prevent a repeat of President Franklin Roosevelts unprecedented election to four terms in office.\n\nTo this day, Roosevelt is the only president ever to have been elected to more than two terms. He died in 1945, less than 90 days after his fourth inauguration.\n\nRepublicans currently hold an extremely narrow, three-seat majority in the House, and have a majority by the same number of states in the Senate. Few, if any Democrats, are likely to vote for Ogles resolution with Trump in office.\n\nOver the course of his political career, Trump has repeatedly hinted at his willingness to serve more than two terms in office.\n\nI suspect I wont be running again, unless you say, Hes so good weve got to figure something else out, Trump reportedly mused to House Republicans during a private meeting in November, shortly after his electoral victory over Democratic former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSpeaking to members of the National Rifle Association in May, Trump said, ?I dont know, are we going to be considered three-term or two-term? Are we three-term or two-term if we win??\n\nTrumps openness to a third term does not come as a surprise to some people who know him.\n\nThe former Fox News journalist Geraldo Rivera, who was friendly with Trump for decades in New York, predicted in December that Trump and his allies would soon turn their attention to the 22nd Amendment.\n\nFor future reference: President Trump & Co. will soon start chattering about revoking/amending the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two four year terms, Rivera wrote on X.\n\nAmending the Constitution is not the only way that Trump could stay in power after his current term ends.\n\nThough the 22nd Amendment prohibits Trump from being elected president again, it does not prohibit him from serving as president beyond Jan. 20, 2029, wrote Philip Klinkner, a professor of government at Hamilton College, in a recent article in The Conversation.\n\nThe reason for this is that the 22nd Amendment only prohibits someone from being elected more than twice, Klinkner wrote.\n\nIt says nothing about someone becoming president in some other way than being elected to the office.\n\nKlinkner wrote that one hypothetical scenario would be for Trump to run for vice president in 2028, and have Vice President JD Vance run at the top of the ticket, for president.\n\nIf elected, Vance could then resign, making Trump president again, Klinkner wrote. But Vance would not even have to resign in order for a Vice President Trump to exercise the power of the presidency.\n\nThe 25th Amendment to the Constitution states that if a president declares that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office  such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President.\n\nAnother scenario Klinkner imagined is for Trump to encourage a family member to run for, and win, the White House. Once elected, they would serve as little more than a figurehead president, while Trump made the key decisions.  CNBC\n\n",
