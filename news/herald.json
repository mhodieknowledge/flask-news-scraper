This is a Presidential project and we are working on his instructions, said Rusanov.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa and his Government are modernising the health sector as part of deliberate efforts to create a modern, prosperous, and highly industrialised country by 2030.\n\nIn June, the President was in Russia where he scouted for investors to help set up the air ambulances.\n\nThe investor, Russian Helidrive Air Ambulance, swiftly came to Zimbabwe and is assisting in the setting up of an efficient air ambulance service manned by highly skilled medical doctors, nurses, engineers, dispatchers, and pilots.\n\nThe Air Ambulance service boasts a fleet of over 100 medical helicopters, dedicated to saving lives across the entire Russian territory for the past nine years.\n\nThe recruitment and training of local personnel was done in Harare in handling air medical services with the company recruiting 40 local pilots, 50 doctors, 100 nurses, 100 dispatchers, and 10 engineers.\n\nAir ambulances are primarily used to transport patients from inadequate levels of care to higher levels of care, or to take them home if unable to travel via commercial flights.\n\nThese specialised aircraft are designed to navigate geographical barriers and provide the same level of medical care available in an intensive care unit.\n\nAir ambulances are also sometimes necessary if a patient needs long-distance or emergency transport and is unable to use a commercial flight due to their medical condition.\n\nThese airborne ICUs are equipped with cutting-edge medical technology and manned by highly trained medical personnel, ready to manage a wide spectrum of medical emergencies en route to care facilities.\n\nThis unique combination of speed, access, and comprehensive care capabilities positions air ambulances as a critical component of emergency medical services worldwide.\n\nZimbabwe has recently embarked on a transformative journey in its healthcare sector with the launch of air ambulance services.\n\nThis initiative, spearheaded by the Government and supported by international partnerships, marks a significant milestone in improving emergency medical response and healthcare accessibility across the nation.\n\nThe air ambulance service in Zimbabwe officially took off in August 2024, coinciding with the 44th Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit.\n\nThe helicopters are equipped with advanced medical facilities and staffed by trained medical personnel, ensuring rapid and efficient medical transport for critically ill patients.\n\nOne of the first successful missions of the air ambulance service involved transporting a cardiac arrest patient from Chegutu to Harare.\n\nThis mission, which took only 20 minutes, significantly reduced the travel time compared to the two-hour road journey, adhering to the Golden Hour principle in emergency care.\n\nThis rapid response capability is crucial in saving lives, particularly in remote and underserved areas.\n\nWelcoming the arrival of the second air ambulance, Winos Dube, chairperson of the Bulawayo Residents Association (BURA), hailed it as a significant step forward in improving healthcare access for the citys residents.\n\nHowever, Dube stressed the importance of ensuring equitable access to these critical services, emphasising that the benefits of this vital resource must extend beyond the privileged few.\n\nWe applaud the Government and our President for the kind gesture, we however hope that every person who needs emergency medical attention will access this. It must not be based on ones position in society but generally, we are excited as its presence will indeed save lives, said Dube\n\n",

This occasion also presents a unique opportunity for the President to dedicate national projects and personal endeavours to the Almighty.\n\nWutawunashe further underscored the profound significance of this interaction, underlining the importance of fostering a strong relationship between national leaders and the churches. She believes that dedicating oneself to God is essential for the spiritual and moral well-being of any nation.\n\nThis is an event that brings our national leaders, community leaders, from business and every sector of the nation including traditional leaders will be well represented.

Well, that is their constitutional right.\n\nIn fact, Mutasa and his Electoral Committee have been under immense pressure during the candidate selection process and will likely continue to endure more pressure in the days leading up to January 25.\n\nCommendably for Mutasa and his colleagues Nyasha Sanyamandwe and Rosemary Mugadza, they have done their utmost best to deliver a fair and credible pre-election selection process.\n\nWhere they have been unsure, they have sought the guidance of respected legal brains and former Harare City Mayor Muchadeyi Masunda.\n\nMasunda, himself, is no stranger to, sport chairs the ZIFA Ethics and Integrity Committee.\n\nHe has previously been a member of the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\n\nSo, after the pre-selection of candidates has been concluded, we now await a period of spirited campaigns by men and women seeking to be president, the two vice-presidents and the six ordinary board member positions that are available.\n\nThose who make it onto the board will be joined by the chairpersons of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) and the Womens Soccer League (WSL).\n\nWe believe that in all that will happen in the ZIFA elections campaign season and voting process, which has already been characterised by political skullduggery, it is FOOTBALL and not individuals, who will emerge the winner.\n\nZimbabwes flagship sport has already been through a lot and forgettable phase in the last three years.\n\nThe Government through the SRC has invested a lot into helping FIFA to normalise the situation and ZIFA as an institution cannot afford to regress.\n\nThus, this watershed election must at the end of it all, pave way for a quick healing process by all opposing candidates.\n\nSoon after the game heals from the wounds associated with any election, must come the more important transformation of ZIFA, with a lot of work awaiting the new president and his team.\n\nA transformation that will see the association respecting the Memorandum of Undertsanding (MOU) that ZIFA entered into with FIFA and the government through the SRC.\n\nZIFA also needs to win back the confidence of the athletes in this case the players, coaches, fans, Government, corporate partners and crucially to continue to receive the kind of goodwill the Normalisation Committee has been enjoying from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and FIFA.\n\nWith a successful poll and a stable, viable post-election election era, ZIFA could be a model association which even FIFA could be proud of having assisted. FIFA have in some instances failed to find the desired results after appointing a Normalisation Committee, with problems persisting.\n\nIn other countries such as Namibia, FIFA had to appoint yet another Normalisation Committee.\n\nBut we believe members of the ZIFA Congress will rise above petty politics and eventually put football interests ahead of any egoist feelings.\n\nThe national teams fine run in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualification campaign, and the decent runs by the womens and junior sides, have shown what our players are capable of achieving where there is some stability.\n\nThis why we will once again emphasis that the biggest winner from the election mad season should in fact be football.\n\n",

The September China-Africa summit saw a pledge US$50 billion to Africa over the next three years.\n\nIt follows the United States (US) pledge of US$55 billion over three years to shared priorities and the African Unions (AU) Agenda 2063. Japan has committed US$30 billion, and Russia has proposed several collaborative and consultative arrangements.\n\nPerhaps most important is Africas relationship with the European Union (EU). The last EU-African Union Summit in Brussels in 2022 agreed on a joint vision for a renewed partnership and investments of 150 billion.\n\nThe AU says such partnerships aim to enhance Africas international standing and global leverage. By prioritising these relationships, particularly with emerging powers such as Indonesia, Africa seeks to maximise its impact in international affairs.\n\nThere is little evidence that having more external partnerships has increased Africas agency.\n\nAccording to the AU, the proliferation of partnerships is evidence of Africas growing prominence in the global arena and its strategic approach to achieving continental objectives through multilateral cooperation.\n\nIn theory, having more partners gives Africa additional options to negotiate and choose from, thereby increasing its bargaining power, decision-making autonomy and flexibility in international relations.\n\nBut there is little evidence that these efforts have lessened external interference in Africa.\n\nFor example, the wave of coups in the Sahel region has led to an alliance between coup governments. The alliance is backed by security guarantees from Russia to establish the Confederation of Sahel States, which threatens both the AU and the Economic Community of West African States.\n\nSome argue that Africa has a unique opportunity to help shape a future world order, owing to its demography, critical minerals and importance in diplomatic and geopolitical alliances.\n\nIt could advocate for more equitable representation within its various partnerships and in key international institutions such as the United Nations (UN) Security Council. The multiplicity of engagements thus enhances Africas agency in global affairs.\n\nIn pursuit of a global system fit for the future, the AU could deploy its common African positions  for example, the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration. These outline Africas stance on UN reform, including of the UN Security Council  demanding permanent representation with veto rights, increased non-permanent seats, and AU-led selection of African representatives.\n\nSuch documents illustrate Africas commitment to multilateralism while aiming to address historical injustices and ensure inclusive representation and meaningful participation in global governance structures.\n\nAfrica must focus on strengthening its institutions, resolving internal conflicts and building economic resilience\n\nHowever, given Africas diversity and complexity, common African positions are few and far between. Crafting them is often costly and laborious, and once set, they bring a rigidity to reform. They may also divert attention from Africas internal pressing peace and development priorities.\n\nRather than striving for continent-wide positions and action, an introspective strategy prioritising Africas development and peace would more effectively enhance the continents geopolitical agency. This should be complemented by a more strategic engagement with key partners.\n\nThe continent must focus on strengthening its own institutions, resolving internal conflicts and building economic resilience before committing significant resources to broader international issues where its interests are not at stake.\n\nBy addressing internal challenges first, Africa can develop a stronger foundation from which to exercise meaningful influence in global affairs and protect its strategic interests.\n\nA more pragmatic and dynamic approach is needed, where the multitude of external engagements complements the pursuit of domestic African peace and development.\n\nAfrica should commit to foreign policy support only on matters where its interests are directly at stake. It should pursue common positions on issues that hinder the continents ability to achieve peace and development.\n\nAfrica should commit to foreign policy support only on matters where its interests are directly at stake.\n\nThe Pan-African agenda should prioritise preventing new conflicts and responding timeously to ongoing wars in Sudan, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Libya and others. Reform of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and putting the World Trade Organisation into operation, directly impact Africas development priorities, and need continental action.\n\nPursuing global tax reform, reducing sovereign borrowing costs, addressing debt relief, pursuing simplified access to private capital and climate financing, and establishing common standards for infrastructure development are also crucial. These targets are realistic and can better meet peoples needs.\n\nAs part of a strategic foreign policy aimed at the future, African states should agree on a standardised set of transparency and project execution guidelines that are uniformly applicable to foreign investors and countries operating in Africa. These criteria must encompass public consultations and sustainability benchmarks. The requirements should be clear, simple and publicly available  as all subsequent agreements should be.\n\nThe AU should lead the development of a binding legal protocol that spells out these requirements, followed by domestic enactment and implementation. Strict regulatory and enforcement mechanisms should accompany such a protocol, which should govern all foreign investment and sovereign loan agreements in Africa.\n\nInitiatives such as reforming African and international peace and security architectures and implementing the African Continental Free Trade Area and Agenda 2063 should be prioritised. With these clear priorities, Africa can forge specific beneficial partnerships while removing requirements that constrain African agency, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive and stable international order.

Zimbabwe and Zambia share three of these scholarships each year and alternate between one and two each. Ms Mudyanembwa will join a cohort of exceptional scholars from around the world.\n\nIn 2018, Ms Mudyanembwa earned the Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo Scholarship to attend the University of Zimbabwe after she left Marist Brothers Dete High School in Hwange so her high-level promise has been recognised for many years. She will be heading to the University of Oxford in September 2025 to join a cohort of more than 100 scholars from across the globe, undertaking postgraduate studies on a full scholarship with travel and liviing expenses included.\n\nIn a statement, the Rhodes Scholarship national secretary of Zimbabwe, Mr Dalumuzi Mhlanga, confirmed Ms Mudyanembwas selection, noting that she joins an elite group of Zimbabweans who have benefited from the same scholarship.\n\nMr Mhlanga highlighted that she overcame stiff competition to secure the only slot available for studies starting next year.\n\nWhen the committee meets every year to select Rhodes Scholars, we are always amazed by the abundance of bright, driven, and capable young people in Zimbabwe. This year the selection committee made the difficult decision to award the only scholarship to Victoria Mudyanembwa, which speaks to the very high bar that the scholarships criteria demand of both candidates and selectors in their consideration and evaluation.\n\nWe hope this encourages young Zimbabweans and candidates, in particular, to consistently excel across all the varied key pillars of the criteria, which cover academics, character, leadership, and service, much like Victoria has done, said Mr Mhlanga\n\nNotable past winners of the scholarship include former Deputy Prime Minister Professor Arthur Mutambara.\n\nMs Mudyanembwa expressed her gratitude for being selected for the prestigious scholarship.\n\nI am overwhelmed with gratitude to be named a Rhodes Scholar-elect. This is an extraordinary honour, and I am deeply humbled to be part of such a prestigious community.\n\nI am indebted to my family, friends, mentors, and supervisors, whose unwavering support has been instrumental in my journey. With this scholarship, I am excited to embark on a new chapter in my life. I am eager to contribute to the global community, to learn from brilliant minds, and to make a positive impact on the world, said Ms Mudyanembwa.\n\nIn furthering her studies, she aims to leverage new technologies to explore complex biology and medicine, with a particular focus on better understanding how indigenous traditional medicine can be made widely available, safely, and cost-effectively.\n\nMr Mhlanga announced that the next applications will open on 1 June 2025, encouraging brilliant Zimbabweans to apply.\n\nEach year, the selection committee looks forward to engaging with remarkable young Zimbabweans of all backgrounds across gender, race, and academic discipline, from both local and international universities. It is our young people who continue to fly the Zimbabwean flag high as they seek to drive progressive change in their fields of study and in the communities and spaces where they find themselves, said Mr Mhlanga.\n\n",
