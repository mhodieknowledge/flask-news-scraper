In addition to selling raw strawberries, we are now going to make jam, juice and strawberry wine.\n\nWe plan to establish an operation focused on quality, sustainability, and local sourcing of raw materials. I am projecting to get 20 percent market share in local food stores.\n\nI also intend to train my fellow war veterans on strawberry farming. The crop requires irrigation water, which is doable since solar-powered boreholes will be made available for war veterans.\n\n",
