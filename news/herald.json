Any form of intimidation or coercion is unacceptable and must be condemned.\n\nThe association has called on the Government and relevant authorities to take decisive action to regulate the public transport sector and prevent further incidents.\n\nWe urge authorities to intervene swiftly to restore order and protect the rights of passengers, Mr Goliati said.\n\nAt the same time, we encourage passengers to report any cases of violence or intimidation to PAZ or law enforcement.\n\nAs Zimbabwes public transport system grapples with these challenges, PAZ has urged all stakeholders to work collaboratively to build a safe, reliable and customer-focused network.\n\nThe safety and well-being of passengers must come first. Let us prioritise this as we address these pressing issues, Mr Goliati said.\n\nThe escalating tension among operators highlights the urgent need for reforms to ensure the public transport sector serves its primary purpose: the safe and efficient movement of people.\n\n",

            "content": "Precious Manomano\n\nHerald Reporter\n\nLands, Agriculture, Water, Fisheries, and Rural Development Minister Dr Anxious Masuka has announced an extension for the deadline to destroy tobacco seedbeds from December 31 to January 15, 2025.\n\nThis decision responds to delayed rains and a prolonged dry spell, providing growers with additional time to transplant their crops and safeguard their investments.\n\nThe Plant Pests and Diseases (Tobacco) Regulations, 1979, mandate that all tobacco seedbeds be destroyed by December 31 to break the life cycle of pests and diseases that could affect tobacco plants.\n\nHowever, many farmers relying on rain-fed dryland tobacco were unable to transplant in time due to erratic rains.\n\nIn light of these challenges, the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB) has issued a statement.\n\nConsidering these challenges, the decision ensures that farmers can preserve their investments and benefit from their months of hard work, said the organisation.\n\nThis advocacy led to the extension of the deadline.\n\nTobacco production involves a detailed process that includes sowing seeds, maintaining a seedbed for three months, preparing land, and creating ridges for transplanting seedlings.\n\nDestroying tobacco plants in seedbeds prevents farmers from transplanting, which can significantly impact their yield.\n\nThe recent December rains have brought relief and hope for dryland tobacco growers, marking a potential turning point for the 2024/25 season.\n\nStatistics from TIMB indicates that as of 27 December 2024, growers had transplanted 84 661 hectares, surpassing the 82 392 hectares recorded during the same period in 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the number of registered growers has increased to 126 092, up from 112 904 last year. These figures reflect the industrys resilience and growth, with a national target of 300 million kilograms of tobacco set for the season.\n\nTo ensure success this season, the focus remains on adopting climate-smart agriculture practices that enhance resilience against erratic weather patterns.\n\nTobacco growers are encouraged to control weeds to reduce competition for water, use potholes to capture rainfall and prevent runoff, and maintain proper ridges for efficient drainage.\n\nMeanwhile, the harvesting of the early irrigated crop is underway, with reports indicating promising leaf quality in areas where good agronomic practices have been followed. Maintaining high-quality tobacco is crucial, and growers are encouraged to prioritise agronomy.\n\n",
