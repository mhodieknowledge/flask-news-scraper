Instead, they caused significant damage to businesses and livelihoods, he said.\n\nThe reality is that protests have often harmed businesses and the economy more than they have addressed the concerns they were meant to highlight.\n\nThose who do not participate in protests, especially businesses and workers, often bear the brunt of the disruptions, while the economic damage lingers long after the demonstrations have ended.\n\nCZR believes that dialogue remains the most effective way to address national concerns.\n\nZimbabwes economy thrives on stability, investor confidence, and a supportive business environment, all of which are undermined by unrest.\n\nHe reiterated CZRs commitment to economic stability, investor confidence, and a thriving business sector.\n\n",
