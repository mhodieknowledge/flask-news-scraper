            "content": "Online Reporter\n\nZIMASCO (Pvt) Ltd has successfully secured an order for the urgent hearing of an appeal challenging a decision that prevents Harare lawyer Mr Wilson Manase from presenting himself as a corporate rescue practitioner for the company.\n\nThe appeal was lodged with the Supreme Court by Kwekwe businessman Shepherd Tundiya and his company, Avim Investments, contesting an interdict issued against Mr Manase.\n\nJustice Tendai Uchena presided over the matter and granted Zimascos application.\n\nThe High Court registrar was directed to compile and dispatch the record of proceedings to the Supreme Court registrar by April 25, in preparation for the appeals hearing.\n\nJustice Uchenas order explicitly restrained Mr Manase from performing or presenting himself as a Corporate Rescue Practitioner under Part XXXIII of the Insolvency Act [Chapter 6:07].\n\nThe matter is to be scheduled for the earliest available Supreme Court date. The court order was issued with the consent of all parties, without affecting the substantive grounds of the appeal.\n\nZimasco has informed its stakeholders that, based on the latest legal developments, two High Court orders previously issued pertain to Sinosteel Zimasco (Pvt) Ltd, a separate entity, and therefore cannot be enforced against Zimasco (Pvt) Ltd.\n\nTo address any lingering uncertainties, a further High Court application has been filed for determination on this issue.\n\nIn the midst of these proceedings, the Chinese Embassy has formally communicated its concerns to the Government of Zimbabwe regarding the protection of its investments in Zimasco (Pvt) Ltd.\n\nIt has urged the Government to take immediate and decisive measures to prevent any unlawful interference with these investments.\n\nAdvocate Daniel Tivadar is representing Zimasco in the ongoing legal matters, while Advocate Silvester Munyaradzi Hashiti is acting on behalf of Avim Investments, Shepherd Tundiya, and Mr Manase.\n\n",

            "content": "Ray Bande in Vumba\n\nGOVERNMENTS increased engagement with its citizens in the diaspora is bearing fruit, with a considerable number of investment projects in agriculture, education, mining among other sectors already operational, while others are in the pipeline.\n\nThis was revealed in virtual presentations made by the countrys envoys during the Third Zimbabwe Annual Diaspora Conference in Vumba just outside Mutare.\n\nAmbassador in Asia and the Pacific Region, Ambassador Joe Tapera Mhishi said several engagement initiatives with Zimbabweans in the diaspora were aimed at highlighting investment opportunities back home.\n\nDiaspora engagement and consular services provision are being rolled out in Australia and New Zealand. There is also massive participation by Zimbabweans here in community organised events such as the Zimbabwe Achievers Awards Gala dinner held annually, and also Independence Day celebrations commemorated here. The Ambassador is invited to these events as a guest of honour. Resources allowing, there should be at least one diaspora engagement meeting in each of the eight states that make up the Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nThis will also apply to New Zealand regions of Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch. These engagement meetings have been focusing on developments in Zimbabwe, trade and investment opportunities, said Ambassador Mhishi.\n\nFurthermore, on record is another individual in the diaspora that submitted a proposal to work in marginalised communities in the agriculture sector. On records again are some individuals in the diaspora who signed an MOU with the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development for a collaboration at Shamva Agricultural College. The MOU focuses on promoting sustainable agricultural practices and innovation to enhance productivity.\n\nAnother individual from Auckland in New Zealand signed an MOU with the Womens University of Zimbabwe. The scope of the MOU is to facilitate running a modern dairy project using the best practices in breeding dairy cows. New Zealand is rated eighth in the world in the dairy industry. There are cases of diaspora individuals carrying out private investments in Zimbabwe as private individuals or corporate bodies. Among these is a diaspora company founded in April 2022 and whose presence is now being witnessed at the ZITF and the Zimbabwe Agricultural Show. The company is the sole producer of concrete made animal feed and water troughs. A diaspora ladies association called Sisters Connect is investing in real estate after they bought land in Chivhu for constructing residential properties.\n\nThere is also a diaspora family whose efforts to construct a medical centre in Gweru is at an advanced stage. In engaging Zimbabweans in the diaspora, the mission is mindful of the numbers that amount to 60 000 in Australia and 10 000 in New Zealand with diverse professional, business, political and personal interests. From these engagements, it is worth noting that Zimbabweans in the diaspora have shown keenness in transferring knowledge and skills in different sectors.\n\nAmbassador in the Europe Region, Ambassador Christian Katsande said Zimbabweans in the diaspora have shown great interest in investing back home.\n\nZimbabweans in the diaspora have shown great interest in investing back home in different sectors of our economy. Effective engagement has also been instutionalised, and is being done through their diaspora organisations. Examples in the UK include Zimbabweans in the UK Organisation, Zimbabwe Diaspora Nation Building Initiative, Zimbabwe UK Business Chamber, Zimbabwe UK Nurses and Midwives Association Zim Achievers Awards and many others.\n\nI am aware that all these organisations have made their contributions. At the Embassy, we have created clusters that mirror the pillars of the National Development Strategy, especially Financial Services, Agriculture, Mining, Tourism, Infrastructure Construction, Sports, Film and Arts as well as Cultural Heritage. With respect to programmes to promote economic diplomacy, engagement with the diaspora has been fostered through bilateral and cluster meetings. In the Financial Services Sector, the diaspora has huge networks with industry bodies of UK financial services who are assisting in mobilising resources, deepening and broadening financial and capital markets.\n\nTrade and investment conferences such as the Zimbabwe Capital Market Conference and mining investment conferences as well as the business exhibitions which draws the participation of Zimbabweans in the diaspora, he said.\n\nZimbabwes first Ambassador to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Ambassador Jonathan Wutahnashe said: Our mission in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is fairly new after having been established last year. This is the reason why it is difficult by now to state the numbers of Zimbabweans, more-so when we have others working in sectors that require extreme privacy.\n\nHowever, we do have Zimbabweans working in Saudi Arabia including some in executive levels while others are what we might call in commercial service level Saudi Arabia has recruited Zimbabweans including in the oil and gas industry as well as construction industry. It is rare not to find a Zimbabwean working as engineers in huge industries here. We had our inaugural diaspora engagement last year, and we connected with local organisations such as ARDA and ZimParks who clearly explained investment opportunities, and there was a lot of interest generated, which we noted, he said.\n\n",
