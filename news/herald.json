How can it be ordinary? he said.\n\nThe house, which was reportedly owned by Dr Munyaradzi Kereke, is intended to be converted into a clinic.\n\nHowever, the Mayor criticised the decision to spend such an exorbitant sum while city employees struggle to access medical treatment due to financial mismanagement, revealing a disconnect between the councils financial priorities and the welfare of its workers.Mayor Mafume said he is often called to address issues regarding delayed salaries.\n\nMoney is being paid twice, he said, indicating a troubling pattern of financial irregularities that raise concerns about the accountability of council officials.\n\n14.54 Council has no control over its firms: Mayor\n\nHarare City Council risks losing its companies amid indications that the subsidiaries, including Harare Quarry and Rufaro Marketing, are registered in the names of individuals, some of whom have since left the local authority.\n\nFurther, council also offered free land to individuals through verbal agreements.\n\nCity Parking, which is wholly-owned by the local authority, had its papers changed sometime last year as it was in the names of previous directors during the era of former Harare Town Clerk Tendai Mahachi.\n\nThe rot, especially at Rufaro Marketing, resulted in council spending 13 years without collecting a cent from its 130 beerhalls.\n\nA report of the special committee on Rufaro Marketing, mandated to run the beerhalls, showed that current and former council employees were subletting the beerhalls in foreign currency, yet paying a paltry fee to council, if at all.\n\nSpeaking during a special council meeting last year, Mayor Jacob Mafume conceded that the city has no control over its assets.\n\nMayor Jacob Mafume\n\nCannibalism had set-in in council. Share certificates were put in names of certain individuals who were then fired or left council for one reason or the other and it was taking time to find signatories.\n\nWe have ordered that those papers be regularised.\n\nCity Parking papers have since been regularised and we are looking at the Quarry papers for their regularisation, he said.\n\nMayor Mafume said as for Rufaro Marketing, a former chief executive had basically run away with the organisation.\n\nWe have now put in a new board and we are asking that the situation be rectified.\n\n",

There is a joint summit of SADC and the East African Community that will be held in Tanzania later this week, which has taken an extraordinary decision to invite all parties in the DRC conflict to a meeting. The President is an important interlocutor in the crisis considering that he has built a strong relationship with both the DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and President Paul Kagame, said Mr Charamba.\n\nThe SADC Double Troika comprises the SADC chairman, outgoing chairman and incoming and the Chairperson of the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation.\n\nTanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan is the current chairperson of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation.\n\nThe SADC Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC), that was deployed on 15 December 2023 to support the Government of the DRC to restore peace and security in eastern DRC, comprises forces from the Republics of Malawi, South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania.\n\nIn the aftermath of summits that were held separately by SADC andthe EAC, the United Nations Security Councils strident criticism of the rebel groups in eastern DRC and their sponsoring countries, a wide conflagration in the Greater Lakes region has seemingly been averted after the M23 and other rebel groups declared a ceasefire, ostensibly on humanitarian grounds.\n\nThe coalition of rebels, which recently intensified clashes in eastern Congo, claimed control over Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.\n\nClashes between government forces and rebel groups have left an estimated 900 civilians dead, displacing tens of thousands more.\n\nThe recent fighting in eastern DRC, which has been dogged by conflict for more than 30 years since the 1994 Rwandan genocide, has also claimed 16 soldiers from the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and Malawi, who form part of the SADC Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC).\n\nAs rebel forces gained the upper hand on the battlefield, capturing much of Goma, the largest city in eastern Congo, South Africa responded with a stern diplomatic warning. The South African government stated that any further attacks on its troops would be regarded as a declaration of war.\n\nIn a swift rebuttal, Rwandas President Kagame accused South Africa of acting as part of a belligerent force. He claimed that South African troops were engaged in offensive combat operations to support the Congolese government in its fight against its own citizens.\n\nResultantly, tensions were high before last weeks SADC Summit in Harare, which mandated its Organ Troika on Politics, Defence and Security Co-operation to engage all state and non-state parties to the conflict on a ceasefire process to protect lives and facilitate a smooth flow of humanitarian support to people and communities affected by the armed conflict.\n\nThe Summit also urged Political and Diplomatic leaders who are parties to the conflict to engage in a co-ordinated effort of dialogue, including supporting the Luanda Process, MONUSCO and others, to restore peace and security in eastern DRC.\n\nSADC leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to the DRCs sovereignty, territorial integrity, and long-term stability, pledging ongoing support for its development and security.\n\nLast week, the African Unions Peace and Security Council (PSC) at its 1256th Emergency Ministerial meeting on the Recent Developments in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), condemned the DRC conflict and called for adherence to the Luanda Process.\n\nUnder the Luanda Process, Angolan President Joo Manuel Gonalves Loureno has tried to broker peace between DRC President Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Kagame. Such talks have, however, remained elusive, amid escalatory rhetoric and trading of accusations between the two leaders.\n\nThus, the summit, that will be held in Tanzania, offers a platform for both President Tshisekedi and President Kagame to meet directly with mediation from SADC and the EAC.\n\n",
