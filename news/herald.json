The quantities were nothing to worry about and l wondered why the water was so dirty.\n\nI thought some youngsters were playing upstream. I went upstream to find out why the water was that dirty but found nothing.\n\nAt around midday, the water had increased to knee level and it later reached waist level. I then went to find out upstream again. This is when l started hearing a loud sound like that of a helicopter.\n\nThat is when I tried chasing away some children that were playing along the stream but instead of listening to my warnings, they scolded me.\n\nWhen the powerful wave came, it came with uprooted trees and logs. By that time the dam had cracked and we could only watch helplessly as the water was sweeping away everything on its way.\n\nLands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Deputy Minister Vangelis Haritatos and his Local Government, Public Works and National Housing counterpart, Engineer Benjamin Kabikira are leading a delegation that has visited the area to assess the damages caused by the dam water.\n\nThey are also mapping out modalities for Government intervention and consoling bereaved families.\n\n",
