This is when I met my first producers, Nyasha Timbe and Mr Noxa, Shellah recalled.\n\nTo date, Shellah has released two projects, each with different outcomes, but he maintains a positive outlook.\n\nA third project is expected before the end of the first quarter of this year.\n\nHis single Urigamba has remained on Power FM Zimbabwes Top 40 charts for two consecutive weeks.\n\nHaving mastered the art of resilience, Shellah serves as an inspiration and motivation for emerging and aspiring artists.\n\nMy main aim is to spread positive messages to everyone, promote love, and eradicate hate, he said.\n\nMy advice to upcoming artists is to exercise patience and embrace hard work.\n\nBorn and raised in Kambuzuma, Harare, the Afro-fusion musician attended Wadzanai Primary School and Kambuzuma 1 High School.\n\n",

            "content": "Farirai Machivenyika and Wallace Ruzvidzo\n\nAll ministries should ensure that business does not suffer from prohibitive regulations as well as punitive administrative licences and fees, President Mnangagwa has said.\n\nIn his address at the First Meeting of the 2025 Cabinet Year on Tuesday, the President said instead of being restrictive, fees, licences, permits and regulations should promote economic development.\n\nTo enhance the overall performance of our economy, the Ease of Doing Business Agenda continues to be an important aspect of our programming.\n\nIn that regard, concerted efforts must be made to revisit all the areas that hinder the start or growth of all investments, whether local or foreign.\n\nI commend the entrepreneurial spirit among our people. By nature, Zimbabweans are hardworking, he said.\n\nTowards that end, Parliaments Portfolio Committee on Industry and Commerce yesterday convened to discuss the challenges faced by manufacturers and retailers in the formal sectors.\n\nConfederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) chief economist, Dr Cornelius Dube, said there was need for legislation requiring Government ministries, departments and agencies to procure a specific percentage of their goods and services from local suppliers to boost the economy.\n\nGovernment should come up with legislation or a statutory instrument that compels it to buy a prescribed threshold for its goods and services from local suppliers, he said.\n\nDr Dube argued that this measure would enhance competitiveness and boost demand for local products.\n\nConfederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) president Mr Denford Mutashu highlighted the unfair competition posed by informal traders.\n\nThere are a lot of regulations and cost centres that we are facing as formal traders that those in the informal sectors are not paying. This makes our prices uncompetitive.\n\nThe closure of formal businesses could negatively impact other sectors, such as banking and finance, due to a decline in deposits, he said.\n\nIn her presentation, chief executive officer of the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) Ms Rosemary Mpofu-Chikarakara stressed the importance of addressing exchange rate discrepancies, foreign exchange shortages, and market distortions that encourage arbitrage.\n\nThe CCZ also wants smuggling stopped.\n\nIssues of porous border posts also need to be seriously dealt with and punitive (and) deterrent measures such as jail terms need to be introduced in order to curb these challenges.\n\nGovernment and the affected businesses can partner and aggressively invest and deploy advanced monitoring technologies, including drones, CCTV, and automated scanning systems, at all major border posts.\n\nAll imported products should abide by the rules, with no exemptions of who is importing. As long as there are other importers who are exempted from paying duty, loopholes will always be created and these products will then find their way both in the formal and informal market, creating an unfair playing field with the businesses that pay duties, the CCZ said.\n\nPortfolio Committee chairperson Cde Clemence Chiduwa acknowledged the concerns raised at the meeting.\n\nWe have taken note of the presentations and we will compile a report that we will table in the House for debate, he said.\n\nThe Committee aims to find viable solutions to support the local industry and create a fair competitive environment.\n\nThe Government and the Reserve Bank have taken taken steps to formalise the informal sector as part of broader measures outlined in the 2025 Monetary Policy Statement announced last Thursday, aimed at enhancing Government tax revenues and stabilising the economy.\n\nA week earlier, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Professor Mthuli Ncube announced measures to rein the burgeoning informal sector that was threatening the survival of formal businesses.\n\nThe RBZ Monetary Policy emphasises the need for both the informal and formal sectors to align, creating a more cohesive economic environment.\n\nRBZ Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu is advocating for the integration of informal businesses into a system that includes dual currencies, bank accounts, and electronic payments, which is essential for achieving the Governments economic goals.\n\nUnder the new regulations, items on a list of commonly smuggled goods will be presumed smuggled unless merchants can provide valid customs clearance.\n\nThis initiative places pressure on businesses to ensure compliance and legitimacy in their operations.\n\nGovernment will implement a presumptive retail-level VAT that manufacturers must collect when selling to small or informal businesses lacking tax clearance certificates.\n\nThis measure restricts wholesalers from engaging with unlicensed entities, further pushing informal businesses towards formalisation.\n\n",
