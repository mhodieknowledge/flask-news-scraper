It is a dream come true for me. I have always wanted to be part of something big, and being part of Wolves is very big for me and my family.\n\nIt is a team that Ive also seen from afar, and the Premier League is the best place to be, so Im delighted to join the family, to join the team.\n\nI am very excited. It is probably going to be the first time I have had a big opportunity to be representing a bigger club. Nothing against Reims, but now you are going to be playing in the Premier League, playing for Wolves.\n\nAlso, we have a greater population in England for Zimbabweans, I think I will feel even more at home than I was in France.\n\nOn his experiences in France, he said: The first time I got there, I did not think I would stay for that long, but considering what I went through with the club, I really enjoyed my time there, and I think now it is probably the best time because I have gained so much experience.\n\nBeing in the French league is also very tough, probably not as much as the Premier League, but I think it is also quite competitive with the clubs that we have. So, I think those games will come in handy once I make this move.On speaking to Chirewa and Abgadou\n\nObviously, Tawanda messaged me as soon as he saw the news. He was so excited, so at least now hes going to have his big brother there. So, it was very good. With Agba he did the same, because when he first came here, I was the one to welcome him. So, I think now it is going to be his turn to welcome me.\n\nAs Wolves have seen so far, what he provides for the team, the impact that he has, the energy, the strength, the physique, it is something that you need in every top team. So, besides that, he is also a very good friend of mine. We have been very good friends for the past three years. So, I am also looking forward to that.\n\nOn bringing leadership qualities\n\nI think in as much as we play football, we learn a lot. Being a leader is something that is not easy, but you also have to nurture yourself. You have to learn how to help others, how to guide, how to lead by example, on the pitch and off the pitch. So I think it is something that I will also be able to bring to Wolves, considering what Ive also produced here at Reims. I think it is some of the qualities that I do produce on the pitch, and off the pitch.  Wolves FC\n\n",
