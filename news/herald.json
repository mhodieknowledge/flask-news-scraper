May the New Year ahead bring hope and greater prosperity for our motherland, Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, Christmas is a time for family, unity, and spirituality.\n\nZimbabweans are embracing the holiday season with enthusiasm and optimism, reflecting the countrys rich cultural heritage and strong sense of community.\n\nThe President said Zimbabwe remained a composite and solid unitary state despite its diverse norms, customs, languages and culture.\n\nFrom Zambezi to Limpopo, from Plumtree to Mutare, and across the most remote villages in our country, we sing with pride one national anthem and fly one national flag. We are diverse, but one.\n\nTo this end, this past week saw my administration concretise the Constitutionally enshrined obligation to give rights to every Zimbabwean citizen to hold and occupy agricultural land.\n\nHence, the bold decision to empower the beneficiaries of the Land Reform Programme through the issuance of Deeds of Transfer that will unlock the value of our land.\n\nThrough this historic act, these new tenure documents will be issued to the over 23 500 A2 and over 360 000 A1 farmers.\n\nThe celebration of this years Unity Day is, therefore, equally a jubilant occasion affirming that the land is now irreversibly with its people, and the people with their land, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nUnity, patriotism, peace, love and respect, he said, remained indispensable values in the countrys development matrix.\n\nI, therefore, call upon all citizens to commemorate this National Unity Day with sober reflections and recommit to the rich national heritage embodied in the historic Accord of 1987.\n\nNever, never, never again, should anything ever divide us.\n\nUnited we must stand, strong and solid as the walls of Great Zimbabwe, from which we derive our nations name.\n\nHand-in-hand, in unity, from village to the provincial level; sector-by-sector and industry-by-industry, Vision 2030 shall surely become a reality, said President Mnangagwa.\n\n",

Dr E. D. Mnangagwas term of office as President of the Republic of Zimbabwe and First Secretary of ZANU PF be extended beyond 2028 to 2030. The Party and Government should, therefore, set in motion the necessary amendments to the National Constitution so as to give effect to this resolution, reads the resolution.\n\nCde Muswere said any other meetings outside Zanu PF forums were private and of no relevance to partys processes.\n\nHe said noise makers outside Zanu PF were not part of the decision-making process.\n\nCde Muswere recently took time to explain and defend the partys ED2030 slogan and growing calls for President Mnangagwa to remain in office and continue the development trajectory beyond 2030.\n\nCde Muswere, who is also Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, and legislator for Makoni West Constituency, emphasised that the call for Mnangagwas continued leadership was an agreed party position, resolved and adopted at the annual national peoples conference.\n\nHe was responding to a question raised by Cde Gilbert Zowa, a recently elected war veterans association member, to clear the air on the slogan.\n\nCde Zowa had sought clarity on the ED2030 slogan, noting that President Mnangagwa himself had expressed disinterest in extending his term beyond 2028, despite the partys enthusiasm for his continued leadership.\n\nHe raised the issue during the Zanu PF Makoni District Coordination Committee (DDC) meeting held at the Makoni Rural District Council boardroom in Rusape.\n\nThe ED2030 slogan has garnered significant traction as party supporters overwhelmingly urge President Mnangagwa to extent his Presidency beyond the current constitutional two-term limit.\n\nCde Muswere said the resolution to extend President Mnangagwas leadership beyond 2030 is in line with Zanu PFs constitution, since the conference that endorsed the resolution had a full quorum, making it legally and properly constituted.\n\nHe highlighted importance of maintaining constitutional integrity and adherence to party principles and values when implementing such resolutions.\n\nCde Muswere said the extension of President Mnangagwas leadership is an opportunity to consolidate the ongoing economic, infrastructural and social transformation programmes, guaranteeing continuity in policies aimed at achieving Vision 2030. Stability and consistency in leadership, he said, are crucial for realising the countrys long-term goals.\n\nRegarding the ED2030 slogan, as Cde (Gilbert) Zowa mentioned, the President made his own announcement. However, our guiding principle on this matter should be the ZANU PF constitution, which stipulates the holding of the annual National Peoples Conference. The last conference was held in Bulawayo, which was attended by all the requisite party organs. Most of you here today attended that conference. This conference was attended by various party organs, including the Central Committee. It was legally and properly constituted, with the required quorum, he said.\n\nThe Central Committee report, which encompassed all resolutions from Provincial Coordination Committees (PCCs), was tabled. The resolutions from Zanu PF provinces were read out and unanimously adopted. The meeting also reviewed thematic committees deliberations. Most of you were in attendance at the conference, which was chaired by Zanu PF national chairperson, Cde Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri. Together with other leaders, Cde Muchinguri-Kashiri requested the adoption of the resolutions asking the President to remain in office beyond 2030, in order to continue pursuing the countrys development trajectory, said Cde Muswere.\n\n",

            "content": "Zvamaida Murwira, Senior Reporter\n\nGovernments forecast of 6 percent economic growth for next year has undergone a stress test to assess its realism, taking into account various fiscal risks, including exchange controls and natural disasters, along with other macro-economic fundamentals.\n\nFinance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube said the 2025 National Budget sought to build resilience and the Government forecast a brighter future going into the New Year.\n\nProf Ncube said this in Senate last week while responding to concerns raised by lawmakers during a debate on the 2025 National Budget that the Legislature has since passed.\n\nHave we taken care of risks that might arise as we focus on such a brighter future for the country into next year? We have done a stress test of the Budget by considering various scenarios to say, suppose we have some macro-economic risks and maybe we are wrong in terms of our Gross Domestic Product forecast of 6 percent for whatever reason, suppose it turns out to be 2 percent lower and what will happen and we do those simulations.\n\nWe also look into how, for instance, exchange rate risks could impact the budget. We look into the impact of commodity risks and some other contingent liabilities that come out of nowhere but impact the fiscal position. We also consider the impact of natural disasters that are unforeseen and some public debt risk, he said.\n\nProf Ncube said the national budget also focussed on building resilience and not necessarily as a recurrent budget alone as what was suggested by some Senators.\n\nEarlier, some Senators had said the budget was skewed towards more recurrent expenditure as opposed to investment or capital expenditure thereby compromising its resilience.\n\nRecurrent expenditure can have resilience characteristics. Resilience is quite broad. Our expenditure on the Pfumvudza/Intwasa Programme speaks to building resilience in our rural areas so as to cushion our rural farmers from the vagaries of climate. By the way, 60 percent of Pfumvudza/Intwasa farmers are women. So, you can see the impact of that Budget expenditure item on the gender equity issues, but also our overall social protection on the budget, whether it is Basic Education Assistant Module (BEAM) or whether it is looking at the grey mitigation programme, all those social protection programmes which are just simple recurrent expenditure programmes, our items speak to resilience, he said.\n\nBoth recurrent expenditure and investment can have resilience characteristics, said Prof Ncube.\n\nThe resilience characteristics from infrastructure will come from investment in irrigation. I think that is an obvious one or indeed, building dams, but with a view of evacuating the water onto the fields and eventually irrigation. So, all of that is a resilience which the budget is supporting, he said.\n\nProf Ncube said in terms of foreign currency receipts, he acknowledged the role played by the diaspora adding he expected them to send more money to Zimbabwe next year.\n\nHe said the Treasury had also made initiations to stimulate domestic car production through the retention of duty on bus imports.\n\nWe believe now we have quite a lot of buses and we have re-introduced duty on commuter buses. We are supporting a programme of incentivising the import of knocked down kits which will then be assembled at facilities such as Willowvale, Deven Engineering or Quest among others. We are encouraging the use of greener cars in order to reduce pollution, he said.\n\nZanu PF Chief Whip, Cde Pupurai Togarepi expressed optimism that the Budget will cater for key Government operations necessary to achieve Vision 2030.\n\nThe vision aims to achieve an upper middle-income economy by 2030 and the Budget spoke to this vision by providing vital resources to productive sectors of the economy.\n\nAs you are aware, our productive sectors include agriculture, mining, industry and commerce and tourism. These sectors were adequately equipped to ensure they continue to contribute to economic growth which is projected to leapfrog by 6 percent by the end of 2025.\n\nOther sectors such as transport and energy which provide essential infrastructure and power to facilitate industrial activities were also catered for and we expect the energy generation capacity to improve by midyear, he said.\n\nCde Togarepi noted that through the Finance Bill, the Budget tried to strike a balance between reducing the tax burden on companies while also ensuring that the Government had adequate funding to run its operations.\n\nNo country can prosper without its citizens paying taxes. MPs encouraged the Minister to widen the tax base. A culture of paying tax is key to economic development, he said.\n\n",

We will not hesitate to arrest anyone found on the wrong side of the law for the law to take its course, he said.\n\nComm Nyathi said proper red reflective triangles should always be used in case of a breakdown to increase visibility.\n\nHe said those who failed to adhere to this requirement would be dealt with in terms of the Road Traffic Act and Road Motor Transportation Act.\n\nThe ZRP said they have taken note of reports of liquor outlets in some central business districts and residential areas, which are not observing the provisions of the Liquor Act, by operating outside their stipulated opening and closing times.\n\nSome of the beer outlets are also allowing minors to access alcohol.\n\nPolice will also take action on those engaging in drug and substance abuse, adding that as the public celebrates the cross-over into the New Year, individuals, institutions and businesspersons must adhere to the provisions of the law on the use of fireworks, firecrackers and other gadgets that may disturb the safety and security of the people.\n\n",

            "content": "Emmanuel Kafe\n\nIn the quiet, rural expanse of Chegutu, Linda Jose, a mother of twins, never imagined that the day she gave birth would become one of the most life-changing and harrowing experiences of her life.\n\nThe farming community, where she had lived for years, was far removed from bustling cities with state-of-the-art medical facilities.\n\nTo get to understand Lindas story, it is good that we start from the beginning. Her pain began suddenly, setting off a whirlwind of hope and fear. Linda was already in labour when she arrived at the local hospital in Chegutu.\n\nI started feeling pain while I was pregnant here in Chegutu, and then I went into labour, she recalls.\n\nWhat she didnt expect was the arrival of an air ambulance, which would become a lifeline for her and her two premature babies.\n\nThe pain was intense, but nothing could have prepared her for the shock of giving birth to twinstwo tiny girls, weighing only 850 grams and 1 000 grams, respectively.\n\nAs minutes passed, complications aroseone of the twins began to show signs of distress, turning yellow and exhibiting symptoms of jaundice, a common condition among premature infants.\n\nAt this point, the hospital staff realised they lacked the necessary treatment and equipment.\n\nWhat happened next was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA helicopter, dispatched by Helidrive Zim, an air ambulance service provider, arrived to transport Linda and her critically ill twins to Chinhoyi Provincial Hospital, a major medical facility capable of handling such delicate neo-natal cases.\n\nIt was such a strange feeling. I never thought a helicopter would come to my rescue, especially living in such a remote place, Linda said, her voice trembling with gratitude.\n\nI thought they would come for someone from the city, not someone like me from a farm. It felt like a miracle. If the helicopter hadnt come, my babies wouldnt have survived, she said.\n\nFor Linda and her family, the air ambulances presence meant the difference between life and death.\n\nThe babies were transported in on board incubators, surrounded by life-support equipment that kept them stable during the flight.\n\nThe swift and efficient transfer ensured they received the critical care they needed in time.\n\nTo many in Lindas community, the sight of a helicopter arriving in their rural village was a surreal moment.\n\nWe were shocked to see a helicopter come to rescue someone like Linda, who lives on a farm, said Abigail, a neighbour from the area.\n\nTo actually witness a helicopter airlift her without her having to pay anythingits incredible. We never imagined something like that could happen here.\n\nAbigail, like many in the community, had never seen such a high-tech, life-saving operation take place in such an isolated location.\n\nTo actually witness a helicopter airlift her without her paying any moneyits unbelievable, she said.\n\nDr Freddy Mhondiwa, the medical director at Helidrive Zimbabwe said since August of this year, the service had airlifted 154 patients, many of whom were children, including two VIP patients.\n\nConcession, Mashonaland Central Province, leads in maternity cases requiring emergency assistance, accounting for 60 percent of cases.\n\nSince August 2024, up until the beginning of this month, weve managed 154 flights, transporting patients from various hospitals to central hospitals.\n\nThe majority of our patients are maternity cases, making up around 30 percent of our flights. These are often urgent cases coming from central hospitals, he added.\n\nDr Mhondiwa continued: Recently, we had a case of a mother with twins. She was coming from Chegutu, unable to deliver at the local hospital. We airlifted her in a critical condition, both for her life and her babies. Were proud that we were able to transport her and that she delivered safely. Now, theyre back home. That was, I would say, one of our best rescue missions.\n\nThough Lindas story is unique, it is becoming increasingly common as rural communities realise that help can indeed come from the sky.\n\nThe government-run air ambulance service, which operates free of charge has saved many lives across the country.\n\nIts a service that not only offers hope but delivers it swiftly, at a time when every second counts.\n\nFor Linda, the memory of that day will stay with her forever.\n\nShe speaks softly but passionately, Im so grateful for the helicopter, and for the people who made it possible.\n\nIt gave my babies a chance to live.\n\nToday, Lindas twins, though still small, are thriving.\n\nTheir premature birth, once a cause for fear, is now a distant memory, replaced by the overwhelming relief that their lives were saved by an air ambulance that arrived just in time.\n\nHelidrive Zim, which operates the air ambulance service, is part of a transformative effort by the Government to improve universal health coverage across the country.\n\nThe air ambulance that came to Lindas rescue was not just a mode of transport; it was a mobile intensive care unit in the sky, equipped with state-of-the-art technology and staffed by skilled medical professionals.\n\nThe Second Republic has been actively working to modernise the countrys health sector, focusing on innovative solutions to ensure that healthcare is accessible to every citizen, no matter where they live.\n\nIn June, the President travelled to Russia to seek investors for establishing air ambulance services for the public health sector.\n\nThis collaboration has led to the creation of the air ambulance network that is already saving lives in the country. Air ambulances are essential, especially in rural areas like Chegutu, where medical facilities are often under-resourced.\n\nThese specialised helicopters can bypass the geographical barriers that isolate rural areas from more advanced healthcare. With highly trained doctors, nurses, engineers, and pilots on board, air ambulances deliver the same level of care found in intensive care units, ensuring that patients, especially vulnerable newborns, are stabilised during transport to higher-level hospitals.\n\n",

            "content": "Christmas Day always brings up images of family gatherings, peace and tranquillity as part of the celebrations marking the year end, the more party-like celebrations coming next week at New Year.\n\nIt fits in with the long-established traditions of farming communities in this part of the world, when the first rains having fallen the pastures are growing again and cattle are improving, and most crops have been planted, so farmers can take a bit of a break after some heavy labour. And even in the cities, we see the first green mealies being roasted to remind us of our roots.\n\nThe traditions are reinforced by the granting of bonuses for all in State service and large swathes of the formal sectors, and those in the informal sectors enjoying good business as those bonuses get spent on the sort of goods and services that this sector makes. So there is the surge of moderate prosperity.\n\nThere is much to be thankful for by many, although we could all do with some more rains, after we have come successfully through a hard year, combating the worst drought in decades although our new resilience meant that this do not derail the country, but rather cut the economic growth rate to 2 percent. We continued to progress despite the climatic disaster.\n\nThere are those we need to remember, those in essential services who will not be with their families today such as staff in health and security services, and even those in more mundane occupations like keeping the border posts open for tourists, and the shop assistants who will come to work for businesses that supply essential needs like food and medicine.\n\nThe police have promised to maintain a strong presence across the country and on the roads to ensure the rest of us can have a peaceful Christmas and our hospital casualty departments will be fully staffed to cope with the expected influx of injured in accidents and at home, numbers which tend to rise at this time of the year.\n\nDespite all the efforts by the Government, churches and others to ensure that no one has gone hungry despite the drought, there are inevitably those who for all sorts of reasons, such as age or ill health, who will be hungry today and we should remember them and try to do our own little bit to relieve distress.\n\nThis consideration for others extends to how we drive and move around. Accident rates rise over the festive season every year, and yet they should be falling as people relax and think more of others. Family reunions are important, but not if we have to die and kill while trying to reach them. Breathalysers are now being deployed at check points and we hope this will be the start of a process of weaning Zimbabweans off the culture of driving around after having drinks.\n\nThis year prices remained, very largely, stable in the run-up to the festive season with the exception of some bus crews on some routes. Whether this was a bright idea of the drivers, conductors and touts, or whether it was ordered by the bus owners, it needs to be stopped and it appears that some sort of fare inspection is needed at long-distance bus terminuses. So much has been done to make buses safer, and it would not need much more effort to also ensure that they maintain fair fares.\n\nBut the rest of the economy has now moved away from the Christmas gouging, largely because our local industries are producing more than enough, so there are no shortages for the deviant to exploit, and the retail sector is now so competitive that it would be impossible to impose excessive mark-ups on goods and services without a good block of retailers cutting prices to take up market share.\n\nIn fact, there has been some strong advertising of Christmas specials thanks to the good production, import and supply chains and the high level of competition.\n\nThe only reason why some bus crews or bus owners on some routes can shove up the fares is because there are people prepared to pay more to get to their destinations on time on days when demand for seats exceeds supply. Consumers can use their buying power to refuse to collaborate with this sort of unacceptable behaviour and refuse to buy tickets or anything else until a fairer price is charged.\n\nToday many Zimbabweans will be in church or at least giving a thought to the religious aspects of Christmas, so it is a good time for us all to rededicate ourselves to what should be at the centre of Christmas, Peace on Earth and goodwill to all.\n\nThese are important, but to make them a reality, we all have to be involved to create that peace and by offering our goodwill to those we know and come into contact with, then we can spread that peace and goodwill. It does not just happen; we all have a part to play to make sure that this becomes the norm.\n\nWe sometimes forget our own individual responsibilities, in everything from making roads safer to making our communities stronger, to making the nation and even the whole world a better place. But everything starts with people deciding to make a difference and then doing this, and we get better community, or city, or country when all our efforts add up to something better.\n\n",

On second thoughts, these issues have always been problematic.\n\nZvangogara zvinonetsa!\n\nHaving learned from the best, the legendary Thomas Mapfumo, Kurai dishes the song in a calm, collected and composed but sombre voice, while his backing vocalists, add to the emotion.\n\nSurely, Mukanya, should be greening with envy from his base in the United States of America .\n\nWhat touches most is the intensity of the instrumentation of the song and the juxtaposition of Kurais voice and the backing vocals.\n\nThe beat is steadfast and excellent and in it comes a shifting tapestry of instruments, each complementing the other, to give the song its totality.\n\nChimurenga Music fans in their broad totality have started enjoying the song.\n\nThis writer played the song again and again, and again and again, again.

I recognise and appreciate the other contestants who were not approved and urge them to continue being powerful forces for the good of our football.\n\nWe must commit to fostering unity, integrity, and progress within our football community.\n\nAs we move forward, I am excited to roll out my vision for our football and work collaboratively with my fellow administrators, players, and fans to restore pride and build a brighter future for Zimba-bwe, said Phiri.\n\nThe former CAPS United owner has been absent from football administration ever since he ceded his shareholding at the club and also relinquished his post as PSL chairman in early 2016.\n\nHe feels he has had enough sabbatical and is ready to be a servant of the game again.\n\nActually, I looked at myself, I looked at our football in general, and I thought I still have something to offer. I strongly feel Im one of those who can offer something to the nation.\n\nThe next step is to go into the campaign, meeting the electorate. Fortunately, or unfortunately, its the festive period, and everyone else is with their families. So, we are going to relax a bit, and then after the holidays we resume the processes, said Phiri.\n\nKweza was also caught up in the relentless mudslinging campaigns after members of the public ap-proached the ZIFA Ethics Committee objecting to his nomination.\n\nBut after getting the nod, Kweza said he could not wait to embark on full-scale campaigns.\n\nWe do not have time. Its already 25 December tomorrow (today), and it means we are left with 20 days or so to do the campaigns. So, there isnt much time.\n\nWe would want to hit the ground running and make sure that we engage the people who matter most at this stage, said Kweza.\n\nI am so happy to have been cleared by the Ethics Committee. Before that, it was a hectic period. There was a lot that was happening, mudslinging and all.\n\nBut its now behind us. It happens during an election time, but we are already past that. We are now focusing on the next phase, which is the campaign.\n\nFor now, we are just resting a bit because of Christmas so that we can re-energise and also give eve-ryone time to be with their families.\n\nAnd then, after that, we start a proper campaign and engage the people who matter, who are the councillors and the ZIFA Congress members, and solicit votes. Hopefully, theyll like what Im selling to them and vote for me on the 25th of January, said Kweza.\n\nZIFA presidential election dark horse Magwizi was not immediately available for comment, but he has been telling the football constituency of his audacious bid to drive the association into a trans-formative phase should he be elected into office.\n\nThat phase is anchored on making ZIFA a viable and strong institution that wins the confidence of key partners such as the corporate world, government, players, and international partners. Earlier yesterday he also released the first part of his campaign videos in which he expounded on player and staff welfare and rights, arguing that Zimbabwe will not go wrong if players are well ca-tered for.\n\nSo, to address player and administrative staff welfare in Zimbabwean football, a comprehensive strategy is needed. Of course, this strategy needs to focus on, number one, financial security; num-ber two, healthcare; number three, the professional development of these players; and number four, the infrastructure from where all these players will operate from.\n\nI think key measures include enforcing fair contracts for each and every player who is within the as-sociation and looking at a model that ensures that all the players get timely payments of their wages.\n\nThere is also a need to build a framework where we ensure that for every level, whether its profes-sional, Division One, or Boozers Social League, there is a need to put a minimum wage policy so that there is a clear framework of how the welfare of every player is catered for.\n\nThere is also a need to think about issues of retirement. What is it that we are going to do for these players when it comes to retirement? We also need to think about issues of their healthcare.\n\nWhat partnerships can we put in place to ensure that the player is supported in respect of their health? When they get injured, how do we manage the injury?\n\nWhen it comes to mental health, how do we support the players in mental health? I think its also important to note that there is a need for a dual career pathway for all of these players.\n\nYou may be aware that players may be at their prime from 18 years. If they are very lucky, if they are extra lucky, maybe like Ronaldo, they will go to 38 or 40 years, said Magwizi.\n\n",

            "content": "Nelson Gahadza\n\nSenior Business Reporter\n\nZimbabwes capital markets underwent significant changes and adaptation and while challenges such as low liquidity and regulatory hurdles remain, efforts to engender durable currency stability and resolve the sovereign debt suggest a bright future.\n\nThe introduction of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency and efforts to improve relations with international creditors have laid a foundation for future growth.\n\nMarket experts believe to stimulate Zimbabwes capital markets in 2025, a strategic and comprehensive approach is essential.\n\nBusiness analyst Mr Kudakwashe Mundowozi said key strategies included enhancing liquidity through the introduction of new financial instruments, streamlining regulatory processes, and implementing widespread investor education programs.\n\nEncouraging institutional investors with tax incentives and leveraging technology to improve market efficiency are also crucial steps, he said.\n\nHe added that promoting sustainable investments and developing a green financing framework could attract socially responsible investors and align with global sustainability trends.\n\nAdditionally, fostering public-private partnerships and encouraging foreign direct investment through policy stability and tax incentives will be vital for long-term growth, said Mr Mundowozi.\n\nHe noted that by focusing on these strategies and addressing the challenges, Zimbabwe could create a more vibrant and resilient capital market.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) and the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) have the potential to become robust platforms for investment, contributing significantly to the overall economic development of the country.\n\nZimbabwes capital market has the potential to drive economic growth and attract both domestic and international investors in the coming years.\n\nInvestment analyst Mr Enock Rukarwa said the introduction of ZiG, which brought about relative stability, moderated stock market activity from flat to bullish outturn during the later part of the year.\n\nWhat has been topical around stock market developments is the issue to do with foreign currency settlement, wherein ZSE trades were being settled with statutory charges only and settlement happening offline in USD.\n\nThis phenomenon ignited improved liquidity on the market, but it was discontinued by regulatory authorities, he said.\n\nMr Rukarwa added that stock market liquidity, depth, and size were key areas of concern locally, and all these variables were a function of economic dynamics.\n\nHe added that an improvement in general macroeconomic conditions would result in improved confidence in the stock market.\n\nFinancial analyst Mr Malone Gwadu said the ZSE and Victoria Falls Stock Exchange went through normal stages of runs and stability, which largely mimic the inflation and exchange rate dynamics characterising the economy.\n\nHe said ZSE mainly acted as a haven for investors in times of volatility, as was the case during the first quarter (Q1) of 2024 and later in 2024.\n\nThe rush to hedge against exchange rate loss through buying shares also played a large role in leading to share price movements. The VFEX remains hampered from performing well due to liquidity issues, he said.\n\nMr Gwadu said there is a need to stabilise inflation and exchange rate volatility if the economy is to be able to attract more activity in the capital markets.\n\nThese remain systemic and structural threats to gains and value for investors and impede building confidence in the bourses trading activities, he said.\n\nAccording to Mr Mundowozi, offering tax incentives to companies that list on the ZSE can encourage more businesses to go public, increasing market diversity and investment opportunities.\n\nRwanda has implemented tax incentives to attract junior mining companies, which focus on exploration and then sell their assets after making discoveries. Similarly, Ireland offers a low corporate tax rate of 12,5 percent to attract multinational companies, he said.\n\nMr Mundowozi said encouraging companies already listed on other exchanges to list on the ZSE could attract foreign investment and enhance market liquidity.\n\nHe said the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in South Africa had successfully implemented a fast-track listing process for companies already listed on major stock exchanges, allowing them to place a secondary listing on the JSEs Main Board.\n\nThis approach has diversified the investor base and improved brand recognition for companies, he said.\n\nFinance, Economic Development, and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube recently said the Government would institute additional measures on the VFEX to drive activity after the exchange was largely characterised by limited trading activity andliquidity\n\nIn the 2025 national budget, the minister proposed to reduce capital gains withholding tax on marketable securities on the ZSE, effective January 1, 2025.\n\nZSE chief executive Mr Justin Bgoni, in emailed responses, said the reduction would incentivise investors to trade, resulting in increased liquidity in the market and will also attract more investors, ultimately boosting overall investment activity.\n\nA reduced capital gains withholding tax rate on marketable securities can make the investment landscape more appealing to foreign investors looking to invest in the market.\n\nThis can lead to increased foreign direct investment, which can benefit the economy as a whole, he said.\n\nMr Bgoni added that lowering the capital gains withholding tax can lead to improved market efficiency as investors may be more willing to engage in trading activities, leading to enhanced price discovery.\n\n",
