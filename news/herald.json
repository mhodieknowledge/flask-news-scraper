            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza-Bulawayo Bureau\n\nTHE Zimbabwe International Exhibition Centre (ZIEC) became a hotbed of innovation yesterday as thousands of schoolchildren from across the region were captivated by a dazzling display of ingenuity.\n\nA tangible sense of excitement filled the air as students explored exhibits ranging from remarkably durable and attractive paving bricks made from discarded tyres to a truly ground-breaking machine that converts used plastic into fuel.\n\nThe displays werent just static exhibits; they sparked curiosity and conversation, prompting students to engage with the innovators and learn about the processes behind these remarkable inventions.\n\nThe sheer ingenuity on display highlighted the potential of young minds and the power of technology to address real-world problems, leaving a lasting impression on the aspiring scientists and engineers in attendance.\n\nThe combination of National Youth Day celebrations and these engaging exhibitions proved a masterstroke.\n\nThe event allowed young people to celebrate the National Youth Day holiday while learning and sharing ideas about two of their key interests: technology and innovation. Thousands of young people celebrated National Youth Day in style,packing three halls at the ZIEC. President Mnangagwa was the guest of honour.\n\nFor young Prince and his Form Four classmates from Milton High School, seeing and touching paving bricks made from discarded tyres was a first. The expressions on their faces showed they recognised the ingenuity of the innovation.\n\nIsheanesu Mukome, a Biochemistry graduate from the University of Zimbabwe (UZ), said that the paving brick innovation was born from a desire to protect the environment by repurposing non-biodegradable materials. Discarded tyres, a significant environmental hazard, can be transformed into durable and attractive paving blocks.\n\nOld tyres can be harmful to the environment if not disposed of in an environmentally friendly way, and we have found a way of turning them into paving bricks. One old tyre is shredded into very small pieces, and the wires are removed before we compact the material into paving bricks that are both durable and beautiful, said Mukome.\n\nHer stand proved popular with schoolchildren, fascinated by the idea of transforming old tyres into building materials traditionally made from sand and cement.\n\nNearby, Benson Manjengwa, another UZ graduate, was kept busy answering questions from schoolchildren eager to understand his innovation  a machine that turns plastic into fuel. Like a patient teacher, Manjengwa explained the process of converting this other notorious environmental pollutant into usable energy. The innovation, a Pyrolysis Plant, cost the team of innovators US$600 to build.\n\nPrincess Moyo of Lobengula High School was thrilled by the innovations she and her friends saw.\n\nThis years National Youth Day celebrations were different from previous ones because we learned a lot about how other young people are making all kinds of products and inventions that will make a difference in peoples lives. President Mnangagwa said the future is in our hands and that we should use science and technology to build our country, so Im happy that we got a chance to see how innovation and technology are good for Zimbabwe, said Princess.\n\nThe exhibitions provided a perfect opportunity for universities and colleges to showcase their offerings to students who will soon be choosing their tertiary education paths.\n\nThe world is now in the technological revolution, and this years National Youth Day celebrations gave us the perfect opportunity to show young learners what our university has to offer. The learners want to know what separates us from other universities and colleges so that they can make informed decisions when they finish high school, said a lecturer from a local university.\n\nIn Hall 3, the Mpopoma High School choir entertained exhibitors, schoolchildren, and guests with an impromptu singing session.\n\nIn Hall 4, where the main proceedings took place, the Head of State and Government addressed thousands of young people from across the countrys ten provinces. The hall erupted in applause when President Mnangagwa announced the countrys digital skills training programme, which aims to empower 1, 5 million young people nationwide.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the initiative will enhance digital literacy and skills among Zimbabwean citizens and empower a new generation of professionals who can contribute to technological innovation.\n\n",

            "content": "Martin Kadzere-Senior Business Reporter\n\nGovernment intends to directly procure fuel for its own use and key economic sectors to lower costs and boost competitiveness, Energy and Power Development Minister July Moyo has said.\n\nSpeaking at the National Competitiveness Commission (NCC) inaugural competitiveness summit in Bulawayo on Wednesday, Minister Moyo said the move would ensure stable supply and affordability.\n\nHe raised concerns about the competitiveness of the fuel procurement system.\n\nZimbabwes fuel cost build-up comprises several components that determine the final pump price.\n\nThese include the international raw fuel cost (FOB), transportation costs, exchange rate between the US dollar and local currency, taxes and levies, blending costs and distributor margins.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA) considers all these factors when setting retail prices. Price fluctuations are primarily driven by global oil prices and exchange rate volatility.\n\nMinister Moyo acknowledged that while Zimbabwe cannot control external factors affecting fuel prices, the Government will focus on internal factors.\n\nThese include import duties and transportation costs.\n\nThe minister said the price of fuel at the port of discharge when compared to regional countries was significantly higher.\n\nFuel costs are a major expense, and their relatively high prices compared to regional countries disadvantage local products. This makes domestically produced goods more expensive, impacting their competitiveness both at home and abroad.\n\nWhile acknowledging the role of the existing fuel importers, Minister Moyo said the Governments goal was to provide predictable and competitively priced fuel to economic enablers to operate more efficiently.\n\nWe analyse and say, are we as competitive as Zimbabwe among those who we trade with? he said.When we look at ourselves here in the region, I think we are very expensive.\n\nSo, the Government is looking at all this, and as I said, we applaud those who are delivering fuel into our country.\n\nBut as Government, we have made some strides nowboth the Minister of Finance (Professor Mthuli Ncube) and I have been directed to make sure that we buy fuel for Government use and for other enablers of the economy, because Government is there to enable the economy to do well.\n\nWe have been directed to make sure that on the Government side and in any way, we should buy our fuel competitively because we used to do that so that we dont buy spot purchases on the international market, as the other 10 (traders) are doing.\n\nThe other 10, we think they are doing very well, but as Government . . . to compete, we should discuss with them, Minister Moyo added.\n\nThe Minister pointed to successful models in regional countries like Mozambique, Zambia, and Tanzania, where fuel traders collaborate with their governments to achieve competitive pricing.\n\nHe explained that while these countries have found effective ways to work with existing traders, Zimbabwes current strategy involved direct Government procurement to drive down fuel costs.\n\nMozambique has fuel traders, Zambia has fuel traders, Tanzania has fuel traders, but working with the Government, they have found a way of buying competitively, said Minister Moyo.\n\nBut for now, we want the Government (to) directly buy competitively, so that we can reduce the cost of fuel in the country, which impacts on your competitiveness.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA) has set the February maximum fuel prices at US$1,58 or ZiG 41,58 per litre for diesel, and US$1,53 or ZiG 40,50 per litre for blended petrol (E15).\n\nIn February, Zambias Energy Regulation Board (ERB) set the price of petrol at US$1,24 per litre and diesel at US$1,16 perlitre.\n\nMinister Moyo applauded existing fuel traders for maintaining a stable fuel supply despite challenges and assured the public that current fuel reserves, including supplies at ports and in pipelines, are sufficient.\n\nHowever, he reiterated that the Governments focus was now on improving the competitiveness of fuel procurement to lower costs.\n\n",

I stand with immense gratitude and appreciation. The generosity and kindness you have shown to the people of Zimbabwe through the donation of medical goods is truly remarkable. The donation will have a big impact on the lives of countless individuals. You dont know how many lives you have touched, some of whom you are not going to see, but you have made them to survive. You have brought some life in them. The medical goods you have donated will enable our healthcare professionals to deliver quality care, saving lives and improving health outcomes. Your commitment to saving humanity is inspiring, and we are deeply thankful for your partnership, she said.\n\nWhat made her think about Rotary Club, the First Lady said, is what she sees among people in both rural and urban areas.\n\nWe need help for our people to live the life that is expected of everyone to be in. In my capacity, I deal with mostly disadvantaged people that is women, children, the aged, the sick, the disabled among many other groups. As a mother, I shoulder all that, because I traverse the whole country and I know their needs.\n\nMy visit here and meeting with you will lessen the burden. Yes our Government is doing everything possible, but as a mother, as the health ambassador and philanthropist, I play my part to compliment the Government. That is what has also brought me here and also meeting with you. To me it is very important and it means a lot for the people of Zimbabwe. I hope that today is not the beginning and end of our joining hands for the benefit of philanthropic work in the health sector, she said.\n\nDr Mnangagwa said she will be grateful to continue working with the Rotary Club for the benefit of the less privileged and marginalised members of this society.\n\nI therefore look forward to our continued cooperation through the embassy of Zimbabwe in Australia. Once again, I want to thank you for your kindness, compassion, and dedication to making medical care accessible to many back in Zimbabwe. Your donations will have a positive impact.

I am taking the medical outreach programmes seriously and encouraging people to embrace the programme and utilise the services offered for free because prevention is better than cure. People should be checked to know their health status and i am happy people come out in their numbers during the outreach, she said.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Dr Mnangagwa said she was overjoyed by the gesture.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa inspects part of the huge consignment of medical equipment donated to her foundation by MediShare Rotary Australia World community service while Zimbabwean Ambassador to Australia and New Zealand Mr Joe Tapera Mhishi, Mr Keith Roffey and Mr Machigere look on, in Australia yesterday.\n\nThis remarkable gesture is not just a donation, it is a testament to the power of global solidarity and the shared commitment to improving the lives of women and children, not only in Zimbabwe but across the world.\n\nThese ultrasound machines will play a pivotal role in Zimbabwe. Let me also say through my foundation and its partners, i am building a Mother and Child hospital in Harare which is nearing completion. I am also building another hospital in the rural area, she said.\n\nShe said the hospitals will be a beacon of hope, a place where every woman and child can access world-class healthcare services, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nPart of the consumables which were donated to Angel of Hope Foundation by MediShare Rotary Australia world community service in Australia yesterday.\n\nWhat drove me to build them is that i looked at the lives of people in rural areas, they do need assistance. I then thought of coming up with a one-stop health care centre mainly targeting the less privileged. The donation from EverX brings us one step closer to realizing this dream, and for that, I am deeply thankful, she said. .\n\nThe donation, she said, was not just a gift of medical equipment, but a gift of life, hope, and opportunity for countless women and children who will benefit from these machines.\n\nAngel of Hope Foundation patron, First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa, Zimbabwes Ambassador to Australia and New Zealand Mr Joe Tapera Mhishi, Dr Andrew Mataruse pose for a photograph with MediShare to Rotary Australia world community national manager Mr Keith Roffey and his team during the donation of medical equipments and products in Australia yesterday.\n\nDr Mnangagwa is always traversing the length and breadth of Zimbabwe with her foundations mobile hospital and clinic offering cancer screening services even in hard to reach areas.\n\nDr Andrew Mataruse, who is part of the First Ladys delegation highlighted the benefits of the state-of-the-art machinery to the nation.\n\nMediShare Rotary Australia World Community service national manager Mr Keith Roffey hands over patient lifters to Angel of Hope Foundation patron First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa while Dr Andrew Mataruse look on in Australia yesterday.\n\nFrom the perspective of the First Ladys vision of having a childrens hospital and a womens hospital the advanced ultra sound scans from EverX will assist us particularly in maternity, assessment of fetal growth, assessment of complications.\n\nSometimes we have pregnancies that are complicated where there are actually damages which are occurring to the fetus so a good quality ultrasound scan can be able to determine fetal health, so that is a very important component that we can use in terms of womens health. It is also important to appreciate that ultrasound scans can be used for many diagnostic evaluations whether of the pregnancy, whether of the abdomen, whether of the chest.\n\nWheelchairs, walking frames, walking sticks and many other mobility aids and medical equipment which were donated to Angel of Hope Foundation patron First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa by MediShare Rotary Australia World Community service in Sydney, Australia yesterday.\n\nWe are also going to get more benefit in assessment in terms of breast cancer, assessment in terms of maternity health, particularly in terms of obstetric assessment of the children. The assistance we received from Medishare will help unlock improved health services for our people.\n\nThese donations give us a deeper sense of belonging and the need to assist those in need wherever possible, he said.\n\nZimbabwes Ambassador to Australia and New Zealand Mr Joe Tapera Mhishi described the First Lady as a well-established philanthropist.\n\nIt is against this background that she has travelled all the way from Zimbabwe to Australia to receive these medical equipments thus, finding best ways of supporting the health sector back home. We thank you for the donations, he said\n\n",

May I take this opportunity to recognise my fellow youthful ministers, said Minister Machakaire.\n\nAs part of your strategic innovations towards achieving Vision 2030, we recognise and celebrate the progress made in key areas for youth development. One remarkable step has been establishing Youth Focal Desks.\n\nThese desks were important points of contact for youth engagement but more work was need to make sure they functioned more efficiently and effectively, ultimately becoming more responsive to young peoples needs, he said.\n\nMinister Machakaire acknowledged Zimbabwes youth potential but stressed the need for further empowerment. His Ministry was modernising vocational training centres to equip young people with practical skills for national development.\n\nHe lobbied for a local scholarship programme to support students lacking the financial means to attend tertiary institutions.\n\nYour Excellency, you will be pleased to know that, thanks to your support for underprivileged students in ZimFEP schools, 13 students from Binga, who benefited from this initiative, successfully completed secondary education and have applied for the 2025 Presidential Scholarship Scheme. While this is commendable, we acknowledge that not all deserving students can be accommodated under the Presidential Scholarship Scheme.\n\nBuilding on this success, we humbly propose, through your wisdom and guidance, that we also create scholarships for our local state universities. This initiative would resonate with your core principles of devolution and the commitment to ensuring that no one and no place is left behind.\n\nMinister Machakaire said the Ministry was prioritising digital skills training for young people.\n\nIn todays digital age, digital literacy is crucial for empowering young people to access education, employment, and economic opportunities. The Ministry continues to prioritise digital literacy and skills development, ensuring our young people are well-equipped to thrive in our increasingly interconnected world, he said.\n\nHe called for improvements to the Youth Empowerment Bank and suggested the Government prioritised employing graduates from the Youth Service Zimbabwe programme, which has trained over 1 000 young people since last year.\n\n",

Adults create policies for us, on our behalf. Why cant we be consulted? I expect to see a change going forward, Ncube said.\n\nShe praised the recently introduced Heritage Based Curriculum, saying it will transform young peoples lives if implemented correctly.\n\nWe are pioneers of this curriculum, which, to me, is a getaway from the employee mentality introduced by settlers. It enables learners to be more practical than theoretical. One can now develop various business and income-generating projects, thanks to the Second Republic, said Ncube.\n\nZimbabwe, like many African countries, faces the challenge of adapting its education system to a rapidly changing global economy.\n\nThe Heritage-Based 5.0 Curriculum, designed to address the nations cultural and economic needs while preparing students for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), is central to this transformation. Blending traditional knowledge with modern science and technology, it promises to be a catalyst for economic growth, the realisation of Vision 2030, and the creation of a workforce equipped for the digital age.\n\nThis innovative framework integrates Zimbabwes rich cultural heritage with cutting-edge technologies and interdisciplinary approaches. Focusing on five key pillars  culture, innovation, education, economy, and sustainability  it aims to equip students with the skills and values to contribute meaningfully to society. Unlike traditional rote learning, the curriculum emphasises a holistic, learner-centred approach, merging academic knowledge with practical applications.\n\nAt its core is a fusion of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education with national heritage and socio-economic needs. Students engage in critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation within a context that values Zimbabwes traditions, indigenous knowledge, and natural resources. The Ministry of Primary and Secondary Educations introduction of this curriculum, converging modern and indigenous elements to create a well-rounded educational experience that responds to both global and local needs, is commendable and deserves support.\n\nOne fundamental outcome expected is its contribution to Zimbabwes economic development. By focusing on practical skills aligned with key sectors like agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and technology, the curriculum is indeed a masterstroke. Its focus on innovation and entrepreneurship encourages students to develop solutions for real-world challenges, contributing to job creation, industrial growth, and sustainable economic development\n\n",
