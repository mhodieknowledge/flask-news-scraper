The EU has no restrictive measures left except an arms embargo, and I think collectively, we hope that with the Government, we will be able in the foreseeable future to also get rid of the mechanism which is still there, said the Ambassador.\n\nOn Zimbabwes debt overhang, the EU described the countrys present efforts to clear its arrears as positive.\n\nIn 2022 Zimbabwe initiated the High Level Structured Dialogue Platform on Arrears Clearance and Debt Resolution, which has seen positive outcomes towards the full servicing of the countrys debts.\n\nI understand that we regard some of this process as positive, said Mr Sikorski, with Ambassador von Kirchmann interjecting and adding And indeed, there have been several positive signs, in particular on land. The historic payment of farmers compensation, I think is something we have applauded publicly as  well.\n\n",

Once assessments confirm a settlement is suitable, title deeds will be issued.\n\nThe Government, in collaboration with Kwangu/Ngakwami Trust, is focusing on developing essential infrastructure such as roads, water, and sewer systems in settlements that meet the required standards.\n\nThe move aims to ensure that only legally acquired and properly developed properties are eligible for title deeds.\n\nMeanwhile, the Government has started issuing 21 000 title deeds for properties acquired through state-sanctioned housing schemes.\n\nHomeowners eligible for title deeds are encouraged to visit district offices with the necessary documents, including identity documents, proof of payment, lease agreements, and sales agreements.\n\nOur ministry prepares the files, which are then sent to the Deeds Office for issuance, Minister Soda said.\n\nSignificant progress has been made in Epworth, where the Kwangu/Ngakwami Trust has established field offices to facilitate the process.\n\nThe initiative covers properties from both Government housing schemes and State land allocated by local councils. Issuing title deeds not only empowers citizens but also improves security of tenure and increases property values. Minister Soda also issued a stern warning to citizens against engaging intermediaries or land barons, urging them to deal directly with Government offices to avoid falling victim to fraud.\n\nWe urge citizens to take title deeds seriously and to avoid intermediaries. We work directly with citizens and do not want them to lose their money to unscrupulous activities by land barons.\n\nThe Government remains committed to addressing the countrys housing challenges, with several projects underway across the country. These include: Dzivaresekwa: Flats commissioned last year.\n\nIn Marondera construction of four blocks of flats in Dombotombo suburb, is expected to be completed by early 2025, while in Lupane houses built to cater to the towns growing status as Matabeleland Norths provincial capital are set to be commissioned soon.\n\nNew houses are set to be constructed in Siakobvu, while in Mutawatawa flats being built for civil servants, as well as the Crownlands project in Chinhoyi, which will provide over 1,000 serviced stands for Government employees.\n\nThere are several other housing projects that are underway across the country and Minister Soda reaffirmed the Governments dedication to improving housing conditions, reducing commuting costs for civil servants, and ensuring homeownership security.\n\nHe emphasized that while the housing sector is poised for transformation, citizens must acquire properties through legal channels to avoid falling victim to land barons.\n\nWith various efforts underway, Zimbabwes housing sector is set for a major transformation, he said. But citizens must be cautious and only acquire properties through legal channels.\n\nAs the Government continues to roll out its housing initiatives, the focus remains on providing secure, affordable, and well-serviced homes for all Zimbabweans.\n\n",

This roadmap included the establishment of a technical coordination mechanism to monitor the implementation of joint decisions, a critical step in addressing residual issues related to peace and security in the eastern DRC.\n\nOur meeting will consider the EAC-SADC joint roadmap, which details immediate, medium, and long-term implementation plans for our mechanism, said Amb Chimbindi.\n\nBrigadier General Rugendo highlighted the importance of learning from past interventions, including the involvement of the United Nations and the East African Community Regional Force. The situation in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has been there for quite some time. Various interventions have happened, said Brig Gen Rugendo.\n\nThe United Nations has been there for a couple of years. The East African Community Regional Force was there for one year. The SAMIDRC has been there for the last one year. We have all learnt lessons from our successes and challenges.\n\nHe stressed the need for an inclusive dialogue to address the root causes of the conflict, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2773 of 2025, which emphasises that military solutions are not viable.\n\nThe discussions yesterday were critical in shaping the outcomes of todays Council of Ministers meeting. Both chairpersons emphasised the importance of collaboration and sustainable solutions.\n\nWe cannot afford to fail our ministers, said Brigadier Rugendo. It is therefore important that we approach our engagement with open minds, a spirit of collaboration, and a firm resolve to advance sustainable solutions.\n\nWith the eastern DRC crisis posing a significant threat to regional stability and prosperity, todays Council of Ministers meeting is expected to lay the groundwork for effective strategies to restore peace. The joint efforts of SADC and EAC underscore the importance of regional co-operation in addressing complex security challenges.\n\nAs the two blocs work towards a co-ordinated response, the focus remains on achieving lasting peace and stability in the eastern DRC, a goal that is vital for the prosperity of both the SADC and EAC regions.\n\n",

            "content": "ZIMBABWE, like others in Africa, is already taking steps to cope with suspensions and possible ceasing of health support from the United States with measures already being implemented to create more efficient health systems as well as make sure there are no gaps.\n\nLast week, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora made it clear that there were two essential areas that had to be kept going without pause or disruption regardless of what decisions were made in the US.\n\nThe first was keeping the medical staff doing a first-class job, continuing to do so, by bringing them onto the State payroll. The second was to start ordering shipments of critical drugs that had been paid for by the US so that there would never be a shortage.\n\nMoves were already being made last year to bring the almost 20 000 health workers paid through foreign aid channelled through non-governmental organisations (NGOs) into the public health system and formalising the ties that the more sensible had already established.\n\nThere was also a need to ensure that all health initiatives at least fitted in with Zimbabwes professionally-guided system that followed best international practice.\n\nFrosty ties between Zimbabwe and the US since the Land Reform Programme at the beginning of the century meant that US aid for Zimbabwe was almost entirely concentrated in the health sector and was largely channelled through NGOs, a preference of the US, rather than as direct support through the Ministry of Health and Child Care.\n\nThis worked reasonably well, if not perfectly, since a large majority of the actual health workers paid via NGOs were sensible people who kept in close contact with the ministrys administrative system, built around provincial medical directors and district health officers, but extending right down to the sisters in charge of clinics.\n\nBut there were problems with people who might or might not be at work, with no way of finding out why they might be missing. And there were always dangers that some of the curiosities of non-scientific health practices common in America, such as the anti-vaccination movements, could hit chunks of Zimbabwes health programmes under the direction of a similarly orientated NGO.\n\nSo the Health Ministry had already started working with the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion to work out how to bring almost 20 000 health workers employed by the NGOs, and largely funded through USAID, into the regular Government-employed health workforce.\n\nMost of these, around 19 000, are classified as community health workers, who have become the backbone of many health programmes, being in the frontline of the highly successful anti-malarial battle.\n\nThey have also been helping to ensure that all those who should be tested for HIV actually get tested, and making sure that the anti-retroviral medication gets to those who are on the programme, almost 100 percent of those who have tested positive for HIV these days.\n\nThis is besides having someone sensible in every village who can give good advice on general hygiene and preventative medicine and help make sure that those who need to go the nearest clinic can go.\n\nThey have also performed magnificently in such areas as the vaccination drives, and came in for particular praise from district medical officers fighting the last measles outbreak for their ability and hard work in getting the vaccination message through to mothers in communities where there was resistance to vaccination.\n\nThe idea that they should be dumped has obviously horrified the medical staff who have come to admire, respect and rely-on these community health workers as an essential part of the chain of health services.\n\nThey have more than justified their movement into the Ministry.\n\nThere are also a little under 1 000 more specialist doctors and nurses who have been providing services whom the Health Ministry wants to bring into the formal structure, again most of them already cooperating with the Ministry so this should not present any problems.\n\nThe use of NGOs as employers and channels of aid did create higher administrative costs, as there was that belt of administrators and NGO heads who added little value that could not be done by the Ministry administrative staff, which is kept very tight as Ministers of Health like to see their staff budget going to health professionals providing health services rather than to administration.\n\nDr Mombeshora wants the health professionals and community health workers, but is unlikely to want a pile of extra bureaucrats.\n\nSo, while Zimbabwe will have to find a significant chunk of the money that might be lost if the US decides to withdraw all or most of its health aid, the higher levels of efficiency and simpler reporting structures and better use of medical staff will mean that not every dollar has to be replaced.\n\nDr Mombeshora was also anxious to reassure those who have been receiving medication with significant levels of US aid funding, including quite large chunks of the anti-retrovirals and tuberculosis medication for example, that steps were already being taken to buy the next shipments required with the present respectable stocks able to last to June.\n\nThe Health Ministry and the Government in general does not expect any disruptions, regardless of what final decisions are made in the United States.\n\nAs we have commented before, the Second Republic has been able to cope with budgetary emergencies remarkably smoothly since it reformed the whole fiscal system in 2018.\n\nThe Covid-19 emergency and the need to feed several millions of Zimbabweans for almost a year after the last harvest was so badly hit by severe drought were both largely funded by some rapid and sensible rebudgeting.\n\nThe probable need for a higher health budget has already been addressed by the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion, which is looking at ring-fencing more taxes for health, as well as intensifying efforts to make sure that those who are supposed to pay taxes establish their relationship with Zimra so they do pay.\n\n",

            "content": "Nelson Gahadza\n\nSenior Business Reporter\n\nThe Life Officers Association (LOA) says sector players should take advantage of the prevailing stability to build resilience in Zimbabwes life insurance industry, which is key in mobilising long-term savings for the economy.\n\nLOA represents life insurance companies in Zimbabwe and was established to promote the industrys growth and sustainability. It also collaborates with regulators, policymakers, and financial institutions.\n\nThe insurance and pensions industrys penetration rate, which peaked at 5,7 percent in 2004, is currently at between 1,5 and 2 percent.\n\nStakeholders that include sector players, the Government, and the Insurance and Pensions Commission (Ipec), are engaged ininitiatives to restore trust and grow the penetration rate.\n\nLOA Secretary General Mr Rufai Mavukeni told media engagement on Friday said to build resilience in the sector, assets related to the customers need to be protected.\n\nCurrently we are in a multi-currency environment, but we are proposing that by 2030 we should have a mono-currency arrangement.\n\nAs the industry, we are saying from experience the assets related to our policyholders need to be protected to avoid loss of value that has happened before, he said.\n\nMr Mavukeni said in the future, the industry would work with policymakers to come up with policies that will protect the assets against inflation.\n\nWe were allowed to start investing offshore last year to protect some of the values that we hold on behalf of our customers.\n\nHowever, the procedure to invest offshore will be simplified this year, and that will allow us to be able to raise our investments outside, he said.\n\nThe Justice George Smith-led Commission of Inquiry set up by the Government in 2015 found that some policyholders and pension scheme members were prejudiced by the conversion process during dollarisation and recommended they be compensated.\n\nThe commission blamed the value erosion on poor regulatory enforcement and the demonetisation of the local currency.\n\nFrom these experiences, policyholders and pension scheme members feel that they were shortchanged, and as a result, their confidence in insurance and pensions industry ebbed.\n\nAs part of efforts to finalise the compensation, Ipec has since halted the dissolution of pension funds pending the conclusion of pre-2009 compensation to ensure fairness among members.\n\nCompensation is one of the initiatives recommended by the Government to restore confidence within the pensions and financial services sectors.\n\nAs a result, the government set aside US$175 million towards that effort, and pension funds were asked to come up with their frameworks and payment plans.\n\nMr Mavukeni said after 2030, either the multicurrency regime should continue or the investment that has been made should be ring-fenced in order to protect policyholders.\n\nBut we are proposing that beyond 2030 the multicurrency regime should continue given a semblance of stability in the currency market. It is the stable currency that we are looking for so that our industry can grow, he said.\n\nMr Mavukeni said the industry should also be innovative and invest in alternative asset classes that can be able to save the value of investments.\n\nWe are encouraging our members to be innovative and invest in information technology (IT). For instance, through IT, that is how Ecosure Life is meeting the market, he said.\n\nHe said the members should also be more involved in investment on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) and the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX).\n\nWe would like the Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe (SecZim) to deepen the investment market so that we are given more options to invest our savings. That way we can create value for the customers, said Mr Mavukeni.\n\nHe said policymakers should ensure consistency of policies to sustain a stable environment where the industry is able to trade without fear of losing value.\n\nWe also believe that our industry should be involved in the modern system of investment, such as issues like blockchain and mobile money platforms that are very useful in todays world. They improve transparency, efficiency, and premium collection, said Mr Mavukeni.\n\n",

            "content": "Walter Nyamukondiwa\n\nMashonaland West Bureau Chief\n\nThere is no chance of a crisis in ZANU PF for as long as the membership does not allow people outside the party to use them to speak on their behalf, Politburo member Cde Ziyambi Ziyambi has said.\n\nAddressing the Mashonaland West Provincial Coordinating Committee meeting in Chinhoyi yesterday, Cde Ziyambi said party members should be wary of remnants of the G40, colonialists and other detractors bent on causing divisions in the party for a political comeback.\n\nAt every stage as Zanu PF we have several enemies that would want to celebrate the demise of the party. We have the opposition, remnants from the G40, remnants from the colonialists and other detractors, said Cde Ziyambi.\n\nI want to focus on remnants of the G40 and the opposition (CCC). They will take every opportunity to fan the flames of divisions within the party and its leadership.\n\nParty members, he said, should be careful not to be used as mouthpieces of the G40 and opposition.\n\nHe said enemies of the party had deployed misinformation and overplaying non-existent divisions in the partys leadership in a bid to weaken the party.\n\nWe should not allow people who are not in Zanu PF to use our mouths to speak for them. You should be careful that you are not used by the G40 to speak on their behalf to cause divisions in the party.\n\nWe are now being used by the enemy to be their mouthpiece to cause divisions so that they takeover the running of the country. So if as a party we make a decision, we stick with the decision, he said.\n\nIn his entire life in Government, he said, there was not a single time he had seen or heard the Vice Presidents General (Retired) Constantino Chiwenga and Colonel (Rtd) Kembo Mohadi and the National Chairman Cde Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri being disrespectful to the President.\n\nCde Ziyambi said Zanu PF was a strong and resilient party that had always managed to deal with internal contradictions throughout its history by observing a strict disciplinary code that espouses the revolutionary ethos.\n\nDetractors of the party, he said, have waded into the partys 2030 Conference Resolution as if they were in the party.\n\nThey take the 2030 Resolution as if its theirs, or it has anything to do with them. This is a Zanu PF resolution and they start suggesting that so and so should be taking over, but there is no such provision in the Zanu PF constitution.\n\nIt doesnt talk of a sun that hasnt set and how the setting sun should set and how the rising sun should rise. There is no other sun that rises before the one that has risen sets, he said.\n\nThe Zanu PF constitution, said Cde Ziyambi, was clear on what happens when the incumbent is leaving.\n\nIf you find yourself having another chairman for Mash West when the incumbent (Cde Mary Mliswa-Chikoka) is still there, then there is a problem, he said.\n\nCde Ziyambi implored party members to be vigilant and ensure that their actions do not destabilise the party.\n\nCde Mliswa urged party members to shun social media groups that fan divisions in the party.\n\nShe said Zanu PF had laid down procedures, which should be followed.\n\nDeputy national political commissar Cde Webster Shamu said party members should shun abuse of social media as it had the potential to affect the party.\n\n",
