Roads were opened while most developments were already at an advanced stage.\n\nHowever, the accused persons started illegally selling and allocating stands in the area. Mr Pasades company allegedly went to court and acquired a High Court order which gave it the authority to remove the illegally settled people.\n\nHowever, the accused persons did not vacate the stands, contrary to the court order. It is the States case that on November 2023, the High Court issued a provisional order against Eastwind Trust.\n\nAfter the order was granted, the accused were served by the Sheriff, but continued invading the area in violation of the order.\n\nThe complainant is Homegram Investments Limited, represented by Mr Pasade.\n\n",
