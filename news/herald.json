When the agreement of sale was done, Nyabadza allegedly misrepresented to Geza that the piece of land had title deeds which he would avail in a months time but failed to deliver.\n\nChirenje told the court that while Geza was in process of obtaining subdivision permits for the land from the Department of Physical Planning in Mashonaland West Province, he discovered that Nyabadza had sold the same land to Velda Estates.\n\nThe court heard that Geza engaged Nyabadza hoping for an amicable solution only to discover that his agreement of sale was cancelled without him being informed.\n\nThe matter was reported to the police leading to Nyabadza being summoned to the courts.\n\nMagistrate Mazhande remanded the matter to January 31 for ruling on the application for exemption.\n\nGeza suffered prejudice of US$1 362 000 and nothing was recovered.\n\n",

She pleaded not guilty. The presiding magistrate Mr Donald Ndirowei deferred the matter to January 24 for judgement.\n\nInvestigations established that Marimo allegedly conspired with Pauline Maganga, the infants mother, to traffic the child to Australia.\n\nMaganga was jailed for 10 years in May this year at the Harare Magistrates Court for her part in the deal.\n\nMaganga told the court that she started to chat with Marimo on Facebook in connection with child adoption in March last year and was made to join the group administered by Marimo.\n\nIn that group, there were six active members all females, including myself, and it had two female members from South Africa, two females from the United States, Janet Marimo and myself, she said.\n\nMaganga said when she was six months pregnant she sent a message to the group informing the other members that she not in a position to look after herself and her unborn child due to lack of resources.\n\nAll the group members responded to my message. They were all willing to look after me during my pregnancy, to meet the hospital bills, and then take the child after birth for adoption, she said.\n\nMarimo then came to my inbox advising me that I must not give the other group members my child since they would take my child for organ donations. She emphasised that I was supposed to give her my child after birth and we agreed.\n\nMaganga told the court that on June 27 last year, she went to Far East Hospital in Johannesburg to deliver her child and this is where she met Marimo physically for the first time.\n\nSince I was a foreigner I was supposed to pay R2 800 for the hospital bills to be given the childs birth card and birth record. Marimo gave me R1 000 to pay on the day and the balance of R1 800 was supposed to be paid by the end of July.\n\nI was only given the childs birth card and I was told that I would collect the childs birth record after paying the balance, she explained to the court.\n\nAfter the childs birth, Maganga agreed that Marimo would pay her R25 000 and then take the child for adoption, an obligation that was fulfilled.\n\nAccording to prosecutor Mr Tendai Tapi, the arrangement was for Maganga to obtain the babys birth certificate by October 29, but she did not fulfil this requirement.\n\nThis situation led Marimo bringing the baby to Zimbabwe illegally. She was apprehended in Waterfalls on November 27.\n\nUpon learning of Marimos arrest, Maganga returned to Zimbabwe on December 12. The child is now in the care of the Department of Social Welfare.\n\n",
