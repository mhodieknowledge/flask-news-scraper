However, we must also empower our youths by providing them with life-changing opportunities.\n\nMinister Machakaire said plans to ensure the youth can participate in various Government projects, including construction and road refurbishment were being implemented to give them tangible work opportunities, regardless of the projects scale.\n\nHe said reducing the high unemployment rate among young people remains a primary objective for the Government.\n\nOur youths are the future leaders of this nation, and it is essential to empower them through quality education and entrepreneurial skills to shape their futures and improve their livelihoods.\n\nWe aim to promote youth-led projects by facilitating technology transfer and creating connections between technology suppliers, financial institutions, and young innovators, said Minister Machakaire.\n\nIn separate interviews, various youth groups expressed excitement and had high hope that todays event will speak to their issues and inspire them.\n\nZimbabwe Vision (ZimVi) 2030 Implementers leader Mr Archibald Siziba said they will use the platform express appreciation of President Mnangagwa positive policies.\n\nAs a beneficiary of the Second Republics youth empowerment programmes, I can confidently say that success is within reach only takes participation, dedication, and a willingness to see beyond misinformation, said Mr Siziba.\n\nBy 2030, I see myself as a millionaire, not because I waited for handouts, but because I took advantage of the opportunities provided by President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nThe future is bright for those who embrace Vision 2030 and walk the path of progress. The President has opened the doors, its up to the youth to walk through them.\n\nAnother youth, Mr Addington Mpofu, said the Second Republic has done extremely well in empowering young people and making sure they become drivers of the economy and critical party of the mainstream economy.\n\nIf you look at the agriculture sector, we have seen young people now participating and Zimbabwe is now one of the very few countries that have the highest number of young people in the agriculture sector, said Mr Mpofu.\n\nIf you go to the mining sector, most of the people there are young people, traditionally mining is an old sector but now its being run by youth.\n\nThe President has been very instrumental in making sure that young people are the drivers of the economy and if you look at our ministers now, most of them are young capable people who are in key strategic ministries.\n\nZanu PF Bulawayo provincial spokesperson Cde Archie Chiponda said Zimbabwe is blessed to be endowed with hardworking and highly intelligent youths who have shown the ability to adapt to any economic environment.\n\nThe issue of reserved sectors for indigenous needs to be implemented effectively as those sectors are the sectors in which we would naturally see a high amount of youth participation, said Cde Chiponda.\n\n",

So today is not about just trivialisation, but its wanting to hear your views because as you currently know, before Parliament is the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill.\n\nIt is going to be read on Tuesday for the second reading of the Bill.

            "content": "Columbus Mabika-Herald Reporter\n\nPolitical commentators yesterday said the removal of Zimbabwe Defense Industries (ZDI) from the sanctions list by the European Union (EU) is a sign of acknowledgement by the West that sanctions were wicked and malicious, while it is also a step towards the universal removal of the embargo.\n\nThe EU on Wednesday delisted the ZDI from the restrictive measures imposed in 2002 but maintained an embargo on arms and equipment.\n\n(EU) Council renews restrictive measures framework and delists one entity. The Council today renewed its framework for restrictive measures in view of the situation in Zimbabwe for a further year, until 20 February 2026. The Council also delisted the last remaining entity, the Zimbabwe Defence Industries. The embargo on arms and equipment . . . remains in place, the EU said.\n\nThe development comes as the SADC region and the African continent at large have joined the long growing band of calls for sanctions which have caused untold suffering on the Zimbabwean populace and hampered economic development to be removed.\n\nFormer legislator and National Peace and Reconciliation Commissioner Mr Obert Gutu said the removal was positive but universal removal of sanctions should be immediate.\n\nBy removing the Zimbabwe Defence Industries from the illegal, punitive and ruinous sanctions list, the EU is simply acknowledging the fact that these sanctions were wicked and malicious in the very first place and also that theyre no longer serving any purpose, he said.\n\nRight from the outset there was absolutely no legal justification to place the ZDI under these malevolent sanctions, the whole idea was to punish Zimbabwe for the revolutionary land reform programme that is irreversible and that Zimbabwes sovereignty is not for sale.\n\nFundamentally, Mr Gutu said these illegal sanctions were simply meant to make Zimbabwes economy scream with the aim of collapsing the national economy.\n\nThe removal of ZDI from the sanctions, he said, will enable the company to trade normally and also be able to easily access modern technology in the armaments industry.\n\nHe said this will definitely make the ZDI more efficient, competitive and more profitable.\n\nAnother political analyst, Dr Tongai Dana concurred saying the EU decision to remove ZDI from the sanctions list marks a significant milestone, not just for the defence sector but for the broader national economy.\n\nThis move signals a shift towards re-engagement, opening doors for economic expansion, industrial growth, and enhanced national security. While challenges remain, this development offers Zimbabwe an opportunity to reclaim its place in the global defence and economic landscape, fostering resilience and self-sufficiency in the face of restrictions, he said.\n\nHe said the development signals the possibility of re-engagement.\n\nThis move sits at the intersection of realism, where strategic interests dictate foreign policy, and constructivism, which acknowledges that international relations are shaped by evolving norms and diplomatic recalibration, he said.\n\nDefence industries worldwide, he said, serve as critical engines for industrialisation, job creation, and technological advancement.\n\nIn Zimbabwes case, the development will unlock access to global defence markets, facilitate technology transfer, and enhance financial transactions, previously stifled by restrictions.\n\nFrom a national security perspective, Dr Dana said the ability to develop an independent defence industry reduces reliance on foreign arms suppliers, a challenge faced by many African nations vulnerable to external pressures leading to terrorism.\n\nAnti-sanctions activist, Mr Witness Dube, said the removal of ZDI from the sanctions list has a positive impact on the economy.\n\nThis is a sign that the relationship between Zimbabwe and the EU is thawing and an acknowledgement of the existence of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, which were the reasons cited for the sanctions in the first place, he said.\n\nRemoval of ZDI as an entity is positive for economic growth as this company can now go all out to attract foreign investment while trading on the international stage. Growth in this sector will open doors for the yet unknown economic activity that has been subdued by sanctions, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Rumbidzayi Zinyuke-Senior Health Reporter\n\nZimbabwe has launched an aggressive fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a hidden yet lethal crisis that has already claimed thousands of lives.\n\nIn 2019 alone, more than 15 000 people succumbed to drug-resistant infections, highlighting the urgent need for action.\n\nYesterday, the Government and its partners launched the second National Action Plan for AMR (2024-2028), setting the tone for the country to address the growing threat of AMR through a comprehensive One Health approach.\n\nThe One Health approach recognises the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health.\n\nWith support from the UK government, through the Fleming Fund phase 2 that has committed 2,5 million, Zimbabwe will expand surveillance, strengthen regulations, and promote responsible use of antimicrobials in healthcare and agriculture.\n\nSpeaking at the launch, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora said if unchecked, AMR could cost Zimbabwe up to 7 percent of its Gross Domestic Product by 2050.\n\nIf we dont act now, the cost will be devastatingnot just in lives lost but in livelihoods destroyed, families torn apart, and opportunities missed, he said.\n\nAMR doesnt respect borders; it doesnt care about wealth or privilege. It threatens us all. Its fuelled by the misuse of antimicrobials in healthcare, on our farms, and even in our environment.\n\nIf we do nothing, by 2050, this crisis could claim 10 million lives annually and cut global GDP by trillions. Here at home, the stakes are high, not to mention the strain it will place on our healthcare system and our farmers. But this is not a time for despair; its a time for action.\n\nThe first National Action Plan, which ran from 2017 to 2022, supported the provision of essential medicines and services in health and animal institutions as well as the introduction of AMR modules in nursing curricula, among many other activities.\n\nDr Mombesora said the new plan was built on five pillars that would guide the national response to AMR.\n\nThese included raising awareness, strengthening surveillance systems, promoting prevention practices, optimising antimicrobial use and fostering research and innovation.\n\nThe 2024-2028 National Action Plan is bolder, smarter, and more inclusive. It adopts the One Health approach, which recognises that human, animal, and environmental health are deeply connected.\n\nThis plan is about bringing everyone to the tablehealthcare workers, farmers, scientists, and policymakersto tackle AMR together, he said.\n\nDr Mombesora said the Government would ensure the successful implementation of the plan through the provision of human and financial resources to supply essential medicines and consumables for the populace and animals.\n\nThe Fleming Fund Grant II aims to address gaps in surveillance and the use of data generated for policy-making.\n\nAs Zimbabwe, we are grateful to our development partners who have been providing technical and financial support to the implementation of activities to mitigate AMR.\n\nFellow Zimbabweans, this is our moment to rise to the occasion. Let us commit to this plan, not just in words but in action. Let us show the world what Zimbabwe can achieve when we come together with purpose and resolve, said Dr Mombeshora.\n\nLands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Minister, Dr Anxious Masuka, who was represented by the Chief Director Veterinary Department, Dr Pious Makaya, said the launch of the second Plan was a pivotal moment in the collective fight against AMR.\n\nOver the past five years, we have made strides in improving our surveillance systems, building laboratory capacity, and strengthening the overall one-world effort.\n\nAs we launch the NAP 2, we move forward with renewed energy and purpose. We build on the lessons learned and the challenges faced during the first phase, and we invest in the new opportunities and collaborations that are emerging, he said.\n\nDr Mombeshora commended the collaborative approach used in the fight against AMR.\n\nMinister of Environment, Climate and Wildlife Dr Sithembiso Nyoni, who was represented by deputy director in the Ministry, Mr Abu Matiza, recognised the critical role the environment plays in the maintenance and strength of AMRs.\n\nAntimicrobial residues in our ecosystems stemming from various sources can contribute significantly to the development of resistance.\n\nThe environment is a reservoir of antimicrobial-resistant microbes and pathogens. Ensuring this reservoir does not sieve or pass on these microbes is critical in guaranteeing the success of environmental solutions in addressing the antimicrobial resistance threat, she said.\n\nFood and Agriculture Organisation sub-regional coordinator for southern Africa and representative for Zimbabwe, Eswatini and Lesotho Dr Pratrice Talla said the integration of AMR into agri-food policies was crucial to ensuring that antimicrobial use in livestock, aquaculture and crop production was both responsible and sustainable.\n\nZimbabwes livestock sector plays a vital role in the national economy and rural livelihoods, with a significant proportion of rural households keeping poultry, which serves as a safety net for food security and income generation.\n\nHowever, the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in poultry and livestock farming can accelerate the spread of resistant pathogens, threatening both animal and human health, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Today is National Youth Day with the maincelebration being held in Bulawayo, and both the name of the day and venue for this years central celebration are important.\n\nThe day only became a public holiday under the Second Republic, and President Mnangagwa has stressed the national nature of the day from its inception.\n\nIn one sense, the choice of Bulawayo is doubly symbolic of the national nature of the holiday. While it is useful for a February holiday to choose a location where it is easy to find venues that allow gatherings if it rains, the Second Republic has been determined to rotate the main national occasions round the country to emphasise both their national nature and that all parts of Zimbabwe are included in the concept.\n\nThe main reason for a national day, and the associated public holiday, is to concentrate attention on our young people, their needs and their expectations, and to celebrate their accomplishments.\n\nThe younger generations are a majority of the population, so they are important, and the future of Zimbabwe will fairly obviously be built around what they do and what they do not do. So it is very important that what they do is productive and constructive and that they do not drift into the self-destruction of drugs and alcohol abuse.\n\nA lot has been done since Independence and is still being done to ensure that all children have a full primary education and at least four years of secondary education. Curriculums are being adjusted to make this basic education more effective and to introduce a great deal more relevance to studies and ensure that all children, regardless of examination results, have a decent base on which to further their training and skills.\n\nWhile the same post-Independence thrust saw a rapid and dramatic expansion in university and polytechnic education, this still left a lot of young people behind.\n\nA lot of tertiary education requires in practice A-Level, although technically a very good O-Level certificate is the minimum for many non-degree diploma and higher diploma courses.\n\nSo what about the rest, the majority, of the youth. Here the Second Republic has been active with the rapid expansion of vocational training and making sure the training centres are dispersed to they are practically accessible.\n\nNow, more is being done to measure the skills that people learn, so that future customers, and bankers, of those who set up their own businesses know who they are dealing with, and future employers have an idea of what they might be hiring.\n\nObviously a lot more needs to be done in this regard, to build on President Mnangagwas declarations that no person and no place must be left behind as Zimbabwe advances. But at least we are now headed in the right direction, and a lot more effort and attention is being directed at ensuring that there are advances.\n\nThe importance is that all young people as they leave school are now being catered for and are seeing opportunities opening up.\n\nThe creation of a dedicated Ministry of Youth Empowerment, Development and Vocational Training highlights the decisions to turn rhetoric into practical programmes with its own slice of the national budget and with officials all having their accomplishments measured in another of President Mnangagwas policies, that political leaders and officials all have to deliver.\n\nA lot has been spoken about the dangers youths face, with drugs and alcohol topping many lists, and young girls in danger of forced marriages while still in their teens. Effective programmes are already in place, and being made better and expanded, to deal with these menaces. But a lot of the temptations and pressures would be dramatically reduced if all youths could get ahead and earn a reasonable income.\n\nWe have noted comments coming from parents and community leaders when investors in a particular area hire local youths where possible, or when the contractors for major infrastructure contracts hire local youths. Comments tend to centre on the fact that their young adult children are highly unlikely to be taking drugs if they are gainfully employed.\n\nLike most developing countries Zimbabwe at the moment has a demographic dividend. The falling birth rates in recent decades, and the far lower size of the population in the past, means that the percentage of the population who are too old to work or are still children is low compared to what we see in most developed countries. We have what is known as a low theoretic dependency ratio.\n\nWith a significant majority of the population in what are seen as the working years of most peoples lives, it is essential for our development that all those in that long gap between childhood and old age are in fact productive and building the wealth of the nation as well as earning their own living and supporting their families.\n\nThis is another point that needs stressing, that we need our youth to be productive, and for that matter paying their share of taxes out of that production, if our economy is to keep growing, and that means there are national needs, as well a human needs, to making sure that every youth is equipped to be productive.\n\nSo the concentration of thought that we hope we will see through our National Youth Day is a major requirement for a better, more prosperous and more equitable Zimbabwe.\n\n",

Zimbabwes biggest multilateral creditors include the World Bank, which is owed US$1,5 billion, the African Development Bank Group US$760 million, and the European Investment Bank US$427 million.\n\nThe countrys domestic debt stands at US$8,7 billion.\n\nTo address the debt issue, the Government established the Structured Dialogue Platform, a collaborative effort between Zimbabwe and international financial institutions to resolve the countrys debt situation.\n\nThis platform is already working to chart a course towards comprehensive debt restructuring to reopen access to cheaper and long term international financing.\n\nSufficient progress across the three pillars of the Structured Dialogue Platform would allow Zimbabwe to fully re-engage with multilateral financial institutions and provide significant amounts of new funding to Zimbabwe.\n\nAfter nearly two years of dialogue with development partners, Zimbabwe is looking to accelerate the arrears clearance and debt resolution process by working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under a staff-monitored programme (SMP).\n\nThe SMP falls under the economic reforms Zimbabwe is undertaking as part of the process to clear its US$21 billion public debt and arrears.\n\nAddressing the sixth Structural Dialogue Platform in November 2024, President Mnangagwa expressed support for the IMF programme and called for provisional financial support to protect vulnerable groups of the population that will be negatively affected.\n\nZimbabwe has not been able to access funding from the multilateral lender since the turn of the century due to its arrears position.\n\nIt cannot also get concessional loans from other multilateral lenders due to the pari passu rule, a principle which requires the lenders to treat defaulters the same way.\n\nIn this regard, the protection of the vulnerable groups, through effective social protection programmes is of critical importance to my Government, President Mnangagwa told creditors, development partners, private sector players, civil society organisations and farmers organisations at the high-level dialogue.\n\nAfrican Development Bank President Dr Akinwumi Adesina termed the IMF staff programme a significant milestone towards concretising the arrears clearance and debt resolution.\n\nI would like to urge here that our collective efforts will be critical to ensure that this is a wet-SMP (a supported staff monitored programme) that will provide fiscal space for the country to implement needed reforms and protect the vulnerable populations, said Dr Adesina, who was appointed by President Mnangagwa the Champion of the debt resolution process.\n\nDr Prosper Chitambara, an economist noted, The dialogue has laid out a clear roadmap for Zimbabwe to address its external debt obligations methodically.\n\nSuccessful implementation will not only restore Zimbabwes creditworthiness but also catalyse significant injections of concessional financing, critical for achieving sustainable growth targets.\n\nCentral to this strategy is Zimbabwes Vision 2030, a series of economic milestones the country must achieve through inclusive economic transformation and poverty alleviation.\n\nWith arrears clearance and debt resolution at its core, Vision 2030 envisions a future where robust public and private investments drive tangible socio-economic progress across all sectors.\n\nVision 2030 hinges on our ability to secure affordable external credit lines and stimulate domestic investment, Mr Kaunda said.\n\nThrough clearing arrears and resolving debt issues, we are positioning Zimbabwe as a magnet for global capital, ushering in an era of unprecedented growth and prosperity.\n\n",
