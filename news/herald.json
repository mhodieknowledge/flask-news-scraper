            "content": "Africa Moyo, Deputy News Editor\n\nTHE amount of ZiG circulating in the market matches the Governments aspirations for durable currency stability desired by consumers, a Cabinet Minister has said.\n\nExplaining Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwes tight fiscal and monetary policy positions, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube said the prevailing exchange rate stability where the official and parallel market rates were almost converging was not artificial and would be sustained for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis follows concerns by some members of the transacting public and industrialists about the alleged shortage of the ZiG, which they claimed was affecting the economy.\n\nSome critics say ZiG shortages have resulted in an artificial inflation level, which would rise if more local currency became available on the market.\n\nThe domestic currency monthly inflation rate matched the US dollar rate in January, following a spike driven by increases in rentals.\n\nIn January 2025, Zimbabwes month-on-month inflation rate in ZiG terms surged to 105 percent, a significant increase from the previous months 3,7 percent, compared to the 11,5 percent rate for the US dollar monthly inflation rate.\n\nThe ZiG monthly inflation rate came in at 0,5 percent in February and remains well below the 5 percent monthly range set by Treasury.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Herald, Prof Ncube said Zimbabwes low inflation trajectory was not artificial.\n\nInflation is what it is. But also the accusation is that theres no money in the market. That is what is called a tight monetary policy; that is actually the technical definition, he said.\n\nSo, right now, we have a policy that is tight in order to manage inflation in the first place. That is the objective; so its not artificial.\n\nA tight monetary policy, also known as contractionary monetary policy, is a strategy used by a central bank to limit the amount of money available in the economy and may include raising interest rates to curb inflation and speculative borrowing.\n\nThe level of inflation is commensurate with the ZIG money supply that is at hand, and it is appropriate that the Reserve Bank is conducting such tight monetary policy, said Prof Ncube.\n\nThat monetary policy is complemented, also, by a tight fiscal policy because what you dont want is for Government spending to run away, getting out of control to a point where we have to monetise that excess budget deficit.\n\nHe said doing that would drive the money supply and raise inflation, pushing prices of most products beyond the reach of many.\n\nA tight fiscal policy involves a government making sure it lives within its means. In this case, all current and capital spending on social services come out of taxes.\n\nOnly capital spending that produces an instant flow of extra money to repay a loan can be supported by borrowing. This means that the Government does not create money and thus feeding inflation.\n\nProf Ncube said a tight fiscal policy and a tight monetary policy went hand in hand.\n\nThat is what we have right now and that is why the ZiG is stable in the first place. The economy and citizens have been crying out for a stable macroeconomic environment and that is what we are delivering right now. So people should be pleased that at least, we are delivering what is expected of us as the economic policymakers, he said.\n\nThey demanded stability; it allows them to plan, it gives our domestic currency, ZIG, value. You can now save in it, you can transact in it, you restore value characteristics.\n\nZimbabwes monetary policy focuses on maintaining a tight stance, backing Treasurys tight fiscal stance, to stabilise the ZiGand curb inflation, with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe aiming to ensure all ZiG in circulation is well-covered by foreign currency reserves.\n\nZiG is backed by gold and foreign reserves.\n\nThe RBZs gold and foreign reserves accumulation strategy in 2024 has resulted in its gold holdings increasing from 1,5 tonnes to 2,7 tonnes.\n\nThe monetary value of gold and foreign currencies ended last year at over US$500 million, which is more than three times cover for the ZiG in circulation.\n\nIn its Strategy Plan (2025-2029), the RBZ exclusively focuses on its core mandate of maintaining price and financial stability, which is aligned to the Back-to-Basics thrust aimed at balancing Confidence-Trust-Credibility-Efficiency-Stability-Growth outcomes.\n\n",

You can see from the results of elections in our region that we are under attack, she said.\n\nTo maintain unity and achieve victory for the revolutionary party, President Nandi-Ndaitwah believes that implementing SADC programmes is essential.\n\nDeveloping regional value chains is essential for promoting economic growth, creating jobs, and improving the well-being of our people, she said.\n\nWe must change our mindset and pour resources on value addition and beneficiation.\n\nPresident Nandi-Ndaitwah pointed to Europes specialised production model, where nations focus on manufacturing specific parts of a product.

            "content": "EXACTLY 21 years after she lifted the nations spirits and flew the countrys flag high because of her sporting achievements, Kirsty Coventry has returned to cheer Zimbabweans again, providing yet another golden moment for her motherland.\n\nIn 2004, in the swimming pools of Athens in Greece, Coventry became the first individual athlete to win a medal for Zimbabwe at the Olympic Games, kick-starting a series that would see her not only become the countrys fabled Golden Girl, but Africas most decorated Olympian as she would harvest more medals at the 2008 edition in Beijing, China.\n\nFast forward to 2025 and in the country where she struck gold in the swimming pool, the Minister of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture powered to a stunning International Olympic Committee (IOC) election victory that broke the ceiling in the 130-year history of the worlds biggest sporting institution.\n\nShe became the first woman president of the IOC after convincingly beating a very strong field of revered contestants, who are highly-rated sports administrators including Juan Antonio Samaranch Salisachs, a Spanish sports executive and financial analyst who currently serves as the vice president of the IOC and World Athletics president Sebastian Coe.\n\nCoventry polled 49 of the 97 votes at stake, Samaranch had 28 and Coe, a very distant third with a paltry eight.\n\nThus Zimbabweans, Africans and the global sporting family at large have every reason to celebrate Coventrys milestone.\n\nHer historic triumph sees her become the first African to lead the IOC and the youngest person to assume leadership of the Movement after its founding president Pierre de Coubertin, who was 33 when he ascended to the helm.\n\nWhile the huge election victory has naturally drawn massive celebrations and an outpouring of love for Coventry from across the globe, Zimbabweans must draw extra inspiration from her historic feat.\n\nAt 41, she was the youngest among those who were vying for the IOC presidency yet in her career as an athlete, as a sports administrator and as a Cabinet Minister, Coventry has been an epitome of resilience and determination.\n\nZimbabweans can only repay the kind of faith and confidence that the world has reposed in Coventry by ensuring we all put shoulders to the wheel and uplift our sporting standards, that have over the years slumped.\n\nAs a small nation, we have already shown the world that we can produce gold medallists at the ultimate global sporting competition  the Olympics, having done so at this countrys birth in 1980 when the Womens hockey team won gold at the Moscow Games in Russia.\n\nIndeed, her triumph in the IOC elections in which the Government has naturally led the way in celebrating, is an epic moment for Zimbabwe.\n\nThe stuff that real history is made of, a triumph that has left even some of this beautiful countrys detractors not only in awe, but having to admit the folly of their negative campaigning, which sadly for them could not sway the IOC voters.\n\nCoventry has a vision to see the IOC playing a bigger role in bridging the gap between the Haves and the Have nots and our various national sporting associations must implement policies that deliberately uplift marginalised sectors of our sport.\n\nHer election should inspire the young people in the country to take sport more seriously from a very young age.\n\nIt should also inspire more women to participate in sport.\n\nAfter all it is women, who have achieved the most for Zimbabwe on the international sporting stage, starting with the hockey Golden Girls, through to the netball Gems who have been to the two World Cup showcases and the womens football team  the Mighty Warriors who reached the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nOf course, Coventrys election does not mean Zimbabwe is now capable of hosting the Olympics, but her illustrious career as an Olympian has inspired thousands of young athletes to take up swimming as their discipline of choice.\n\nHer extensive experience and profound knowledge of the sporting ecosystem is a feat which all out sporting institutions can only tap into.\n\nIt is through her passion and vision for sport that as Minister, she has demanded professionalism at national associations.\n\nWe believe that this country is endowed with the talent but that talent could come to nought if not accorded the important support systems especially those that guarantee Long Term Athlete Development.\n\nShe has made this country proud since her teenage days when she competed in the Commonwealth Games.\n\nIn her new role as IOC president, Zimbabweans can only make her proud by ensuring we produce Olympic medallists and grow the numbers of our athletes who qualify for the quadrennial Games.\n\nHer manifesto was based on the principles of Ubuntu which speaks to and prioritises team work and collectivism over individualism.\n\nUbuntu asserts that society shapes our humanity: I am because we are.\n\nThis is a guiding principle that enhances a practical approach to interpersonal relationships.\n\nA principle so valuable our national supporting associations and Zimbabweans at large should adopt in growing our sport, our economy and our beautiful country.\n\nThank you Kirsty for the Olympic legacy.\n\n",
