Pollution, noise, and habitat destruction caused by mining will ruin the visitor experience and harm Zimbabwes tourism industry, Mr Farawo said.\n\nWe will not stand by and allow wildlife habitats to be destroyed. Our duty is to protect these lands for the benefit of all Zimbabweans and future generations, he said.\n\nSinamatella is also home to the historic Bumbusi Monument, a culturally significant site for the local Nambia-speaking communities.\n\nTraditional leaders conduct annual rainmaking ceremonies there, and locals feel that mining activities could disrupt these sacred rituals.\n\n",
