Surviving the Chimoio attack, Cde Mandipaza displayed resilience that inspired many. He played an integral role in the formation of the Zimbabwe National Army, contributing to the establishment of the 1 Mechanised Brigade.\n\nHe also described how the provincial hero contributed towards food security through his farming prowess.\n\nAfter retiring from the army, Cde Mandipaza continued to serve his community through agriculture, embracing the land reform program and contributing to the Vision 2030 initiative, he said.\n\nHis efforts were not just about his own farm at Longcroft but were aimed at uplifting the lives of those around him, ensuring food security and economic sustainability.\n\nAs we bid farewell to this gallant son of the soil, let us reflect on the values he embodied: bravery, loyalty, and an unyielding commitment to our nations progress. Cde Mandipazas legacy is a call to action for all of us to safeguard our hard-won independence and to remain steadfast in our duty to serve Zimbabwe.\n\n",

            "content": "Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, a broker of peace in the Middle East in his time, and a tireless advocate for global health and human rights, has died, it was announced on Sunday. He was 100 years old.\n\nMy father was a hero, not only to me but to everyone who believes in peace, human rights, and unselfish love, said Chip Carter, the former presidents son, in a statement.\n\nMy brothers, sister, and I shared him with the rest of the world through these common beliefs. The world is our family because of the way he brought people together, and we thank you for honoring his memory by continuing to live these shared beliefs.\n\nA Georgia Democrat, Carter was the longest-lived president in US history. He only served one term in the White House and was soundly beaten by Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\nBut Carter spent the decades afterward focused on international relations and human rights, efforts that won him the Nobel peace prize in 2002.\n\nCarter had undergone a series of hospital stays before and his family said on February 18 last year that he had chosen to spend his remaining time at home, in hospice care and with loved ones.\n\nThe decision had the full support of his family and his medical team, a family statement said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday declared January 9 a national day of mourning, calling on Americans to visit their places of worship to pay homage to the late US leader.\n\nCarters wife, Rosalynn Carter, died last November, two days after her own transition to hospice care.\n\nThe former first lady was 96. The pair married in 1946 and the former president attended her memorial service, traveling from the couples longtime home in Plains, Georgia, to the Glenn Memorial church in Atlanta.\n\nThe Carters eldest grandchild, Jason Carter, had said in a media interview in June this year that the former president was not awake every day but was experiencing the world as best he can as his days were coming to an end.\n\nCarter took office in 1977 as Jimmy Who?, a one-term Georgia governor and devout Christian whose unfamiliarity with Washington was seen as a virtue after the Watergate and Vietnam war years.\n\nHopes for the Carter presidency were dashed, however, by economic and foreign policy crises, starting with high unemployment and double-digit inflation and culminating in the Iran hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. A rolling energy crisis saw the price of oil triple from 1978 to 1980, leading to lines at US gas stations.\n\nSuch struggles belied early promise. In 1977, Carter completed a treaty that had eluded his predecessors to return control of the Panama canal to its host country.\n\nAt Camp David in 1978, Carter brought together the Israeli prime minister, Menachem Begin, and the Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, for a deal that would produce peace that endures today.\n\nCarters fruitless attempts to halt the economic slide led Republicans to label him Jimmy Hoover, after the Depression-era president.\n\nBut as Carter prepared to run for re-election in 1980, it was the Iran hostage crisis that weighed most visibly on Americans minds, the TV anchor Ted Koppel devoting his broadcast five days a week to the plight of 52 Americans held in Tehran.\n\nA botched rescue attempt left eight US servicemen dead and fed doubts about Carters leadership.\n\nReagan, a former California governor, won 44 states. The hostages were released on 20 January 1981, hours after Carter left office, prompting speculation that Republicans had made a deal with Iran.\n\nBroadly unpopular then, Carter went on to become not just the longest-lived president but also to have one of the most distinguished post-presidential careers.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel peace prize for decades of untiring effort for human rights and peacemaking. His humanitarian work was conducted under the Atlanta-based Carter Center, which he founded in the early 1980s, with Rosalynn.\n\nCarter traveled the world as a peace emissary, election observer and public health advocate. He made visits to North Korea in 1994 and Cuba in 2002.\n\nThe Carter Center is credited with helping to cure river blindness, trachoma and Guinea worm disease, which went from millions of cases in Africa and Asia in 1986 to a handful today.\n\nCarter was a critic of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, drone warfare, warrantless government surveillance and the prison at Guantnamo Bay.\n\nHe won admiration, and loathing, for his involvement in efforts for Middle East peace, urging a two-state solution in speeches and books including Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.\n\nHe met Shimon Peres, then president of Israel, on a 2012 trip to Jerusalem, but top Israeli leaders generally shunned Carter after publication of the book. As recently as 2015, requests to meet the prime minister and president were rebuffed.\n\nCarter played a central role in promoting Habitat for Humanity, which provides housing for the needy, and was an alternative energy pioneer, installing solar panels on the White House. (Reagan removed them.)\n\nThe Carters had four children and 11 grandchildren, among them James Carter IV, credited with playing a pivotal role in the 2012 election when he unearthed a video of Mitt Romney casting aspersions on 47 percent of Americans.\n\nJames Earl Carter Jr grew up in Plains, Georgia, a town of fewer than 1 000 and about 150 miles south of Atlanta.\n\nA graduate of the US Naval Academy, he rose to the rank of lieutenant and worked on the nascent nuclear submarine program.\n\nAfter his fathers death in 1953, he took up peanut farming. He was elected to the Georgia senate then won the governorship in 1970, calling for the state to move beyond racial segregation.\n\nCarters blend of moral authority and folksy charisma produced moments of unusually frank national dialogue.\n\nIn a 1979 speech, he spoke semi-spontaneously for half an hour about a crisis of confidence  a fundamental threat to American democracy  nearly invisible in ordinary ways. Americans had fallen into a worship of self-indulgence and consumption, he said, only to learn that piling up material goods cannot fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose.\n\nThe address struck a chord: Carters popularity surged 11 points. But after Reagan and others recast it as a self-indulgent exploration of personal malaise, the speech became a liability.\n\nJames Fallows, a former Carter speechwriter, wrote in 1979 that the president suffered from an inability to generate excitement but would surely outshine most other leaders in the judgment of the Lord.\n\nCarter outlived the two presidents who followed him, Reagan and George HW Bush.\n\nThere will be public observances in Atlanta and Washington DC, followed by a private interment in Plains, Georgia. Carters state funeral, including all public events and motorcade routes, is still pending.-The Guardian\n\n",
