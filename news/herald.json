This is critically important. There are so many children of the same age, same school, but those who find their way to this place should feel privileged, but most importantly, it is because they have performed well, that is why they are able to come and meet the Head of State; I congratulate them, he said.\n\nThe Minister of Primary and Secondary Education, Torerayi Moyo, said the awards for the learners spoke volumes of how rich Zimbabwes Heritage-based Education was and lauded the milestones registered in that sector.\n\nThe importance of this competition is that education should be meaningful. Education that does not produce goods and services that our people need is useless and is not important.\n\nThrough the Heritage-based curriculum, we want to identify talents in our students. Those who are good in law, so be it. They were competing as lawyers. A moot court is like a mock court session where we have judges as adjudicators and they have won, said Minister Moyo.\n\nSo the Heritage-based curriculum ensures that they have identified their career pathway. So, on completion of A-Level, I can envision that these students will proceed to university and study law and become lawyers. So that is the advantage of Heritage-based education that our President has approved and we are implementing it very well.\n\nMinister Moyo commended President Mnangagwa for creating an educational environment that allows good students to excel.\n\nI want to appreciate and thank His Excellency, the President, Cde Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, for affording our students an opportunity to interact and engage with others.\n\nI want to congratulate the students for performing exceptionally well. They managed to come first out of 19 schools, and there were seven countries that participated in the moot court competition.\n\nSo, Zimbabwe will represent the Southern region in the next competition to be held in Ghana in August, and we wish our students very well, he said.\n\nTheir coach, Ms Bernadette Mazambani Chigwida, said it was through sheer hard work that they brought the trophy home.\n\nIt is a competition which is a simulation of your court proceedings. We had seven countries and 19 schools, and out of those 19 schools, our Team Zimbabwe managed to come out first. So we have the best speaker from thecompetition from Zimbabwe; we also have the best female speaker, andI was voted the best adjudicator, said Ms Chigwida.\n\nThe best student speaker, Simbarashe Mujuru, was delighted to meet President Mnangagwa, saying it will spur him to continue working hard.\n\nThe competition was difficult, but through sleepless nights and hard work, we managed to win. The exposure itself and the chance to represent the country is something we will not forget.\n\nThe opportunity to meet the President; this is the person who runs the country and for him to take his time to meet us, is something we appreciate, he said.\n\nThe best female speaker, Kimberly Chamboko, echoed the same sentiments.\n\nIt was very tough  there were many schools, many countries, but we managed to push through many sleepless nights.\n\nIt was a learning experience, trying to learn about the laws and everything, but we managed to come through, and we brought the trophy back home to Zimbabwe, said Chamboko from Heritage School in Borrowdale.\n\nOther students who participated are James Charumbira, Samuelson Kapingidza, and Munotida Foya from St Georges College.\n\nOthers are Trish Kadenhe and Beverly Chifeya from Heritage School.\n\n",

We are now at 99,99 percent in terms of readiness, he said.\n\nMinister Garwe said there were a few minor areas still requiring final touches.\n\nSo we came here with the Minister of Womens Affairs, the Minister of State for Harare Province, the traders themselves represented by their leadership, and all other stakeholders. Everyone is ready and waiting for Friday, he said.\n\nMbare Retail Market Traders Association chairperson Mr Erasmus Fofo praised the President for delivering a modern market.\n\nWe have a listening President. Since the time we had the inferno, we never expected such a beautiful market would be built here, he said.\n\nMr Fofo, however urged the local authority to ensure reasonable prices for traders, especially considering the devastating fire they experienced last year.\n\nMinister Tavengwa assured vendors that the Government is implementing measures to reduce rent burdens and ensure that no one is forced out of business due to unaffordable operating costs.\n\nWe are putting in place concrete measures to ease rent burdens, he said.\n\nNo one should be forced out of business due to unaffordable operating costs. The Government is committed to protecting small traders and vendors, who form the backbone of our informal economy.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume said the market exemplifies a strong partnership between central Government and local Government.\n\nThis was built after the Government declared a national disaster. We got a contractor Masimba Holdings alongside the Government andthe City of Harare.\n\nIn a collaborative effort, we worked together to construct what is a modern, temporary market, while we prepare to restore and rebuild the main market where vendors had been operating from, he said.\n\nMayor Mafume said this first phase had been completed in record time, as promised.\n\nThe vendors will be housed here temporarily while we build the main vegetable market in Mbare. It will also include better facilities, more space, and larger stores for the traders to operate in, he said.\n\nThe new Mbare Traders Market stands as a testament to President Mnangagwas vision of transforming Zimbabwe into an upper middle income economy by 2030.\n\n",

Another major highlight is the sprucing up of the Nembudziya Mortuary, which is receiving modern equipment and structural upgrades.\n\nThe improvements are part of an ongoing commitment to uplift public health services in the area.\n\nIn an interview yesterday, Zanu PF Midlands provincial chairperson Cde Edson Chiherenge said the province was ready to host the giant event.\n\nNow, we are at 80 percent completion, with only minor outstanding works. All the major works have been completed, including structures for buildings at different schools.\n\nContractors are now at the roofing stage while we are also doing floors and plastering, he said.\n\nCde Chiherenge said roads connecting to Gokwe Nembudziya have been rehabilitated.\n\nRoads that connect to the venue include Chakari, Jakani, Hovano, Galavi, Choda, and Copper Queen, and they have been rehabilitated. Tarring of the growth point has also been done.\n\nConstruction of a mortuary at Nembudziya Hospital is almost complete. Drilling of mechanised solarised boreholes is also underway. The stadium is complete, with roofing of changing rooms underway, he said. Locals have expressed optimism about the pace of progress.This is not just a one-day celebration. It is about showing the world what rural Zimbabwe can achieve when development is prioritised, said Mr Trymore Gumbi, a Gokwe villager. Mrs Anotida Runesu also hailed the progress.\n\nWe thank President Mnangagwa for rotating the hosting of national events. Indeed, he is staying true to his word of leaving no one and no place behind, she said. With just a few days remaining, Gokwe is buzzing with anticipation, ready to welcome the nation for a celebration that promises pride, unity, and progress.\n\n",

I spent five years in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe received me very well and I think I accomplished my duty in Zimbabwe. Finally, after 32 years, we finally did the Second Session of Bilateral Joint Commission between Angola and Zimbabwe last year in May.\n\nSo, in that session Angola and Zimbabwe signed 11 legal instruments in different areas like cultural cooperation, sport and other ones, memorandums of understanding between Angola and Zimbabwe. So, Im leaving Zimbabwe in a few weeks, maybe the end of this month, but Zimbabwe for me is still my second home.\n\nSo, I feel Zimbabwe, the relationship between Angola and Zimbabwe is more attractive and I made many friends in Zimbabwe and I thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the cooperation and collaboration between Zimbabwe and Angola, he said.\n\n",

It is part of the Governments broader efforts to modernise its ports of entry.\n\nIt also aligns with global trends towards more streamlined and secure border management through the use of advanced technologies. We expect to use the same system which we are piloting to efficiently clear an anticipated surge of traffic during the forthcoming Easter holidays.\n\nThe new immigration system is complementary to the current automation system at the border where most services are now being digitised.\n\nThe OBMS is able to capture travellers bio-data, picking flagged travellers, auto generating days for visitors, for example allocating 30 days for those visitors travelling on holidays, seven days for business travel and three days for those transiting through our country.\n\nMr Matyora said the new system has helped reduce human interface and rent seeking activities at the border.\n\nWe are piloting the project and so far we are happy with the situation on the ground, he said.\n\nWe are also working with other border agencies to tighten security through the use of CCTVs and drones. This has seen us being able to detect and weed out undesirable persons at the border and its flanks.\n\nMr Matyora said through collaborations with other border agencies, they have managed to reduce the smuggling of unaccompanied minors through the border.\n\nIn 2023, he said, they intercepted over 300 minors and last year they managed to intercept and process 149 minors.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) manager (Beitbridge), Mrs Winfred Chiyangwa, said they were using the Zimbabwe Electronic Single Window (ZESW) initiative as a way of enhancing the ease of doing business.\n\nThe concept was introduced in 2022 as part of measures to enhance efficient clearance of legitimate traffic and trade facilitation at the countrys ports of entry.\n\nShe said the main objective of the ZESW is to improve trade facilitation and to achieve efficiency to boost revenue collection, enforcement of trade laws, social protection, and providing business intelligence to the government.\n\nZimra is the lead agency ensuring the co-ordination and harmonisation of clearance processes at the countrys ports of entry.\n\nCurrently there are 22 border agencies at major ports authorities including Beitbridge whose operations will be harmonised and streamlined under the ZESW.\n\nUnder the new order clients and stakeholders will not be moving from one agency to another as all the regulatory and transitory services, processes and payments will now be done online through a single platform, thus faster, better, and transparent, she said.\n\nThe major benefits of the Single Window will be compliance among agencies, more efficient and productive use of resources, enhanced collection of fees, duties, and penalties.\n\n",

Since then, nothing has been done. As residents, we have been ignored for too long.\n\nIt is now hard to visit people or invite guests. We are embarrassed. People avoid us because they think we are dirty, but this is a result of council failing to deliver services, she said.\n\nAnother resident, Mr John Pakatsi, expressed anger over what he believed was mismanagement of public funds.\n\nFor years we have heard the Government had been providing council with funds for painting, maintenance and respraying of these buildings, Mr Pakatsi said.\n\nBut nothing has been done.

We are putting in place a scheduled pest control programme across all affected suburbs, and Mbare is at the top of that list.\n\nHowever, some residents remain sceptical, pointing to years of broken promises and declining standards of living.\n\nWe want action, not speeches, said a resident who asked not to be named.\n\n",

The connection they exhibited of both voices and body language showed that they had done their homework well and were prepared to enthral their fans.\n\nThe voice imitations were exuberant, tight and sounded real so much that one would have been mistaken to think that some of the musical legends were actually in the house.\n\nEven the vintage and classic dressing of flared high waist trousers, berry-bottoms, floral waist coats, shiny sequins outfits and long afro hairstyles were befitting costumes for such a show.\n\nObvious it was about the legends, yesteryear music, hence the disco setup style.\n\nTo put icing on the cake, the show also some of the local saxophonists performing together on the song, Ndire, which brought the whole auditorium to standstill.\n\nSpeaking at the show, Ecobank senior executive, Mark Dengwani paid tribute to the fans, saying Legend Nights will be bigger and better next year.\n\nIt is exciting to see music fans from all walksenjoying themselves like this.\n\nWe hope to make the Ecobank Legends Night bigger and better next year, he said.\n\nIn Total band founder member and director Joseph Chinouriri said he was happy and shocked at the same time that they had filled the giant auditorium of Harare International Conference Centre, (HICC).\n\nThis is God and I can tell you I am still in shock. After the change of venue last minuet due to some logistics with the marketed venue (Harare Gardens), I was a bit hesitant as I thought as young as we are, HICC was too big for us, he said.\n\nThree days prior to the show, the tickets started selling like hot cakes and I said to my team this is a miracle.\n\nChinouriri said he was cleared for all copyright acts.\n\nWhat we played was cleared by relevant authorities. We did not do things on our own rather we engaged even the families of the legends. They all know about this.\n\nNext year it will be bigger and better and I want to thank everyone who supported us from the start, our families, fans, stakeholders and not forgetting the InTotal team.\n\nThe saxophonist also confirmed they are taking the show to Bulawayo and United Kingdom this year.\n\nWe are happy to announce that we are taking the concept to Bulawayo on June 14 and as for the United Kingdom fans, they can expect us in August. The logistics are currently taking shape.\n\n",
