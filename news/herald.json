We enjoy it every day as Zimbabweans.\n\nThere is no doubt that Zimbabwe is one of the most peaceful countries in the whole world.

Our elders should always teach us to be patriotic and to always respect the sacrifice made by our fathers, grandfathers, and grandmothers for this freedom.\n\nI am aware that this peace did not just come; a vicious battle occurred, and Zimbabwe came out victorious. This is why we are here to celebrate that victory which brought in independence.

We thank you, the people of Gokwe and the Midlands Province for your warm welcome and hospitality. Tauyawo kudunhu revaShangwe.\n\nNzvimbo ino inenhorowondo. During the brutal colonial era, this area became home to many of our forefathers who were forcibly bundled out from various parts of the country by the racist white colonial regime.\n\nThey survived and thrived in these lands, which were then highly infested with tsetse flies, turning this area into one of the most populous and economically vibrant districts in our country.\n\nIn gathering here, from all the four corners of the country, we honour you, the people of the larger Midlands Province and Gokwe in particular. You shall forever stand as a symbol of resilience and fortitude. We also honour the great heroes of the Midlands Province.\n\nThese include General Josiah Magama Tongogara, Cde Leopold Takawira, Cde Cephas Msipa, Cde Richard Hove, Cde Stephen Vuma, Cde Lameck Makanda, Cde Benjamin Mabenge, Cde Sibusiso Moyo, Cde Garikayi Magadzire, Cde Nash Nyasha Dzimiri, Cde Herbert Mahlaba, Cde Sydney Bhebhe, and Cde Ngwabi Bhebhe, among others.\n\nMany more lie at District and Provincial Heroes Acres as well as in unmarked graves within the country and beyond.\n\nIt is because of their collective bravery, dedication and patriotism that today we are forever free, Independent, peaceful and a sovereign people. Kutsunga kwavo, nekushinga, nekuda nyika yekwedu; nekuzvipira kwaita kuti nhasi tive takasununguka.\n\nYour contribution as Midlands Province and Gokwe, to the economy in post-Independent Zimbabwe, through cotton production, here in this district as well as in mining, crop and livestock farming, among other sectors, is unmatched.\n\nThe country is gathered here, therefore, to thank you, ukuzolibonga, kuzokutendayi, and to celebrate with you. This Independence is ours together, we are one united people of Zimbabwe. Commemorations are also taking place countrywide, at provincial levels as well as throughout the world at our diplomatic missions. To all my Fellow Citizens, countrymen and women ndinoti Makorokoto; ngithi Amhlophe; Congratulations Zimbabwe, on 45 years of Independence, freedom, sovereignty, unity, peace and development. Happy Independence Day!\n\nComrades and Friends; As we mark this day, we can look back at the past with pride, knowing what we have achieved, as a united and hardworking people.\n\nFrom the household level up to our respective provinces and the nation as a whole, we are defying the odds, breaking records and realising uncommon development successes.\n\nThe continuing sanctions, climate change-induced setbacks, global economic shocks, and machinations by detractors, desperate to see us divided, have not derailed our course. A higher quality of life and a prosperous upper middle-income society for many more of our people, in line with Vision 2030 is within sight.\n\nTogether as one people, we are building our motherland, brick by brick, and stone upon stone. From Plumtree to Mutare, Zambezi to Limpopo, Beitbridge to Chirundu, Zimbabweans are demonstrating that Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatirwa nevene vayo / Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhu-le-kelwe ngabanikazi balo.\n\nComrades and Fellow Citizens; The Second Republic is comprehensively promoting rural development and revitalisation.\n\nWe are delivering development towards Vision 2030. Hurumende yedu ye ZANU PF irikuunza budiriro kumaruwa.\n\nIt is worth noting that this years Independence celebration is occurring after the consolidation of our Land Reform through the issuance of title deeds to both A1 and A2 farmers, including veterans of the liberation struggle. My Government is also stepping up efforts to regularise both old and new settlements in cities and towns throughout the country. These programmes are set to assure citizens security of tenure, and ownership of their properties through title deeds.\n\nThe ongoing Agriculture Transformation Strategy, implemented under my Administration, is further deepening rural reforms to ensure food security, increased grain production and agricultural efficiency.\n\nImproved incomes for farmers, beginning at household levels are evident while poverty eradication initiatives anchored by the agriculture sector have broadened.\n\nRiding on the rural industrialisation policy, the volume of trade and value addition, based on agriculture crops and products is recording new highs.\n\nSteady growth of both the beef and dairy national herds and other categories of livestock farming as well as the need to prevent animal-borne diseases remain a top priority for my Government. As such, programmes, including the Presidential Heifer, Piggery and Poultry Pass-on Schemes, particularly for women, youth and war veterans, will continue to be supported.\n\nLand which is our inalienable heritage, is being productively utilised, with an anticipated bumper harvest from the 2024-2025 summer cropping season.\n\nThis will see the restocking of our Strategic Grain Reserve.\n\nI call upon all patriotic Zimbabweans to support our farmers and industries by buying local produce, increasing investments in agri-businesses and unlocking the full potential of our land.\n\nThe Pfumvudza/Intwasa programme is expanding yearly. Partnerships under the Irrigation Development\n\nAlliance, will develop an additional 100 000 hectares with the private sector. These proactive initiatives will go a long way towards minimising the challenges associated with climate change.\n\nLast seasons El Nino induced drought affected many districts throughout the country. We must applaud ourselves as a nation, for being able to feed ourselves in the face of this adversity. Vulnerability of all those affected was adequately reduced under the Food Deficit Mitigation Programme, which also saw urban households benefiting from cash transfers.\n\nGovernment continues to honour the contribution made by our people to the attainment of Independence, especially the Veterans of the Liberation Struggle. We are creating an enabling environment for full participation in mainstream socio-economic development. To date, many programmes are underway, such as the Presidential Borehole drilling, Rural Solarisation and Housing schemes, along with those under the Youth Empowerment initiative.\n\nCommunities across the country are encouraged to be actively involved in these programmes being championed by our ruling ZANU PF Government.\n\nAll Zimbabweans, no matter their gender, tribe, age or political affiliation, must benefit. ZANU PF is a peoples Party. Tose tinokwana muhomwe nemuma programmes e-Musangano weruzhinji rweZimbabwe.\n\nGovernment, is concerned with the frequency of destruction of life and property in some districts, including here in Gokwe, Chimanimani, Chipinge, Chiredzi, Muzarabani, and Tsholotsho, among others, due to the severe weather events. The need to build climate resilient infrastructure in communities, is now urgent.\n\nMore resources have, therefore, been allocated to restore and rehabilitate damaged infrastructure, including schools, clinics, bridges, roads and water supply systems. So far, houses constructed by Government for flood victims are ready for commissioning, while over 400 boreholes have been drilled in this province alone, some of which, have been equipped with solarised pumps.\n\nFellow Zimbabweans; It is pleasing that our economy continues to experience positive growth.\n\nThe policies of the Second Republic are bearing fruit, with the mining sector leading and supporting value addition across sub-sectors.\n\nA 5,6 percent growth is expected this year, benefiting from new mines, and the favourable commodity prices of some minerals.\n\nThe accelerated implementation of the National Development Strategy has had a positive impact on manufacturing sector value chains. Of note is the Pharmaceutical Sector, with rising capacity utilisation up to the current 50 percent, from previous levels of 43 percent. After 45 years of Independence, the ZANU PF Government remains committed to building a future that honours the sacrifices of the past, but fundamentally, secures prosperity for the generations ahead.\n\nTo guarantee that Zimbabwean products are competitive in both local and global markets, technical and vocational education, with biases in Science, Technology and Innovation, are of critical importance. Training of artisans and technicians to drive our industrialisation agenda, under the Industry and Government Special Apprenticeship Scheme has commenced.\n\nThe Integrated Skills Expansion and Outreach Programme is also equipping youths in rural communities, with skills to drive modernisation and development, beginning at the grassroots level.\n\nOver the past year, tax incentives, infrastructure access and public procurement reforms, that favour youth-led enterprises and business start-ups, have been implemented by the Second Republic.\n\nSimilarly, financial support to women-led businesses have been extended through various financing schemes.\n\nThese facilities have increased the number of women and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises participating in local, regional and international trade. The ZANU PF Government is listening and wholeheartedly fulfilling the aspirations of our people.\n\nVulnerable learners under the Basic Education Assistance Module exceed 1.5 million. New schools and classrooms were constructed in all provinces with focus on rural and resettlement areas. New urban settlements throughout the country are benefiting from this programme, including Cowdray Park in Bulawayo as well as Stoneridge and Caledonia in Harare.\n\nThe ongoing quest by my Government to realise urban-rural energy security, has seen the electrification of rural public institutions across Zimbabwe, such as schools, clinics and administrative centres. This is positively impacting social service delivery.\n\nThe health delivery system is undergoing reform and modernisation, in terms of quality service delivery, access to affordable specialist treatment, availability of drugs as well as infrastructure development. I commend the private sector, which has come on board to increase health facilities across all provinces.\n\nFellow Zimbabweans, Comrades and Friends;\n\nIn March this year, Senior Public Sector officials signed Performance Contracts, as a management tool for achieving impactful results. It is commendable that thousands of high impact projects have been completed between 2018 and 2024, with every Ward having a project the people can attribute to the 2nd Republic.\n\nThese span critical areas in infrastructure, energy, agriculture, health, education, and industry.\n\nInternet access during the Third Quarter of 2024, increased remarkably, paving way for the expansion of digital transformation, e-Government, e-Learning, mobile banking services and automation of procurement systems, improving efficiency and curbing corruption, among other benefits. Technologies in the delivery of justice, are assisting in crime prevention as well as protecting lives and property.\n\nThe same will be deployed to bring sanity on our roads and prevent the mayhem that has increased Road Traffic Accidents. Progress, in these and other areas, is significant, and work is ongoing. We will leave no stone unturned in pursuit of quality service delivery throughout our economy.\n\nEmployee welfare, as well as fair and inclusive working conditions, are a top priority of the Second Republic.\n\nThe Public Service Pension Fund is prudently laying a firm foundation for sustainable social protection while occupational safety and health are being promoted.\n\nAll people and all jobs are important, be it in rural or in urban areas, we are one. Tose takakosha munyika yedu. Vekumaruwa, nevekumadhorobha, ne avo varikushanda varikunze kwenyika, takakosha.\n\nFellow Citizens;\n\nUnity, peace and security are essential ingredients to sustainable development and prosperity. Zimbabwe is at peace within our borders, with our regional neighbours and the world. Our country enjoys excellent relations within the comity of nations. Under our mantra friend to all and an enemy to none, we are consolidating existing friendships and establishing new partnerships that benefit the economy and people to people relations.\n\nAs the current Chair of SADC, Zimbabwe is promoting innovation, the development of cross-border value chains and enhancing opportunities for Public Private Partnerships, to drive modernisation and industrialisation.\n\nFurther, promoting intra-African trade, and resolving conflicts in some parts of Africa, towards entrenching peace for sustainable socio-economic development, are critical areas of our focus.\n\nIn this spirit, we work with all partners to strengthen multi-lateralism and a rules-based global governance system, that leaves no country, or region behind.\n\nComrades and Friends; Each of us has a duty to protect our nation from elements, both within and outside our borders who want the regression, of our national development course. Hand-in-hand, with focus and discipline, let us defend and work harder for the benefit of our motherland, Zimbabwe, now and in the future.\n\nWe salute our security services for their loyalty, patriotism and unflinchingly defending our country, sovereignty; territorial integrity; and hard-won Independence.\n\nTinotenda mawuto edu navo vese vanoshanda kudzivirira nyika yedu nekuzvitonga kwedu kuzere.\n\nAll patriotic Zimbabweans are reminded of the need to guard against the dangers of social media, which is increasingly being used as a tool to cause discord and raise false alarms.\n\nI commend you, my dear fellow compatriots, both at home and abroad, for remaining vigilant, patriotic and steadfast, never allowing ourselves to be misled by shadowy elements with dubious opportunistic agendas. Ngatirambe takabatana, tichivaka nyika yedu. Tose tine mutoro wekushandira Zimbabwe. Ngatizivikanwe kuti takashandira dunhu kana nyika yekwedu, nekubatanidza vanhu.\n\nThe values of love, mutual support and trust are handed down from generation to generation, just like our culture, traditions, history, and moral principles.\n\nMoral standards and the family institution must be deliberately protected. Zimbabwe has been, and must remain, a stronghold of the traditional values on which human civilisation stands. In this spirit, let us never neglect the plight of the elderly, orphans, disabled and those exposed to drug and substance abuse, among other vulnerable members of our society.\n\nAll levels of Government, our traditional leaders, civil society and the churches are challenged to contribute to stronger families and greater community cohesion. As communities, let us help to preserve the noble values of love, unity, compassion, empathy, discipline and hard-honest work, for which Zimbabweans are known for. This message of peace, love, unity, hard work and discipline, should be spread across all our families, communities and the nation, to children, as well as young and old people alike. The Second Republic is entrenching the rule of law, defending the Constitution and stands ready to protect law-abiding citizens, while dealing decisively with misguided and rouge elements. Divisive and alarmist elements will never triumph over a nation such as ours; with a rich liberation history and born out of the blood of the brave sons and daughters of this sacred land. Our law enforcement agencies, will always act according to the law and in the best interests of our Independent and sovereign motherland, Zimbabwe.\n\nFellow Country-men and Country-women; Our motherland, Zimbabwe, is poised for greater times.\n\nLet us remain focused, resilient and persistent, inspired by the numerous achievements and milestones attained so far.\n\nRegardless of political affiliation, religion, race, gender or age, let us all put Zimbabwe first. It is the only country that we call home, and which the next generations shall call home.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, Fellow Citizens in the Diaspora; you too have a duty to speak well, defend and promote the national interests of our great nation, Zimbabwe. Victory in all circumstances is our heritage; the ability to overcome any challenges is in our DNA.\n\nAcross every sector, let us re-double production and productivity, to realise self-sufficiency in our economy. Through our own efforts, let us remain a free, Independent and sovereign people, who are masters of our own destiny.\n\nAs the curtain comes down on this year s commemoration, which begun with the Childrens Party yesterday, I thank you, the people of Midlands Province and Gokwe, for warmly welcoming Zimbabwe to your doorstep and for turning out in your large numbers. Makorokoto, Amhlophe, Magona.\n\nCongratulations.\n\nWe also commend all stakeholders for the developmental projects undertaken on the side-lines of these commemorations and for the overall success of this event. Fellow Compatriots; This years Independence commemorations coincide with the Easter holidays. We thank Almighty God, who gave His only begotten Son, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to die on the cross and rise from the dead, for our sins. Through Him we now receive salvation and eternal life. Let us continue to thank God for redemption and to pray for our nation, encouraged by Philippians 4 verse 13 which says We can do all things through Jesus Christ who gives us strength.\n\nWith these remarks, it is now my singular honour and privilege to wish all Zimbabweans, here at home and those around the world, a Happy 45th Independence Anniversary.\n\nLong live our independence.\n\nLong live our freedom, our unity and our peace.\n\nLong live Zimbabwe.\n\nGod bless you.\n\nGod bless Zimbabwe.\n\nI thank you.\n\n",

Their eyes tell a story. A story of hunger, of fear, of a life adrift. You see the pain, the loneliness, the shattered dreams reflected in their eyes. But you also see the flicker of hope, the spark of resilience, the yearning for a better future.\n\nNdidzulafhi does not just see the children; she sees their potential, their dreams, the lives that could be.\n\nI interview them, she says, adding, Try to understand their situation, their fears, their hopes. To see the child beneath the scars, beneath the grime. To see the unique individual, with their own dreams, their own talents, their own unique story waiting to be written.\n\nThis innate empathy, born from her own profound losses, has led her to become a foster parent, a role she embraces with unwavering dedication.\n\nLosing three out of her six biological children to the Grim Reaper has etched a deeper understanding of loss and grief onto her soul. After losing her children, she was left to raise her grandchildren single-handedly as death claimed her husbands life last year.\n\nThis taught me the depth of a mothers lovethe fragility of life and the desperate need for a loving hand, she confesses, her voice thick with emotion.\n\nIt taught me that every child deserves a chance to thrive, to dream, to simply be a child, free from the burdens that weigh down their young shoulders.\n\nNdidzulafhis home, once a haven for a few, has transformed into a sanctuary, a veritable childrens home overflowing with life and laughter.\n\nThe clatter of plates, a symphony of metal against metal, echoes through her small house every evening.\n\nTwenty-two plates, meticulously arranged on the rough-hewn wooden table, await their eager occupants. A stark reminder of the lives she nurtures, the hearts she mends, the futures she shapes.\n\nEach plate testifies to her unwavering commitment to the children who call this humble abode their home.\n\nSome women dump newly-born babies for different reasons. These find their way to Ndidzulafhis home.\n\nThe training she received as a community child care worker (CCW) under the child protection programmes spearheaded by the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare, in partnership with UNICEF and the Swedish government, further empowered her commitment.\n\nWhen a child is dumped, I report the case to the police and to the social welfare department. It is my duty to ensure their safety, to protect their innocence. But it is not enough, she says.\n\nShe adds: We need to break the cycle of poverty, of exploitation, of despair. We need to empower these children, to give them the tools and the opportunities to build a better future for themselves and their communities. We need to create a world where every child has the right to a birth certificate, to an education, to a life free from abuse.\n\nIf a child is picked from the streets and handed over to me after proper channels have been followed by the social welfare department, I ensure that the child gets a birth certificate or national identity card.\n\nAmong the children she shelters are the twins, Enock and Victoria. Orphaned at a tender age, they faced a bleak future.\n\nEnock, a beacon of resilience, took on odd jobs while still in Grade Six in the sugarcane fields, sacrificing his childhood to ensure his sisters and his own education.\n\nHe walked for miles, Ndidzulafhi reflects.\n\nMiles to school, miles to work, carrying the weight of his family on his young shoulders. His spirit, unbroken by hardship, is an inspiration to us all. His actions even taught me that, in the face of adversity, the human spirit can soar.\n\nTheir story, she says, touched the hearts of their teachers and soon, the school intervened. Recognising the impossible burden on these young shoulders, they sought a safe haven for the twins.\n\nNdidzulafhi, with her open heart and overflowing home, became their refuge. Now, the twins are blossoming, their futures no longer tethered to the harsh realities they once faced. Both Enock and Victoria, with Ndidzulafhis encouragement, are excelling in their studies, dreaming of becoming engineers.\n\nYet, as she watches the children devour their meal, a quiet worry lingers within her.\n\nTwenty-two plates, twenty-two mouths to feed, twenty-two lives to nurture.\n\nThe weight of responsibility, the ever-growing needs of her children, often threatens to overwhelm her.\n\nMy prayer is that when these two complete their Advanced Level studies, which I am confident that they will pass with better grades, they get enrolled at a university to further their studies.\n\nI want to see them realise their dreams despite the fate they befallen them at a tender age, Ndidzulafhi says.\n\nAs the sun dips below the horizon, casting long shadows across the dusty streets of Tshovani, she sits on her porch, the laughter of children fading into the distance.\n\nNdidzulafhi looks up at the star-studded sky, a silent prayer for the future, for the children in her care, for a world where every child can reach for their dreams, where every child can find their place under the sun.\n\nFeedback:X@TheseusShambare\n\n",

            "content": "PRESIDENT Mnangagwa was clear and forthright in his Independence speech in Gokwe yesterday  lets keep focused towards the attainment of Vision 2030 without letting our detractors side track us.\n\nHe was also unequivocal about the need to maintain national cohesion and unity, exhorting Zimbabweans to prioritise peace and stability so that national programmes and processes can proceed unhindered.\n\nZimbabweans are honest, hard working people, the President said, and there is nothing that can stand in their way towards the attainment of shared goals.\n\nThus he called for the consolidation of the progress made since Independence while building towards a better, prosperous future.\n\nIn the years after independence there was real progress in making sure educational opportunities long denied so many people were opened to all. There was also a concerted effort to ensure that all Zimbabweans could access at least the basic health facilities practically, as well as opening doors to economic advancement.\n\nEfforts were made to empower the communal areas with both proper local government and with the start of better farming opportunities, at the very least stripping away the laws that limited their competitiveness. With the dumping of the old racial and land tenure laws it became possible for a lot of people to realise the fruits of their hard work and live better.\n\nAfter around 20 years the promise of land reform was made real in the sense that Zimbabwe took control of its farming land and started allocating this land on the basis of ability and need, although it soon became obvious that the major benefits of land reform would need further programmes to allow the landholders to realise their potential and to give them security so they could develop their farms.\n\nBut whatever we do there is still more than needs to be done since we cannot just draw a line and say we now have a perfect country, a perfect society and a perfect economy.\n\nThe Second Republic under President Mnangagwa has in more than six years been accelerating the development of the economy, of communities, families and individuals, realising ever more the potential of the resources Zimbabwe has been blessed with and making sure that everyone shares in this potential, with no area and no person left behind.\n\nThis double requirement, of growth that includes all, is summarised in the theme for the independence celebrations this year: Zimbabwe at 45: Devolve and develop together towards Vision 2030. We need the development, but we need to make sure that this is devolved, so we all benefit, and no one is left behind.\n\nIn his address to the nation to mark the 45th anniversary, President Mnangagwa returned to the practical business of building Zimbabwe. It cannot happen instantaneously, but it must happen as he noted, a brick a time. Vision 2030 is largely a goal so that we know what we are building in practical terms, and to make sure that all Government and private policies are heading in the same direction. In his address the President explored the brickworks that we are using to get those bricks to build the country. Farmers, commercial on the larger A2 farms and small-scale on the communal lands and A1 farms, are now able to access a range of programmes to grow more crops and, increase and upgrade livestock.\n\nThese practical programmes not only bring in the results of research to cope with climate change and other problems, and not only make sure that any genuine farmer can access inputs through a range of schemes, but also close the door on those who want to cheat with some very simple checks and conditions shutting the door on corruption.\n\nOther programmes are closing the rural-urban divides, such as the borehole drilling that is bringing a borehole to every village and every school, and the rural solar programme that will provide a basic power supply to every house. These add value to life far in excess of the modest increase in economic value, making life a lot easier for a lot of people. Not all programmes have to be economically justified.\n\nAt the same time the Government is now moving ahead on offering security to all genuine farmers with a title-deed scheme, with a similar scheme in progress in urban areas to regularise those settlements that can be regularised and where people have commendably been building decent housing. At the same time as sorting out the urban mess caused by deficient local government, the Government wants the proper rules enforced so that we can accelerate the provision of housing without cleaning up future errors.\n\nThe universal right to education and skills training is being made far more effective, partly by ensuring that those from vulnerable families can go to school, partly through curriculum changes that stress that pupils and students must learn how to apply the knowledge learned in classrooms, but also with a huge expansion in vocational training so that practical skills are learned and far more people can earn a good living.\n\nIn the end it is what people can do and what they do that matter and here a practical Government is opening doors for practical people, and increasing the backing for those prepared to apply their skills and work hard.\n\nDevolution has had some very practical benefits already, with a significant chunk of the capital budget now being applied through local authorities and communities. The basis for this is that people living on the spot almost always have a far better idea of what they need and what they are missing than a theoretical expert, and are normally willing to ensure far more value comes from the devolved funds through their own inputs.\n\nGood government also requires being able to deal with emergencies, and here the President brought up the fact that Zimbabwe is now largely able to cope with its own resources when faced with emergencies like Covid-19 or that terrible drought that hit us last year. We also learn from this coping, not just in overcoming the potential disaster but also putting place policies so that next time we have less of a problem.\n\nThe President was also stressing the need for national unity, which does not mean we all agree all the time but does mean we are all ready to pull our weight and push forward to build the Zimbabwe we want and which our children deserve. There might be debate and disagreement over priorities and policies, but there is remarkably little disagreement over what sort of society we want and what sort of country we all want.\n\nIndependence Day is a good time for us all to remember that far more unites us than splits us up and that we have and can work together. We first did that to win our independence, and now we must continue doing this to turn that independence into the sort of country and society we all want.\n\n",
