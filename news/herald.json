            "content": "Ivan Zhakata\n\nHerald Correspondent\n\nThe Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) has welcomed the signing into law of the Death Penalty Abolition Act, 2024 by President Mnangagwa .\n\nIn a statement, the commission said the landmark step is a significant milestone in Zimbabwes commitment to upholding the sanctity of human life, as enshrined in Section 48 of the Constitution, which protects the right to life, alongside sections 51 and 53 which respectively guarantee the rights to dignity and freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.\n\nIt said the new Act eliminates the death penalty in Zimbabwe, ensuring no person shall be sentenced to death or executed.\n\nThis legislative development aligns with modern human rights standards and reflects the global trend towards the abolition of the death penalty, read the statement.\n\nZimbabwe now joins a growing number of nations that have recognised the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of their past actions. The ZHRC applauds the inclusive and compassionate approach taken in the transitional provisions of the Act, ensuring prisoners under sentence of death are afforded legal representation and the opportunity for clemency.\n\nThis approach underlines the importance of rehabilitation over retribution in Zimbabwes justice system. The ZHRC highly commends the unity of purpose demonstrated by the political leadership across the political divide, notably, Mr Edwin Mushoriwa who\n\nintroduced the Private Members Bill in November 2023, Minister of Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Ziyambi Ziyambi who facilitated the passage, members of Parliament as a whole, and President Mnangagwa who signed the Bill into law.\n\nThe commission said the abolition of the death penalty is a monumental achievement for human rights in Zimbabwe as it resonates with the fundamental principles of equality, justice and mercy, which are cornerstones of a democratic society.\n\nThis development also reinforces Zimbabwes alignment with international human rights instruments such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, read the statement.\n\nThe ZHRC recognises the challenges of addressing grave crimes, but firmly maintains that the death penalty is not the solution. Evidence worldwide shows that the death penalty does not deter crime more effectively than other punishment.\n\nInstead, its abolition allows for a more humane and restorative justice system. As we celebrate this significant milestone, the ZHRC reiterates its commitment to promoting the protection of human rights and advocating for the reform of laws and policies to create a fairer and more just society.:\n\nThe commission called on all stakeholders, to implement the Act fully.\n\nAs a matter of priority, the ZHRC urges the responsible authorities to ensure expeditious and fair re-sentencing of those on the death row, and will monitor such process.\n\n",

The chairpersons of NDS1 thematic working groups were requested to submit programmes and projects that they implemented in 2024 and to that effect, 834 were submitted.\n\nA standardised template was distributed to MDAs (ministries, departments and agencies) to guide selection of projects.

Picture: Edward Zvemisha\n\nOn the infrastructure and utilities pillar, Dr Muswere said last year, the Government implemented projects that focused on provision of road and aviation networks and utilities such as water and electricity.\n\nThey included the expansion and construction of a new VVIP Pavilion at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport in Harare, the Dete Community solar project in Matabeleland North Province, the Harare-Masvingo-Beitbridge road upgrade, the Shurugwi-Mhandamabwe road rehabilitation, the repair of 2 000 boreholes across the country and the drilling of 3 528 boreholes under the Presidential Borehole Drilling Programme.\n\nOther projects include the Mbudzi Interchange construction project, which Dr Muswere described as an engineering marvel, the Harare-Kanyemba Road construction, the Great Zimbabwe 5MW Hydro Power Station in Masvingo, and construction of New Parliament Building access roads in Harare, Mashonaland West and Mashonaland Central provinces.\n\nUnder the digital economy pillar, Dr Muswere said the Government invested in expanding ICT infrastructure, promoting digital literacy, and supporting technology start-ups.\n\nThe start-ups include the Media and Communication Policy, the National E-learning Strategy (computerisation of 1 000 schools to bridge the urban-rural divide), the National ICT Policy launch, the Artificial Intelligence Strategy approval, the licensing of Starlink, electronic passports for citizens in Harare, Guruve, Murehwa, Lupane, Beitbridge, Zvishavane, Marondera and Gweru, among others.\n\nOn the food security and nutrition pillar, Dr Muswere said many projects including dams were constructed.\n\nIn an effort to combat the effects of El-Nino on citizens, livestock, and crop production, the Government of Zimbabwe employed diverse climate proofing strategies chief among them the Pfumvudza/Intwasa programme, food distribution, Presidential Livestock and Stock Feed Programme under disaster risk management. These were all launched and implemented, he said.\n\nMahusekwa District Hospital in Mashonaland East Province was one of the major projects toured by Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, Dr Jenfan Muswere, last week.  Picture: Joseph Manditswara\n\nIrrigation rehabilitation and accelerated dam construction across the country was done to boost food security.\n\nDams such as Kunzvi in Mashonaland East, Muchekeranwa Dam on the border of Mashonaland East and Manicaland, Tugwi-Mukosi in Masvingo, Semwa in Mashonaland Central and Lake Gwayi-Shangani in Matabeleland North have been constructed and some are complete and already transforming lives while others are over 70 percent complete.\n\nOn the economic growth and stability pillar, Dr Muswere said Government initiated many programmes such as the debt and arrears clearance programme, tamed inflation, and introduced a gold-backed currency, among others.\n\nRegarding image building and the engagement and re-engagement programme, Dr Muswere said President Mnangagwas administration rehabilitated infrastructure in foreign missions and installed broadcasting infrastructure, which is critical for enhancing Governments image and improved economic diplomacy. It also hosted the 44th Sadc Summit in August and the SADC Extraordinary Summit in November.\n\nOn the social protection pillar, Dr Muswere said the Government focused on the protection of individuals and communities from poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion.\n\nIt also implemented programmes that promoted social justice, human rights and economic security, especially for the marginalised and vulnerable population, he said.\n\nOn governance, there was the construction of magistrate courts, and the implementation and operationalisation of the Integrated Electronic Case Management System, among others.\n\nOn housing delivery, the Government constructed affordable and decent houses in many towns for its workers.\n\nIn terms of human capital development and innovation, learners were prepared to become socially and economically empowered through quality and innovation education.\n\nOn youth, sports and culture emphasis was on fighting socio-economic ills that include drug and substance abuse as well as unemployment.\n\nA lot was also done on health and wellbeing last year including emphasising on improved high-quality care that is affordable and accessible.\n\nAll these initiatives are as a result of the selfless steward leadership of His Excellency, President ED Mnangagwa.\n\nAs we move into 2025, the nation will be guided by NDS2, which is set to propel economic growth and prosperity through technological advancement, Dr Muswere said.\n\n",

They are compiling a report. The minister is likely to issue a statement on it after we go through it, said Dr Maunganidze.\n\nHarare City Council director of Works, Engineer Zvenyika Chawatama, confirmed that they had issued a permit for the project.\n\nHe said health concerns have been raised, including from within the citys Department of Water and they were pursuing remedial action.\n\nConcerns on the water pipeline that passes through the property were recently raised by Harare Water, said Eng Chawatama, who at the time of the interview last week was the citys acting town clerk in the absence of the incumbent.\n\nWe have asked our surveyors to pick up the line so that we wont have structures or graves over it. The other matters raised will be dealt with through an environmental impact assessment process that will be done before the project becomes operational. Environmental Management Agency (EMA) will lead the process and all stakeholders will be consulted.\n\nIn the event that burials are happening before an EMA certificate is granted, then they have to be stopped.\n\nQuestions have also been raised about the issuance of a permit at a time when there was no Environmental Impact Assessment from EMA.\n\nThe citys acting director of Urban Planning, Mr Samuel Nyabezi, defended the decision.\n\nThe permit is issued with conditions; one of which is for an EIA done and approved by EMA. Failure to meet any one of the conditions results in the permit falling away.\n\nThe EIA process is an expensive exercise and it would not be proper for one to incur such high costs where there is no guarantee that a permit will be granted  said Mr Nyabezi.\n\nContacted for comment, EMA spokesperson, Ms Amkela Sidange, said they initially conducted an ecological assessment where they recommended for an exclusion of 22 hectares wetland area, leaving 55 ha non-wetland area.\n\nShe said after an assessment, an EIA was eventually issued.\n\nRegarding the public health implications, Ms Sidange said: Issues of health implications as spelt out in the context of handling of dead bodies and their disposal can best be handled from the public health scope.\n\nOtherwise planning authorities should always be proactive to avert such eventualities, through their environmental health experts and civil engineering department during land use planning and allocation.\n\nCemeteries by their nature are a key function in any settlement development and planning authorities should, just like in any other land use planning stage, exercise due diligence.\n\nMs Sidange said EMA is continuously calling upon planning authorities to ensure that settlement developments integrate environmental considerations and exhibit best practices to protect the environment and the public.\n\nHealth experts spoken to by The Herald expressed reservations about the health prudence of setting up a cemetery in the area.\n\nThat area is bad for a cemetery project to say the least. There are high chances of contamination of the citys raw water source such as Seke dam which is mostly to be in form of both ground water and surface, said one public health expert.\n\nBesides, the procedure of issuing an EIA certificate and the permit include consulting several stakeholders including those in the surrounding areas, something which was not done in the present case.\n\nWe might have a replica of the Lake Chivero water contamination but this time at a huge proportion. We also wonder why the city has not taken heed of recommendations by its own department, the Department of Water, which raised a red flag over the project.\n\n",
