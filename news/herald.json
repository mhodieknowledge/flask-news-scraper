As a team, you endured rigorous training sessions, and extraordinary pressure on and off the field as you faced competitive as well as aggressive opponents.\n\nHowever, through every scrum, tackle and ultimately try, you embodied the true meaning of sportsmanship, passion and zeal, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa then drew focus to NDS1, which he said was symbolised by the Sables incredible feat.\n\nAt Government level, the National Development Strategy calls for the development of high-performance sporting disciplines and nurturing of elite athletes.\n\nThe success story of you, our Sables, dovetails with these aspirations. Additionally, the victory of our national rugby team is timely, occurring when our nation is re-asserting its place among sporting countries within the international arena.\n\nThis milestone is therefore another testimony that Zimbabwe is ready to compete and excel at the highest levels of continental and global sport.\n\nI acknowledge and express my profound gratitude to the various stakeholders, particularly families of players whose unwavering support and sacrifices have been instrumental to this success.\n\nThe President called upon the Sports Ministry and other relevant stakeholders to take a page out of the Sables success and come together to further develop Zimbabwe sport.\n\nMay the spirit of this victory inspire many more young people as they strive for greatness, said the President.\n\nALL SMILES . . . PRESIDENT Mnangagwa and Sables skipper Hilton Mudariki hold the Africa Cup while the rest of the Sables delegation watches at State House in Harare yesterday.\n\nThe Ministry of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture, industry and business stakeholders are called upon to scale up support for the sport sub-sector towards both quality infrastructure and ensuring that athletes can take sport as a viable career, he said.\n\nZimbabwes rugby team captain Hilton Mudariki described meeting with the President as the highlight of his career.\n\nHe said the meeting now puts the team in good stead as they prepare for the all-important 2025 edition of the Rugby Africa Cup which will double as qualification for the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia.\n\nIt is a truly special moment for me and the team, you cant describe it. It is a day that each of us will remember for the rest of our lives, an opportunity to be hosted by His Excellency, President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nIt will definitely act as motivation for us to keep working hard as we prepare for the all-important Africa Cup next year. We have a target on our back as every team will be gunning for us, but we will surely be up for the challenge, Mudariki said.\n\n",

            "content": "Joseph Madzimure-Senior Reporter\n\nRETIREMENT should not be seen as a period of retreat, but rather as a time of renewal and reinvention, President Mnangagwa has said.\n\nIn a speech read on his behalf by Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri at the inaugural Public Service Commission (PSC) retirement conference 2024 in Harare yesterday, the President said participatory development in communities offers a unique opportunity for retirees to apply their skills where they are most needed, fostering economic and social growth.\n\nThis milestone event is a testimony to the unwavering commitment of the Second Republic to improving the welfare of those who have served our nation with dedication and honour.\n\nThe doctrine of social protection is predicated on dignity in retirement. This dignity is borne out of the prosperity that comes from the sweat of those who selflessly serve the nation, he said.\n\nThe conference, running under the theme, Embracing a New Chapter: Empowering Public Sector Workers for Retirement with Dignity, will end tomorrow.\n\nThe theme, President Mnangagwa said, reflects the significant strides the Government has made through various reforms aimed at strengthening social protection.\n\nAs we write this new chapter, ourfocus is the dignity and empowerment of Government workers. We must ensure that retirement is not an endpoint but a meaningful new chapter contributing to the prosperity of our provinces, districts, and communities, he said.\n\nThe conference, organised by the Public Service Commission, is being attended by retirees; active members of the public service; and retirement experts from different sectors with major focus on discussing opportunities to secure the dignity; financial independence and health of civil servants in retirement.\n\nIt also focuses on financial planning; real estate planning; and life skills capacitation among other issues.\n\nGovernment adopted a Defined-Benefit Pension Scheme which provides eligible employees with guaranteed income for life when they retire.\n\nAs the largest employer in the land, President Mnangagwa said Government guarantees a specific retirement benefit for each participant based on factors such as the employees salary and years of service.\n\nThis means that the Government bears the risk if the returns on the investment do not cover the defined-benefit amount due to a member, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said as Government improved social protection, there was a need to ignore the benefits associated with a Defined Contribution Pension Scheme which does not promise specific benefits at retirement.\n\nWith a Defined Contribution, risk falls on the contributor in that, pension benefits are pegged in relation to returns that are generated from investments.Thus, low investment returns result in low pension payouts. By adopting a Defined-Benefit Pension Scheme, the Government chose to shoulder the risk and guaranteed a specific pension benefit to all eligible beneficiaries, he said.\n\nCurrently, there are 195 000 to 200 000 retirees benefitting from the pensions payouts.\n\nIn any given year, 300 to 500 civil servants retire from active service.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa emphasised that those who join retirement must remain productive and continue to contribute to nation-building.\n\nGuided by the provision of the Constitution and Vision 2030 with respect to social protection, he said the Second Republics developmental thrust is premised on championing inclusivity, innovation, and progress.\n\nTo this end, my Government has developed an array of social protection policies aimed at improving the welfare of retirees to secure their dignity in retirement. In addition, my Government aims to empower retirees whose shoulders have borne the weight of nation-building. This resonates with our espoused mantra, Nyika inovakwa igotongwa igonamatirwa nevene vayo.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said retirement should not be seen as merely the end of active service but as a cornerstone of national progress, embodying the values of the liberation struggle and the dividends of peace and unity.\n\nHe hailed the public servants for being at the forefront of implementing policies that drive national development.\n\nThrough hard work and sacrifice, President Mnangagwa said workers have shaped a government that serves its people with integrity, diligence and resolve.\n\nThe Second Republic, he said, stands firm in its commitment to a Zimbabwe where every citizen young or old, retired or in servicehas the opportunity to thrive.\n\nThe conference was also attended by the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare, July Moyo, Minister of Veterans of the Liberation Struggle Monica Mavhunga, chairman of the Public Service Commission, Dr Vincent Hungwe, Commissioners of the Public Service Commission, Secretary of the Public Service Commission, Mrs Sibusisiwe Zembe among other senior Government officials.\n\n",

I, therefore, implore the community to be united and ensure that the funds availed are used for the intended projects and programmes, said VP Chiwenga.\n\nZCDC has revamped and constructed school blocks for the local community.\n\nThis is commendable and I encourage the company to continue engagements with the local community and their leadership.\n\nWe should all be conscious that diamonds are a finite resource and it is necessary to have Corporate Social Responsibility projects that go beyond the lifespan of our mines.\n\nIt is Government policy under the leadership of President Mnangagwa that communities where mining takes place should be empowered to sustain their livelihoods during and after mining activities have ceased, said VP Chiwenga.\n\nHe urged mining stakeholders to uphold high ethical standards which saw Zimbabwe being certified compliant with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme in 2022.\n\nDeputy Minister of Mines and Mining Development Polite Kambamura said they are seized with creating a vision of sustainable, responsible and value driven mining operations.\n\nHe thanked the ZCDC for showing them insights into their operations.\n\nZCDC chief operating officer Mr Dennis Mtombeni said the vision of the company is continuous progression in value addition of diamonds.\n\n",

Kana wafunga zvekupfuma, chiyenda kuchikoro udzidze or start a business worega kudeura ropa. Munyika muno tinoremekedza those with albinism uye tovada vakadaro. Vana zvipo zvinobva kuna Mwari.

I take pride in the fact that the abhorrent tradition of infanticide against children with disabilities has been eradicated in Zimbabwe.\n\nPart of the crowd that interacted with First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa and received food, hampers, free eye checks, sunscreen lotions and lip care from Angel of Hope Foundation and its partners in Chitungwiza yesterday.\n\nIt is disheartening to witness some husbands are still choosing to abandon wives for bearing children with disabilities, driven by superstitious beliefs.\n\nIt is crucial to recognise that a mother is not to blame for the circumstances of her childs birth. Ultimately, having a disability does not diminish ones humanity.\n\nRegardless of disability, we are all human beings; our differences lie merely in skin tone, hair colour, eye, colour and other physical attributes, she said.\n\nSome individuals, the First Lady said, are born with disabilities, while others may acquire them during their lives.\n\nIn either case, we are united in our shared humanity. Our elders have contributed immensely to the development of our society, they have worked tirelessly to build the foundations upon which we stand today.\n\nTheir wisdom and experience are invaluable resources that we must cherish and learn upon.

By giving them, we not only honour their contributions, but also ensure that they feel appreciated.\n\nSupporting the elderly can take many forms. It can be as simple as spending time with them, listening to their stories and showing them that they are valued.\n\nIt can also involve providing assistance, care and other essential services to improve their quality of life. Community programmes and initiatives that focus on the well-being of the elderly are crucial in creating a supportive environment where they can thrive, she said.\n\nAs the First Lady of Zimbabwe, Dr Mnangagwa said she was committed to advocating for the welfare of elderly citizens and her office will continue to work closely with Government agencies and community leaders to develop and implement programmes that address the needs of the elderly.\n\nAll the philanthropic work that I do, I started way before I became the First Lady. I grew up as an orphan and I would regularly assist the elderly in our community with even household chores.\n\nThis is something I am imparting in todays youth nekuti vana vedu havatozive kubatsira vakwegura vedu vanotoda kudzidziswa. I am teaching them through my Gota/Nhanga/Ixhiba programme. Also, as parents, let us teach our children good morals.

Lastly, I would like to encourage all of us to foster a sense of tolerance and acceptance in our community. Let us, where we can, be our brother and sisters keeper, she said.\n\nAmbassador Zhou said the First Ladys tireless compassion and unwavering commitment to uplifting vulnerable communities has continued to inspire many.\n\nThrough the Angel of Hope Foundation, the Ambassador said the First Lady had shown that the true measure of leadership lay in serving those who often felt invisible.\n\nSunscreen lotions which were distributed to people with albinism through the partnership of Angel of Hope Foundation and Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe.\n\nI would like to extend my deepest appreciation to you for your exemplary dedication to the welfare of the Zimbabwean people. Today, as we come together to celebrate this special programme for people living with albinism, we reaffirm a shared commitment to build an inclusive society that cherishes every individual, celebrates diversity, and leaves no one and no place behind.\n\nChina and Zimbabwe enjoy a friendship that has stood the test of time. Our collaboration spans many sectors: from large-scale infrastructural projects that have transformed the economy, to grassroots initiatives that touch the everyday lives of citizens, he said.\n\nAmbassador Zhou said it was important to emphasize that while big infrastructure projects may capture headlines, their contributions to local communities reflected the heart of partnership between the two nations.\n\nOver the years, China has supported numerous programmes in education, health, and poverty alleviation, underscoring our belief that development is most meaningful when it reaches the most vulnerable.\n\nIn this spirit, we are humbled to extend a donation specifically for Zimbabwes albino population, a group that often faces unique challenges in their daily lives. This gesture is not merely an act of giving; it is a symbol of our shared humanity, a recognition of their strength and dignity, and a commitment to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are met.\n\nPart of the hampers and sunscreen lotions which were donated by Angel of Hope Foundation patron First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa to people with albinism, the disabled and the elderly in Chitungwiza yesterday.\n\nToday we are pleased to announce that the Chinese Embassy in collaboration with the Angel of Hope Foundation, will be donating sun protection and lip balm for albinistic skin types respectively, he said.The albino population in Zimbabwe, he said, is a vital part of the nations tapestry, yet they face significant obstaclesfrom health complications due to sun exposure to social stigmatization that can isolate them from their communities. Their courage in the face of these challenges is nothing short of inspiring.\n\nBy providing resources that enhance their quality of life, Ambassador Zhou said, China hopes to reaffirm the inherent value and potential of every individual.\n\nWe are committed to working alongside the Government of Zimbabwe and organisations like the Angel of Hope Foundation to ensure that every person, regardless of their abilities or circumstances, can thrive, he said.\n\nIn a speech read on his behalf by Retired Major Catherine Kampila, Harare Metropolitan Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Charles Tawengwa praised the First Lady for her well-thought-out programmes which benefited the nation.\n\nHe thanked the First Lady for leading from the front in supporting vulnerable groups without leaving no place and no one behind.\n\nMr Bruce Nyoni from the Albino Trust Zimbabwe congratulated the First Lady on her recent graduation with a Doctor of Phylosophy Degree in Tourism and Hospitality Management.\n\nCongratulations Amai for the doctorate degree you recently earned from the Midlands State University. As a community we cannot give a blind eye to the efforts you make. The work you are doing isnt impacting Zimbabwe alone, but SADC as a whole.\n\nAs a community we remain grateful for the Disability Policy launched. There are a number of benefits we enjoy because of the policy. We would like to thank you for your unwavering support to the disability community as a whole. We now have a Sadc Declaration on the protection of people with disabilities. To the disability community, the door of progress is upon us, I appeal to you to study. Lets move from the charity model to the developmental model. As we journey towards building our nation lets reflect on what we have achieved through the Disability Policy. Amai we have seen the good works you are doing and as people with disabilities we remain in solidarity with your vision, he said.\n\nHonourable Rose Mpofu, the Presidents Special Advisor on Disability said she was proud of the work being done by the mother of the nation.\n\nWe are proud of you Amai. I thank you for what you and the President His Excellency Cde Mnangagwa are doing. You are advancing Vision 2030. Thank you Amai for assisting people with disabilities through Angel of Hope Foundation, for encouraging the able bodied to always assist others. Amai you always preach the gospel of unity, she said.\n\nChinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding distributes hampers donated by Angel of Hope Foundation in Chitungwiza yesterday.\n\nAmbassador Nyasha Nhau underscored the need for parents with children living with disabilities to send their offspring to school to unleash their full potential.\n\nI am thankful for this opportunity you have afforded us to gather here as people living with disabilities this month when we are commemorating the International Disability Day. I am also heading the disability desk in Commonwealth countries representing persons with disability. I have mentioned this focusing on parents with children living with disabilities. We must ensure we send our children to school. If you let them acquire education, they will rise to ambassadorial roles just like myself I am in the Commonwealth and the African Union. I wish to thank our First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa for her love and kindness, he said.\n\nIn a speech read on his behalf by Mr Zimhunga, Public Service and Social Welfare Minister July Moyo praised the First Lady for her dedication and support to persons with disabilities and the elderly.\n\nHe said the sunscreens will go a long way in assisting people with albinism as the nation is currently experiencing a heat wave.\n\nBeneficiaries expressed gratitude to the First Lady.\n\nSekuru Raymond Mukaka said; I was overjoyed by this gesture by the First Lady because I now live a lonely life after losing my wife five years ago. All my children are away working in South Africa and barely send me anything to get by. The First Lady has done a good thing for I now have food and toiletries for Christmas, he said.\n\nEqually elated was Christopher Nzombe who lives with a disability.\n\nAngel of Hope Foundation patron First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa distributes hampers in Chitungwiza yesterday.Pictures: John Manzongo\n\nThe First Lady has given us a deep sense of belonging. People usually look down upon us, but our mother has a loving heart which accommodates everyone. She has been working tooth and nail to see to it that we are well catered for and for that I am most grateful. In the 52 years of my life, I had never been given such love by someone outside my family. I feel greatly loved, he said with a huge smile.\n\nMs Ronika Bunhe, who lives with albinism was also over the moon.\n\nWe struggle a lot with eyesight and the First Lady today swept to our rescue with free eyesight checks as well as the supply of spectacles to all those who needed them. We also have challenges coping with extremely hot temperatures like those currently being experienced in the country and we desperately needed the sunscreen lotions that she has distributed to us today. People living with albinism often live in isolation as they are not well understood by many people, but the First Lady is an all-embracing mother who regularly comes to visit us and offer us programmes to contribute to economic development and feed our families. She is indeed a great mother, she said.\n\n",

We are working out a similar format, he said.\n\nAmbassador Mukonoweshuro said he was set to meet Botswanas Minister of Immigration to action the pronouncement by President Boko.\n\nI am yet to meet the new Minister of Immigration and Human Rights as well as the Permanent Secretary in that office to try and actualise the words by the President, he said.\n\nTurning to consular services at the Zimbabwean Embassy in Gaborone, the Ambassador said they were serving a considerable number of Zimbabweans daily.\n\nThey will be coming for passport renewals, new passports, specific letters pertaining to permit renewals, and birth certificates among other services.\n\nOn a good day especially towards holidays we serve upwards of 100 people a day, sometimes 150 especially when school children are on holiday.\n\nThey are coming for different things like passport renewals, new passports, birth certificate applications and assistance for those that have deceased and those who want to extend their permits. Sometimes its a requirement that the embassy writes papers to authenticate documents, he said.\n\nAmbassador Mukonoweshuro said the Embassy was also in the process of compiling a list of Zimbabweans living in Botswana.\n\nIn a separate interview, Dr Brighton Hurombo, a Zimbabwean lecturing at the University of Botswana, said he was happy with consular services at the embassy.\n\nI am very happy with the services and quality of service being offered here. Today I had come to the Embassy to inquire about my drivers licence and I was very much assisted. Now I will be travelling to Harare for the holidays with no problems, he said.\n\n",

Additionally, a musical fountain, designed to enhance domestic tourism, is nearing completion.\n\nThis fountain utilises water, colour, and music to create an entertaining show.\n\nThis is another indication that we are ready to bring Dubai to Zimbabwe. The fountain will dance to the rhythm of music, resembling the famed dancing waters of Dubai, said Dr Tungwarara.\n\nThe overall development is estimated to cost nearly US$500 million, featuring elaborate designs, including the impressive fountain.\n\nThe Cyber City project is being developed by Mulk International, owned by Dubai-based billionaire Mr Shaji Ul Mulk, who proposed the project to President Mnangagwa during a visit to the UAE.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa subsequently invited Mr Mulk to bring the project to Mount Hampden. The civil works contract has been awarded to Bitumen World, with the first phase already underway. This phase focuses on essential infrastructure such as roads, sewer trenching, and water systems, paving the way for the smart city development.\n\nThe Zim Cyber City will comprise 250 homes, including 80 luxury villas, along with green spaces, offices, and commercial spaces, all connected to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a digital transport system.\n\nIt represents the first real estate investment in Zimbabwe under the Zimbabwe Global Investments (ZGI) Special Economic Zone (SEZ) programme, which has been approved by President Mnangagwa and facilitated by the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion.\n\n",

            "content": "UNTIL the Ministry of Health and Child Care started compiling statistics of how many people are bitten by dogs, very few knew just how serious the problem of uncontrolled and wandering dogs was in Zimbabwe.\n\nBy the fourth week of November, with five weeks still to go before year end, 35 820 dog bites had been reported in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe total number of dog bites must be considerably higher as the figure is for those where someone sought treatment from a clinic, doctor or hospital.\n\nThose who did not bother and just washed the wound at home are not in the total.\n\nThe Ministry figures are bad enough in any case, an average of well over 500 a week or almost 80 a day.\n\nIn the breakdown of the 610 bites in the week to November 24, just under a quarter, 149, were from dogs that proved on investigation to be vaccinated against rabies.\n\nAlmost as many, 135, came from dogs that were definitely not vaccinated against rabies. Most worrying, in about half the bites no one could find out if the dog was vaccinated or not. Rabies is an invariably fatal disease once the symptoms appear.\n\nThe only defence is to be vaccinated promptly after a bite by a rabid animal, or one suspected of being rabid.\n\nIf the dog that bit you cannot be found or identified, and so checked out, there are obviously some difficult decisions to make, based purely on likely probabilities considering the area and its recent history concerning rabies. The huge total of dog bites, and the follow up by the Health Ministry, shows that there are a number of laws and local authority by-laws being broken on a very large scale.\n\nFor a start all dogs in Zimbabwe are supposed to be vaccinated at three-year intervals. Perhaps we have never reached 100 percent, but at times in the past we have come close, and it is generally accepted that at least 70 percent of dogs must be vaccinated to break the chains of infection.\n\nRabies can never be totally eliminated in Zimbabwe, since jackals and some other wild animals can be infected and they in turn bite the first dog in a chain of infection.\n\nBut with more than 70 percent of dogs effectively vaccinated, that chain of infection will be very short, or perhaps not even able to start.\n\nThe dog bite statistics, looking just at the percentage of dogs whose vaccination status could be ascertained, show that only about half of Zimbabwean dogs are vaccinated, and that is a dangerously low fraction.\n\nSo for a start, we need to start checking up on dogs and making sure that the law is followed and that all are vaccinated. It is not expensive and often the Department of Veterinary Services makes sure it is free. While people who climb over a wall or fence or cut through a hedge to gain admission to a property where there is a dog cannot complain if the dog bites them, such legal bites are in a small minority.\n\nMany people keep dogs precisely to deter criminals and since many criminals are either deterred or equipped with poison or weapons to take action to immobilise a dog, few are bitten.\n\nMost people are bitten while going about their lawful business, walking in the streets or on open public land and should be able to do this without worrying that some stray dog will attack them, or some dog will shoot out of an open gate and attack them for walking past its owners house.\n\nSome of these attacks produce severe injuries and wounds, and in the past there have even been people killed by dogs, innocent people who were attacked as they walked past a fence or a gate quite legally and lawfully.\n\nThis year there have been no deaths, but with 26 000 bites that is simply good luck, not something that could have been expected. People are not allowed to let their dogs wander. The law in almost all local authorities is fairly firm on this.\n\nDogs in urban areas must be confined to the premises of their owners, meaning they cannot get into the street or over a boundary into a neighbours property, unless they are under the control of a responsible person, generally meaning being on a lead or being so well trained that they will instantly obey a command to return to the controlling human.\n\nEven rural dogs are not allowed to roam at will and need to be kept on the owners farm or other premises or be under control. They cannot attack schoolchildren passing a village for example.\n\nWhile by-laws exist, and have for decades, enforcement, especially in recent years, has been very slack. Roaming dogs are not reported and gates left open with a dog sitting by them have become all too common, as owners cannot be bothered to stop and get out of their car once they have driven through. All this needs to be reported and then effective action taken.\n\nSometimes the grossly underfunded SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) will round up a bunch of stray dogs, but there are limits and thus local authorities need to attack the menace from the other direction, of fining owners of wandering dogs and those with dogs who leave gates open or walls and fences unrepaired.\n\nThat fine money could even be assigned to more effective action, such as catching and holding stray dogs.\n\nHarare City Council has made promises that it will be enforcing its dog licencing and other dog-orientated by-laws, including limits on how many dogs a household can keep and the need to keep dogs confined on plots or under control.\n\nWe hope arrangements have been made to make the tens of thousands of licence discs in time and have these at all area offices in time, and that inspectors will be going around to ensure the dogs do have collars, again legally required, and that the licence discs are displayed on the collar. The licence money is supposed to cover this enforcement. This is the start of eliminating dog bites, except of criminals climbing clandestinely into private premises.\n\nIt also means every dog owner can be identified through the licence disc and so can be fined for breaches of the by-laws, or can be sued in civil courts for damage or injury inflicted by their dog. And perhaps those bitten by stray dogs will be able in future to sue the dogs owners for medical costs and damages.\n\n",
