Nujoma served as Namibias first president between 1990 and 2005. He was among the last African remaining revolutionaries of his era. Mbumba said the Founding Father lived a long and consequential life during which he served the people of his beloved country.

He is highly revered for his unwavering stance through the countrys struggle for liberation.\n\nHe remained an influential figure in Namibian politics after independence, serving as the countrys first president for three terms between 1990 and 2005.\n\nA Pan-Africanist to the core, Nujoma remained one of Africas last greats, liberation heroes who sacrificed their youths to bring independence to their countries.\n\nThis includes the crop of Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Samora Machel of Mozambique, Nelson Mandela of South Africa, and Jos Eduardo dos Santos of Angola.\n\nA period of national mourning and burial arrangements are expected to be announced soon.
