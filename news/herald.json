This could be service providers in the tobacco industry or any of those whose services and products relate to the industry, said Mr Khumalo.\n\nThe Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB) last week announced that the 2025 tobacco marketing season commences on March 5 for auction floors and March 6 for contract sales.\n\nZimbabwe is expecting 300 million kg of tobacco this season after farmers increased the area under tobacco to 84 661 hectares, surpassing last years 82 392 hectares.\n\nTobacco is the countrys second-largest foreign currency earner after gold, with about 98 percent of the locally produced crop exported in semi-processed form, amid growing calls for value addition.\n\nThere has been high demand for the cash crop in China, and funding from both Government and private tobacco companies has boosted output.\n\n",
