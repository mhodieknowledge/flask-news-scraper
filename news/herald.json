In accordance with the provisions of the Thematic Area on Digital Economy of the National Development Strategy 1, the Presidential Internet Scheme aims to provide reliable broadband internet connectivity targeting all 2 400 administrative wards across the nation. This initiative will employ advanced Low Earth Orbit satellite technology and fibre optic infrastructure to ensure comprehensive coverage and accessibility, said Dr Muswere.\n\nThese will cover schools, Community Information Centres, Zimbabwe Republic Police stations, health institutions, traditional leaders homesteads, Agriculture Extension offices, courts, District Development Coordinators offices, Vocational Training Centres and Growth Points in the wards. The programme will target to connect the unconnected by focusing on the areas and sites that are situated in remote parts of the country and are currently not connected.\n\nHe said the project is expected to start in June 2025 and run until 2030 with continuous review due to the ever-changing technology landscape.\n\nThe Presidential Internet Scheme will bring out the following outcomes to rural communities: enhanced broadband connectivity, improved access to digital services, increased Information Communication Technology utilisation, improved financial inclusion, increased digital literacy, improved digital economy growth, increased transparency, effectiveness and efficiency in governance services. This is in line with the Smart Zimbabwe Master Plan, Dr Muswere said.\n\nResponding to questions from journalists, Information Communication and Technology, Postal and Courier Services Minister Tatenda Mavetera said there were ongoing discussions to partner with Space X (Starlink) and engage other local internet service providers, in a bid to improve internet access and affordability.\n\nShe said they have been engaging service providers to rationalise data tariffs and make them affordable, particularly to the rural community.\n\nWe had conversations on how we can reduce the premiums, and we agreed on a figure that we are going to disclose very soon, and its quite lower than what we are getting as of now. So, we need to conclude on all the documentation so that we can then publicise that, Minister Mavetera said.\n\nWe are going to come up with free Wi-Fi zones that we are going to institute, especially in our rural areas. We will be using our community information centres, to be called digital centres. So, they definitely will have access to free Wi-Fi, and more efforts are still being made for us to work on the price of data. But I am sure you all agree that the price of data has relatively gone down for months.\n\n",

It also reflects confidence in ongoing economic reforms.\n\nAnother economist, Gladys Shumbambiri-Mutsopotsi, echoed similar sentiments, stating: The improvements in sales and employment expectations are encouraging. It suggests that businesses are beginning to see tangible results from their strategic efforts to optimise operations.\n\nZimstat further reported that investment intentions remained positive, with 52 percent of respondents indicating plans to expand their businesses.\n\nSuch intentions are crucial for long-term economic growth and stability, particularly as Zimbabwe seeks to attract more domestic and foreign investments.\n\nThe BTS also revealed that 35 percent of respondents reported increased production during the survey period.\n\nThis up-tick in production is expected to bolster the countrys manufacturing sector, which has been recovering steadily following supply chain disruptions caused by global economic turbulence.\n\nAnalysts believe the positive indicators captured by the survey can be further strengthened through continued policy consistency and improved access to finance.\n\nIf the Government maintains its reform agenda and addresses bottlenecks such as energy supply, we are likely to see sustained growth, noted Mr Shava.\n\nAs the country navigates 2025, the optimistic outlook reflected in the Business Tendency Survey provides a promising foundation for economic growth. The findings will be instrumental for stakeholders across the economy as they plan for the future with greater confidence.\n\n",

And we are going to support our brothers who are in Government. As far as we are concerned, Zimbabwe is part of Zambia, and Zambia is part of Zimbabwe.\n\nThe UPND Secretary-General stressed the importance of non-interference in each others internal affairs and mutual respect, calling for increased trade and educational cooperation.\n\nHe said more than 6,000 Zimbabwean students are currently studying at Zambian universities.\n\nSo, we feel, as a country, these are the kinds of exchanges we should have between the two nations, Mr Imenda said.\n\nHe lauded President Mnangagwa, describing him as an accommodating leader.\n\nWe thank President Mnangagwa for giving us a rare opportunity within a short period of time to see him. As soon as he heard that we were meeting at the Zanu PF headquarters, he indicated to Dr Mpofu, please, I would spare a few minutes to meet our Zambian visitors before I proceed to Uganda; bring them here so that I can greet them. That was a rare opportunity accorded to us. We thank him very much.\n\nMr Imenda said following Cde Mpofus visit to Zambia two years ago, they felt it was their duty to reciprocate the visit.\n\nCde Mpofu said one of the major issues raised during the discussions was that of fugitives who commit crimes in Zambia and hide in Zimbabwe, and vice versa.\n\nSo that is one issue that we deliberated upon, and then we indicated to our counterparts that Zimbabwe recognises and works with political parties that are in power.\n\nHe added that it was important for ruling parties to meet regularly and deal with various issues of mutual interest.\n\nWe agreed that we would be meeting regularly and clearing out some of the grey areas. This was endorsed by many of the members of the UPND.\n\nThe visit marks another step in strengthening bilateral and socio-economic cooperation between the two nations.\n\nPresent at the meeting were Zimbabwes Ambassador to Zambia, Charity Charamba, Dr Mpofu, Foreign Affairs Minister Professor Amon Murwira, and Zanu PF secretary for External Affairs, Cde Simbarashe Mumbengegwi\n\n",

The 65th Edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) is scheduled for 21 to 26 April 2025 and will be held under the theme Industrialisation: Crafting an Integrated Landscape. A key highlight is the extension of the event to six days. The President of the Republic of Mozambique, His Excellency Daniel Chapo, will officially open the 65th Edition of ZITF on April 25, 2025, he said.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Commerce, said Dr Muswere, is conducting strategic dialogues with national Business Member Organisations and industry associations to maximise private sector participation and input.\n\nAs part of preparations for the event, Air Zimbabwe and Fast Jet were engaged with the aim of increasing flight frequency for exhibitors and visitors, ensuring a positive customer experience. As at April 7, 2025, 596 direct exhibitors had registered to participate, compared to 428 who registered during the same period in 2024.

By the end of June we will be receiving new stocks so dont panic, said Minister Mombeshora.\n\nWe have made available US$12 million to import more drugs and this means the additional stock of drugs will now take us up to the end of September so there is no need to panic. We purchase these drugs in batches so that we dont run out.\n\nThe minister revealed that the Government was looking at other avenues to raise funds to procure ARVs other than relying on the Aids levy only.\n\nGovernment was reprioritising to make sure first preference was given to procurement of ARVs and medication for other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis that were mainly covered by US aid.\n\nMinister Mombeshora said conservative estimates showed that support from the US government in terms of fighting HIV and Aids together with malaria and tuberculosis was around 36 percent.\n\nTo cover for the 36 percent funding gap that has been created we are reprioritising the provision of these drugs (ARVs, TB and Malaria) so that there are no consequences and our people do not die, said Minister Mombeshora.\n\nWe are guided by the President Cde Dr ED Mnangagwas philosophy that Nyika Inovakwa Nevene Vayo, and we are doing that in the health sector too, if we get donors they are welcome but they must be a bonus.\n\nAccording to the Minister, there has been a remarkable decline in new HIV and Aids infections in the country that has resulted in the achievement of the 95-95-95 target.\n\nHowever, we cannot afford to be complacent, we must continue to work especially targeting specific vulnerable populations such as sex workers and adolescents, said the Minister.\n\nZimbabwe was also on the cusp of a new dawn with Minister Mombeshora announcing that plans to introduce a National Health Insurance Scheme that would cover every Zimbabwean were in the pipeline.\n\nHe said the Ministry of Finance would work out the modalities of how funds for the scheme would be raised and the amounts involved but pointed out that proceeds from the scheme would also mobilise sufficient funding to equip the countrys health sector and give every citizen health insurance.\n\n",

This is not just about erecting buildings or fixing roads; it is about restoring dignity, order, and opportunity to a suburb that has historically been a pillar of trade and community life in Harare, Minister Tavengwa said.\n\nAmong the measures being rolled out are enhanced security patrols, improved waste management systems, and infrastructural development focused on accessibility.\n\nThe minister said authorities are working closely with law enforcement agencies and local council departments to ensure that Mbare is safe for residents, tourists, and business operators.\n\nWe have boosted lighting in key areas, deployed more police patrols, and introduced smart waste disposal initiatives. Cleanliness and safety are at the heart of this transformation, he added.\n\nMinister Tavengwa emphasised that Mbare is among the top urban zones listed in the provinces master plan for development, with a focus on improving housing, sanitation, public transport, and public spaces.\n\nUpgrading living standards in Mbare is not just a priority; it is a responsibility. We are working on long-term housing solutions and better social services to ensure that residents enjoy a decent quality of life, said Tavengwa.\n\nThe facelift will not only enhance Mbares infrastructure but will also rebrand its image and revive its historic significance as a commercial powerhouse.\n\nThe rehabilitation of roads and the erection of the new Mbare Market are part of a broader strategy to reposition Mbare as an economic giant, said Eng. Tendai Mafoti, Project Manager for the Masimba-led development.\n\nWe want to attract business from across the globe and promote tourism by improving the infrastructure, especially around the Mbare hub.\n\nIn recent years, Mbare has faced deteriorating infrastructure and congestion, deterring both visitors and investment.\n\nThe Government believes that modernising the suburbs core facilities will draw in tourists and traders who had previously avoided the area due to its poor road conditions and outdated market facilities.\n\nThe road rehabilitation works, which include widening, resurfacing, and improved signage on Remembrance Drive and Chaminuka Street, among other major roads, are expected to ease traffic flow and ensure safer, more accessible routes for locals and tourists alike.\n\nEngineer Mafoti said this model will be replicated across other urban centres in Zimbabwe as part of a long-term national renewal strategy.\n\n",

            "content": "WHEN the Mbare Musika traders market went up in flames in October last year, thousands were devastated, having lost both their meagre stocks and the stalls where they could legally do business.\n\nThe Government stepped in promptly, President Mnangagwa declaring a state of disaster which immediately allowed central Government to intervene despite the market being in a municipal area. The thrust of the intervention was not just to help the stallholders get back into business, but to take advantage of the fire and build something a lot better, a proper modern market complex.\n\nIt quickly became obvious that the site, the customer demand and the number of potential traders would allow a centrepiece three-storey market. Meanwhile, the existing stallholders needed somewhere to trade, and a subsidiary site round the corner was allocated for a temporary market.\n\nA proper structure was quickly planned and built, and will be officially opened this week by President Mnangagwa. Although described as a temporary market, it is a proper permanent structure and while able to accommodate several thousand traders, is smaller than the eventual permanent main market structure. The main advantage of this structure is that it could be built a lot quicker than the main market.\n\nThe President will, at the official opening, be delivering on his promises, not only with a decent market already built but also with the ground breaking ceremony for the far grander main market.\n\nBut the traders will already have somewhere suitable, safe and respectable to trade from, and it will be important to keep the market that way. There is an ideal opportunity to work out the organisation and what is needed to maintain a proper market structure, and here those responsible for administering the structure and those holding the stalls need to work together.\n\nThere are certain past problems that need never to recur. For a start, any attempt by criminals in the guise of space barons need to be barred, along with any attempt at sub-letting. Whoever is administering the market needs to be hair-shirted honest, and totally immune to corrupt activity and ready to prevent any emergence of such activity.\n\nPrivate sector markets tend to flourish, but Harare City Council has a poor record. It will be essential, however, that the final administration is worked out, and Government maintains at least a strong watching brief to prevent any sign of dishonesty.\n\nTo keep costs down and stall fees low, stallholders will need to maintain the cleanliness of the market, each making sure their own stall is immaculate while co-operating on aisles and common areas. When you start off with something brand new, the standard is easy to set.\n\nBesides offering a proper market space, this temporary market also offers the opportunity to work out and adjust all the administration and co-operation requirements of the far larger main market that will now be built, and will have space for new people who perhaps do not know each other nearly so well as those who were together before the fire.\n\nAs newcomers are granted stalls, it should be possible to make it explicitly clear just how things work and just how everyone needs to behave.\n\nIt will probably be useful to look at a proper licensing regime for the very small businesses that need a market building. Licensing would be useful in conjunction with the stall allocation records, but cannot and must not be pricey. A very simple and cheap licence, something like the old municipal hawkers licence perhaps but with a monthly fee, would move the stallholders into the ranks of the formal sector, albeit on the bottom rung of that ladder.\n\nWhile most of the businesses at the market will be too small to attract tax, Zimra could still take a look at the larger concerns. In any case since registering for tax is free, or should be free, perhaps it would be a good idea to get the stallholders to start registering, even if their assessed taxes are zero or close to zero. The point is to start the formalisation process so that as tiny businesses grow into small businesses, they are already in the system.\n\nMeanwhile, as the new three-storey complex is being built, thought needs to be given to the future use of the complex the President opens on Friday. It might be described as a temporary market, but it is a good-quality permanent structure.\n\nThere are many possibilities, some linked with the general upgrade of Mbare now starting. As tourism increases and Zimbabweans become prouder of their own cultures and traditions, there would seem to be need for a decent central arts and craftwork market, and as the ordinary traders move out into their own large complex, there would be something really suitable already built.\n\nBut, however Mbare market space continues to be developed, the Government has delivered on its promises to build something modern and upmarket, and is supporting a better future for thousands of people in Mbare.\n\n",
