The scheme involves funding, farm mechanisation, as well as mining equipment among other youth empowerment initiatives.\n\nWe are anticipating a gathering of 5 000 youths mobilised from across all the 10 provinces and the venue is HICC, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has continued to underline the youths critical role in the countrys economic development and as Zimbabwes vanguard.\n\nTowards this end, since the coming in of the Second Republic, various youth-centred initiatives have been rolled out, enabling the youth to actively participate in the countrys economic turnaround.\n\nWe, the older generation played our part to bring about independence, freedom and peace. The ball is now in your court. You must deliver. In unity, the youth of Africa can do more for the realisation of the Africa we want and deserve, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the Second Republic had demonstrated its unwavering commitment to empowering young people through the deliberate and bold placement of youth in key leadership and decision making positions.\n\nThis includes Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies, in Parliament as well as other strategic institutions, such as boards of parastatals and advisory councils among others.\n\nIn view of these achievements, I challenge the people deployed in various leadership positions to continue displaying principles of servant leadership and discipline, while at the same time galvanising the youth to fully participate in the socio economic and cultural affairs of the country, said the President at last months National Youth Day celebrations held in Bulawayo.\n\nTodays launch of the Youth Fund is expected to be attended by investors from Asia, who are keen on investing in the country and creating jobs for the youth.\n\nInvited by Special Presidential Investment Advisor to the United Arab Emirates Dr Paul Tungwarara, four business tycoons, with a combined net worth of nearly US$500 million, will be at the launch.\n\nThe investors are looking for opportunities to drive the countrys economic growth across multiple sectors, including education, renewable energy, and healthcare.\n\nAmong the investors are Dr Ajeenkya Patil, Mr Rajat Verma and Mr Ravi Reddy, renowned multimillionaires from India, as well as Mr Lalu Samuel, a prominent millionaire from the United Arab Emirates.\n\n",

The elephants, concentrated in the Zimbabwean component of the Greater Mapungubwe and Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs), have not only destroyed crops but also endangered villagers, many of whom are now afraid to move around at night.\n\nZimParks spokesperson, Mr Tinashe Farawo, confirmed that teams were dispatched to assess the situation and take necessary action.\n\nSo far, we have shot and killed two elephants in the Mutetenwa area of Beitbridge to control the herd that had been camped there for several days. Our teams will remain on the ground to monitor the situation in all hotspot areas where these elephants are commonly seen during this time of the year, said Mr Farawo.\n\nHe added that ZimParks is conducting continuous campaigns to minimise human-wildlife conflicts.\n\nOur animals are overpopulated, and we must find ways to coexist while saving lives. We advise people in hotspot areas to avoid moving at night where possible. If they encounter elephants or other dangerous animals, they should give them space and immediately notify rangers in their respective areas, Mr Farawo said.\n\nMr Jahson Mugodzwa, the Beitbridge Civil Protection Committee focal person, confirmed the ongoing issues, saying the committee had alerted both the Beitbridge Rural District Council (RDC) and ZimParks officials.\n\nWe have received distress calls from villagers in Mzingwane, where elephants have destroyed several crop fields. Another herd is camped in Mutetenwa, and villagers are living in fear for their safety. As the Civil Protection Committee, we have informed the relevant departments who are already on the ground addressing the matter, said Mr Mugodzwa.\n\nHe added that five teams of stakeholders dealing with wildlife have been deployed across the district to manage the situation.\n\nElephants have become a recurring threat to crops and villagers, particularly those living near water bodies such as the Shashe, Mzingwane, Bubi, and Limpopo rivers.\n\nIn separate interviews, villagers from the affected areas praised the local civil protection committee for its swift response in dispersing the wild animals.\n\nWe are relieved as villagers because we were living in fear of being attacked by the elephants. Many have lost crops in their communal fields, leaving them vulnerable, said Miss Remeketsi Mbedzi, a villager from Malala.\n\n",

India is committed to supporting Zimbabwe in its journey towards economic growth and self-reliance, he said.\n\nBeyond education, India has made significant investments in Zimbabwes infrastructure and trade.\n\nIndian businesses have invested US$600 million in sectors such as mining, textiles, food processing and agriculture, creating 15 000 jobs.\n\nAdditionally, 17 Indo-Zim Technology Centres established in 2008 were recently upgraded with state-of-the-art CNC machines to enhance Zimbabwes technical education.\n\nOn defence cooperation, Ambassador Kumar said a recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed at AERO India 2025 marked a milestone in military collaboration.\n\nDeputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Sheillah Chikomo expressed Zimbabwes gratitude for Indias long-standing support particularly in education and skills training.\n\nThe ITEC programme aligns perfectly with our national vision to enhance education, technical expertise and global competitiveness, she said.We are grateful for the 270 annual scholarships India offers Zimbabwe, as well as the 56 fully funded postgraduate courses under the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR).\n\nShe said Zimbabwe and India signed an MoU at the Central University of Technology and Management (Odisha), which has already seen 71 Zimbabwean professionals admitted for specialised training in fields such as engineering, agriculture and technology.\n\nFurther collaboration has been established with Indias National Forensic Science University, where Zimbabwean professionals are receiving training in cybersecurity, forensic psychology and DNA testing.\n\nZimbabwe aspires to be a knowledge-driven society under Vision 2030. Indias support in modern technical training and skill development is playing a crucial role in achieving this goal, Deputy minister Chikomo said.\n\nIndia and Zimbabwe share centuries-old ties, dating back to the 14th and 15th centuries. India also played a crucial role in supporting Zimbabwes liberation struggle, and this partnership has since evolved into structured cooperation in trade, investment, and education.\n\nAmbassador Kumar reaffirmed Indias philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakammeaning The World is One Familyas the guiding principle behind its engagement with Zimbabwe. As India continues to expand its footprint in Zimbabwe through education, investment and technological collaboration, both nations are set to benefit from stronger economic and people-to-people ties, ensuring a mutually prosperous future.\n\n",

The newly added category of people living with disabilities had five participants.\n\nAt the centre of the competition was Zimbabwes signature dish, the highfiridzi, a delectable mix of beef and leafy greens (rape/covo or tsunga) simmered to perfection.\n\nThe stage was set for a showdown of flavours, as participants from Harare District took to the stoves to prepare Zimbabwes favourite dish  the renowned highfiridzi.\n\nThis beloved Zimbabwean delicacy is usually served with sadza and its name traces back to Highfield, one of Harares oldest suburbs, where lush backyard gardens supply the leafy greens that give this dish its authentic, natural flavours.\n\nTourism and Hospitality Industry Minister, Barbara Rwodzi, was the guest of honour at the event, accompanied by her deputy, Tongai Mnangagwa.\n\nOther notable attendees included senior Government officials from various ministries, such as Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Development, Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development, as well as the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution.\n\nWe want to thank our First Lady for this initiative and for being a patron who is giving us a good direction that is even recognised by UN Tourism which has given our destination an endorsement, Minister Rwodzi said.\n\nShe also revealed that since the inaugural United Nations (UN Tourism) Regional Forum on Gastronomy for Africa held last year in Victoria Falls there has been a significant improvement in the tourism sector.\n\nFrom 2024 July up to now as we are speaking, we are experiencing a number and a number of tourists that are coming from international markets because UN Tourism has endorsed our destinations in a way.\n\nThe cookout programme is a concept introduced by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa in 2019.\n\nSince then, the Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry has been tasked to coordinate the implementation of the programme together with provinces and other line ministries.\n\nMinister Rwodzi also highlighted that Amais Traditional Cookout Competition has made notable strides in inclusivity this year by introducing persons living with disabilities.\n\nAmai has introduced a new approach this year, bringing together people with disabilities and men who can cook for their families, promoting unity and inclusivity.\n\nThis move aligns with the Presidents vision of leaving no one behind and promotes unity and inclusivity.\n\nFrom the four categories, the judges selected the top three winners, who will proceed to the national cookout competition once all provincial competitions have been completed.\n\nThe winners shared their excitement in separate interviews, eager to advance to the national cookout competition.\n\nI didnt expect to win, as I had hastily prepared these dishes, but surprisingly, I emerged as the winner, said Naomi Ngarandi, a Kuwadzana resident living with a disability, who made her debut in this years competition and scooped the first prize.\n\nI would like to thank Amai (Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa) for including persons with disabilities, as it is clear from the competition that we can compete with anyone and take our talents far, she added.\n\nAnother participant, Ms Martha Charenga from Chitungwiza, who was the second runner-up in the persons living with disabilities category, said: I am very excited because we managed to compete among the giants and came out victorious, she said.\n\nChef Nelson Shonhiwa, who took home the top prize in the professional chefs category, praised the Ministry for promoting gastronomy tourism and encouraged his fellow men to participate and hone their cooking skills.\n\nI encourage other men out there to showcase their talents, regardless of the category.

Zimbabwes strategic location at the heart of Southern Africa positions it as a natural gateway to the SADC, COMESA, and AfCFTA markets. This access to a market of over 1,3 billion people and a combined GDP of approximately US$3,4 trillion presents unparalleled opportunities for foreign businesses, he said.\n\nDeputy Minister Modi said the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is a cornerstone of Agenda 2063, the African Unions blueprint for a prosperous and integrated continent.\n\nHe stressed the diplomatic corps role in attracting international exhibitors, investors, and business delegations.\n\nYour role in positioning Zimbabwe as a premier trade and investment destination is not merely appreciated; it is indispensable.\n\nWe rely on your influence to promote this platform as a gateway for investment, trade linkages, and industrial cooperation.\n\nYour advocacy will be instrumental in attracting international exhibitors, investors, and business delegations, he said.\n\nHe also pointed to Zimbabwes commitment to political stability and peace, alongside ongoing reforms by the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (ZIDA), as key factors in creating a conducive investment climate.\n\nZITF is more than an exhibition; it is a dynamic ecosystem of trade, networking, and industrial collaboration. It brings together key stakeholders, fostering mutually beneficial partnerships and driving technological advancement and skills development. We urge you to engage your respective business communities, chambers of commerce, and investment agencies to ensure a robust international presence at ZITF 2025, he added.\n\nZITF Company Chairman, Mr Busisa Moyo, likened economic collaboration to a well-balanced meal, emphasising that retooling industries and securing financing are top priorities for businesses.\n\nAs a meal nourishes our bodies, collaboration strengthens our economy. Industry leaders are focused on mechanisation for scale and efficiency, as well as securing finance for operations and infrastructure, he said.\n\nHe noted that ZITF, as one of Africas premier trade showcases, continues to drive industrial growth and foster vital business connections. ZITF 2025 will spotlight our nations drive toward a sustainable industrial ecosystem. We aim to reduce reliance on raw material exports by encouraging value addition and manufacturing, Mr Moyo said.\n\nMr Moyo emphasised the critical role diplomats play in fostering economic growth by advocating for national interests, promoting trade agreements, and providing valuable market insights.\n\nTogether, we can showcase the potential of our diverse industries and create a vibrant platform for collaboration and growth.\n\nLet us unite in this endeavour to foster deeper connections and explore new avenues for partnership, he said.\n\nThis years ZITF will run from April 21 to 26, 2025, and is expected to attract a wide range of international exhibitors, investors, and business delegations. The event will highlight Zimbabwes industrial potential, focusing on value addition, manufacturing, and sustainable economic growth.\n\nZimbabwe is strategically positioning itself as a hub for trade and investment in Southern Africa, leveraging its geographic location and participation in regional and continental trade agreements.\n\nThe ZITF serves as a critical platform for showcasing the countrys industrial capabilities and fostering international partnerships.\n\nWith a focus on political stability, industrialisation, and value addition, Zimbabwe aims to play a significant role in shaping the global economy while addressing local economic challenges.\n\nThus the involvement of the diplomatic corps and international stakeholders will be crucial in realising these ambitions.\n\n",

At the moment, we are recruiting inspectors to beef up the current numbers, he said.\n\nMr Chiperesa attributed the stability of the ZiG to heightened compliance among businesses, bolstered by efforts from the FIU, the security sector, and the Government crack down on currency manipulators and economic saboteurs.\n\nThe FIU director general acknowledged that compliance levels remain inconsistent in areas where the FIU does not have a permanent presence.\n\nWe have been receiving reports from other centres that businesses there have lower compliance levels. We have been sending some teams on an ad hoc basis to those centres, and we found that indeed in areas where the FIU does not have a presence, compliance levels among traders tends to be lower, he said.\n\nCompliance means businesses across the country must accept all currencies under use in Zimbabwe, and all methods of payments.\n\nMr Chiperesa said to address this gap, the FIUs expansion drive will ensure that traders in all provinces adhere to currency regulations.\n\nHe said the establishment of permanent offices in Bulawayo is a first step, with plans to review and expand to other towns and cities in the future.\n\nWe want to make sure we have a presence in all major centres of the country, starting with Bulawayo. We will review where else we need to deploy permanent FIU offices, Mr Chiperesa said. He reiterated the FIUs commitment to enforcing regulations and making sure that the stability being enjoyed at the moment is maintained.\n\nWe want to consolidate the current stability and make sure that businesses in all provinces are complying with the monetary requirements, Mr Chiperesa said.\n\nSharp disparities between official and parallel market exchange rates fuelled economic instability in the past.\n\nHowever, the Government and the central bank have made concerted efforts to stabilise the ZIG through regulatory enforcement and interventions targeting black market operators.\n\n",

            "content": "Court Correspondent\n\nTHE trial of Michael Smith, accused of defrauding MA Auto Suppliers, trading as Mr Cruiser of at least US$38 000 and R124 000, has resumed with State leading testimony from two key witnesses.\n\nSmith faces multiple charges, including two counts of theft of trust property, 12 counts of fraud, and 25 counts of corruptly concealing transactions from his principal, represented by Mr Michael Scott Asher, before Harare magistrate Mrs Ethel Chichera.\n\nThe first witness, Ms Sophia Mupariwa, a customer services advisor at MA Auto Suppliers, testified about her former boss.\n\nHer responsibilities include attending to customer inquiries, receiving and booking customer vehicles, inspecting vehicles, and generating quotations and job cards, among others.\n\nMupariwa said that from 2020 to 2022, Smith was employed as a director, overseeing daily operations.\n\nDuring this time, the company serviced several vehicles owned by Smith, his family, and his friends.\n\nShe alleged that Smith frequently ordered the release of these vehicles either without full payment or after partial payments, despite the company providing labour and parts for the services.\n\nFor instance, in one case, a client with a Land Cruiser 100 Series was charged US$1 680 for seat covers, but only paid US$850, leaving a loss of US$830 to the company.\n\nOn another occasion, Smith brought in his sons Prado J95 for repairs quoted at US$1 378.46, but paid only US$600, leaving a balance of US$778.46.\n\nThe second witness, Ms Christine Vellah, the finance and administration manager at MA Auto Suppliers, detailed her role in maintaining financial records and ensuring fiscal compliance.\n\nShe testified that Smith managed company cash and would provide her with payment schedules, making it difficult for her to reconcile accounts due to incomplete information.\n\nMs Vellah revealed troubling practices involving a company called Mant Procurement, in which Smith held a 50 percent stake.\n\nThis company allegedly siphoned money from MA Auto Suppliers without providing legitimate services.\n\nFor example, she noted an independent runner charged only 15 percent for transportation, but Smith inflated costs, hiding invoices to justify higher charges, leading to a loss exceeding R100 000.\n\nMs Vellah recounted several other instances of alleged fraud.\n\nOn November 9, 2020, Smith received a US$10 000 loan from Cruiser Bond (Pvt) Ltd without informing her, resulting in the company having to repay the full amount without any record of its use.\n\nIn a sale of a Toyota Land Cruiser 78 series for US$13 000, only US$5 000 was recorded in company accounts, with Smith pocketing the rest.\n\nIn addition, Smith reportedly took company property, including chairs valued at R4 786 and a 95-litre fridge, without ever making payment.\n\nMs Vellah highlighted another instance where Smith instructed her to pay ZW$295 200 for fees related to a jointly operated boat, despite the company only being liable for ZW$88 250.\n\nThe remainder was Smiths responsibility, which he never repaid.\n\nProsecutor Chirenje, through Ms Vellah, tendered documentary evidence relating to cash records, invoices, emails, and bank statements that incriminate the accused largely relating to counts 1 to 14.\n\nDefence counsel Mr Takudzwa Nyambira raised an objection arguing that some of the schedules which the witness was testifying to were not in order.\n\nHe also said he did not have some of the schedules they were being referred to by the witness, but Mr Chirenje said it was not the duty of the State to put them in order since he served him with all the documents.\n\nMr Nyambira then consented to the admission of the said documents into the record.\n\nThe trial continued yesterday with Ms Vellah testifying.\n\nThe case will resume on March 25 with cross-examination by the defence lawyer.\n\n",

We must pay special attention to creating regulatory policies that provide tools to remain more protected in this regard, Deputy Minister Phuti said.\n\nZimbabwe and Cuba have been targeted by imperialist powers for maintaining their resolve to fight imperialism, neo-colonialism, and Western machination to interfere with their sovereignty.\n\n",
