This led to the establishment of stimulation centres focused on disability-inclusive parenting, in line with the National Disability Policy, he said.\n\nThe programme, which is running in Harare, Bulawayo, Zvishavane, BeitBridge, and Mutasa, has already seen the creation of 18 specialised centres.\n\nThese centres provide essential services such as physiotherapy and psychosocial support, helping children with disabilities not only to survive but thrive in a more inclusive environment.\n\nGovernments commitment to the cause reflects a broader effort to ensure that children with disabilities receive the protection and care they need, thereby marking a significant step forward in the fight for disability rights in Zimbabwe.\n\nThrough the initiative, Zimbabwe is paving the way for a more inclusive society where every child, regardless of their abilities, has the chance to live a fulfilling life.\n\n",

Furthermore, any tobacco so treated will be destroyed without compensation to the grower, read the notice.\n\nEDB has been widely used for soil fumigation in tobacco farming for many years and its use will be phased out at the end of December 2024. There are, however, several alternative nematicides and soil fumigation formulations available for nematode control.\n\nKutsaga said new active ingredients were currently being evaluated to give growers a wide variety to select from.\n\nA list of 15 fungicides, growth regulators, herbicides, insecticides, nematicides and suckercides have been banned. These include benomyl, butralin, alachlor, dimethenamid, metolachlor, trifluralin, acephate, chlorpyrifos, fenvalerate, methamidophos, methomyl, monocrotophos, thiodicarb, aldicarb and pendimenthalin.\n\nThe list of approved agro-chemicals bears both the chemical and trade names of the products, company distributor, old and new certificate number, as well as the expiry date with October 18, 2027 being the last expiry date for sanctioned chemicals.\n\nThe list also includes fungicides, herbicides, suckericides, growth regulators and fertilisers, insecticides and nematicides.\n\nThe Tobacco Research Board as mandated by the Tobacco Marketing and Levy Act [Chapter 18:20] continually tests, approves and monitors all crop protection agents (CPAs) for use on tobacco under the pesticide approval scheme service (PASS).\n\nThis legislation has been used to destroy tobacco in the field or offered for sale where the regulations are infringed.\n\nAs over 90 percent of Zimbabwes tobacco crop is exported, therefore it must meet stringent international agro-chemical regulations for acceptance and maintenance of markets, especially in an increasingly competitive global market.\n\nFurthermore, compliance with global health standards, correct and safe use of crop protection agents as well as good agronomic practices in tobacco production are key to sustainable agriculture, Kutsaga further explained.\n\nAgro-chemicals not appearing in the table are either not currently countenanced by Kutsaga or have been removed from the list of approved agrochemicals based on the provisions of the PASS, which came into effect in 2011.\n\nKutsaga also encouraged farmers to refer to the flue-cured tobacco handbook for rates and recommendations and also be aware of the toxicity colour triangle codes.\n\nThe EDB discontinuation notice comes on the backdrop of projected record-breaking tobacco yields for the 2024/25 agriculture season, thanks to heightened prospects of a good rainfall season due to the forecast La Nina weather phenomenon and the increase in average prices in the 2024 marketing\n\n",

This has resulted in the countrys spices and herbs export earnings rising a whopping 120 percent from US$ 2 345 948 in 2021 to US$5 171 898 in 2023.\n\nSource: ZimStats\n\nA local global good agronomic practice (Global GAP) certified and Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) registered company, Dombera Farm, is supporting smallholder farmers to access international markets.\n\nDombera Farm managing director, Mrs Claire Bailey said her organisation provided farmers with top quality plant genetics to produce African Bird Eye Chilli and training on sustainable farming techniques that protect their natural resources and boost their income.\n\nAs one of the five lead firms in Zimbabwe selected to participate in the UK Trade Partnerships Programme (UKTP), Dombera Farm acts as a centralised hub to grade and package products, provides transport and ultimately creates market linkages. We currently have 70 smallholder farmers on seven hectares of land, said Mrs Bailey.\n\nThe growing appetite for spicy foods has resulted in Europe becoming the second biggest importer of dried chillies in the world and developing countries are the major producers. High quality and sustainably produced chillies fetch high prices on the market.\n\nZimbabwe produces chillies with no artificial colours or flavours under high adherence to environmental and international standards. The countrys unique selling point is the slow grown, mountain chillies of superior colour and taste, sustainably produced by smallholder farmers under high environmental standards.\n\nRecently, the centre for the promotion of imports from developing countries (CBI) said the global supply of spices was changing and disrupting the European supply chain.\n\nShipping issues (Red Sea obstruction) are causing delays and extra supply costs, consumption growing faster than production in key producing origins (Indonesia, India, China) and crop failure (floods and droughts) as a result of climate change are causing this disruption.\n\nMany African countries have good climatic conditions for growing spices and are nearer than the traditional sources like India or Indonesia, the analysis showed.\n\nIt revealed that European imports from Africa had been on an upward trajectory from 2020 to 2023 with capsicum, ginger, seeds of anise, cloves and coriander seeds being the most traded spices.\n\nThe top five African exporting countries to Europe are Zambia, Egypt, Madagascar, Nigeria and Morocco.\n\nThe main success factors for African spices to capture the EU market are compliance with EU quality regulations, embracing sustainability, investing in market development and adoption to customer needs.\n\nMain hazards in spices are residues of agro-chemicals exceeding EU maximum residue levels (MRL), microbiological hazards, salmonella, mycotoxins, authenticity and food-approved packaging and correct labelling.\n\n",

A synopsis of the business transacted during the year reveals that, as Government, we have made notable headway in our people-centred national development agenda. In this respect, during the course of the year, we crafted, reviewed and implemented impactful policies, programmes as well as projects in our quest to fulfil the collective aspirations of our citizens. In a nutshell, the 2024 Cabinet Calendar was a success, with its robust and frank deliberations, said the President.\n\nThese discussions were facilitated by the greatly improved quality of memoranda submitted to Cabinet. Guided by the principle of collective responsibility, it was pleasing that as ministers, you rose above your respective sectoral interests, in favour of objectivity and the common national good, with coordination being more seamless. Congratulations.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa chronicled several achievements registered during the year in different sectors that include, energy, agriculture and health.\n\nHe said adequate grain continued to be distributed to citizens under the food deficit mitigation programme following the declaration of a State of Disaster for the 2023-2024 Summer Season, due to the El Nino-induced drought.\n\nThe timely delivery of food aid as well as agriculture inputs to our people at the grassroots level must be prioritised while complaints that transport costs are sometimes passed on to our people, must be honestly addressed. I, therefore, challenge the relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies to apply themselves and devise strategies that will increase transport and logistical efficiency in getting aid and support to our people, he said.\n\nOn health, President Mnangagwa commended stakeholders in the sector for implementing multi-pronged intervention measures which saw the country combat the cholera outbreak during the first half of the year.\n\nHe said mechanisms were in place to deploy the recently approved Multi-Hazard Contingency Plan to curtail the effects of floods and other national disaster emergencies.\n\nI call upon you to provide leadership and assist your communities to mitigate damage and harm to property and life in the wake of the ensuing rainfall season. On the economic front, the revision of economic growth projections, on the back of the El Nino-induced droughts negative impact on agricultural output, was inevitable. However, we remain resolute and optimistic that the fiscal and monetary reforms introduced during the year will increasingly underpin currency stability and usher economic rebound, he said.\n\nTurning to the energy sector, President Mnangagwa said while there was a shortage of power owing to low generation at Kariba Hydropower Station, the improved use and exploitation of renewable energy sources in the country, particularly solar by companies and households, continued to reduce national grid power demand.\n\nThe initiatives by ZESA through new models of Independent PowerProducers are welcome moves to crowd in the private sector in power generation, specifically for their respective energy needs. More campaigns should be mounted to encourage our people, in both rural and urban areas to adopt renewable energy for domestic use,\n\nOn housing, President Mnangagwa said the Government will continue to channel resources towards housing delivery, as well as the upgrading and rehabilitation of both residential and institutional accommodation nationwide.\n\nThe strides made by local authorities during the course of the year are commendable. These include the conclusion of Master Plans by most local authorities. There are also glimpses of mindset change within that sector. Regrettably, cases of corruption emanating from the sector remain worrisome. The bold decision by Harare City Council to transfer waste disposal and management to private entities should be supported and replicated in other local authorities. Quality service delivery to our citizens remains the core objective, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nThe decentralisation and devolution agenda, said President Mnangagwa, has led to an improved standard of life and living environments for people with enhanced basic social services infrastructure.\n\nHe said the Government will continue prioritising the digital economy and empowerment of youths, women and small to medium enterprises.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa also called for innovative financing models to accelerate the reconstruction of the Mbare Traders Market following a fire incident that gutted the place recently.\n\nThe digital technology revolution is the cornerstone of modernisation, industrialisation and efficient service delivery to drive sustainable economic growth, he said.\n\nHowever, the digitalisation of Government information and services was occurring at a slow pace, something he said was worrisome.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa implored Ministers to ensure that Government continues to provide service to the public during the Cabinet break.\n\nAs Cabinet takes a well-deserved break, let us take note that we are not shutting down Government business and the subsequent delivery of service. Mechanisms must be put in place to balance the demands of a family and associated festivities with serving the people of our great motherland, Zimbabwe. The service delivery demands of the people of Zimbabwe must be responded to timely. After all, we are a Government by the people and for the people, he said.\n\n",

These include both ad-hoc as well as standing Cabinet Committees. The worrisome tendency by Ministers and senior officials to absent themselves from meetings is untenable, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nIn some cases, junior officials are delegated to attend and merely warm bench the meetings. This culture is tantamount to dereliction of duty. Permanent Secretaries should ensure that in their absence, only directors and above should attend working party meetings.\n\nHe directed the Chief Secretary in the Office of the President and Cabinet, Dr Martin Rushwaya to monitor Ministers attendance of the meetings.\n\nIn the 2025 calendar year, the Chief Secretary is directed to strictly monitor individual attendance and ensure that errant Ministers and officials toe the line or risk dire consequences. Ministers should remain mindful that Cabinet business takes precedence over all other business, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe said Deputy Ministers should be adequately briefed to help them represent the Government when they attend meetings.\n\nIn cases where Deputy Ministers are assigned, they should be adequately capacitated to enable active participation in the requisite deliberations.\n\nTo this end, I direct that in the 2025 programme cycle and going forward, Deputy Ministers must now sign performance contractors. It is incumbent upon Ministers to ensure that their deputies are comprehensively briefed on Government business and given the latitude for effective involvement, he said.\n\nA few years ago, President Mnangagwa introduced performance contracts for Cabinet Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and heads of parastatals and State entities as a way of encouraging hard work and results oriented workmanship.\n\nHe has also been conferring awards to top-performing Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, and heads of Government departments as the Second Republic continues to foster a culture of excellence, work ethic and servant leadership in its quest to attain Vision 2030.\n\n",

            "content": "Rumbidzayi Zinyuke-Senior Reporter\n\nA solar power initiative is poised to transform the lives of over one million rural households across eight provinces by providing reliable and sustainable energy.\n\nThe implementation plan for the Presidential Rural Solarisation Project received Cabinet approval yesterday, with roll-out expected to commence next year.\n\nDuring a post-Cabinet media briefing, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Dr Jenfan Muswere said the project sought to provide solar power to at least 200 000 households annually over the next five years.\n\nCabinet approved the Presidential Solarisation Project which is a livelihoods initiative aimed at providing sustainable renewable solar energy to household beneficiaries in the eight rural provinces of the country. The project targets approximately 200 000 beneficiaries a year and will run for a period of five years starting from 2025, he said.\n\nThis initiative is expected to enhance energy access, improve living conditions, and promote sustainable development in rural communities.\n\nThe project is part of the broader Rural Development 8.0 Strategy, with a goal to uplift rural livelihoods, enhance agricultural productivity, and boost food security.\n\nDr Muswere said the Rural Infrastructural Development Agency (RIDA) will oversee the implementation of the project through an Inter- Ministerial Steering Committee architecture comprising experts from local universities.\n\nThe project will be financed by the Government and other stakeholders and will provide affordable but advanced solar technologies (batteries, inverters, solar panels and cables) to power gadgets such as light bulbs, radios, televisions, phone chargers, laptops, small refrigerators, submersible pumps and Wi-Fi, he said.\n\nHe said local youths and women will be trained to participate in the installation programmes implemented in the districts and villages across the eight rural provinces of the country.\n\nZimbabwes traditional power generation infrastructure is currently facing challenges in meeting the national electricity demand.\n\nWhile the refurbishment and expansion of the Kariba and Hwange power plants are underway, Government is also pushing increased uptake of renewable energy to close the gap.\n\nThe key step toward improving renewable energy comes at a time when the Zimbabwe and many other countries in the Southern African region have been hit by successive droughts, reducing the amount of electricity generated through hydro power.\n\nThrough the National Renewable Energy Policy, Zimbabwe aims to achieve 1100MW of renewable energy capacity by 2025.\n\nThe Presidential Solarisation Project is one such key intervention which is expected to boost domestic productivity and create employment opportunities in rural communities in line with Vision 2030.\n\nIt also complements other projects already underway including the Gwanda Solar Project and the US$250 million floating solar plant to be built in the Kariba Dam.\n\nZimbabwes renewable energy transition aligns perfectly with global sustainable development goals, particularly SDG 7 which speaks to affordable and clean energy and SDG 13 on Climate Action.\n\n",
