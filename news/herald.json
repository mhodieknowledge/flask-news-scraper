            "content": "Michael Tome\n\nBusiness Reporter\n\nTANGANDA Tea Company Limited says its export sales volume grew by 39 percent to US$15,1 million in the year to September 2024, which accounted for 59 percent of the groups total revenue.\n\nIn contrast, the company experienced a 16,5 percent decline in local sales volume to US$10,6 million.\n\nThe surge in export sales was primarily attributed to a substantial increase in avocado export volumes.\n\nAs the restrictions imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic eased, the company benefited from both the recovery in selling prices and an upswing in demand.\n\nAvocado exports grew significantly, climbing by 40 percent to 2 997 tonnes, compared to 2 148 tonnes in the same period the previous year.\n\nThis rise was bolstered by an increase in average selling prices, which improved to 75 US cents per kilogramme, up from 44 US cents in the past year, reflecting the global markets improved conditions following the easing of pandemic-related restrictions.\n\nHowever, not all product categories shared this positive trajectory.\n\nMacadamia nut exports faced challenges, experiencing a decline of three percent, dropping to 1 508 tonnes from 1 551 tonnes the previous year.\n\nThis downturn was largely due to logistical complications stemming from rescheduled shipping, which affected the final consignment of 286 tonnes.\n\nSimilarly, bulk tea exports also saw a slight decrease, falling two percent to 6,137 tonnes from 6,238 tonnes in the prior year. The drop in tea export volumes was linked to a decline in tea quality,negatively impacted by extreme temperature conditions experienced throughout the year.\n\nAdditionally, the prevailing market conditions in Kenya significantly affected the tea-export average selling prices. They decreased from US$1, 44 per kilogramme in the prior year to US$1, 34 per kilogramme in the current fiscal year, further worsening the challenges faced by Tanganda.\n\nRevenue for the year of US$25, 7 million grew by nine percent from the prior year of US$23, 6 million primarily attributable to an increase in avocado export volumes and the recovery of their selling prices as Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased, said Herbert Nkala, Tanganda Tea Company chairman in the full year financial review to September 30 2024.\n\nMr Nkala highlighted that the developments occurred against a backdrop of economic instability characterised by exchange rate fluctuations, depreciation of the local currency, and persistent inflationary pressures.\n\nAfter the new local currency was introduced on April 5, 2024, the economy witnessed a resurgence of the challenges, culminating in a 43 percent devaluation of the ZiG in September 2024.\n\nThis devaluation contributed to a further weakening of market confidence in the local currency.\n\nDespite the Governments implementation of tight fiscal and monetary policies to stabilise the economy, Tanganda said, domestic currency stability continued to be threatened by structural economic challenges.\n\nThe situation had been further compounded by the El Nio which adversely impacted the agricultural sector and coincided with a period of subdued international commodity prices, thus significantly affecting overall economic performance.\n\nDespite navigating these mixed challenges, Tanganda achieved a profit after tax of US$1, 4 million, a turnaround from a loss of US$3, 1 million reported in the previous year.\n\nThe companys total revenue for the year reached US$25, 7 million, reflecting a nine percent increase from the prior years US$23, 6 million.\n\nOperating profit also increased significantly, soaring by 223 percent to US$1, 9 million.\n\n",

            "content": "Oliver Kazunga\n\nSenior Business Reporter\n\nTHE Construction Industry Federation of Zimbabwe (CIFOZ) has commended the Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) model saying the initiative promotes growth and development of the construction sector.\n\nUnder National Development Strategy 1 (NDS 1), the five-year economic development policy running through 2025, the Government has prioritised infrastructure development as one of the 14 critical pillars to drive the country towards the envisioned upper middle-income society by 2030.\n\nAgainst this background, the Government has prioritised infrastructural development, calling on construction industry players to tap into opportunities under the PPPs arrangement, where various infrastructure projects have been initiated and developed.\n\nProjects in which the PPPs model has been embraced include the US$88 million Mbudzi Interchange in Harare, US$121,7 million Gwayi-Shangani Dam project in Matabeleland North Province, as well as the US$300 millionBeitbridge Border Post modernisation project, which has positioned the country well for the implementation of the One Stop Border Post concept with the neighboring South Africa.\n\nIn an interview, CIFOZ chief executive officer Mr Martin Chingaira said We are commending the policy changes (to PPPs), where locals are now preferred for most of the projects.\n\nThat has given our local companies in the built environment a new lease of life because we are participating in various infrastructural development projects through PPPs.\n\nHe said the Government had also engaged the private sector, encouraging it to create more jobs using the PPPs and utilise the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (ZIDA) website for priority projects.\n\nAny economy in the world can only do better when the private sector is participating in infrastructure development, unlike waiting for the Government to mobilise funding for the projects.\n\nWe are saying to our members, gone are the days we waited for public tenders to be flighted for us to get jobs but we need to engage for PPPs to create linkages that will create more money through profits, return on investments\n\nWhenever we talk about the construction industry or the built environment, first of all, we say we are the barometer of any economy  thus for the economy to grow we need roads, dams, housing, schools, universities, commercial buildings and so forth.\n\nThis means that when the construction industry is activated, manufacturers of cement or bricks, and those who do timber and ceilings, among others across, the value chain will increase production, said Mr Chingaira.\n\nHe said the construction industry federation would forge ahead with the PPPs model, adding that as long as the population of Zimbabwe keeps growing, more infrastructure like roads, social amenities, health and educational facilities would be required.\n\nCurrently, we are talking about congestion on our roads just because we have not expanded or dualised most of our roads or constructed new roads.\n\nAs long as there is population growth, it means we have to expand every facility we are using for us to be comfortable.\n\nSo there is a lot of work  we need more roads, dams, schools, and industrial buildings and thus there is a lot of work and opportunities for the built environment, said Mr Chingaira.\n\nIn this ZiG276,4 billion 2025 National Budget Statement presented last month, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube said aside ZiG58,6 billion to shore up infrastructure development.\n\nConsistent with our aspirations for Vision 2030, resources will be availed towards funding the 2025 Infrastructure Investment Programme including intergovernmental fiscal transfers amounts to ZiG58,6 billion whose breakdown is as follow: budget revenues of ZiG28,4 billion, development partner support of ZiG1,2 billion, loan funding of ZiG1,8 billion, and statutory and other funding of ZiG27,2 billion, he said.\n\nMinister Ncube highlighted that on account of the continued infrastructure delivery needs and the limited funding capacity, amid the increased funding requirements to close the infrastructure gap, all available funding instruments for projects such as the budget, bond markets, bank loans, equity issuance and guarantees, should be leveraged.\n\n",

The outlook for industrial metals is murkier, with trade moves, potential changes to Bidens climate laws and Chinese demand all likely to play a role, ING said. Bloomberg\n\n",

Teslas stock has soared nearly 71 percent so far this year. Its market cap is US$1,23 trillion.\n\nThe stock has surged since Donald Trumps victory in the US presidential election, as investors wagered the electric vehicle maker would benefit from Musks close ties to the president-elect.\n\nMark Malek, Sieberts chief investment officer, previously told BI that some sort of premium has been placed on the stock as a result of Musks very public involvement in Trumps campaign.\n\nTesla could continue to make further gains.
