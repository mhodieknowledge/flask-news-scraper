In horticulture, Zimbabwe has a significant opportunity to export fresh produce, especially blueberries, avocados, citrus fruits, and chillies.\n\nThe demand for organic and natural products is also on the rise in Singapore, creating openings for Zimbabwean exporters of organic teas, dried fruits, nuts, jams, and sauces.\n\nZimbabwean dried fruit, particularly mangoes, pineapples, and bananas, could find a receptive market in Singapore, given the preference for high-quality dried products, said ZimTrade in its latest monthly publication.\n\n",
