We need help, and we need it now, he said.\n\nWe are now thinking of relocating to safer places because the local authorities are not responding swiftly to this emergency issue.\n\nSewage is flowing right inside our houses we cannot even enjoy Christmas celebrations with others as flies are always roaming around worst of it the smell of raw faecal matter.\n\nAnother resident, Tecla Bomba said the situation reminds her of the 2008 period when she was admitted at Chitungwiza Central Hospital due to cholera.\n\nWe do not want history to repeat itself here, cholera is a deadly disease, I was diagnosed with cholera in 2008 together with my children but we were lucky to survive due to urgent medical assistance that was rendered to us. Now the same area has been hit by this sewage crisis bringing back the trauma, she said.\n\nSpeaking in a telephone interview, Chitungwiza Council public relations officer Mr Tafadzwa Kachiko said they are looking into the matter.\n\nPlans are in a pipeline that we sort out sewage issues in Chitungwiza focusing on our 2025 proposed budget to the tune of US$5,1 million, he said.\n\nWe hope that by next year Chitungwiza will restore its smart town status. Our works department is working tirelessly to fix water issues and they need financial and mechanical support since the sewage issues are overwhelming, especially this rainy season.\n\n",

In Zimbabwe, as in many parts of the world, road traffic injuries are among the leading causes of death, particularly among our youth. This is not merely a statistic; these are our brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, and friends, he said.\n\nEach loss is a tragedy that reverberates through our communities. This campaign is not just the responsibility of a few; it is a collective effort that necessitates the involvement of every individual, community, organization, and government agency.\n\nTogether, we can create a safer environment for all road users- pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, and passengers alike. We must cultivate an ethos of responsibility and respect on our roads. Each one of us has a role to play.\n\nDr Nhanhanga said whether it is driving within speed limits, obeying traffic signs, drivers should avoid driving under the influence of alcohol or substances.\n\n",

In addition, we processed 69 992 departures versus 81 235 processed last year during the same period.\n\nShe advised travelers to avoid the use of third parties to clear with the department of immigration since in most cases these turn out to be conmen.\n\nMrs Magaya said those travelling with children must ensure they have valid passports and the necessary supporting documents.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Tourism and Hospital, Dr Takaruza Munyanyiwa is already on the ground leading a team to ensure there is a seamless flow of traffic at the border.\n\nWe are here on the ground and happy with the feedback we are getting from travelers coming through Beitbridge Border Post, said Dr Munyanyiwa.\n\nWhat we have noted from most travelers is that there is a need to harmonise payment processes to cut the time they spend in queues paying levies and other compliance fees.\n\nGenerally they are happy with the permanent separation of traffic into cargo, buses, and light motor vehicles.\n\nIn separate interviews, most travelers said they were happy with the ambiance, signage, and separation of traffic at the border.\n\nI was served well this time around compared to the last three years. I am happy about the introduction of the eTIP system which is a good step by the Government embracing e-governance, said a motorist who preferred anonymity.\n\nA cross-border transporter identified as Ncube said the separation of traffic was a game changer that has helped reduce the turnaround time at the border.\n\nIn previous years, all the traffic would be processed from one building which saw travelers spending a minimum of 24 hours to pass through the border.\n\n",

            "content": "Nqobile Bhebhe, Bulawayo Bureau\n\nThe Government is undertaking a comprehensive review of existing policies and regulations to facilitate the effective implementation of the parole system and establish community correctional centres.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, in partnership with the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service (ZPCS), are working to implement the system that is outlined in the new Prisons and Correctional Service Act.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa recently reassured the ZPCS of continued Government support to enable the organisation to fulfil its constitutional mandate while officiating at a pass-out parade of correctional officers at Ntabazinduna Training School.\n\nThe parole system initiative underscores Zimbabwes commitment to transforming its prison system from one of punishment to one focused on rehabilitation and reintegration.\n\nParole is the conditional release of prisoners before they complete their sentences. The new Act has provision for the establishment of the State Parole Board and sets conditions for early release from prison.\n\nThe system needs ways of measuring how each prisoner considered for parole would have met the required conditions.\n\nAn inmate can be released through a decision made by the President, the State Parole Board, the Commissioner General of Prisons, or the Minister responsible for Prisons and Correctional Services.\n\nThe State Parole Board is authorised to release inmates on day parole.\n\nSome of the considerations for granting parole include whether an inmate has displayed meritorious conduct, self-discipline, responsibility and was industrious while in prison.\n\nPersons to be released early must not present undue risk to society when on parole, and their release must contribute to the rehabilitation and reintegration of the inmates into society as law-abiding citizens.\n\nIn his address at the combined 154th and 155th recruit correctional officers courses pass-out parade held at ZPCS Ntabazinduna Training School recently, Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi said that in liaison with ZPCS, the ministry is reviewing policies and regulations in line with the provisions of the new Act.\n\nThis will positively see the effective implementation of the parole system and establishment of community correctional centres, among other aspects. These programmes are crucial in advancing the reintegration process and also assisting in reducing overcrowding in correctional facilities, he said.\n\nMinister Ziyambi added that ZPCS is leaving nothing to chance to address challenges faced by inmates and ex-inmates in their passage to reintegration into society.\n\nHe said ZPCS has initiated a bid to facilitate the establishment of a foundation aimed at addressing these challenges.\n\nThrough stakeholder involvement, the foundation will provide support programmes and mobilise resources necessary for the successful implementation of reintegration initiatives. As a Ministry, we are fully behind this ingenuity and will ensure that the vision becomes a reality.\n\nHe noted that it was also vital to make concerted efforts and continue fostering regional collaboration among neighbouring correctional services to holistically enhance successful reintegration.\n\nI, therefore, urge all correctional services in Africa to fully use the African Correctional Services Association in order to propel exchange programmes for mutual benefit towards successful reintegration. It is our belief that African problems should be solved by African solutions.\n\nSpeaking at the same ceremony, ZPCS Commissioner-General Moses Chihobvu said the enactment of the new Act had empowered ZPCS to bolster its efforts in the rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates.\n\nBy focusing on rehabilitation over punishment, the new legislation aims to strengthen the furnishing of former inmates with the requisite skills and support for successful re-entry to society after serving their sentences, he said.\n\nReintegration is crucial not only for the personal growth of released inmates but also for enhancing public safety and reducing recidivism rates. When ex-offenders are provided with access to education, employment opportunities, and social services, they are more likely to become contributing members of society.\n\nHe noted that the holistic approach fosters a sense of belonging and encourages positive citizenship, ultimately strengthening the fabric of the nation.\n\nHe said through effective reintegration efforts, ZPCS sought to transform lives and promote a more inclusive and resilient society.\n\n",

Just going to Ngundu costs US$20, and I might end up paying US$30, so I hope to find a direct one, she said.\n\nBut on other routes, bus operators mantained the same fares. If you look, Chinhoyi and Bulawayo routes are still the same , I hope they will not increase tomorrow (today), Mr Tinashe Gwekwe said.\n\nA bus driver plying the Harare-Karoi route, said: Usually during this festive season we increase fares because people will be carrying a lot of luggage and the heavy weight translates to huge fuel consumption.\n\nPushcart operators were also making money, as they were the most preferred option for carrying peoples goods, being capable of navigating the congested roads with ease.\n\nI am targeting US$100 a day, and I am praying that this congestion will persist, so that people will be dropped far from the bus stop, allowing us to charge them handsomely, a pushcart operator who identified himself as Tindo said.\n\nSimilarly, at the Simon Muzenda Street bus terminus, some operators had marginally increased their fares with pirate taxis the worst.\n\nTouts could be heard mocking passengers bound for Shamva, who were waiting for buses that cost US$3.\n\nYou are hesitant to board this kombi, were going to increase the fare to US$8 from US$5 at 6pm , a tout said.\n\n",

The stock levels meant that prices would be stable as they could only be pushed up by profiteering retailers when there were shortages.\n\nWith all maize in stock reserved for Government food schemes, millers had to import their entire supply except for what they had contracted with the farmers.\n\nSome of the products that have been supplied to the market were maize meal,rice, flour, salt and other essentials.\n\nThe surplus supply has stabilised prices, making these commodities accessible to all, in both formal and informal retail outlets, he said.\n\nMoving forward, we remain committed to supporting local agriculture through contract farming and exploring additional source markets to maintain affordability.\n\nMr Musarara thanked the Government for its private sector-led approach to achieving national food security.\n\nThe Governments policies align with international best practices and have enabled us to adapt effectively to these challenges, he said.\n\nThe Government has implemented a number of measures to stabilise the economy including strengthening the foreign exchange market that has seen the stability of the local currency, the ZiG, against the US dollar and other currencies, even on the parallel market.\n\nA crackdown against smuggling through the countrys borders has also been launched, amid startling revelations the country may be losing an estimated US$1 billion annually in revenue through smuggling.\n\nThrough partnerships with private investors, a number of electricity generating projects, especially in the coal sector, have been initiated and are expected to ease power shortages the country has been experiencing this year by the end of next year. This will enable Zesa to release more electricity to the manufacturing sector.\n\nMinister Ndlovu said they are focusing on strengthening collaboration with the private sector and invited all stakeholders to engage actively with the Ministry.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Industrial Reconstruction and Growth Plan 2024-2025 had been launched to promote industrial development as the country strives to be an upper-middle income society by 2030.\n\nThe plan seeks to address challenges hindering the growth of the manufacturing and commercial sectors, including issues such as competitiveness, the cost of doing business, promotion of links with small and medium enterprises, innovation and research.\n\nThe Ministry was allocated ZiG509 million for the implementation of the plan in the 2025 National Budget.\n\n",
