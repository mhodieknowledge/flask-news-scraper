He said he would engage her so that she could assist in the matter.\n\nOn October 6, Nyarugwe told Mr Muraza that Mrs Chinamasa had requested for US$ 10 000 to release the bus and goods.\n\nMr Muraza gave his wife the money to hand over to Nyarugwe.\n\nA few days later, Nyarugwe asked Mr Muraza to go with him to Zimras offices in Masvingo to follow up on the release of the bus and goods.\n\nThe court heard that Nyarungwe introduced himself as a Zanu PF Central Committee member to Mr William Murashwa Gadzikwa, Zimra Masvingos Technical Services Manager. He informed him that he had come to check on the seized goods.\n\nNyarugwe was advised that they were still waiting for some report before they could compile the release terms.\n\nOn October 24 , Mr Muraza received an email from Zimra stating that he was supposed to pay ZWG 893,529.59 duty, a fine equivalent to the duty, interest and storage fees.\n\nMr Muraza immediately contacted Nyarugwe over the issue. The court heard that Nyarugwe claimed that he had given Mr Murazas money to Mrs Chinamasa but promised to reimburse it.\n\nNyarugwe then became evasive and has not reimbursed the money.\n\nInvestigations revealed that Nyarugwe was not in any way connected to the Zimra Commissioner General and does not know her personally.\n\n",

Human rights groups have echoed similar concerns, labelling the checkpoints and iron gates as tools to enforce apartheid conditions on Palestinians.\n\nAs tension continues to rise, the Palestinian leadership is urging the international community to take decisive action to end the suffering and ensure justice for the Palestinian people.\n\n",
