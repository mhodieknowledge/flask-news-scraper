Picture: OPC\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the facilitation of more opportunities and windows of support such as low-interest financing, business development services, transfer of skills and technologies as well as market access for the sector, will be availed.\n\nHe directed all partners to the Mbare Musika Traders Market and future projects to ensure that levies and rentals are pegged at competitive and affordable levels.\n\nOccupants and customers of the markets were also called upon to be responsible custodians of the modern facilities.\n\nThe President called for collaborative synergies between SMEs and relevant ministries, departments and agencies, saying such collaboration was important towards the formalisation of small businesses and start-ups.\n\nAs we continue to diversify our economy, the formalisation of this sector must never be viewed as a direct threat to the survival and sustainability of your respective businesses.\n\nOn its part, my Government will continue to improve the ease of doing business, through reducing barriers to entry, as well as streamlining business registration, licencing and compliance levies.\n\nDialogue with the SMEs sector is an essential building block for enhanced business productivity. There should not be a them and us mentality, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe added that the Government and SMEs sector must act as one for the good of the country.\n\nThe Ministry of SMEs was challenged to deploy innovative initiatives that will see more SMEs becoming fully fledged business entities with footprints beyond Zimbabwe and the SADC region.\n\nGovernment is determined to see the realisation of the Urban Transformation Agenda designed to primarily focus on addressing rapid urbanisation by prioritising safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable cities and human settlements, in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Number 11.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said Phase 2 of the New Mbare Musika is designed to be a multi-storey complex with improved sanitation, fire safety features and organised trading spaces, thus resonating with Vision 2030 and the SDGs.\n\nHe applauded Masimba Construction and Mkambo Misika Hubs, whopartnered the Government in the project, for their professionalism and work ethic, which have ensured the completion of Phase 1 of the market.\n\nEarlier on, President Mnangagwa commended Mbare residents for their consistent support of Zanu PF that saw the revolutionary party winning in that constituency in the 2023 harmonised elections.\n\nBe assured that the interests of the people of our great motherland, Zimbabwe, remain at the core of my Administration. Two weeks ago, I was pleased to receive, at State House, representatives of Vendors and Tuckshops Associations from across the country.\n\nThat engagement, among many others I have had in the recent past, gave me general insights into matters that concern you and the broader Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises sector. Government is seized with facilitating an environment where your businesses can thrive for an improved standard of living for all, he said.\n\nDefence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri said the construction of the market resonated with President Mnangagwas national vision spelt out in the National Development Strategy 1 and Governments ultimate goal of elevating Zimbabweans to a prosperous and empowered upper-middle-income society by 2030.\n\nThis bustling market has been a cornerstone of Zimbabwes SMEs and a vital source of livelihood for traders and their families.\n\nThis initiative has not only restored the markets infrastructure but also upgraded it to a cutting-edge facility, demonstrating Governments commitment to creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, she said.\n\nLocal Government and Public Works Minister, Daniel Garwe, said the commissioning of the market was a precursor to the second phase of another market to accommodate more people.\n\nThis event also marks the ground-breaking ceremony of the main market, which is going to accommodate 10 000 traders, he said.\n\nMinister Garwe said following the fire disaster that destroyed stock and stalls, President Mnangagwa directed the engagement of domestic investor, Masimba Holdings, in terms of the urban transformation policy to undertake reconstruction works.\n\nThe infrastructure, as you have witnessed, Your Excellency, is augmented by social amenities such as banks, Zimbabwe Republic Police Post, advanced security services, CCTV, advanced ablution facilities, advanced fire suppression systems, and availability of water infrastructure, among others, he said.\n\nWomen Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Minister, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa, said the new market was set to transform the SMEs sector that has been looked down upon over the years.\n\nMinister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Harare Metropolitan, Charles Tawengwa, commended President Mnangagwa for restoring the livelihood of traders following the fire outbreak.\n\nYesterdays event was attended by Cabinet Ministers, permanent secretaries, Harare City councillors, captains of industry, Zanu PF leadership, and traders, among others.\n\n",

However, even excluded activities may come within the scope of monitoring against money laundering if the activities are carried on by any high-risk entity.\n\nClause Six repeals the existing section of the principal Act requiring the registration of a PVO and replaces it with a more comprehensive provision that brings within the scope of registration certain trusts that were previously excluded from registration.\n\nIt requires organisations not previously within the scope of the PVO Act to now register as PVOs, but in these cases, time will be given for compliance.\n\nThis means those organisations not registered as trusts, but which receive external funding to pursue objects of a charitable nature, such organisations will be afforded a reasonable period to comply with the Act.\n\n",

As the shops continue to thrive, the women have been banking the profits and currently have a bank balance of US$20 000.\n\nIn her remarks, Dr Mnangagwa said she was gratified with the hunger for success shown by the beneficiaries of her programmes in Masvingo and encouraged them to keep working hard to realise more success.\n\nI brought about the First Ladys Widows Associations in all provinces seeking to see whether since your husbands have died, the homes still dignified. As a mother are you still walking the correct dignified path? When left alone following the death of your spouse, you will shoulder all the responsibilities for the family. However, God will never give you a burden that you cannot carry. I then said let me go out there and tell these women that you are important. Amai makakosha munodzora, muri muchengeti uye munochengeta nekubatsira even vasiri vekwenyu. You help even in instances that do not benefit you. I then ask again as to whether you are the woman who is being spoken about, or you are the one who is living recklessly after the death of your husband snatching other peoples husbands. This is where the test is, as people want to know how you are faring. Vanhu vakatotarisa kuda kuona magariro amurikuita as a widow. A mother is not selective, she is a defender and builder even to neighbours. It is not a crime to be widowed. Accept the situation. To men, if you have a family, fix all the challenges while you are still alive seeing to it that children are brought up well. Prepare for your children because some of your wealth will be taken away by greedy relatives, making it difficult for your children to live like others out there, she said.\n\nThe broiler chickens being reared by widows under First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwas widows association in Masvingo yesterday\n\nDr Mnangagwa implored women to use their hands to earn good names in their communities.\n\nParticipate in projects that give you income and good names in the communities. On my 575 Gender-based Violence toll-free line I am receiving calls to the effect that some widows are being promiscuous and bringing all types of men home. They are the same men who are raping their children and some of them start dating your daughters. Does it augur well for a mother and her daughter to share a man? These boyfriends destroy and waste away the inheritance that was left behind by your husbands. Women, let us stay away from embarrassing things which earn us bad names, she said.\n\nDr Mnangagwa did not hide her appreciation of the womens hard work.\n\nI am gratified with the work that you are doing. When I brought up these projects, I told you that I would come back for a follow-up. Masvingo you have made me proud and even those who helped me with the resources I gave you will be happy seeing your zeal to prosper. You did not embarrass me. Continue working in groups and in harmony, she said.\n\nBikita district also came and shared what it accomplished.\n\nTheir representative Mrs Matimba said they now boast 2 400 chickens which they are selling in boarding schools and restaurants around the district.\n\nThey also have close to US$ 10 000 cash and intend to start fish farming and a goat project soon.\n\nThe broiler chicks being reared by widows under the First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwas widows association in Masvingo yesterday\n\nMrs Chengeto Shindi representing Chiredzi said;\n\nAmai we took the groceries and road runners you gave us to the district. We sold the groceries and reared chickens before starting a pass-on scheme where we gave one another the chickens in our wards. The profits we got from selling groceries we started a fushai scheme and a started goat-rearing project, she said.\n\nSaid a representative of Chivi District: After selling the groceries you gave us Amai; we realised a substantial amount of money which we distributed to all the constituencies in our district. In the constituencies, they used the money to start other projects which are flourishing.\n\nMwenezi District was over the moon.\n\nIts representative described Amai as a worker, organiser, manager, adviser and nation builder (WOMAN).\n\nAmai our members are 650 and we are all benefiting from your generosity. We are rearing chickens and keeping money. We will not let you down. Amai we are awestruck by your hard work and love.\n\nA representative of Gutu District, Mrs Makuwaza gave a brief on what they did with the groceries received from the First Lady.\n\nShe said after selling groceries, they realized over US$3 000 which they now want to use to start other projects while continuing with their retail business.\n\nZaka district was also thankful to the mother of the nation.\n\nTruly as widows, we had bad names but you came and erased them and made us walk on the correct path. We are now dignified people through working hard for ourselves. Amai from selling our products we generated money which we want to use for piggery and poultry projects, she said.\n\nPart of the widows follow proceedings during their interactive session with the patron of First Ladys Widows Association, First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa, where they also benefited from a legal clinic in Masvingo yesterday\n\nMrs Tambudzai Mutume (57) was among the widows who expressed gratitude to the First Lady for her life-transforming initiatives.\n\nMy husband died in 2010 and I was left with five children. The First Lady gave us groceries and chickens which we sold and realized money which we kept and we are rearing more chickens and used part of the money to start goat rearing project, she said.\n\nMrs Elizabeth Marimira the chairperson of the project in Ward 23 was equally ecstatic.\n\nI lost my husband in 2017 and was left with seven children. Out of my children, only three were grown up. We were given groceries which we sold and started chicken projects and goat rearing. Before this, most widows would take other peoples husbands and frequent bars but since we started these projects no one ever did this as we were married to our projects. We are benefitting from the projects and we are now able to send our children to school. No widow will ever frequent bars and we thank the First Lady for her benevolence, she said.\n\nThe First Lady donated packs of vegetable combo seeds to the women for horticulture farming.\n\nShe further donated tonnes of wheat to communities.\n\nMrs Senzeni Kapanga from the 575 GBV call centre, which is stationed in the office of the First Lady underscored the need for families to live in peace at all times.\n\nAmai through the call centre is assisting people in a lot of ways but the biggest thing she is focusing on is staying well in the homes, in marriages, in families and communities. Amai varikukurudzira runyararo vachiti no to gender based violence. If we are not living well in our homes, it also means even the children are not happy. It also means even the community is not safe. If all these spaces are not safe, it therefore means no one will get the time to work. You can call on 575 and get help. In the call centre, some agents are multi-lingual. We are happy to have come here today where there are widows because we receive a lot of reports against them.\n\nMost of the reports we are getting is that we as mothers are not controlling ourselves and we are doing things that are not expected of us. We are engaging in harlotry and this is affecting our families, children and communities.\n\nMost people who phone are children who would have been bashed. When going further to assist the child, it will come out that the mother was being promiscuous openly and the child was following suit thinking that it was how it was done. We are also encountering mothers who are not taking care of their children. A child complains of being raped and the mother sends the child to that person. Some mothers are protecting their relations with lovers even after they would have raped their child. We have a case where someone concealed a rape case to protect a boyfriend only for the protected man to continue doing so until the child contracted a sexually transmitted infection, she said.\n\nA Masvingo police Victim Friendly Unit representative said cases of rape, domestic violence and statutory rape were on the rise. She urged women to report such crimes timeously without fear.\n\nPlease know that every man is a potential abuser, therefore do not leave children with any men, including relatives. Look after our children, she said.\n\nMasvingo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Ezra Chadzamira paid tribute to the First Lady for her empowerment initiatives.\n\nWe are grateful for your income-generating projects Amai. You have embarked on a lot of projects, which are meant to ensure that the country becomes an upper-middle-income economy by 2030. You are complementing the work being done by the President. We are very grateful because you are leaving no one and no place behind. You have impacted the lives of women, the elderly, children, widows, and everyone. You have transformed the lives of people from marginalised communities. You started Agric4She which has given birth to a lot of success stories countrywide. You empowered seven districts in our province with the Widows Association Project, and today we are witnessing success stories from one of the districts. You have chosen to come to the periphery of Masvingo. To you, distance is not a barrier. You are always travelling across the country even in hard-to-reach areas to make sure that everyone lives a decent life, he said.\n\nMinister Chadzamira praised the First Lady for playing a role in the preservation of the countrys traditional values.\n\nYou are also playing a pivotal role in the preservation of our traditional cultural values. You are teaching women, men and children to dress decently, and we are seeing the results of your teachings. We would also like to thank you for bringing us food. You always teach us to earn a living through using our hands, he said.\n\nBulawayo-based arts group IYASA provided edutainment.\n\n",
