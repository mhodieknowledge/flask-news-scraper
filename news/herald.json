I am giving you 72 tractors,10 combine harvesters, 10 vehicles for provincial youth, and 10 rigs for boreholes, he said.\n\nIn addition, I am launching a US$5 million Presidential Youth Mining Equipment Scheme for our young artisanal miners. These two initiatives are just, but a few of the many that will follow in due course. The Youth Empowerment Bank will administer the fund.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the Government would be mobilising more financial resources towards this initiative.\n\nAdditionally, from the US$50 million financing facility that my Government is mobilising to accelerate irrigation development, for climate-proofing agriculture, US$10 million will be reserved for the youth in agriculture.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa enjoys proceedings at the launch of the Presidential Youth Empowerment Fund in Harare yesterday.  Pictures: Believe Nyakudjara\n\nThe President called for transparency and accountability to ensure deserving youths benefit.\n\nAs you distribute these resources, I urge you to exercise high levels of morality and ethical consideration. The schemes must identify deserving and capable youth.\n\nNo to favouritism and corruption. I want this to be an enduring and sustainable fund which benefits the majority of our countrys youth.\n\nHence, the US$2 million fund must not be taken as a free hand-out, but administered as a revolving one that issues loans, which are paid back for the benefit of many more people after.\n\nThe President said symbiotic relations between the Zanu PF Youth League and the Ministry of Youth Empowerment, Development and Vocational Training were mutually beneficial and served the youth.\n\nAs the programmes unfold, the President said, the Youth League national structures will be capacitated to offer technical assistance, as well as monitor and evaluate progress of the schemes for sustainability.\n\nTo this end, the use of technology is the way to go to enhance productivity. I acknowledge youth development and empowerment strategic partners who have heeded our call for partnerships in resource mobilisation for this scheme, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nThe Zanu PF Government, he said, was walking the talk and delivering results to the people.\n\nAs we continue to explore avenues to deliberately empower the youth, who are our future leaders, the Second Republic has appointed many young people into strategic areas of governance and decision-making.\n\nThis is designed to create an ideologically sound and experienced cadership in all facets of our society. These young people are performing incredibly well so far. Well done.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa shares a lighter moment with an exhibitor during a tour of stands before the launch of the Presidential Youth Empowerment Fund in Harare yesterday in the company of Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri (second from right), Youth Empowerment, Development, and Vocational Training Minister Tino Machakaire (left). Also present was Harare Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Charles Tawengwa (wearing black cap behind Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri)\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said his administration had implemented tangible youth empowerment projects such as the piggery, heifer and poultry schemes, among others.\n\nIn addition, land for both agriculture and housing has been availed and is being distributed to ensure that youths can run profitable agricultural businesses and also build decent homes.\n\nHard honest work pays, while focus, discipline and professionalism in all business endeavours are indispensable values for the success and prosperity of our nation. This culture should be preached and entrenched among you, our young people, he said.\n\nThe President urged youths in business to be good citizens in the management of the environment and communities.\n\nTo this end, the Youth League and the Ministry of Youth were called upon to be more visible during National Clean Up days set aside as the first Friday of every month.\n\nI hardly see you. In the spirit of Ubuntu, I am because we are, I exhort the youth of our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe, to uphold the culture of voluntarism and community service in aid of the vulnerable, elderly and disabled, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nYouth-owned businesses should embrace innovation, emerging technologies and deployment of ICTs to create new product lines, and penetrate value chains and global markets, which have become essential ingredients to realise business success.\n\nYesterdays event was held under the theme, Fuel Youth: Ignite the Future.\n\nIt was attended by Defence Minister Oppah Muchiguri-Kashiri, Youth Empowerment, Development and Vocational Training Minister Tinoda Machakaire, Zanu PF Politburo members, Presidential Investment Advisor Dr Paul Tungwarara, development partners, and senior Government officials.\n\nYoung Women 4ED follow proceedings at the launch of the Presidential Youth Empowerment Fund in Harare yesterday\n\n(From left, foreground) Cdes Mike Bimha, Elifasi Mashaba, Munyaradzi Machacha, Lovemore Matuke and Jenfan Muswere join a bumper crowd of youths who turned up in their thousands for the launch of the Presidential Youth Empowerment Fund in Harare yesterday\n\n",

Time after time they come to the old man to take wisdom and I enjoy it, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nSo I had a fantastic morning talking to my two younger brothers. What else would I want when my younger brothers find time to come talk to me.\n\nDr Adesina said his decision to stay on in the debt negotiations was influenced by Zimbabwes standing as a strategic country in the region.\n\nThe AfDB boss said he was personally and fully committed to seeing through the success of the arrears clearance platform.\n\nYou know, this is a full commitment. I am personally committed to this. The African Development Bank is fully committed to thisyou know, it goes beyond myself or my term because Zimbabwe is a very important part of the African Development Bank.\n\nZimbabwe is a critical country in the SADC region and, in fact, I was talking to His Excellency (President Mnangagwa) about how we look at regional trade, and the Zimbabwe Railway network is critical in our centre for everything, he said.\n\nThe AfDB, said Dr Adesina, remained a friend to Zimbabwe.\n\nSo, we clearly, as the African Development Bank, are committed to this. And this, of course, will continue. We are a friend of Zimbabwe, and everybody else is, he said.\n\nZimbabwe has a debt overhang of US$21,1 billion.\n\nOf this, external debt stands at US$12,3 billion and domestic debt at US$8,7 billion, and the country has been making efforts to settle the arrears.\n\nDr Adesina said President Mnangagwa had shown tremendous goodwill from the onset towards the success of the arrears clearance process.\n\nAll I can tell you is that the President is strongly supportive of this process and will do all it takes to make sure that this ends.\n\nWe are excited about the progress we have madeall the bilateral partners that are here, World Bank, IMF and UNDP and everybody else, we are all working together for the same goal.\n\nAnd, you know, we are not fully there yet but we also, as African Development Bank, have been very supportive of this process, he said.\n\nDr Adesina said everything was being done to ensure everything goes well, including the roping in of financial and legal advisory firms.\n\nWe have a clear timeline that has been done. We have paid to secure a global financial advisory firm to support Zimbabwe towards that end.\n\nWe have also paid for a legal advisory firm that is advising the country and we are looking into how to get the bridge financing framework in place that will allow Zimbabwe to be able to clear some of the arrears that it has in multilateral financial institutions, he said.\n\nFormer President Chissano said there was progress being made in engaging international lending institutions and it was especially encouraging to note that the AfDB remained committed to Zimbabwes arrears clearance process.\n\nSo, it is about the progress that we are reaching in all the processes. It is a matter of continuation, and I think that soon, we will have better results.\n\nI also was worried that when he (Dr Adesina) leaves, what is going to happen but he reassured me that he personally will continue with us, but also the bank will continue with us.\n\nSo, we are satisfied with all the measures that are being taken to stabilise the country in all forms, he said.\n\nFormer President Chissano said the future was bright for Zimbabwes continued economic growth.\n\nWe are happy that there is immense hope for economic growth in the country and that the agriculture sector will grow better.\n\nAnd we are expecting to have better wheat, and maybe we will buy from here, he said.\n\n",

My vision is firmly anchored in the professionalisation of the procurement profession across Africa. We recognise that procurement is a vital driver of economic development and social progress.\n\nTo maximise the impact of procurement, Dr Ruswa said, Africa must ensure that procurement practitioners are equipped with the necessary skills, knowledge and ethical standards to navigate the complexities of the field.\n\nIn pursuing this vision, I am committed to advocating for sustainable procurement practices that prioritise not only economic efficiency but also environmental stewardship and social responsibility,he said.\n\nMs Uwingeneye commended Zimbabwes potential, expressing confidence that the country would build upon the successes achieved during her tenure.\n\nShe said the main purpose of the APPN is to provide a platform for learning and networking to public procurement policy makers, regulators and practitioners of its member countries.\n\nDuring the year 2024, we have managed to record some good performance and I would like to mention some.\n\nWe managed to have eight knowledge sharing sessions and these gathered almost 2 000 participants, said Ms  Uwingeneye.\n\n",

Wishing her the greatest of success, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nCoventry becomes the 10th president of the IOC. She becomes the first woman and African to ever be elected to the position in the 131-year-hisytory of the Olympic movement.\n\nAt 41, Coventry will also be the youngest ever to be elected to the position after she powered to victory ahead of six other contestants in a heavyweight field where all her rivals were male.\n\nIn the poll staged in the seaside resort of Costa Navarino in Greece Coventry garnered 49 votes to secure a landslide victory and land the most powerful job in world sport.\n\nHer nearest rival Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain had 28, while Briton and World Athletics president Sebastian Coe was distant third with eight votes.\n\nOther candidates David Lappartient (four) Morinari Watanabe (four) Johan Eliasch (two) and Prince Feisal Al Hussein with two completed the race.\n\nCoventry will officially take up the role on June 24, after incumbent Thomas Bach steps down following a 12-year spell in charge.\n\nShe takes over the mantle at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty around the globe, question marks over the direction of the Olympic movement in the 21st century, and more scrutiny than ever on issues concerning gender identity and equality, among others.\n\nBut for Coventry, Zimbabwe, Africa, and athletes around the world, the victory is in doubt about living a dream.\n\nThis is an extraordinary moment. As a nine-year girl, I never thought I would be standing up here one day getting to give back to this incredible movement of ours, Coventry said after her election.\n\nBefore becoming a member of the IOC, she was a standout athlete for Zimbabwe, winning seven of the countrys eight Olympic medals to date.\n\nShe is also Africas most decorated Olympian.\n\nHer colleague in Cabinet and Minister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Monica Mutsvangwa also described her triumph as a proud moment for this nation and for Coventry.\n\nHearty congratulations, Kirsty Coventry!Your historic election as the first woman and African president of the International Olympic Committee is a proud and defining moment  for you, for Zimbabwe, and for our entire continent, Mutsvangwa said.\n\nYou have shattered barriers and inspired generations, proving that Zimbabweans can lead on the worlds biggest stage.This achievement signals a new era of inclusion, hope, and possibility  a testament to your unwavering commitment to sport, equality, and global unity.\n\nWe celebrate you and stand with you as you take this bold step forward.\n\nOnce again, makorokoto, congratulations, amhlope! Mutsvangwa said.\n\nAccording to reports from Greece, the first round of voting yesterday didnt proceed without issues though, with numerous voters complaining about problems with their technological voting systems.\n\nAt one point, IOC director general Christophe De Kepper  who was hosting the voting  humorously said that a member was testing his patience with his complaints.\n\nTo the surprise of many, the voting was quickly closed after the first round with a winner already reaching the absolute majority (50% + one vote) mark needed.\n\nAnd after a 30-minute break, Coventry was announced as Bachs replacement and the 10th president of the IOC; of the 97 votes.This is not just a huge honour, but its also a reminder of my commitment to every single one of you that I will lead this organization with so much pride with the values at the core and I will make all of you very, very proud and extremely confident in the decision that youve taken today, Coventry said.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart, and now, weve got some work together. This race was an incredible race and it made us better, made us a stronger movement.\n\nCoventrys first major event to oversee will be the Milan-Cortina Winter Games next year in Italy, with the Opening Ceremony less than 11 months away.\n\nIn her manifesto for the IOC presidency, Coventry stated she hopes to make sport a bridge between countries and cultures, a source of hope and a force for good.\n\nShe also stressed her commitment to addressing inequality in sports, which also means strengthening womens sports by protecting female athletes and promoting equal opportunities for women at all levels of our movement.\n\nHer historic win was made all the more, sweeter that it came in the Womens Month when the world is celebrating all females.\n\n",

The high intellect of our top leaders cannot be undermined by any factional expedience.\n\nPart of the Presidents responsibility during the war of liberation was to fish out and arrest spies, gather intelligence and security in rear, front and any other quarters.\n\nAs such, this rhetoric cyber excitement will not be tolerated under whatever circumstances. No one can rewrite the history of the President, he said.\n\nDr Muswere also warned the media against being used to propagate anarchy and despondency.\n\nThose found wanting, he said, would face the full wrath of the law.\n\nWe have also witnessed the extent to which some journalists have assigned themselves a responsibility to sow seeds of factional havoc. Those bent on the flagrant violations of the Cyber and Data Protection Act; as well as the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform Act) at whatever level in society must stand guided not to nurse irrational factional appetites which seek to undermine the unity of our leaders in the ruling party and Government.\n\nIt must be clear that those media outlets illegally peddling and propagating these heinous atrocities will face the full arm of the law, he said.\n\nDr Muswere then urged malicious entities to refrain from attacking members of the Presidium.\n\nWe note with dismay the abuse of technology and online media platforms which have been spewing malicious attacks on the Vice President of the Republic of Zimbabwe Cde Dr. C.G.D.N Chiwenga.\n\nThe issues that are being peddled are sub-judice, which are linked to his past marriage. This is against basic ethics of journalism and general standards of criminal procedure and the judiciary system, he said.\n\nName dropping, added Dr Muswere, was another violation that the Government would not entertain. There are then some malicious segments printing inflammatory t-shirts and lying that they have been sent by senior Zanu PF officials, we say to you, we know who you are, that nonsensical name-dropping and maliciousness should stop forthwith, he said.\n\nInsincere whistleblowing with respect to inexistent cases of corruption remained criminal and would not be accepted especially if it involves high ranking civil servants, Dr Muswere said.\n\nAgain, all procurement processes in Government are done in accordance with the law. The continued maligning of senior bureaucrats cannot be justified under the pretext of hollow freedom of expression as it is prone to injure the integrity of the nations public institutions. Therefore, the media is encouraged to desist from abusing its constitutional liberties to be a purveyor of malice and fake whistleblowing, he said.\n\n",

Those who try to ignore or defeat the rules find themselves in serious trouble which can include large civil penalties and loss of a lot of money.\n\nNow the team will be deployed outside Harare, with the Bulawayo office to open in a couple of months, something that should be fairly easy since the Reserve Bank already has offices in that city.\n\nThis also supports the Government policy of having services devolved where possible, so that everyone who needs to interact with that service can do so fairly easily.\n\nThe unit is then looking at setting up offices in other provinces and this should not be particularly difficult, the main need being some office space and the links to the major databases and good communications now possible.\n\nA lot of the work of the unit, as its name implies, is gathering the necessary intelligence to take effective action to those who break currency and banking rules, and that needs more than just peering into screens watching the movement of money, important as that activity can be.\n\nIn Harare, people who find themselves faced with businesses that break the rules on what currencies to accept and the like find it easy to phone or message the FIU, and get a thank you reply quite promptly followed by an investigation. The problematical behaviour has ceased by the time the person making the complaint goes back for their next visit.\n\nSpreading the officers of the unit across the country allows more people to contact the team easily, and a lot of the intelligence must come from such contact since those breaking the rules do not announce that they are doing so and would rather the authorities never found out.\n\nIt also means investigation can be a lot easier and quicker when someone is only a short drive away from the offender and can easily check out the complaint or the suspicion and confirm that illegal activity is taking place, or clear the business under suspicion which benefits the law-abiding.\n\nSo the spreading of the FIU wings has a double benefit of getting more on-the-ground information and intelligence and being able to take effective action.\n\nThis will become an ever larger proportion of the FIUs likely work. The officers sitting in front of screens watching money move between bank accounts have been so effective that a lot of those breaking the rules now no longer transfer money through the system, knowing that this leads to an investigation and the imposition of penalties.\n\nThe drop in such impositions shows that the system does work, by making the fiddling that used to be common now too expensive to continue.\n\nThe result has been the currency stability we have been seeing along with a lot less of other despicable practices.\n\nSo more of the nasty work is now done more secretly, using cash as much as possible. At the same time the hammering of the biggest players has still left the thousands of little money manipulators, dealers and cheats operating, and getting a grip on them is obviously why the FIU both wants to expand and to spread itself around the country.\n\nJust having the larger manipulators out of action is only a first stage.\n\nWe need to see the medium and small offenders reined in as well so that everyone moves into using their innovative temperaments into crating and growing honest and productive businesses. That has the dual advantage of still enriching the innovator, legally now, and also enriching the country by adding value.\n\nIn an ideal society we do not need enforcement, but no society is ideal and Zimbabwe, with its dual currency system, is more vulnerable than most.\n\nBut the major drive of the Second Republic to eliminate corruption and associated activity has made enforcement of proper rules and laws easier.\n\nThis is because the whole enforcement system is orientated towards having a clean society while encouraging growing and innovative businesses, making it clear that this growth and innovation is to be applied to legal and honest businesses, not cheating and impoverishing ones neighbours.\n\n",

            "content": "Freeman Razemba, Senior Reporter\n\nGOVERNMENT has stepped in to rehabilitate and construct roads in major cities and towns across the country to address years of neglect by local authorities.\n\nFor the past two decades, many urban roads have fallen into a state of disrepair under the watch of opposition-run local authorities, even though they receive funds from the Zimbabwe National Road Authority (Zinara) and ratepayers.\n\nWhile the maintenance of roads falls under the purview of local authorities, on several occasions, central Government had to step in after councils failed to execute their duties.\n\nIn the latest instance, Government, through Zinara, is set to begin work on key roads, including Willowvale Road, which stretches from the intersection with Simon Mazorodze Road (Rothmans) to Glen View and Budiriro in Harare.\n\nThis initiative is part of a broader road rehabilitation programme spearheaded by the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development, which has identified at least 40 major roads in and around Harare needing urgent attention.\n\nTransport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona recently met with all 10 Provincial Road Engineers to discuss the programmes progress and challenges.\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday, Minister Mhona said good infrastructure is important for economic growth.\n\nCity roads fall under the purview of local authorities, but for the past 20 years, we have seen these roads neglected, Minister Mhona said.\n\nHis Excellency, President Cde Dr Mnangagwa has made it clear that we cannot stand by and watch. We must take action to rehabilitate these roads for the benefit of our people.\n\nMinister Mhona said Zinara collects and distributes funds to road authorities nationwide for road maintenance and rehabilitation.\n\nHowever, he expressed concern over the mismanagement of these funds by some local authorities.\n\nDuring the Commission of Inquiry, it became clear that some local authorities were diverting funds meant for road projects to other uses, he said. For example, some officials were earning exorbitant salaries of up to US$30 000 while roads in their areas crumbled. This is unacceptable.\n\nTo ensure transparency and accountability, Minister Mhona announced that Zinara would now publicly disclose, on a quarterly basis, the funds allocated to local authorities for road projects. This measure aims to hold councils accountable and ensure that funds are used for their intended purpose.\n\nGovernment has also taken a hands-on approach to road rehabilitation, intervening to directly oversee the repair and construction of key urban roads.\n\nAmong the priority roads are Harare Drive and Nemakonde Road, which connect major areas such as Trabablas Interchange, High Glen Road, Kuwadzana, and Kirkman Road.\n\nKirkman Road will be widened, while Harare Drive will be dualised to ease traffic congestion.\n\nWe are not just focusing on major highways but also on roads that connect our communities, Minister Mhona said.\n\nFor instance, we are rehabilitating Willowvale Road from Rothmans to Glen View, ensuring that residents in these areas have access to well-maintained roads.\n\nThe Minister acknowledged that even after rehabilitation, maintaining the roads would remain a challenge for some local authorities.\n\nTo address this, the Government is working closely with Zinara to ensure sustainable road maintenance practices are implemented.\n\nThe road rehabilitation programme is a giant step towards improving urban infrastructure and enhancing the quality of life for Zimbabweans.\n\nAs the Government takes the lead in addressing years of neglect, residents in cities like Harare can look forward to safer, more reliable roads that support economic growth and community development.\n\nDevelopment is for all Zimbabweans, Minister Mhona said.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that our roads are restored to their former glory and beyond, for the benefit of current and future generations.\n\n",

            "content": "Blessings Chidakwa, Arts Reporter\n\nDzimwe nzendo, taurai madzoka!\n\nThis phrase, a signature line from Mark Ngwazis hit song Taurai Madzoka, once resonated deeply with fans as the young sungura artist rose to prominence.\n\nAt one point, Ngwazis rapid ascent led to bold comparisons with the undisputed king of sungura, Alick Macheso. The debate intensified in 2022 when the two musicians released albums just weeks apart.\n\nMachesos Tinosvitswa Nashe album launch took place on June 10, 2022 while Ngwazis Nharo neZvinenharo followed suit on June 25.\n\nWhile both albums were critically acclaimed, for Ngwazi, this marked a career breakthrough.\n\nFor decades, Macheso has ruled the sungura scene largely unchallenged, particularly after the tragic passing of his longtime rival, Tongai Dhewa Moyo, in 2011.\n\nSince then, no artist has truly posed a serious threat to his dominance until Ngwazis emergence.\n\nSome fans saw Ngwazi as a fresh competitor, while others dismissed him as just another hopeful trying to dethrone the king.\n\nThe alleged feud?\n\nWhile both artists have publicly denied any bad blood, industry insiders and fans have often speculated about an unspoken rivalry.\n\nNgwazis rise was seen as a challenge to Machesos throne, sparking debates on social media and among sungura lovers.\n\nMacheso, known for his humility and mentorship, remained diplomatic about the comparisons. As for Machesos publicist, Tichaona Makahamadze, said they will never be swayed by comparisons.\n\nAs for being compared to various artists againmuwonero wavo asi hazvifi zvakatichinja zvatiri, ticharamba tiri band revanhu kusvika nariinhi, he said.\n\nAsked about how Macheso has managed to withstand pressure from comparison of other artsists, Makahamadze said there is always pressure especially being such a big branch and looking foward to grow even bigger as well as getting worldwide recognition.\n\nThe way we handle the pressure depend on the type and time of pressure so we take each challenge as it comes.\n\nWhen we feel the heat. We do our best to maintain the standard we always believe in Musikanavanhu, Yahwevarikumusoro kudenga, he said.\n\nMakahamadze on allegations that Macheso was probably at his weakest, he said: Munhu wese ane kodzero nemaonero nemafungiro ake uyethe perspective they refer to as weakest from our end , each show we playtinenge tiinefull crowd, full house.\n\nWe have more than five dozen songs that can be released even all at once but we time our things and only do it when it really is necessary and deemed fit. Right now our fansvarikunakirwa na Hunhu hwakashataand as soon as we get the indicationkuti yave kupera mutowe drop the next in line.\n\nMakahamadze said it is a new strategy, a change in how we do this and as you know some people are resistant to change and will quickly black mail uskuti tatadza, just wait and see.\n\nEven in an interview yesterday, Ngwazi continued to downplay the perceived rivalry.\n\nI dont do music for competition.Chedu kuita basa, thenmafans vanemaonerewo avo akasiyana(Our duty is to make music, and its up to fans to interpret it in their own way).\n\nWhat I can only do is to thank all those who support me, keep that spirit alive so we can achieve our goals, he said.\n\nThe Reality: A Battle for Relevance?\n\nDespite the denials, the industry tells a different story. Macheso remains a household name with an unwavering fan base, while Ngwazis star, once seen as a major threat, has somewhat dimmed.\n\nSome critics argue that Ngwazi, while talented, has struggled to maintain the same momentum that initially fueled the comparisons.\n\nMeanwhile, Macheso, even at what some call his weakest, continues to dominate the sungura landscape. His unmatched stage presence, deep lyrical content, and distinctive bass-playing style set him apart from his would-be competitors.\n\nWhile Ngwazis efforts are commendable, he still has a long way to go before he can truly stand toe-to-toe with the legendary Baba Sharo.\n\nThe question remains: Will he rise to the occasion and cement his place in sungura history, or will he fade into the background like many before him?\n\nOne thing is certain sungura fans will always have something to debate.\n\nA genre in crisis?\n\nPerhaps the rivalry debate is a distraction from a bigger issue: the perceived decline of sungura itself.\n\nRenowned music producer and arts critic Clive Mono Mukundu believes modern sungura has lost its authenticity, with copycats dominating the scene.\n\nSunguras death is a suicide, not a homicide. Sungura artists are the ones killing sungura.\n\nThe biggest threat to its growth and survival is a lack of diversity. Most artists are busy imitating Alick Machest, he said.\n\nMono recalls that during sunguras peak, there was a variety of distinct sounds John Chibadura, Leonard Dembo, Pengaudzoke, and the unique Dendera and Zora styles.\n\nBut these days, everyone sounds the same, he added.\n\nCreative entrepreneur and digital creator, Plot Mhako disputed that sungura was dying, but largely stagnated.\n\nMachesos dominance cements his legendary status while highlighting the absence of equally consistent successors.\n\nMark Ngwazi and others bring fresh energy but still struggle to establish a unique sound and match Machesos influence, he said.\n\nArtists like DT Bio Mudimba have introduced refreshing elements, yet the genre needs more structured support, innovation, and fresh talent to stay vibrant.\n\nFans and the media also have a big role in embracing and promoting emerging sungura artists.\n\n",
