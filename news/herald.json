            "content": "Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau\n\nThe Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) working with other border agencies on Tuesday intercepted and destroyed 21 boats which were being used to move contrabands between Zimbabwe and South Africa along the Limpopo River.\n\nMost of the boats were identified with the aid of drone surveillance technology. In a statement Zimras Commissioner General Ms Regina Chinamasa said they confiscated and destroyed 21 smuggling boats and 20 paddles along the Limpopo River.\n\nThis operation, a testament to Zimbabwes strengthened border security measures, highlights the growing impact of drone surveillance and a whole-of-government approach to tackling illicit trade, said Ms Chinamasa.\n\nThe sting operation saw Zimras elite Drone Operations Team, Customs Officers, and other border security stakeholders patrolling key smuggling hotspots, providing real-time aerial intelligence that led to the swift interception and destruction of smuggling infrastructure.\n\nShe said the drones have revolutionised border security, providing unparalleled aerial surveillance and tracking smugglers in real time, even in remote areas that were previously difficult to monitor.\n\nThe commissioner general added that the drones were also equipped with night vision and high-resolution cameras.\n\nShe said the drones have been instrumental in identifying illegal crossing points and exposing deeply entrenched smuggling networks.\n\nThis is a game-changer in our fight against smuggling. The use of drones has allowed us to detect smuggling activities with precision and speed, ensuring that illicit goods never make it into the market, said the Commissioner General Chinamasa.\n\nSmuggling is not just about tax evasionits an attack on Zimbabwes economy, local industries, and the safety of our communities. Through this collaborative approach, we are sending a strong message: Zimbabwes borders will not be a playground for criminals.\n\nMs Chinamasa said the latest intelligence-driven operation targeted five notorious smuggling corridors, informally known as Valley 1 and 2, Proof, Godfather, and Thembani.\n\nShe said at these illegal crossing points, the surveillance teams uncovered a fleet of inflatable boats strategically positioned on both the South African and Zimbabwean sides; vehicles on standby, ready to transport smuggled goods inland; donkey-drawn carts, motor vehicles, and boats, being used to ferry illicit goods across the border.\n\nShe said the revenue collector will continue to intensify aerial patrols, deployment of more drones, and increase joint border operations with security agencies to completely dismantle smuggling syndicates.\n\n",

We are appealing and challenging community trailblazers especially the property development and hardware consumable fields to come to the front and assist Gogo with this important rebuild, she said.\n\nWhat is needed are bricks, cement, electrical reticulation, plumbing, consumables, roofing, tiling, fixtures and fittings and the beams for roof and finishings like doors.\n\nMathazia said Zesa has given the greenlight to the Malisela family to clear off all the debris.\n\nThey have done their investigations so there was phenomenal support that came through from men at the Roman Catholic church which she belongs to, she said.\n\nThey have managed to remove rubble from three rooms in the house but had to stop due to the weather. We are going to go by the engineers report which was so kindly done pro-bono.\n\nThey said they need to look at the floor to make sure that it is not cracked. If its cracked then we will have to replace the floor and the demolish the walls and then build up\n\nMathazia said before the rebuild, they need to have the plan of the house so that they can get a quantity surveyor to survey and provide the quantities for building materials\n\nMathazia said the Malisela family has enough clothing, bedding from donations.\n\nShe said this week she is expecting to circulate a petition for Gogo Malisela to replace important documents relating to her house.\n\n",
