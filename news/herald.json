Your voices (media) can help keep HIV high on the national agenda, advocate for resource mobilisation, and hold stakeholders accountable.\n\nYour presence here underscores the vital role played by editors in shaping public understanding, influencing behaviour, and ultimately contributing to our national response to HIV and AIDS, he said.\n\nMr Yekeye said the workshop for editors has been organised to strengthen collaboration in the national HIV response through accurate, responsible, and impactful media reporting.\n\nAs gatekeepers of information, your commitment to accurate, responsible, and impactful reporting is indispensable.\n\nThis workshop has been designed to provide you with the latest information on the HIV and AIDS landscape in Zimbabwe, including the impact of the recent funding cuts by the United States government.\n\nIn addition to the usual updates, we have included topical issues such as microbial resistance, use of artificial intelligence in cervical cancer screening, advanced HIV diseases, and HIV funding, among others, for your benefit, he said.\n\nThe two-day workshop comes a few days after journalists toured Mashonaland East Province as part of NACs ongoing efforts to strengthen collaboration with the media, which is critical in promoting awareness.\n\nThe global community aims to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030, as outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThis requires strong political leadership, data-driven approaches, and addressing inequalities, alongside ensuring sufficient and sustainable funding.\n\n",
