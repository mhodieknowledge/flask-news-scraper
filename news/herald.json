J.G. Moyo, M.P. Minister of Energy and Power Development (and) Hon. E. Moyo, M.P: Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare.\n\nThe re-assignments are with immediate effect.\n\nMinister July Moyo had been Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister since 2023, while Minister Edgar Moyo was Energy and Power Development Minister from the same year.\n\nMinister July Moyo joins the Energy Ministry at a time when the country is facing power challenges occasioned mainly by low water levels in Kariba Dam due the El-Nino phenomenon, which hit most parts of Southern Africa last year.\n\nBut encouragingly, Minister Moyo comes in when Zimbabwe has embarked on 18 electricity generation projects with a capacity to deliver up 4 000MW in the next two years.\n\nThese will effectively make the country electricity self-sufficient with capacity to export the surplus.\n\nYesterday, Zimbabwe was generating a total of 935MW from Hwange (700MW), Kariba (185MW), Independent Power Producers 50MW. This is against a national demand of about 1 800MW.\n\nIn respect of the appointment of Dr Mangwanya, Dr Rushwaya said: In terms of Section 226(1) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe, His Excellency the President, Cde Dr Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa has appointed Dr Fulton Mangwanya as the Director General, Presidents Department. The appointment is with immediate effect.\n\nDr Mangwanya takes over from Ambassador Isaac Moyo, who was in charge of the department from December 8, 2017.\n\nBy the time Ambassador Moyo assumed the DGs post, he was Zimbabwes Ambassador to South Africa and the United Kingdom of Lesotho.\n\nOn his part, Dr Mangwanya had been the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Managements director-general since August 1, 2017.\n\nHe had replaced Mr Edson Chidziya, who left the organisation in 2015.\n\nDr Mangwanya has been described as committed, self-motivated, adaptable to evolving technologies and a results-oriented team player.\n\nHe was born on January 13, 1967 and began his career as a farm manager in the 1980s, before joining the Presidents Department in January 1988.\n\n",

More so, at a time when the Police Service has a vital role of creating a conducive environment for the sustenance and success of national development priorities pronounced through Vision 2030, said Comm-Gen Mutamba.\n\nHe paid tribute to Comm-Gen Matanga for providing sound leadership during his tenure.\n\nI greatly thank you my dear brother for laying such a strong foundation. Going forward, I hope to build on the already reinforced pillars to ensure that the Zimbabwe Republic Police indeed becomes a modern police service that leverages technology towards fulfilling its Constitutional mandate. In doing so, I will equally continue to ride on discipline as the cornerstone of the organisation whilst also expecting all members and officers of the organisation to remain steadfast.\n\nComm-Gen Mutamba thankedPresident Mnangagwa and the Government as a whole for showing trust in him.\n\nThe event was attended by Minister Kazembe, Minister of State for National Security, Lovemore Matuke, Director General of the Central Intelligence Organisation, Ambassador Isaac Moyo, Commander Zimbabwe National Army Lieutenant General Anselem Sanyatwe, service chiefs and senior Government officials.\n\nMay I therefore take this opportunity to reassure the appointing authority, the responsible Honourable Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, Kazembe Kazembe, the whole Government as well the people of Zimbabwe that I am ready to take my assigned role and look forward to your support, he said.\n\nComm Gen Mutamba lauded Comm Gen Matanga for his leadership role, saying he will utilise some of the lessons he learnt from him.\n\nAbove all, I thank His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Cde Dr Emmerson Mnangagwa for trusting me and appointing me to head the organisation. Be rest assured that your trust will not be in vain. I look forward to the support and co-operation from the people of Zimbabwe in our endeavour to guarantee continued public confidence in the police service. In addition, it is my shared hope that we will be able to galvanise a disciplined and corrupt free police service by the year 2030, he said.\n\nIn his speech, Comm Gen Matanga said he was leaving the ZRP a happy man given his service and will be retiring to go into farming and other business interests.\n\nFor me personally, it is a boundless moment of delight as I bid farewell to longstanding colleagues and organisation that I served over a long period of time. Alas, the day will certainly come when we have to separate with the organisation that we have drawn a lot of friendships, experiences and livelihood from, he said.\n\nComm Gen Matanga saluted President Mnangagwa for affording him an opportunity to serve at the helm of the police service.\n\nHe dismissed social media reports that circulated recently claiming that he was refusing to leave office, describing them as flawed and premature.\n\nIn the same manner may I also take this opportunity to clarify an incorrect position that has been peddled in the media recently pertaining to my retirement. Ladies and gentleman, listen carefully. I was properly served by the President of Zimbabwe, His Excellency Dr Mnangagwa at a time when my retirement was due. I am so contended with the contribution and service I gave to the country in pursuit of national goals and aspirations, suffice to say the bar to modernise the police service is relatively high in view of resource constraints, skills flight and crippling sanctions we have endured for decades among other challenges, Comm Gen Matanga said.\n\nI am however, confident that a new broom sweeps clean and my successor will be able to ride on the achievements we have made and tackle existing challenges head on. I am comfortable to pass the baton to Cde Stephen Mutamba whom I have been with in the trenches for many years and have no doubt in his capacity to steer the ship going forward.\n\nThe event was attended by Minister Kazembe, Minister of State for National Security, Lovemore Matuke, Director General of the Central Intelligence Organisation, Ambassador Isaac Moyo, Commander Zimbabwe National Army Lieutenant General Anselem Sanyatwe, service chiefs and senior Government officials.\n\n",

            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza-Bulawayo Bureau\n\nJUST over two weeks ago, four-and-a-half-year-old Tatenda Machezera was a picture of health.\n\nBut on a seemingly ordinary Sunday morning, December 22, 2024, a sudden and terrifying change occurred.\n\nTatenda began complaining of a severe headache and dizziness, and within hours, her condition dramatically deteriorated.\n\nAlarmed by her nosebleeds and unexplained bleeding from the mouth, her grandparents rushed her from their home in Bulawayos Emganwini suburb to the nearest clinic in Nketa.\n\nStaff at the local clinic referred the little girl to the United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH), where her grandparents, Alexander Tirimboyi and Sphephile Ncube, began a near-fortnight stay at the referral health facility.\n\nThis continued until yesterday afternoon when the ailing child was airlifted to Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare.\n\nAccompanied by her granny, Ncube, young Tatenda will undergo a barrage of tests to determine exactly what she is suffering from  the type of disease that would render a healthy child bedridden and in excruciating pain.\n\nTatenda was born without any complications and was a healthy child until 22 December when she got sick to an extent that she was bleeding from the nose and mouth. We spent the festive season at UBH as doctors and nurses tried to figure out what exactly is wrong with our grandchild. The doctors suspect she could be suffering from bone marrow cancer, but they said its better she is transferred to Harare for more tests, said Tirimboyi.\n\nJust before noon yesterday, UBH staff, patients, and visitors were taken aback by the sounds of rotor blades of an Ansat helicopter whirring in the air, announcing the arrival of the life-saving air ambulance in the city.\n\nThe helicopter, a flying intensive care unit, is one of two air medical rescue service ambulances that will be stationed at UBH to offer swift medical responses for emergencies, such as the critically injured in road accidents. The air ambulance will also be used to airlift patients from hard-to-reach areas, which would typically take hours to get to by road.\n\nYesterday, HeliDrive Zimbabwe, the air ambulance service, had two passengers  little Tatenda and her granny, Ncube, who was travelling as the legal guardian of the child. Tatendas parents work in South Africa, and her mother is expected to be in Harare this evening.\n\nWe will know exactly what it is our granddaughter is suffering from when the doctors are done with the tests, said Tirimboyi.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to HeliDrive Zimbabwe for the swift and efficient services that ensured young Tatenda was airlifted to the capital city at no cost to the family.\n\nThe staff at UBH has been amazing. Tatenda was in a bad state when she arrived at UBH, but they made sure that she gets the best assistance. Im grateful to HeliDrive Zimbabwe and the Government for introducing such a life-saving service that will ensure that patients are transferred from one hospital to another in a short space of time, Tirimboyi said.\n\nIt takes about six hours to drive from Bulawayo to Harare, a long drive that is not suited for someone in a precarious condition such as Tatenda. By helicopter air ambulance, the journey can be completed in slightly more than an hour.\n\nTypically, HeliDrive Zimbabwe carries a single adult patient, but in the case of a minor, a legal guardian is also accommodated in the air ambulance. In total, six people  Tatenda, Ncube, a medical doctor, a technician, pilot, and co-pilot  were aboard the air ambulance as it made its way into theskies en-route to Harare.\n\nOnce the helipad at UBH is complete, the HeliDrive Zimbabwe crew  doctors, pilots, technicians, and other personnel  will be housed in a building at the hospital. The ideal response time is 15 minutes from the time a call is received to the air ambulance taking off, as explained to our Bulawayo Bureau by HeliDrive Zimbabwe accountable manager Ellemencia Nyasha Makosa last year.\n\nIn the event that the air ambulance is summoned to an area where there is no helipad, the pilots use their discretion to use an open space such as a sports field to land.\n\nAir medical ambulances play a crucial role in healthcare by transporting patients, often in critical condition, from one location to another using aircraft specially equipped with medical equipment and staffed by trained medical professionals. The importance of air medical transport lies in its ability to provide rapid and efficient transportation for patients who require immediate medical attention or specialised care that may not be available locally.\n\nThe service allows for timely access to advanced medical facilities and specialised healthcare providers that may be located far away. This is particularly significant for individuals residing in remote areas or regions with limited healthcare resources. By bridging the geographical gap, air medical transport ensures that patients receive the necessary medical interventions promptly, potentially saving lives.\n\n",

I thank women including churches for the work that has been done here today. I am thankful for the rains that are allowing our crops to germinate. I encourage all women to take to the fields so that we keep hunger at bay. I am glad that we have assisted the elderly, those with disabilities and orphans and planted crops that had not germinated. Yes, the Government assists including distributing inputs but as a mother I am saying let the Government come in when we would have done something at our homestead looking at vision 2030. Climate change has transformed our rainfall patterns therefore we must conform to the weather outlook. Today I have brought inputs for hundreds of people including maize seed, vegetable combo seed, fertilizer, knapsacks and pesticides. Let us not sell these inputs. I gave you so that you get good yields. Let us plant even our traditional grains which are nutritious and health. Today I visited the home of gogo vane 102 years who does not walk with the aid of a stick and is still very active. Her secret is that she consumes our traditional food. I also encourage you to plant trees, including fruit trees at your homesteads, she said.\n\nShe warned communities against indiscriminately cutting trees and burning forests and highlighted their importance.\n\nThe mother of the nation decried that Mashonaland Central Province tops in terms of child marriages and said such a trend had to be reversed through behaviour change.\n\nMashonaland Central tops in child marriages, why are we doing this? Why dont we let the children go to school and realise their full potential to look after us in future. You need seeds to plant and if they learn, they will go to work and be able to buy you these seeds. I beg you all please let us say no to child marriages. Let us raise our children well and give them equal opportunities with the boy child, she said.\n\nThe First Lady enjoined the community to live in peace and encouraged Members of Parliament to hear the peoples concerns so that they articulate them in Parliament.\n\nTo our Chiefs, I am thankful that you are uniting families in communities and I urge you to continue doing that so that people continue living in peace, she said.\n\nGogo Ngadze (102) was over the moon.\n\nWhat has happened here is so pleasing. Since my childhood and since I got married, I had never seen such a gesture. I am so happy and thankful for what Dr Mnangagwa has done for me and her teachings which people put to heart. I wish I could fly to God and tell him that I am so happy to have received such a gift from the First Lady as lowly as I am. Amai Mnangagwa is so loving and I had never seen such love, the old woman said as she sang and danced with delight.\n\nMrs Joy Mpofu said she was grateful for the valuable lesson which the First Lady had given them.\n\nWe were taught by our mother, Dr Mnangagwa that we must assist the elderly, the disabled and orphans with their chores, washing for them, cooking for them and fetching water for them. We were told to assist the needy. Today as a community we called the First Lady so that she sees us carrying forward the work she taught us because it helps achieve their chores. Here we are at Gogo Makaraus homestead and we showed her love and performed household tasks. Some people accuse the elderly of dabbling in witchcraft and leave them wallowing in poverty as they stick to life in the city. This is not good at all because we must always tap into their wisdom, she said happily.\n\nMrs Wendy Welengai echoed similar sentiments.\n\nAgric4SHE patron, First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa, hands over maize seed to Gogo Felita Ngadze (102 years) of Masiiwa Village as part of her philanthropic initiatives to help the elderly and vulnerable groups in communities.  Pictures: Edward Zvemisha.\n\nI move about the homes of theelderly assisting them with their chores and weeding their yards after being taught by our mother to look after these vulnerable groups. Today we invited the First Lady to come and see what we are doing. We visits anambuya nana sekuru as they impart knowledge in us as the fortress of wisdom. They teach us good morals so that we grow up well and eat traditional dishes. We are thankful to the First Lady for coming here at short notice, she said.\n\nGogo Eneresi Chikapinda (72) was swept by a tide of emotion and wept.\n\nI live alone here with no one to look after me. I bore 13 children out of which nine perished, leaving four who barely look after me. I go hungry and no one helps me at all. God has remembered me today. I thank Amai Mnangagwa for what she has done to me. I have no toilet and the kitchen is sagging but the children never look at me at all. Ndanga ndisina kana sipo yekuwachisa asi nhasi ndawachirwa hembe dzangu dzese and blankets. Ndinotenda, she said in-between sobs.\n\nMrs Sabina Ndengu said she was overjoyed to have learnt from the best.\n\nBeneficiaries celebrate afterAgric4SHE patron, First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa handed over agriculture inputs that include maize seed, vegetable combo seed, fertilisers, knapsack and pesticides to the elderly and vulnerable groups in Mashonaland Central.\n\nI am so glad I have learnt from the best. What the First Lady taught us is very good and gives these elderly persons a deeper sense of belonging and they feel loved. This is something that we shall continue doing and also teach our children, she said.\n\nThis dovetailed with the views expressed by Gogo Sheila Kuseni.\n\nWhat else would anyone ask for from a human being? What the First Lady has done here is a great thing. She entered the fields with us and participated in the cleaning process which means everything she does and says comes from the heart. She is a blessed woman whose teachings we must fully embrace for a brighter future, she said with happiness written all over her face.\n\nMashonaland Central Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Hon Christopher Magomo praised the First Lady for her love and educative programmes.\n\nPart of the agriculture inputs which included maize seed, vegetable combo seed,fertilisers, knapsack and pesticides which were donated by Agric4SHE patron, First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa to the elderly and the vulnerablein Mashonaland Central.\n\nWe have gathered under the auspices of elderly peoples empowerment support programme. This initiative backed by the First Lady, Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa represents a significant step in recognizing and uplifting the welfare of our elderly citizens. We are thankful for the time that you have committed to come here Amai. Your excellency, we are truly honoured and humbled to host you as we begin this new year. It is an honour that we do not take for granted and we deeply appreciate your presence. Congratulations for the new year. Amai, your unwavering commitment in driving positive change in livelihoods for vulnerable groups inspires us. Your compassion for the empowerment of disadvantaged individuals in our society is unparalleled and knows no boundary. Indeed your programmes are leaving no one and no place behind as we journey towards our vision 2030. May the Almighty God continue to bless you abundantly and provide you with the resources and energy needed to reach every person in need, he said.\n\nAll the elderly whose houses were cleaned were given food and toiletry hampers, courtesy of the First Lady.\n\n",
