            "content": "Ordinary South Africans are walking away from the 2025 budget bruised and bloodied.\n\nGovernment not only proposed an increase in the value-added tax (Vat) rate, but their income tax burden has increased by R18 billion.\n\nThe partial relief for bracket creep provided for in the original version of the 2025 budget has been wiped off the table. There will be no inflationary adjustment, not even for low-income households.\n\nNor is there any inflationary increase in medical credits.\n\nBut there will be above-inflation sin tax increases. These tax proposals are designed to result in an increased tax collection of R28 billion for the 2025/26 tax year and a whopping R44,1 billion in the following year.\n\nDespite massive resistance to tax increases, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana raised the Vat rate by 0,5 percent, effective May 1 this year, and another 0,5 percentage points in 2026.\n\nTipping point\n\nThe expected collection from the Vat increase is R13,5 billion in 2025 and R15,5 billion in 2026.\n\nAneria Bouwer, senior consultant at Bowmans, says these projections may not materialise because of the overall increased tax burden.\n\nThe South African Revenue Service (Sars) seems to recognise that there is a tipping point where increased tax rates do not equate to increased tax collections.\n\nBouwer also notes that the primary and secondary rebates have not been adjusted to provide for the impact of inflation.\n\nIndividuals also receive an annual exemption on all South African interest income they earn. It has remained the same for a few years.\n\nThe exemption threshold for interest has remained unchanged since 2013. The current threshold is set at R23 800 for individuals under 65 and R34 500 for individuals 65 and older.\n\nThere is a general reluctance to increase certain thresholds, and because it is gradual it does have a substantial impact on taxpayers and their disposable income.\n\nGovernment thinking is that the higher income households will be bearing the brunt.\n\nLow Vat rate\n\nGerhard Badenhorst, director in Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyrs tax and exchange control practice, says Godongwana indicated in his 2025 Budget Review that 75 percent of the Vat collections come from high income households.\n\nThat may be true but one needs to consider that these households can afford to pay the taxes.\n\nWhat is important is to consider that poor and low-income households spend a substantial proportion of their disposable income on Vat.\n\nThey will feel the impact of the increase more than the richer households, he says.\n\nVat collections until 31 March are expected to come in at R460 billion, which is just under 25 percent of total tax collections. Time will tell if this percentage of total collections will increase because of the 0.5 percentage point increase in the rate, Badenhorst adds.\n\nThe minister attempted to motivate the increase by referring to peer countries and comparing their Vat rates with that of South Africa. The average of the peer countries is 19 percent compared to our current rate of 15 percent.\n\nBudget 2025, Vat, tax rates\n\nBadenhorst warns against considering the Vat rate in isolation.\n\nBotswana has a Vat rate of 14 percent, but its primary healthcare and education systems are exempt for Vat purposes. Our neighbours corporate tax rate is 22 percent compared to our 27 percent and their maximum marginal personal income tax rate is 25 percent compared to SAs 45 percent.\n\nScandinavian countries have an average Vat rate of 25 percent but virtually everything in these countries is tax-exempt.\n\nThey have taken a policy decision to move away from direct taxes to consumption taxes. That is why their Vat rates are so high, says Badenhorst. It is dangerous just to look at rates in isolation and then draw the conclusion that our Vat rate is low compared to other countries.\n\nSmokes and drinks\n\nSouth Africans will feel their tax burden further when they stock up on their smokes and drinks. Cigarettes and cigarette tobacco go up by 4,75 percent and alcohol products by 6,75 percent. Moneyweb\n\nTax Justice SA (TJSA) says these tax hikes will make life even harder for honest citizens while handing yet another victory to criminals.\n\nInstead of tackling the rampant illicit trade that is already robbing the fiscus of R100 billion every year, the government has chosen to punish law-abiding businesses and consumers, driving even more economic activity into the hands of criminals, the organisation says in a statement.\n\nMinister Godongwana has ignored reality and chosen a path that will only worsen South Africas economic crisis, says TJSA founder Yusuf Abramjee.\n\nIncreasing Vat and sin taxes will not raise the revenue the government hopes for. It will only boost illicit traders who operate with impunity while honest businesses struggle to survive.\n\nHe says the budget fails to address the real problem  criminals who are looting the nation on an industrial scale in virtually every sector.\n\nWhy is the Government so quick to squeeze honest taxpayers but so slow to shut down the kingpins of illicit trade? Moneyweb\n\n",

I need to stress that the Government programme will never come to an end.\n\nWe are always on alert to respond to distress calls. Even after April, if there is a particular community that requires food assistance, they can always go to the nearest social welfare office. We are available throughout the year to ensure and uphold the pledge by the President that no one should die of hunger.\n\nUN resident coordinator, Mr Edward Kallon said he was impressed by the refining of the food distribution process, which is now more accountable.\n\nI want to thank the Government and UN for working together with one common cause, he said.\n\nWFP representative and country director, Ms Barbara Clemens said due to the good the rains, there is going to be a reduction in the number of people in need of assistance in the next lean season.\n\nWe are in the process of working with the Government at the Food and Nutrition Council to see what the state of food security will be like going forward, she said.\n\nThat will inform the degree of resource mobilisation as we prepare for the next lean season. The programmes we undertake seek to minimise the need for lean season assistance by helping to make people more resilient, which is important.\n\nSpeaking on the US aid reduction, Ms Clemence said this presents an opportunity for fostering partnerships with the private sector.\n\nThis is an opportunity to see more efficiency, effectiveness and greater impact because we are partnering and not going alone. We are partnering more with other UN agencies and other NGOs; what is missing from the equation is the private sector.\n\nFor years we have been talking about engaging the private sector, and now we must do that, she said.\n\nUNICEF, Zimbabwe representative, Ms Etona Ekole said she was impressed by the services being offered to beneficiaries at the food distribution points.\n\nBeneficiaries are also getting useful information on health, water and sanitation, while children are also being screened for malnutrition by community health workers.\n\nI liked how organised this process is. It is very structured. It is a beautiful model that can be strengthened and replicated, she said.\n\nWorld Vision representative, Mr Assan Golowa said: We will continue to put our heads together. Let us continue to partner not only in this intervention but in all.\n\nBuhera District in Manicaland is prone to drought, with 15 percent in region 3; 35 percent in region 4 and 50 percent in region 5.\n\nThe lean season assistance in Buhera targeted 229 319 beneficiaries across all 33 communal wards, with food distributions taking place from January to March .\n\nBeneficiaries were receiving 8,5 kg of cereals, 1,7kg pulses and 0,6kg vegetable oil per individual.\n\n",
