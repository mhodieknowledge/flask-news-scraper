As you are aware in South Africa we are facing that challenge now where we have invited different political parties to come and formulate a Government of National Unity, he said.\n\nCde Malatji said President Mnangagwa was excited to see youths from Zanu PF and ANC working together.\n\nHe told us to continue working together and said our future is bright, he said.\n\nCde Malatji also said he was impressed by how the Government was supporting the youth to participate in the mainstream economy.\n\nOn the issue of land, I have seen there is progress, I witnessed President Mnangagwa giving farming equipment to the youth on Wednesday.\n\nThe youth are expected to return the country to its Sadc food basket status and secure Zimbabwe in terms of food supply, he said.\n\nThe ANCYL leader commended Zimbabweans for taking the issue of land seriously.\n\nWe are also here to learn how the party and the State operate. We are happy to hear that the role of the State is to implement the resolutions of the party made at conferences.\n\nThe party and the Government are not separate, he said.\n\nFurther, Cde Malatji said, they also discussed the Africa Youth Congress which they are organising with the Zimbabwean youth leadership.\n\nWe are here to set up a strong team to organise this congress and ensure it is a success.\n\nWe are going to travel to all SADC countries and some parts of Africa meeting youths and sharing the same vision and objectives such as those of Zanu PF, he said.\n\nCde Malatji challenged Zimbabweans who are resident in South Africa to come back home and work with the Government instead of organising unnecessary protests in foreign lands.\n\nThe chairperson of Africa Youth Congress, Cde Taurai Kandishaya, said preparations are going-on well.\n\nWe are winding up our preparations working together with our South African counterparts, he said.\n\nThe visit highlights the positive relationship between the ANC Youth League and the Zanu PF Youth League.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has been actively promoting youth empowerment through various initiatives, including the Presidential Youth Empowerment Scheme, which aims to provide opportunities for young Zimbabweans to contribute to the countrys development.\n\nThe ANCYL delegation witnessed the handover of over 72 high-tech tractors and 10 combine harvesters valued at US$7,4 million in Hatcliffe,Harare, on Wednesday to youth agricultural groups from various provinces, a programme which is being championed by President Mnangagwa.\n\nThe handover is a follow-up to the Presidential Youth Empowerment Scheme that was launch recently.\n\n",

Currently, there is no State land that you can apply for and get granted authority to do some developments. That has been stopped. That was a result of the land barons who would go to unsuspecting prospective house owners and dupe them of their hard-earned money, Minister Zhemu said.\n\nHe said the Government needed to first deal with a number of the issues, which include the regularisation of the already-built illegal settlements before resuming issuing permits.\n\nOne of the issues being regularisation and sanitisation of the settlements that have been created without proper plans. So we are dealing with that at the moment.\n\nWe cannot have a situation where we are dealing with the problem and we allow new problems to continue to be caused.\n\nThe moratorium is also seen as a necessary step to ensure compliance with the Regional Town and Country Planning Act and other pertinent regulations.\n\nThe Government has introduced a one-stop shop for building plan approvals, aiming to streamline the process and ensure that all developments adhere to established guidelines.\n\nMinister Zhemu said approximately 65 000 title deeds could be issued to residents in areas such as Epworth and Chitungwiza, where illegal settlements have taken root due to the actions of land barons.\n\nThis initiative is part of the Governments broader strategy to regularise and legitimise existing settlements while safeguarding against future illegal encroachments.\n\nIt is anticipated that the Governments latest measures will restore order to the housing sector and protect the interests of honest citizens.\n\n",

Thankfully, over and above the outcomes of the Summit, Zimbabwe will derive investment and tourism opportunities through this platform.\n\nThe gathering, Minister Moyo said, was not just a meeting of minds, but also a call to action for all nations who believe in the power of education to change lives and shape the future as articulated by former South African President, the late Nelson Mandela, that Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.\n\nHe said President Mnangagwas unwavering commitment to educational development was a testament to his vision of an empowered society and a brighter future for Zimbabwe.\n\nMinister Moyo added that the Presidents dedication exemplified the transformative power of education and the essential role it played in driving change and innovation throughout the world.\n\nHis astute leadership has been instrumental in establishing innovation hubs and industrial parks, positioning Zimbabwe as a leader in innovation and development across Africa. These initiatives ensure that every child has access to a conducive learning environment, empowering our learners to thrive. His focus on education not only equips the next generation with the skills needed for a modern economy but also fosters creativity and entrepreneurship, he said.\n\nThe summit, Minister Moyo said, provided a valuable opportunity to build partnerships and share insights on critical issues in education systems, including gender equality and access to quality resources.\n\nThe first Africa Education Summit was held in Rwanda and the second in Nottingham in the UK.\n\nThe second Summit was held under the theme, Entrepreneurship and Skills Development in the 21st Century Education System: The African-European Perspectives.\n\nIt made a clarion call for Governments, civic society organisations, and international partners to prioritise investments in education infrastructure, teacher training, and targeted support for marginalised groups.\n\nThe summit also identified the need for a paradigm shift in education systems towards a knowledge-based economy, driven by technological advancements and globalisation and the re-imagining of education curricula to foster creativity, problem-solving, critical thinking, adaptability, and pursuing innovative solutions to complex challenges.\n\n",

I was able to go through the receipts to see what is recorded there. Very transparent.\n\nAs someone who brings in waste, you know how much you have to pay. You know who you are.\n\nIt is very transparent all the way through, he said.\n\nProf Ncube commended the personnel at the facility, particularly the engineers, for their demonstration of knowledge.\n\nI am also very impressed by the quality of the engineers.

I could feel that.\n\nI had no idea that the garbage sorting process is in fact an effective process.\n\nEmploying 200 people, its labour intensive, 24 hours, again, that shows you the commitment that you have for this project. The passion and the passion of your engineers.\n\nI also saw the water treatment plant, I almost drank it, it looked very pure but I was told I should wait a bit. So really, I must congratulate you for this phenomenal project, he said.\n\nProf Ncube said he was confident that once operational, the power generation plant, whose works commence in June, will contribute positively to the national grid.\n\nI can assure you, when we get to the electricity stage, you will be able to reach a very good tariff between 16 cents per kilowatt hour.\n\nMost of these projects will be profitable.

            "content": "Edgar Vhera, Agriculture Specialist Writer\n\nFARMERS have welcomed producer prices announced by the Grain Marketing Board yesterday, indicating that there was a need for constant review in line with market dictates.\n\nIn an X (formerly Twitter) post, GMB said maize and traditional grains will be bought at US$376, 48 per tonne, with soyabean on US$580 and sunflower at US$668, 98.\n\nThe winter wheat incentive planning price was set at US$451, 35 per tonne.\n\nGMB will primarily purchase produce from farmers financed under the Presidential Input Programme (PIP) and irrigation schemes.\n\nThese prices are consistent with achieving both food security and macroeconomic stability. Contractors are expected to buy back contracted produce at market prices.\n\nFurthermore, GMB, working with the Zimbabwe Mercantile Exchange (ZMX), shall provide commercial warehouse receipt services to all players, said GMB.\n\nZimbabwe Commercial Farmers Union (ZCFU) president, Dr Shadreck Makombe, said the prices were good but said there was a need to constantly review them upwards.\n\nAt the time of announcement, the prices are fair on comparative terms with other markets in the region, but as time lapses there might be need for an upward review.\n\nThe production costs are continually increasing as a result of rising input prices, he said.\n\nZimbabwe National Farmers Union (ZNFU) president, Mrs Monica Chinamasa, said it was important that the payment modalities are also announced.\n\nMrs Chinamasa said it was unfortunate that inputs prices continued to increase eroding the farmers profits.\n\nFarmers should know if the payment will be 100 percent foreign currency or some split portion as well as time of payment after delivery, she said.\n\nZimbabwe Women Farmers Trust president, Mrs Depinah Nomo, said they welcomed the prices but expected Government to review in line with the increases on inputs prices.\n\nWe hope the prices will be reviewed from time to time so they remain viable. The major challenge is the price of inputs which is usually pegged in foreign currency.\n\nMaize and traditional grains are our staple food and the producer prices should motivate many farmers to produce at a commercial level, she said.\n\nAn agricultural expert, Dr Reneth Mano, commended the new Government policy where the GMB will not be the sole buyer of the grain but only purchase to support the strategic grain reserve.\n\nFurthermore, it has tightened the categories of farmers it targets to buy grains from. There is an apparent positive and very deliberate policy move to deepen the liberalised free competitive domestic grains and oilseeds marketing system, he said.\n\nOne such agricultural policy thrust has seen the strengthening of ZMX warehouse receipt system and ZMX daily spot auction market for grains and oilseeds.\n\nDr Mano said presently Zimbabwe has the highest grain producer prices in the region and the permanent solution is for Government to enact sober domestic policies that effectively work towards reducing domestic agricultural cost of production (fertiliser, fuel and bulk water prices as well as high interest rates on farm input loans to match those of the region).\n\nZMX is expected to become the central agricultural commodity marketing institution where large and small-scale commercial farmers freely sale their produce to private agro-processing companies at competitive market prices that are discovered through the willing buyer willing seller daily spot market auction system.\n\nDr Mano said efficient agricultural marketing and predictable pricing system is the most critical cornerstone of any successful national food and agricultural development strategy.\n\n",

            "content": "ZIMBABWE has a lot of young people who are prepared to work hard and, thanks to the education and training they have received, are able to make sure that hard work is productive and efficient.\n\nWhat is largely missing for most of them is that access to finance and equipment that this productive and efficient hard work requires. Most come from fairly poor families and even with the considerable and successful backing given by Government through programmes such as Pfumvudza/Intwasa, these families do not have the sort of spare cash that would be useful to launch the next generation on its way.\n\nSo the Government, with President Mnangagwa personally in the driving seat, has been pushing hard in the last few years to turn talk into action when it comes to empowering those youths who show the necessary skills and work habits.\n\nFirst came the Presidential Youth Empowerment Revolving Fund, with seed capital of US$2 million, two weeks ago, with a similar US$5 million fund for youths in mining in the advanced planning stages.\n\nThis week we saw specific backing for youths in farming, with the handover of 72 heavy-duty tractors and 10 combine harvesters that will be assigned to youth business clusters, plus confirmation of the Presidential promise that of the US$50 million assigned to build up irrigation, US$10 million will be specifically earmarked for young farmers needing irrigation.\n\nSo enthusiastic is the President for these schemes to function and be better funded that he has arranged to pay half the US$7,4 million for the agricultural equipment from his own pocket, leaving the clusters of young farmers assigned the equipment to pay the other half of US$3,7 million over three years.\n\nThis is easily possible as the tractors and combine harvesters must be used to boost production to levels that will bring in the required cash, with change for the farmers to support themselves and build up their investments in their own farms.\n\nThe farm clusters will also be required to maintain and operate the equipment so the repayment and maintenance requirements mean that each group of farmers will need to have a sound administrative base and be able to raise the money.\n\nProbably fees from member farmers for each hour or each hectare the equipment is used for will be the fairest.\n\nIt was made very clear by the Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Dr Anxious Masuka, that repayment was not an option.\n\nThe whole basis of the imports of this Belarus equipment is that the trade finance backing it will be paid off over three years, at a concessionary 7,5 percent interest rate, by the farmers and farm groups that buy the 800 units of equipment being supplied this year.\n\nThese sort of schemes, matching suitable equipment with necessary finance for the buyers, are essential to accelerate the mechanisation of Zimbabwean farming.\n\nThis is why every farmer who accepts the conditions and is able to buy or share equipment has to use it to make the money to pay up on the due dates.\n\nThe youth revolving fund will operate under the same sort of terms.\n\nThe money coming forward is a first instalment as the scheme is built up, but for the scheme to grow subsequent allocations of capital need to be used to increase the size of the fund, not replace money that was lent out and then was never repaid.\n\nThere is also the practical point, that once everyone sees the money revolving, being lent and repaid and then lent again, there will be a general feeling among taxpayers that the fund is being properly used and administered and is doing sound work, so the future top-ups will not be begrudged.\n\nAnd the growing fund can then be helping ever more people each year.\n\nThe Second Republic has been very businesslike in the way it channels Government support into farming and groups like the women and the youth.\n\nThose who are supported have to fulfil initial requirements to show they are genuine and both capable and willing to do the hard work.\n\nNow their business and farming schemes will be checked to make sure that these, properly run, will produce the money needed to repay loans or pay off the equipment. That is how it should be.\n\nThose moving out of such schemes should then be in a position to satisfy bankers and other future finance providers that they are the sort of low-risk people that the commercial world really likes to do business with, the Government schemes not just helping the youths get started but also providing the documented track record of success and that sort of ability and honesty that does repay loans and pay instalments.\n\nA good business reputation, even if your business is still on the small side, is a priceless asset that anyone can create when opportunity arises, and will last a lifetime long after the successful business person or farmer or miner has moved out of the start-up schemes provided via Government programmes.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa, using his own money to expand the schemes coming via the Government and finance providers, is showing confidence in the youths he is backing.\n\nHe is also providing an exceptional example to others who have been successful in their business life and leaving yet another legacy that will be remembered for many years.\n\n",

Authorities are now pursuing him and other key figures.\n\nIn a statement, national police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi said they were still looking for more suspects who are linked to the case and they have since identified some of them.\n\nSome of the suspects have since been identified through WhatsApp groups which they were using to send messages and in Masvingo we have identified two more suspects. Social media was being used to coordinate these criminal acts.\n\nWe are casting the net wide to identify these initiators of criminal acts and they were also threatening people in their communities using social media, he said.\n\nRecently, the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (POTRAZ) condemned cyberbullying and warned those perpetrating it that they risk being prosecuted.\n\nCyberbullying is a malicious act that involves sending or posting harmful, intimidating, or humiliating messages or information on social media platforms, private chats, or other digital forums.\n\nUnder Section 4 of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act (Chapter 9:23), anyone convicted of cyberbullying may face a fine or imprisonment for up to 10 years or both a fine and imprisonment.\n\nComm Nyathi said the law will certainly take its course on unruly elements who commit criminal acts under the guise of demonstrations.\n\nHe said police will continue to deploy officers in strategic positions to thwart any criminal activities.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police applauds the public for maintaining law and order during the recent attempts by some individuals and groups to incite violence and engage in criminal acts in the country on 31 March 2025. The situation in the country remains peaceful and conducive for all socio-economic activities.\n\nThe police will continue to deploy officers in strategic positions in support of the current serene environment, he said.\n\nComm Nyathi said on Monday, police recorded a few reports of violence and malicious property damage.\n\nThe Police arrested 107 suspects throughout the country for participating in violent and unsanctioned demonstrations. Most of these arrests were made at Robert Gabriel Mugabe Square in Harare.\n\nThe public is urged to remain vigilant and disregard social media calls to engage in violent acts or hoodwinked into join unlawful gatherings targeted at looting and other criminal acts. The law will certainly take its course on unruly elements who commit criminal acts under the guise of demonstrations, Comm Nyathi said.\n\nThis week, Prosecutor Mr Anesu Chirenje told the court that the group gathered at Robert Mugabe Square around 9:20 am on March 31 as part of a broader plan to cause disruption.\n\nSome individuals reportedly recorded videos and took photographs of the protest, which were later shared on social media to incite further unrest.\n\nPolice arrested 94 suspects at the scene, while others were apprehended at their residence after being identified in online footage.\n\nWritten submissions from the State and defence teams are expected to be heard starting Tuesday, with the bail ruling scheduled for April 10.\n\nAnother four Chitungwiza men also appeared in court for allegedly carrying out a series of vehicle arson attacks at business premises in Avondale, Highlands, Newlands and Goromonzi on Friday last week.\n\nLast Matarutse (40), Abel Jobe (47), Kizito Chinhanga (40) and Thomas Chanetsa (45) were charged with malicious damage to property when they appeared separately before Harare magistrate, Ms Marehwanazvo Gofa.\n\nThe court remanded them in custody to April 14, advising them to apply for bail at the High Court.\n\n",

            "content": "Eddie Chikamhi, Zimpapers Sports Hub\n\nEXCITING times beckon for domestic football following the launch of a national campaign by ZIFA yesterday, appealing to local designers and the games enthusiasts to design unique and inspiring brands and kits that reflect national identity.\n\nThe groundbreaking initiative, dubbed the Warrior Pride: Brand Design Battle, was announced by ZIFA president Nqobile Magwizi in Harare, and will run for the next six weeks.\n\nThe winning design will not only become the official brand and kit for the national teams, but also earn the designer a US$3 000 cash prize, and an all-expenses paid trip to watch the Warriors opening match against Egypt at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco.\n\nMagwizi said submissions will be evaluated by a panel of industry experts, and fans will have their say by voting on the final four designs via social media.\n\nIt is a groundbreaking national campaign that puts the creative power into the hands of Zimbabweans, he said.\n\nFor the first time, we are inviting graphic designers, artists, football fans, and creative minds across Zimbabwe to shape the future identity of our national football teams.\n\nThis is your chance to design a brand and kit that truly represents the spirit, resilience, and unity of Zimbabwe in football.\n\nThis initiative is designed to engage the nation in the creative process of branding our national teams. Of course, encourage creativity and participation from designers and football enthusiasts, as well as showcase our national pride through unique and inspiring designs, said Magwizi.\n\nAccording to ZIFA, the competition is open to graphic designers and artists, football fans, Zimbabwean youth, social media creatives, advertising agencies and all talented Zimbabweans.\n\nParticipants will be asked to submit a brand name and a logo/icon design with a description of the inspiration behind it; three jersey designs  a home kit (yellow), an away kit (green), and an alternative kit (white), incorporating the colours of the Zimbabwean flag, and additional branded merchandise like caps, souvenirs and t-shirts.\n\nDeadline for the submissions is May 15.\n\nThe adjudication panel is led by renowned academic and branding expert Christopher Sachikonye.\n\nIt also includes communications industry entrepreneur Sapi Bachi, Faithwear founder Brett van Rooyen, Ebenezer Ayisa, Danayi Madondo, Carl Joshua Ncube and Footballers Union of Zimbabwe president Desmond Maringwa.\n\nMagwizi said the campaign was more than just a competition as it seeks to rally the cross-section of Zimbabweans behind the national teams.\n\nThis is more than a competition . . . It is a celebration of our national pride, our creativity and our passion for football.\n\nWith the hashtags #WarriorPride and #ZimKitChallenge, let us turn this into a national movement that unites Zimbabweans through design and football. This is our opportunity to leave a lasting legacy for Zimbabwe and football.\n\nOf course, I will expect people to submit their designs before the 15th of May and be part of this history. I hope we are all up for the challenge. The countdown starts now, said Magwizi.\n\nHe said the winning brand and kit designs could be on display when Zimbabwe play at the upcoming AFCON 2025 in Morocco this December.\n\nThe first aspect we are looking at is a brand that will be owned by ZIFA. This brand will then be applied to the kits. The first assignment or the primary application that were looking to proliferate this brand is on the 2025 AFCON kits.\n\nSo, were going to have a brand which were going to own for a long time as an association and this brand will be applied to various merchandise. But our first product will be the kits, said Magwizi.\n\nWe are looking at a situation whereby annually we design new kits. But the brand wont change.\n\nAnnually, well be looking to have new kits and of course, we are going to look at the various teams, the Under-17s etc.\n\nI know we are looking at the 2028 Olympics as well, where we need to start building those teams again and they must also have their own kits.\n\nBut, at this point, we are looking at the national team thats going to AFCON.\n\nThose are the three kits that have been requested by the competition. But beyond that, of course, other designs can then be applied elsewhere, added Magwizi.\n\nThe ZIFA executive committee have since their election in January come up with various initiatives aimed at giving the national game a professional outlook and commercial value.\n\n",
