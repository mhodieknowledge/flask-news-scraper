The implementation of a harmonised regional strategy for road infrastructure in our region is not only for Zimbabwe, but for the region. We collaborate in many respects so that when our neighbours visit us, they should cherish what we are doing, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe commended the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development led by Minister Felix Mhona for spearheading several road projects in the country.\n\nTodays event is impactful as we transform and upgrade our transport infrastructure which is a key enabler of our economic growth and development. I grew up in this area and in the 1940s and 1950s, we would travel long distances from here to Shurugwi and Gweru to sell sweet potatoes and other products with my mother. We would take the whole day travelling, but now because of modernisation, it is taking a few hours. This has all changed, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe urged ministries to continue pushing projects that have a national impact and also bear economic benefits.\n\nWe need to provide an efficient transport network which is essential for enabling people to exchange visits and access markets and also to promote regional and international integration. Zimbabwe cannot grow in isolation. The development of Zimbabwe is inter-related with the development of other countries in the region. Anychallenges that might affect one country in the region hurt other countries in the region, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nFor our country to develop we require robust infrastructure, planning and development, we need to develop the necessary domestic linkages. You must have a zeal to develop your own country. What determines the development of a country is its infrastructure, road network, schools and clinics that are adjacent to communities. You do not need to travel long distances to access social services such as education and health.\n\nHe commended Road Truckers Construction, the company that resurfaced Shurugwi Mhandamabwe Highway, for a job well done.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga chat at the official opening of the Iron and Steel Indaba in Kwekwe yesterday.\n\nTurning to the countrys natural resources, President Mnangagwa said minerals must benefit the communities from which they are being extracted.\n\nWe also do not allow indiscriminate mining without due regard to the environment and land degradation, he said.\n\nOn agriculture, President Mnangagwa said farmers should continue preparing for the summer cropping season and assured villagers that the Government will continue providing seed inputs.\n\nHe also urged motorists not to drink and drive ahead of the festive season, calling on law enforcement agencies to apply the law firmly to ensure an accident-free holiday.\n\nTransport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona commended President Mnangagwa for his leadership which he said had seen his Ministry registering several milestones in infrastructure development.\n\nYour wise leadership has registered wonders despite illegal sanctions that would have ordinarily affected the projects, he said.\n\nChief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Dr Martin Rushwaya (with neck-tie) and Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Dr Jenfan Muswere (left)arrive for the official opening of the Iron and Steel Indaba in Kwekwe. yesterday\n\nMinister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution responsible for Midlands Province, Cde Owen Ncube, said the province has been a hub of development owing to the leadership of President Mnangagwa.\n\nThe Shurugwi-Mhandamabwe road is viewed as a catalyst for enhancing transport movement along the Southern corridor and has gone through a substantial transformation to improve border-to-border connectivity.\n\nIt primarily connects Beitbridge with other borders including Chirundu and Nyamapanda.\n\nThe event was attended by Cabinet Ministers, legislators, traditional leaders and senior Government officials.\n\n",

            "content": "Patrick Chitumba and Freedom Mupanedemo\n\nPRESIDENT Mnangagwa has underscored the importance of the iron and steel industry in Zimbabwes economic revitalisation, highlighting its vast potential to transform, not only the countrys economy, but that of the entire SADC region.\n\nThe President said the industrys current state was worrisome, with Zimbabwe spending in excess of US$1 billion on importation of iron and steel.\n\nHe was speaking at a gathering to officially open the Iron and Steel Indaba which is underway at a hotel in Kwekwe.\n\nIn attendance were Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, Industry and Commerce Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu and other senior Government officials.\n\nIn attendance were Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, Industry and Commerce Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu and other senior Government officials.\n\nIt is my singular honour and privilege to officiate at this Iron and Steel Indaba here in Midlands Province, being hosted under the theme, Leveraging the Resurgence of Zimbabwes Iron and Steel Industry. As you are aware, the Engineering, Iron and Steel industry has always been a cornerstone of Zimbabwes industrial landscape. In the past this was through the operations of Ziscosteel, then the largest steelworks in Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the sector holds immense multiplier effects in promoting value addition and beneficiation by leveraging the countrys expansive mineral resources, such as iron ore and chrome, among others.\n\nIn light of this, the resurgence of this sector is of urgent necessity. This Indaba is, therefore, taking place at an opportune time. It is in line with our vision to ultimately establish a robust and sustainable iron and steel industry that meets domestic demand, while also positioning Zimbabwe as a regional manufacturing hub, he said.\n\nThe President added that the recent operationalisation of the Dinson Iron and Steel Company in Manhize, Mvuma, has significantly increased the prospects of the sector.\n\nThe investment by Tsingshan Group, which is the largest steel giant in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the 6th leader in the world, is a show of confidence, by one of the global industry leaders, in our iron and steel sub-sector, he said.\n\nThe iron and steel value chains, the President added, are among key sectors identified to accelerate the transformation and growth of the manufacturing sector.\n\nThrough the requisite policy mix, our manufacturing has been on the rebound. Capacity utilisation increased from an average of 36.4 percent in 2019 to 53.2 percent in 2023, while capital investments in the sector amounted to US$747 million over the past three years. Shelf occupancy of locally produced goods rose from about 64 percent to 80 percent in 2019 and 2023, respectively, he said.\n\nFurthermore, President Mnangagwa said, the manufacturing sectors contribution to overall national employment remains on a positive growth trajectory from 7.5 percent in 2019 to 9.7 percent in 2023.\n\nHe said the vast natural resources and a youthful population should be continuously harnessed for sustainable industrial transformation in the country.\n\nIt is a misnomer that we continue to lose millions every year on the importation of iron and steel and other related products. This is despite the numerous investments within our manufacturing sector. It is against this background that the Second Republic resolved to facilitate a vibrant, dynamic and competitive industrial base, driven by smart and strategic value-chain linkages. We are fostering structural transformation of our economy by putting in place deliberate and systematic measures to graduate from being resource-driven to a knowledge-based economy. This will be achieved through incremental step-by-step, brick-upon-brick, and stone-upon-stone processes, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nThe Iron and Steel indaba is thus expected to speed up the realisation of targets in the critical mining sector and the economy as a whole, towards Vision 2030.\n\nHe said the Indaba is taking place after the Government, through Treasury, recently presented an elaborate 2025 National Budget, which is both citizen and pro-business-centric.\n\nFrom a regional perspective, Zimbabwe, as the current chair of SADC, has the opportunity to drive both the national and regional industrialisation agenda.\n\nFurther, the present round of the Industrial Revolution is moving at a heightenedpace, characterised by increased digitalisation, artificial intelligence and innovation. These are in-turn transitioning traditional modes of production as well as broadening the range of products required by the markets, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nI, thus, challenge stakeholders in this sector to take leadership and implement forward-looking business models which impact beyond our borders and the continent. Zimbabwe and the SADC region are part of the global village and should not be left behind.\n\nHe said the domestication of the value chains and value addition must be expedited, adding that the sector is integral for the resuscitation and modernisation of the national railway network, as well as foundry and fabrication of industrial equipment for the transport and energy sectors, among others.\n\nIn the agriculture sector, President Mnangagwa said iron and steel products are essential to counter the dire consequences of climate change through expanding the countrys irrigation infrastructure to build resilience, while also securing farm land through appropriate boundary fences.\n\nSimilarly, our construction sector, other infrastructure such as dams, modern roads and bridges, among other upstream, downstream and main-stream products, all depend on the viability of this sector. Great is the task before you, hence the need to have unity of purpose and collaboration. This Indaba should merely be the first step. The sector cannot afford to work in silos but must be complementary in approach, leveraging on the various technical resources and skills that reside within different entities in the industry, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said to scale up efforts in this regard, it is critically important that the strategies to resuscitate and grow the sector are holistic, well-co-ordinated and focused on the overall national good.\n\nThe President, who later in the day commissioned the Shurugwi-Mhandamahwe road, said other national development projects such as the Gwayi-Shangani Dam in Matabeleland North, and Tugwi Mukosi Dam among others, are important for the realisation of national targets.\n\nHe said energy projects like the new 720 MW power plant under construction in the Hwange area, will aid the drive for a robust and growing iron and steel sector anchored on broader value chains.\n\nA skilled workforce equipped with modern technical expertise is an integral component for sustaining innovation, productivity and growth of the iron and steel industry. Hence, investments in human capital development are essential, as well as partnerships between industry players and academia, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe said the Indaba is taking place after the Government, through Treasury, recently presented an elaborate 2025 National Budget, which is both citizen and pro-business-centric.\n\nIt is my sincere hope that as businesses, you will capitalise on the wide spectrum of both fiscal and non-fiscal incentives availed for sustainable economic development. As we engage and deliberate throughout this Indaba, it is critically important that we collectively find lasting solutions to resuscitate and grow the iron and steel sector. The generality of our population counts on our unity of purpose to deliver a prosperous economy, sector by sector, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nAddressing the same gathering, VP Chiwenga said the entry of Dinson Iron and Steel into Zimbabwe was a game-changer which will see the country becoming one of the major producers of iron and steel products.\n\nHe said it was through President Mnangagwas engagement and re-engagement drive that Dinson invested in the country.\n\nIt is through your engagement and re-engagement efforts, Your Excellency, that Dinson Iron and Steel Company in Manhize, Mvuma set up a billion-dollar plant which will result in the country becoming a major player in the iron and steel industry in Africa, he said.\n\n",

We found ourselves in constant conflict with city officials who refused to adhere tobasic accounting principles.\n\nMs Mahari disclosed that the officials also obstructed the integration of financial records from major subsidiaries, including City Park, Rufaro Marketing, and Harare Quarry.\n\nPrior to the discontinuation of the ERP, we submitted crucial reports highlighting deficiencies in the system. Yet, the city officials turned a blind eye, leaving us powerless to address the gaping holes in their financial controls, she said.\n\nMs Mahari said the exclusion of executive payrolls, coupled with poor financial practices, had fostered an environment ripe for fraud.\n\nThe two Groupview Technologies officials expressed concern that councils transactions could be slipping through the cracks, unrecorded and unaccounted for.\n\nThey pointed out that the lack of bank reconciliation left room for fraudulent activities.\n\nMr Jasi pointed out the dire consequences of the citys refusal to fully utilise the ERP system, claiming it created a loophole for corruption.\n\nRevenue generation is the lifeblood of the councils operations.

Mr Chimuka, who is a former student at Handina Primary School in Rukweza, is currently building classroom and administration blocks at both Handina Primary and Secondary schools.\n\nHe is also constructing a clinic in Ward 31 named Chihombe Madhara Chimuka in remembrance of his late grandfather.\n\nPart of the crowd that interacted with Angel of Hope Foundation patron First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa at Handina Primary School in Manicaland where she donated building materials and food hampers to schools and people affected by recent heavy rains in the area.\n\nThe First Lady thanked Mr Mataranyika for also spearheading and planting trees through his Nyaradzo Funeral Services which gives each grieving family a tree seedling, which they can plant at home or where they like, including at the cemetery.\n\nThe mother of the nation, who is also the countrys health ambassador also brought instant porridge for the benefit of children, who are close to her heart.\n\nThe porridge was donated by Food4Africa a partner of her AoHF to ensure children do not suffer malnutrition.\n\nHealth personnel taught the mothers how to prepare the porridge. The First Lady also held an interactive session with the community warning against drug abuse, child marriages, gender-based violence, promiscuity, laziness and poor relations among-in-laws.\n\nIn her address, the First Lady said although rainfall is presently low and the workload in the fields is also minimal, this was not a passport for people to engage in promiscuity and domestic violence which could result in permanent injuries or death.\n\nShe encouraged families to live in peace and harmony, while they waited for rainfall to work in the fields. To women, she advised them to respect the marriage institution by not snatching other peoples husbands, but to be involved in productive activities.\n\nSo touched by the First Ladys gesture were members of the Makoni South community that they broke into song and dance.\n\nThey thanked Amai Mnangagwa for her teachings and for coming to their rescue.\n\nI have been prompted to pay you a visit by challenges which were experienced in this place. Kuno kwakaita mafashamu akaparadza zvivakwa zvakawanda. Because of climate change and the extreme temperatures, we are experiencing, it is promising that we might incur hailstorms.\n\nWhen it comes to this, we do not have to look at Government alone, but we put our heads together even with the private sector and assist one another. With my Angel of Hope Foundation, I have partners whom I work with in my programmes. Angel of Hope Foundation is not a State-funded entity and relies on assistance from well-wishers.\n\nPart of the Christmas hampers and truck with loads of building materials that were donated by Angel of Hope Foundation patron First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa in Manicaland yesterday.\n\nThese are the self-same partners who enabled me to come with the assortment of goods I have brought here today. I grew up with an inclination to assist those in need therefore even when I became First Lady, I proceeded to assist those in distress.\n\nI thank you heartily for congratulating me on my recent attainment of a PhD. I did this to motivate the youth and fellow women that education has no end and you achieve your vision through commitment and dedication, she said.\n\nThe First Lady said the door wasopen for everyone to go to school to deepen their knowledge.\n\nI brought the Zimbabwe Open University under the partnership with my AoHF so that you all could undertake short courses to advance and empower yourselves without looking at age. To our learners here present, we outrightly reject cases of those who fail to return to school in January after falling pregnant. We abhor naughtiness. Focus on your education because a profession is your first husband. But mothers, are we getting time to counsel our daughters and vana baba, are you sitting down with the boys to show them the right path?\n\nLet us build strong family relations, we want love, peace and unity to prevail in our families. We say no to gender-based violence even cases of letting children dabble in drugs.\n\nToday I have brought building materials to rebuild our homesteads and the destroyed schools. I encourage us to rebuild these structures the proper way so that they remain strong even in the face of strong winds. It is also my plea that we plant trees for windbreak and also to curb climate change. Let us not cut down trees or burn forests, she said.\n\nThe mother of the nation thanked her foundations partners who made the programme a success.\n\nShe encouraged youths to emulate such persons because they did not forget their roots.\n\nHad they focused on drugs, the First Lady said, the well-wishers would not have been able to chip in at the critical hour as they did.\n\nThe First Lady touched on gender-based violence and urged couples to shun the scourge which breaks families and affects children more.\n\nAs a mother she is moving with her Afrikana Humanism Programme and denounced promiscuity, urging couples to be content with one partner.\n\nUnenge uchichiva baba vepanext door kuti vanochena uye mukadzi wacho anochena zvekuti vakakupfimba haurambe asi wotozoona kuti havana kana sugar chaiyo yekutokupa. Madzimai let us respect the marriage institution, she said.\n\nDr Mnangagwa asked mothers-in-law and their daughters-in-law whether they were cooperating and living in peace. Marceline Muzhinye (23) said all was well with her mother-in-law.\n\nShe said she grew up as an orphan and when she got married she took her mother-in-law as her own mother since she yearned for motherly love. She said in return, the mother-in-law treated her well. A second respondent said her relations with her mother-in-law were fine, but not so rosy with her husband who was abusive and frequently bashes her.\n\nThe gathering also heard from a daughter-in-law who said her in-laws, both aunties and the mother-in-law, was a thorn in the flesh, referring to her husbands sisters as return soldiers.\n\nOne of the respondents said her husband was always drunk and she now survives on the measly earnings she gets from performing menial tasks at other peoples homesteads. She said sometimes the husband makes her sleep outside ordering her to return wherever she would have spent the day working.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa interacts with senior citizens while handing over Christmas hampers to the elderly and other people affected by recent heavy rains at Handina primary school in Manicaland yesterday.\n\nGogo Eunice Muzondo encouraged young women not to bottle up abuse, but to speak out before its too late saying domestic violence can lead to death or permanent injuries.\n\nAnother elderly lady said daughters-in-law of today were lazy to the extent of not sweeping the yard.\n\nShe also touched on dressing saying they do not dress in a dignified manner even in the presence of their fathers-in-law.\n\nShe said her daughter-in-law brags that she was proposed love on social media when the mother-in-law was wooed over a period exceeding two years hence, they were not on the same page.\n\nThe First Lady took time to address every situation raised and helped address the issues, urging people to use her national gender-based violence 575 toll-free and report any form of abuse.\n\nMr Bofu Promise Chitsidzo, the headmaster of Nzvimbe Primary School in Nyazura said his school was among institutions whose roofs were blown away by strong winds.\n\nWe were stranded not knowing how we would rebuild the schools and today our mother has brought us cement, roofing material and other accessories to repair the schools and allow children to learn well. We are entering a rainy season. We thank the First Lady and those who help her in the Angel of Hope Foundation for the assistance they have rendered, he said.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa interacts with senior citizens while handing over Christmas hampers to the elderly and other people affected by recent heavy rains at Handina primary school in Manicaland yesterday.\n\nManicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Advocate Misheck Mugadza praised the First Lady for her gesture and congratulated her on her recent graduation with a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Tourism and Hospitality Management.\n\nOur First Lady recently shone like a beacon when she graduated with a PhD. We thank our mother for persevering with her education and we shall follow suit as her children.I am overjoyed to stand before you Amai here in Makoni in Manicaland to welcome you to Handina School in Makoni South. You once visited this place alongside the President.\n\nHere, we encountered a disturbing occurrence where 10 schools were destroyed by strong winds. Over 79 homesteads were not spared and this troubled us. We ran about with the Civil Protection Unit until we decided to approach you for assistance.\n\nToday, we have gathered here to welcome you as you bring materials to rebuild the homes and roof the schools. Our mother has come to assist us and brought us food hampers as well.\n\nI thank you, Amai for the hampers you recently brought for orphans, widows and the elderly in care homes. Our mother has a warm heart and is a visionary. She has many programmes like Agric4she, Teen Mothers Empowerment Programme, Gota/Nhanga/Ixhiba Programme, National GBV Call Centre, Vulnerable Population Empowerment programme, Cookout competitions, Girl Child Scholarships, Street Persons Empowerment Programme, Environment Protection Programme, Short Courses programme, Former Ladies of the Night Empowerment programme, among many other programmes aimed at transforming the lives of people, he said.

The amendment also seeks to repeal the requirement for directors of licencees to be Zimbabwean citizens and places a limitation of 40 percent of the directors to be foreigners. Amendments to section 8(3) will allow any person other than a natural person to apply for licences such as community radios, reads the Bill.\n\nClause Three of the Bill provides that the role of the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ) is to regulate and manage the broadcasting service bands for sustenance rather than controlling broadcasting service bands.\n\nThe role of BAZ is to regulate and manage the broadcasting service bands for sustenance rather than control broadcasting service bands.\n\nThe intention is to move away from a perception that the legislation is intended to stifle the freedoms guaranteed by section 61 of the Constitution and instead to focus on necessary regulation of the airwaves.\n\nThis is also in line with current international trends as contained in some international instruments among them, the African Charter on Broadcasting, the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, further reads the Bill.\n\nClause 4 amends section 4 of the principal Act by reducing the number of board members from 12 to seven and also providing for gender balance within BAZ.\n\nClause 15 amends section 38B by inserting a new provision which prohibits the sale of a motor insurance cover to persons who do not have ZBC radio licences.\n\n",
