This is aimed at enhancing utilisation of the warehouse receipt system (WRS), he explained.\n\nIn the outlook, ZMX aims to expand its warehouse facilities significantly and increase the number of aggregation centres in each district.\n\nWe are also working with farmer organisations and other key stakeholders in order to register a substantial number of farmers on our platform and conduct awareness campaigns to improve access to the exchange for all stakeholders plus facilitate enhanced trading through our weekly auctions, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, ZMX is ready for the upcoming annual African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Association of African Commodity Exchanges (A-ACX) conference to be held in the country from March 26 to 27.\n\nThe conference presents a strategic opportunity for Zimbabwe to enhance its economic position, foster regional collaboration, enhance visibility and open up multiple avenues for growth and collaboration in the commodities sector while promoting sustainable growth within the African continent, he highlighted.\n\nThe hosting of the event in Zimbabwe is a thumbs up to ZMX, which was launched in 2021 before joining the A-ACX in 2023 and had its CEO appointed to its steering committee.\n\nMr Tapfumaneyi said hosting the conference highlighted Zimbabwes growing role in the continental commodities market.\n\nThis reflects the countrys increasing importance as a player in trade and economic development within Africa, as well as commitment to AfCFTA goals, he noted.\n\nThe AfCFTA is a major African economic integration initiative whose objectives include boosting intra-African trade and promoting economic resilience across the continent.\n\nSixteen leading African commodities exchanges united to form AfCFTA A-ACX to advance intra-African trade and collaboration in 2023.\n\nThe ZMX boss said the conference provided Zimbabwe with an opportunity to showcase its contributions to the African commodities market, particularly its innovative frameworks and strategies for market development.\n\nAs the host country, Zimbabwe stands to benefit from potential investments in its natural resources and commodities sectors, which are crucial to the economy. The event offers a platform for global investors to explore opportunities in Zimbabwes market, he said.\n\nThe conference will bring in delegates from across Africa, benefiting Zimbabwes tourism and hospitality sectors.\n\nLocal stakeholders will have the chance to engage with international experts, gaining insights and skills that can help develop Zimbabwes commodities market further.\n\n",

When they come to an end, I will step aside and my party will elect my successor. That is as clear as day. Those who have other imaginations, its a democratic society for people to dream but facts will carry the day, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nAsked to comment on current efforts being made to have him extend his term up to 2030 through constitutional amendments in order to give legal effect to a resolution passed at Zanu PFs annual peoples conference in Bulawayo last year, President Mnangagwa said he will have to engage them on the need for him to be in compliance with the Constitution.\n\nI will persuade the persuaders not to persuade me so that I remain constitutional, said President Mnangagwa\n\n",
