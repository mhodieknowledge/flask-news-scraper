They are more likely to have tyre bursts and brake failures, which can cause serious accidents. Overloading also affects the vehicles stability, handling and stopping power, thereby putting drivers , passengers and other road users at risk.\n\nShe said the department is operating seven traffic control centres strategically located across Limpopo Province to monitor and screen vehicle loads.\n\nThese centres are in Mantsole, Zebediela, and Groblersburg in the Westerburg district; Polokwane in Capricorn district, Musina at Beitbridge, Mooketsi in Mopani District and Rathoke in Sekhukhune District.\n\n",
