Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): Leveraging PPPs can significantly enhance infrastructure development and public service delivery in Zimbabwe.\n\n2. Blended Finance: Combining concessional funds with private investments can reduce risks for development projects, thereby attracting more investors.\n\n3. Financial Inclusion and Innovation: Enhancing digital financial services can increase economic participation, helping to mobilise resources within the economy.\n\n4. Capacity Building and Human Capital Development: Investing in education and skills development is crucial for fostering a capable workforce to drive economic transformation.\n\n5. Policy Coherence and Governance: Strengthening these areas will attract higher foreign direct investments and bolster domestic investments.\n\nThe collaborative efforts under ZUNSDCF have seen Zimbabwe make strides in areas such as renewable energy, health, education and food system transformation.\n\nMajor successes include mobilising additional investments in renewable energy and connecting schools to digital networks, laying the ground for future growth.\n\nThe UNs role has been pivotal in fostering these developments, supported by flagship joint programmes and strategic dialogues on financing and development policies.\n\nThese initiatives demonstrate how effective partnerships can drive sustainable development and resilience.\n\nLooking ahead, priorities for 2025 focus on ensuring economic stability, resolving debt issues, enhancing institutional capacities and promoting inclusive policies to address gender disparities and youth skill development needs.\n\nThe 2024 report, along with insights and planned actions leading up to FFD4, presents a clear roadmap for Zimbabwes sustainable development.\n\nThrough strategic partnerships and a robust shift towards financing for development, Zimbabwe stands ready to accelerate its progress towards the SDGs, turning challenges into opportunities for sustainable growth and development.\n\nThis proactive approach by Zimbabwe, supported by international cooperation and innovative financial strategies, holds promise for unlocking pathways to prosperity and aligning national development goals with global objectives.\n\nAs the world converges on Sevilla for FFD4, Zimbabwes strategic endeavours serve as a testament to the power of partnership in realising the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nThe 2024 UN results report is available on: <https://zimbabwe.un.org/sites/default/files/2025-04/UN%20ZIMBABWE%20ANNUAL%20RESULTS%20REPORT%202024_Final-1.pdf> <https://zimbabwe.un.org/en/292321-2024-un-country-team-zimbabwe-results-report>\n\nSirak Gebrehiwot is UN Partnerships and Development Finance Advisor at the UN Resident Coordinators Office.\n\n",
