Every effort does count!\n\nThe potential for the region to create a more equitable and just society is huge and ever-present.\n\n",

So we are on the way to do that and we are doing that in order to grow our economy.\n\nProf Murwira said Zimbabwes Constitution demanded that the country should not only be Pan-African, but must join progressive groups that are good for the socio-economic growth of the nation while promoting peace in the world.\n\nPeace is fostered through economic development and BRICS is one of those groupings which Zimbabwe wishes to be part of.\n\nSo, what we have done with the Russian Federation and many other countries is to coalesce around the idea of growing capabilities, and this comes through education, innovation, science, and technology, he said.\n\nProf Murwira outlined the Governments commitment to economic diplomacy, which seeks to secure trade partnerships and foster local production.\n\nHe elaborated on initiatives such as partnerships in education and technology with Russia.\n\nZimbabwe has applied to join BRICS and the BRICS Bank at a time President Mnangagwa has championed rapid economic growth anchored on infrastructure development and a strong private sector participation.\n\nAll these developments have been achieved using locally mobilised resources as Zimbabwe continues to grapple with the effects of illegal financial sanctions imposed by the US and its Western allies at the turn of the century.\n\nJoining the BRICS Bank head-quarted in Shanghai in China will thus give Zimbabwe the much-needed fillip in its economic development plans as the bank was primarily established by BRICS for the purpose of mobilising resources for infrastructure and sustainable development in emerging markets and developing countries.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa is on record as saying that after applying to join the BRICS Bank, the next stage would be to seek to go beyond the bank and join the grouping.\n\nIt will be an opportune leap for Zimbabwes economic development quest as the groupings global influence continues to grow, with over 40 countries having applied to join the group that already accounts for at least 25 percent of the global economy.\n\n",

Equality. Empowerment.\n\nSen Mutsvangwa said the Government remained committed to empowering women through various initiatives, leaving no one and no place behind.\n\nGovernment recognises that women and girls continue to face significant barriers to achieving their full potential, she said.\n\nFrom discriminatory laws and policies to societal norms and stereotypes, women and girls are often marginalised, excluded, and silenced.\n\nHowever, we also acknowledge the incredible progress that has been made towards achieving gender equality, and we celebrate the courage, resilience and determination of women and girls who are driving this change.\n\nSen Mutsvangwa said Zimbabwe had made significant strides in promoting womens rights and empowerment.\n\nOur Constitution guarantees equal rights for women and men and we have implemented various policies and programmes aimed at promoting gender equality.\n\nHowever, despite these efforts,women and girls in Zimbabwe continue to face significant challenges, including limited access to education, healthcare and economic opportunities, she said.\n\nSen Mutsvangwa said Government recognises that empowering women is not just a moral obligation but a strategic necessity to combat poverty, illiteracy, hunger and malnutrition.\n\nGovernment has made significant strides in ensuring rural women are equipped to conquer adversity.\n\nThrough my ministry, Government is relentlessly providing awareness and training to women on climate change mitigation and adaptation, which is pivotal in fortifying resilience.\n\nWe are tirelessly collaborating with development partners to amplify womens access to renewable energy sources, liberating them from hazardous traditional cooking methods that endanger family health, she said.\n\nThe Minister passionately highlighted how solar-powered boreholes and irrigation schemes have revolutionised livelihoods, while menstrual health training and reusable sanitary wear production have uplifted over 2 000 rural women and girls this year alone.\n\nWe will not rest until every community can reliably supply the much-needed sanitary wear, ensuring no girl is left behind, she declared.\n\nMinister Mutsvangwa expounded on financial empowerment, detailing how microfinance facilities established in collaboration with development partners and financial institutions are transforming lives.\n\nThrough the Zimbabwe Women Development Fund, Community Development Fund, Womens Micro Finance Bank, and SMEDCO funding facilities, we provide affordable loans to women, enabling them to become formidable entrepreneurs who drive economic growth, she proclaimed.\n\nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator, Mr Edward Kallon, praised the nations monumental progress, urging unwavering dedication to the cause.\n\nInternational Womens Day is a clarion call to uphold the dignity and rights of women and girls worldwide.\n\nThe UN stands shoulder to shoulder with Zimbabwe, committed to reversing the regression in womens rights and forging a path to true gender equality, he said.\n\nSwedish Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Per Lindgrde, who was representing European Union nations, lauded Zimbabwes relentless pursuit of gender equality, acknowledging the nations progress while emphasising the need for sustained momentum.\n\nToday is not just a celebration, it is a call to action. Zimbabwes Constitution enshrines gender equality, the Education Act ensures pregnant girls remain in school and the Marriage Act protects vulnerable girls.\n\nYet, the scourge of gender-based violence persists, with one in three women affected. We must unite to obliterate this injustice, he affirmed, reinforcing the EUs resolute support through the Team Europe initiative.\n\nAmbassador Lindgrde said the EU has funded many initiatives in Zimbabwe that have significantly contributed to improving the lives of women and girls.\n\nThese initiatives have supported projects aimed at enhancing access to quality education, promoting womens economic empowerment through small and medium enterprises, and strengthening healthcare services in rural areas, he said.\n\nHe also stressed that the EU remains committed to working with the Government of Zimbabwe to create sustainable opportunities for women, protect their rights, and eliminate gender-based violence.\n\nThrough the Team Europe initiative, the EU has consistently championed gender equality, funding programs that equip women with essential skills, provide start-up capital for income-generating activities, and ensure that vulnerable communities receive the necessary support to thrive, he said.\n\nMinister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Advocate Misheck Mugadza, extolled the indomitable spirit and achievements of women in the province.\n\nWomen constitute approximately 1 035 000 of Manicalands population, and their resilience is unparalleled. Our province has produced trailblazing leaders like Minister Oppah Muchinguri and Minister Monica Mutsvangwa.\n\nManicaland stands as an unyielding pillar of womens empowerment, with girls schools shattering records and achieving historic milestones, he said with pride.\n\nAdv Mugadza applauded transformative local projects spearheaded by President Mnangagwa, including the Chikanga Mushroom Project in Mutare, Jopa Market in Chimanimani, and Cynara Dairy in Mutasa.\n\nThese visionary initiatives have equipped women to ascend as innovators and captains of industry, catalysing community transformation, he added.\n\nInternational Womens Day has been observed since the early 1900s  a time of great expansion and turbulence in the industrialised world that saw booming population growth and the rise of radical ideologies.\n\n",

China has established strategic partnership with all African countries having diplomatic ties with it. The China-Africa community with a shared future has been elevated to an all-weather level.\n\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of FOCAC. Over the past 25 years, China has helped Africa build or upgrade nearly 100 000 kilometres of roads and more than 10 000 kilometres of railways. In the past three years alone, Chinese enterprises created more than 1,1 million new jobs in Africa. China has remained Africas largest trade partner for 16 consecutive years. To African brothers and sisters, China-Africa cooperation is visible, tangible and truly beneficial, he said.\n\nMinister Wang further noted that Africa represents a fertile ground of hope for the 21st century.\n\nThere will be no global modernisation without African modernisation. The stability and development of Africa is vital to the future of humanity, and the world must listen to Africa and heed its concerns. Africa is going through a new awakening, and countries should support Africa in exploring a new development path of self-reliance and self-strengthening, he said.\n\nThe relationship between China and Zimbabwe has deep historical roots, dating back to the liberation struggle of the 1960s, during which Beijing provided crucial military support. This partnership deepened in the early 2000s when Western sanctions were imposed on Zimbabwe, leading China to remain a steadfast ally and a significant trade partner.\n\nUnder President Mnangagwas leadership, trade between Zimbabwe and China has experienced substantial growth, driven by engagement and re-engagement initiatives. China has invested billions in Zimbabwe, particularly in the mining and manufacturing sectors. Notable projects include the US$3,6 billion Palm River Energy Metallurgical Special Economic Zone in Beitbridge, developed in collaboration with a Chinese mining company, and the US$1, 5 billion Dinson Iron and Steel Company project in Manhize.\n\nOther key investments encompass the Afrochine ferrochrome smelters and lithium mining projects through Sinomine Resources, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, and Chengxin Lithium Group.\n\nChina has also supported significant infrastructure projects in Zimbabwe, such as the Hwange Thermal Power Station Units 7 and 8 (US$997 million), Kariba South Hydro Power Station (US$533 million), the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport expansion (US$152 million), and the Victoria Falls Airport upgrade (US$150 million).\n\nIn addition to infrastructure, China has contributed to national development projects, including funding the new Parliament building in Mt Hampden through a US$140 million grant.\n\nThe two nations have also collaborated in health and agriculture, with China providing substantial support during the Covid-19 pandemic and assisting Zimbabwes modernisation efforts through initiatives such as borehole drilling. These robust bilateral ties have solidified Chinas position as Zimbabwes all-weather friend, delivering tangible benefits across numerous sectors and aligning with Zimbabwes Vision 2030 modernisation and industrialisation goals.\n\n",

            "content": "Trust Freddy-Herald Correspondent\n\nSEVEN years after President Mnangagwas declaration, the National Environment Clean-up Day initiative, continues to thrive.\n\nYesterday, the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) joined three other independent commissions in a clean-up campaign.\n\nThe initiative stems from the Presidents declaration made on December 5, 2018, designating the first Friday of every month as National Environment Cleaning Day.\n\nOrganisations that participated included the Zimbabwe Media Commission, Zimbabwe Gender Commission, and the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission.\n\nZACC chairperson Mr Michael Reza said the clean-up campaign was important.\n\nThis is a follow-up to what His Excellency the President, Dr Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, said, that the first Friday of every month is Clean Up Day. Moreover, it is often said that cleanliness is next to godliness.\n\nTherefore, it is essential that we maintain cleanliness in our surroundings. We must ensure that our workplaces and public areas are clean and well-maintained.\n\nZimbabwe Media Commission chairperson Professor Ruby Magosvongwe weighed in saying: This is just an extension of the recognition of the call by His Excellency the President. I hope that, coming from where we are, each one of us has already cleaned up their offices, their work environment, and is also abstaining from contaminating the beauty within them, because what is happening outside may not necessarily be reflective of whats going on inside.\n\nThe clean up began at a fuel station on Sam Nujoma Street, with the team moving to Herbert Chitepo Avenue, where they thoroughly cleaned the area surrounding Harare Gardens and the ZACC offices.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa launched the national clean-up programme in December 2018, encouraging all citizens to clean their environment between 8am and 10am on the first Friday of every month.\n\nEveryone is invited to participate in cleaning their communities on this day, from individuals to businesses and organisations.\n\n",
