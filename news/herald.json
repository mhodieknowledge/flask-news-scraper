In this regard, as correctional officers, there is need to adopt new technologies and the smart prison concept in the discharge of your duties, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nThe Head of State and Government added that modern data analysis techniques should be deployed in assessing the behaviours of inmates and risk levels.\n\nThese and other innovations should inform the design of robust intervention strategies which are tailored to individual needs and current trends. However, it is crucial to implement these technologies ethically so that they effectively contribute to the overall goals of rehabilitation and public safety, he said.\n\nGovernment is establishing a community information centre at the ZPCS Ntabazinduna Training School, which upon completion will be accessible to the local community.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa congratulates the overall best ZPCS correctional officer, Tawonga Chinyamunjiko at the pass-out parade yesterday.  Pictures: Eliah Saushoma\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the centre is also part of efforts to accelerate digital transformation for economic growth and innovation in line with the philosophy of leaving no one and no place behind.\n\nHe commended the training school for continuously making strides to buttress Government programmes of economic empowerment through the implementation of projects that enhance production and productivity.\n\nThe President said the promotion of innovation and entrepreneurship using own resources in the process reducing reliance on fiscal support, is also commendable.\n\nZPCS has embraced a commercial business model dimension as part of its broad-based approach towards boosting revenue and self-sustenance in line with the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1).\n\nThe thrust dovetails with the organisations smart prison concept driven by the fact that ZPCS is now correctional in outlook and business-oriented.\n\nThe President, Ministers Ziyambi Ziyambi (left) and Richard Moyo (right), ZPCS Commissioner-General Moses Chihobvu (second from left), and the schools Commandant Commissioner Sithokozile Shoko (second from right) are joined by best recruits for a photo session after the pass-out parade yesterday\n\nAlready, ZPCS has embarked on several income-generating projects being undertaken at the countrys correctional and rehabilitation facilities.\n\nAnju Prison Farm in Matabeleland North Province, for instance, is core to ZPCS drive to empower inmates with life skills, which they can use upon release from prison.\n\nThe farm is one of the 23 ZPCS farms producing food for inmates at different prisons across the country.\n\nProduce from the farm is used for feeding inmates at prisons in the Matabeleland region while the surplus is sold to generate income to fund some of the day-to-day operations of the prisons.\n\nAs ZPCS, you are part of the security services and a vital cog in the national development agenda. You must, therefore, be on high alert and acquit yourselves well in executing your constitutional mandate, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nLet us all live up to the national development philosophy of Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, igonamatirwa nevene vayo/ Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo.\n\nAlso, the President called on newly graduated officers to maintain constitutionalism, professionalism, and discipline in their service to the nation, warning them against any form of misconduct that could tarnish the reputation of the ZPCS, Government, or the country.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa noted the growing challenge of drug and substance abuse, particularly among youths, which has also affected the security sector. He stressed the need for decisive action to address this scourge as Zimbabwe works towards becoming an upper-middle-income economy by 2030.\n\nTo the graduates, I emphasise that being a member of the security services requires unwavering loyalty, discipline, and a strong commitment to serving the nation. I further, urge you to work wholeheartedly and diligently, whilst upholding constitutionalism and professionalism. Your integrity must remain untarnished by selfish interests, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said drugs and substance abuse threaten national security in various ways and hinder economic development, adding that anyone caught engaging in such unethical behaviour will face the full wrath of the law.\n\nAnyone caught engaging in such unethical behaviour will face the full wrath of the law. Any form of indiscipline that could taint the reputation of the Service, Government and nation at large will not be tolerated, he said.\n\nAs new ambassadors of the ZPCS, I challenge you to adhere to high ethical standards and uprightness in your duties.\n\nThe President commended the ZPCS for its proactive measures in combating drug abuse, including awareness campaigns involving officers, inmates, and communities.\n\nI call upon recruits to reject such illicit activities and take bold steps towards building a brighter Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nIn June, President Mnangagwa launched the Zimbabwe Multi-Sectoral Drug and Substance Abuse Plan (2024-2030), a comprehensive strategy to tackle the issue. The plan includes seven pillars, focusing on supply and demand reduction, harm reduction, treatment and rehabilitation, psychosocial support, and community reintegration.\n\nThe graduating cohort included 1 107 males and 512 females from courses 154 and 155. Among them were recruits from the San community in Tsholotsho District, marking continued progress in integrating marginalised groups into national security services.\n\nThis follows the historic graduation of 20 San youths in June 2022, the first from their community to join the ZPCS. Before the Second Republics interventions, the San people faced significant challenges, including a lack of identity documents, limited access to education, and exclusion from formal employment opportunities.\n\nRecruits go through their drills at the 154th correctional officers pass-out parade at the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service (ZPCS) Training School in Ntabazinduna, Matabeleland North Province yesterday\n\nPresident Mnangagwa urged the graduates to remain committed to lifelong learning and adapt to evolving trends in correctional management.\n\nTo the graduates, as you step into the service of our great motherland, Zimbabwe, carry with you the lessons and memories from your training. Do not just dream of the future, but become the architects of the future you want, he said.\n\nApproach your work with the courage and optimism to make a positive impact wherever you will be deployed. Remember, learning is a lifelong journey, and your thirst for knowledge must never stop.\n\nStay abreast of evolving trends in correctional management and continually sharpen your knowledge and skills.\n\nYesterdays pass-out parade was attended by several senior Government officials, service chiefs, and the relatives of the recruits.\n\n",

            "content": "Rumbidzayi Zinyuke\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nThe pollution levels in Lake Chivero, Harares primary water source, have reached alarming heights, adversely affecting both aquatic and wildlife.\n\nThe rise in cyanobacteria due to pollutionprimarily from raw sewageposes significant health risks to humans and animals alike.\n\nThe toxic algae blooms have already resulted in the deaths of several animals, including four rhinos, three zebras, four wildebeests and four fish eagles.\n\nAdditionally, over 1 000 dead fish have been washed ashore, raising concerns for local fishermen and consumers.\n\nDespite the presence of dead fish, some fishermen continue to catch and sell fish from the lake.\n\nOne fisherman remarked, The fish in the water are okay. You can easily identify those that are affected because they are dead.\n\nNearby farms have also reported livestock developing problems with Mr Vareta Kupanyira, manager at Cumbrae Farm, noting that four of their cattle had developed sores after drinking water from the lake.\n\nWhen there is no electricity to pump water from the borehole, they drink from the lake, he said, highlighting the risk posed by contaminated water.\n\nA recent study by ecologist Professor Christopher Magadza indicated a dire situation for Lake Chivero.\n\nHe warned of the lakes warming and a potential ecological shift towards a permanent cyanobacteria-dominated ecosystem, particularly under conditions of elevated temperatures and nutrient overload.\n\nCyanobacteria, such as Anabaena and Microcystis, thrive in warm, nutrient-rich waters, leading to explosive growth.\n\nDuring blooms, toxins are released into the water, posing risks to both humans and animals.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) confirmed that the deaths of fish and animals are linked to the lakes poor water quality.\n\nPreliminary investigations indicate that sewage runoff from the Marimba area has\n\nforced contaminated water into multiple bays, creating hazardous conditions for aquatic life. High pollution results in a boom in algae growth, which increases oxygen demand on the water body resulting in high mortality for the fish. As wind patterns continue to shift, we anticipate that this issue may further impact fish populations across the lake, said ZimParks spokesperson Mr Tinashe Farawo.\n\nHe said a team was currently on the ground carrying out further investigations on a broader scale.\n\nTo mitigate the risk, we implemented measures to deter the animals from drinking from the affected dam by placing salt blocks and game nuts around the park, as well as artificial water points with clean water. Regrettably, these efforts proved to be not enough, as the animals continued to drink from the lake, said Mr Farawo.\n\nLake Chivero is one of Zimbabwes seven Ramsar-protected sites as a wetland of international importance and a vital water source for the country.\n\nBesides being the main water source for Harare and nearby towns, Lake Chivero is a habitat for many animals, including white rhinos, zebras, pangolins and over 400 bird species.\n\nTemporary corrective measures were put in place in an effort to address the challenges being experienced at the recreation park to no avail.\n\nThe pollution challenges facing this lake require a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach therefore we urge the public and relevant authorities to understand the effects of pollution and to join us in advocating for better environmental practices to protect our biodiversity, Mr Farawo said.\n\nDespite the ongoing pollution, the Harare City Council insists that the water treated and supplied to over a million residents is safe for consumption.\n\nMayor Jacob Mafume acknowledged the algae issue but reassured that the water is treated in accordance with World Health Organisation standards.\n\nEvery body of water that is untreated is unsafe so we always treat our water in line with World Health Organisation standards. Every year during this period, we get fish that die as a result of lack of oxygen caused by the algae. The situation is being exacerbated by the heat but once the rains come, the situation will get better. However, what happened with the animals needs to be further investigated for us to understand what is happening, he said.\n\nHe acknowledged that the council needed to find a solution to the growth of algae to ensure that life in and around the lake is protected.\n\nMayor Mafume also said the long-term solution was expanding the sewer treatment plants to ensure that the sewer is treated before it reaches the lake.\n\nOur sewer plants have a design capacity of 80 megalitres but we have about 200 megalitres of sewer being channelled through. We need to expand our plants to accommodate this excess. We are engaged with the Taskforce and the Ministry of Local Government on how we can do this, he added.\n\nIn 2020, the Ministry of Environment launched a campaign to declare Lake Chivero and Darwendale Dams as Ecologically Sensitive areas.\n\nThis was done in terms of (113) (1) of the Environmental Management Act (EMA) [Chapter 20:17] as read with Section 7 (2) (a) of the Environmental Management (Efluent and Solid Waste Disposal) Regulations 2007 (Statutory Instrument 6 of 2007).\n\nThe situation at Lake Chivero comes as Zimbabwe is set to host the RAMSAR Convention CoP15 in July next year.\n\nThe event will prioritise issues such as the protection of freshwater sources, biodiversity and sustainable use of wetlands.\n\nThe Ramsar Convention on Wetlands is a convention that recognises the importance of wetlands for providing clean water, food, and protection from extreme weather events. Wetlands also play a role in mitigating global heating by capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide.\n\n",

Fortunately, Chido (no longer a cyclone but an overland depression) continued its west-south-westward movement into Tete Province still in northern Mozambique.\n\nMSD said the movement of the cyclone overland, reduced its wind speed and rainfall intensity due to increased frictional forces.\n\nAs of yesterday, the residual moisture from the overland depression resulted in cloudy conditions over the northeastern parts of Zimbabwe, bringing light to moderate rainfall in Manicaland and Mashonaland East provinces as early as 0900hrs.\n\nFrom there, the MSD said the remnants of this residual moisture should combine with moisture from the usual Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, which brings rainfall over Zimbabwe from mid-December, as well as the cloud band from Botswana.\n\nThis should result in moderate rainfall (30-80 mm) over much of the country.\n\nCPU director, Mr Nathan Nkomo, said officials are closely and continuously monitoring the situation.\n\nWe continue to get updates from both our two early warning units, the Meteorological Services Department and the climate service centre daily, we are monitoring the situation, Mr Nkomo said.\n\n",

Artists like Dominic Benhura and David Ngwerume, who create remarkable works from their own studios, exemplify the thriving local art scene.\n\nOne of the sectors most significant achievements has been its ability to promote cultural diplomacy, enhancing the global appeal of Zimbabwean art.\n\nThe country made a notable impression at the 60th International Exhibition of Biennale in Italy.\n\nOften referred to as the World Cup of Arts, this prestigious event featured Zimbabwean artists such as Moffat Takadiwa, Gillian Rosselli, Victor Nyakauru, Sekai Machache, Troy Makaza and Kombo Chapfika. Their participation exemplifies Zimbabwes growing presence on the international art stage.\n\nThe legacy of Zimbabwean artists at the Venice Biennale includes luminaries like Portia Zvavahera, Virginia Chihota, Misheck Masamvu, Calvin Dondo and many others. This impressive roster underscores the global demand for Zimbabwean art.\n\nIn addition to group exhibitions, individual artists have also made waves internationally. Takadiwa, who operates Mbare Art Space in Harare, recently auctioned some of his works to the famous power couple Jay-Z and Beyonc.\n\nThis event highlighted the international appeal of Zimbabwean art and marked a significant milestone in promoting the brand of Zimbabwe overseas.\n\nThe success of visual artists in Zimbabwe is further illustrated by the achievements of four artists from the Swiss-Zim Heritage Gallery in Domboshava, led by Keith Zenda.\n\nThey showcased their collections at Andakulova Gallery from November 29 to December 13.\n\nThis quartet, which included Sampson Kuhwenguva, Tonderai Mujuru, Barry Lungu, and Zenda, received acclaim in Dubai, attracting numerous buyers interested in Zimbabwean art.\n\nTheir exhibition, titled An African Story, resonated strongly with audiences, reflecting the growing demand for local art.\n\nWhile international markets garner much attention, local leaders have stressed the importance of supporting homegrown talent.\n\nNhaka Art Gallery in Harare has also been a vibrant hub for local artists. The centre concluded its 2024 calendar with a two-day event called the Tandavara Exhibition, held on November 30 and December 1.\n\nThis gathering brought together over 20 talented creatives, including renowned artist Troy Makaza, who was also featured at the Venice Biennale.\n\nDuring the exhibition, artists exchanged ideas and insights, fostering a collaborative spirit within the community.\n\nThe event, titled The Power of Memory Art, showcased artworks that conveyed intricate narratives inspired by personal and collective experiences, blending culture, heritage, and identity.\n\n",

            "content": "Tapiwa Muruviwa\n\nHerald Correspondent\n\nThe ongoing developmental agenda in Zimbabwe has become a focal point of academic and scholarly discussion, particularly since 2017, a watershed moment for the nation.\n\nThe Second Republic inherited a challenging political and economic landscape, heavily impacted by illegal Western sanctions.\n\nHowever, under the leadership of President Mnangagwa, the country has begun to turn a corner.\n\nZimbabwe is in the midst of extensive infrastructural development, essential for industrialising its economy.\n\nPresident Mnangagwas role as Chairperson of SADC further emphasises his influence on regional and continental matters.\n\nFor the past two decades, the nations road infrastructure had significantly deteriorated, necessitating innovative strategies for revitalisation.\n\nInfrastructure development as a priority\n\nSince taking office, the Second Republic has prioritised infrastructure development as a key component of the countrys ambition to achieve upper-middle-income status by 2030.\n\nOne of the cornerstone initiatives under his administration is the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Programme (ERRP), which aims to foster socio-economic growth through infrastructural improvements.\n\nThese projects are not confined to Harare, they extend across all provinces, demonstrating a commitment to national development.\n\nNotable achievements include the rehabilitation of the over 300 kilometres Harare-Beitbridge Highway and the recent improvements to the 45km Shurugwi-Mhandamabwe Highway in the Midlands Province.\n\nSuch flagship projects reflect President Mnangagwas political will to stimulate socio-economic growth and enhance the quality of life for Zimbabweans.\n\nModernisation efforts\n\nSignificant advancements have been made in upgrading critical facilities like the Beitbridge Border Post and Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport. Moreover, the modernisation of the Beitbridge Border Post and expansion projects at RGMI Airport represent other significant infrastructural advancements.\n\nThe upgraded Beitbridge Border Post facilitates regional trade and economic integration, showcasing the success of the principle Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo (the country is built by its own people).\n\nThese projects are executed by local companies and funded by the Government, aligning with President Mnangagwas vision for an independent development agenda.\n\nIndustrialisationand value addition\n\nPresident Mnangagwas administration has also demonstrated a commitment to industrialisation, focusing on value addition and beneficiation of Zimbabwes natural resources.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure, President Mnangagwa has exhibited bold leadership in championing industrialisation. His administration emphasises the importance of value addition and beneficiation of Zimbabwes natural resources, which are crucial for economic growth.\n\nBy focusing on industrialisation, the Government aims to create jobs, improve living standards, and position Zimbabwe as a competitive player in global markets.\n\nRegionally, as SADC Chairperson, President Mnangagwa promotes collective infrastructure development and industrialisation. His developmental agenda aligns with the SADC Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP 2020-2030) and SADC Vision 2050, which prioritise industrial and infrastructure development.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the SADC headquarters in Botswana, he encouraged member states to shift from being mere consumers to producers of goods and services, a vision that empowers regional economies.\n\nForeign policyand re-engagement\n\nFurthermore, President Mnangagwa took office during a period when Zimbabwe faced international isolation due to sanctions.\n\nHis foreign policy, centred on engagement and re-engagement, has been instrumental in restoring relations with the global community.\n\nScholars like Mataruse (2023) note that this approach has led to positive developments, with countries like Britain and the US reconsidering their stances on Zimbabwe.\n\nBy fostering strategic partnerships with former adversaries and traditional allies such as China and Russia, the Government has attracted vital foreign direct investment essential for economic recovery.\n\nRegional leadershipand peacekeeping\n\nUpon taking office, President Mnangagwa faced the challenge of restoring Zimbabwes international relations, which had been strained by sanctions.\n\nOver the past few years, Zimbabwe has made significant strides in regional cooperation and peacekeeping initiatives.\n\nAs President Mnangagwa undertakes the responsibilities of SADC Chairperson, the expectations for Zimbabwe to play a pivotal role in regional peace and stability are high.\n\nHis demonstrated political will suggests that he will continue to be a key figure in promoting security and development in the region.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-lets-prepare-for-disasters-take-warnings-seriously/",
            "content": "Zimbabwe has been building up its capacity to warn communities and individuals about impending potential disasters, such as cyclones and floods, and its capacity to create evacuation centres and routes and to deal with the aftermath of these extreme events.\n\nCyclone Idai of March 2019, the most extreme weather event for many decades, showed that we needed a significant upgrade over what had worked in the past with the less extreme weather we once enjoyed.\n\nWe were facing something new and we needed to create new systems, and upgrade some of the better older ones, to cope with the new world we are facing. It was fairly obvious when we were looking at the lessons we needed to apply, that if everyone had received a more urgent and detailed warning and if many had been evacuated or had simply fled earlier to the right places, with the right places identified, the loss of life would have been very light although property damage would still have been severe. While the flood waters would still have destroyed roads and homes, the people would have moved uphill to safer areas and relief efforts would then have been concentrated initially on providing temporary shelter, food and water.\n\nWith global warming and the accompanying climate change, and the greater heat in the atmosphere and the seas means that there is more energy to generate more intense weather events such as cyclones, we can expect these potential disasters to become worse and more frequent.\n\nThe Civil Protection Unit is now better equipped and an entire organisation has been put in place, usually using civil servants who generally have other day jobs, but move into the disaster mode when needed, to make sure warnings get out and the best possible preparations are put in place, and then to help assess and deal with the damage afterwards. As we have seen with Cyclone Chido, which was expected to have diminished in intensity significantly by the time it reached Zimbabwe, general warnings were issued through the media.\n\nThe Meteorological Services Department, while maintaining its determination to give as accurate a forecast as possible, now also warns that the weather or weather event could be worse than expected and that people should take precautions. Weather forecasting is in many ways a statistical science, calculating the odds of certain events, and so the department now correctly makes it clear that the lesser probabilities could happen.\n\nWe probably need to go further. In our present systems, individual provinces, districts and even wards can be put on alert and warnings sent to local leadership, especially the traditional leadership such as chiefs, headmen and village heads, so that warnings can be given to communities from people who are trusted, and where necessary people can be moved rapidly to safer places. Organisational plans include rapidly using the more secure shelter that is usually available, such as schools and some church buildings, and the Civil Protection Unit can get hold of buses and have stockpiled essential requirements that can be moved at short notice.\n\nThis is fairly standard best practice around the world. But recent technology advances allow more direct warnings. Britain, for example, very recently commissioned a system that allows authorities to ensure that all mobile phones in the cells where a major warning is needed to give a screech or siren sound, even if they have been set to silent, and the detailed warning message and strongly recommended action is displayed.\n\nThe sound warning works on all networks and all makes of phone, and the largely ubiquitous ownership of mobile phones, and at least of the more basic smart phones, means that almost everyone is warned and told what they should do and what they need to do. The system was tested for the first time a short while ago when a very intense storm threatened a group of counties in south-western England.\n\nWe almost certainly need to be more active in making sure people do not build houses and other structures on areas likely to flood, or near rivers that are likely to burst their banks. We have now all seen pictures of how powerful moving water can be, even quite shallow water, with heavy vehicles swept from low-level bridges where the water was not that deep but was moving fast. That same powerful flow can wreck even a well-built brick house.\n\nWe also need to make sure that roofs are properly designed to handle high winds, and then make sure that the required maintenance is done, so loose nails and the like do not see the roof sheets ripped off. Zimbabweans are often laid back over storm water drainage, at least until they see the results of blocked drains or even filled-in drains or no drains.\n\nThe Government has been stepping up its determination to ensure planning rules are followed, and among these rules are the security of wetlands and the need to stop people cultivating and building on streambanks. Wetlands can act as a temporary sink for floodwaters, allowing them to spread out harmlessly, and if nothing very valuable is on streambanks there is a lot less danger, and the rivers can overflow without serious side-effects, again using natural systems to minimise the dangers.\n\nWe have come a long way under the Second Republic in building up our preparations to deal with potential disasters, and increasing resources available. The Civil Protection Unit goes on alert more often than might be needed when looking in retrospect, but the alerts are given when there is a reasonable probability of danger, and if the weather event passes at lower intensity that is fine, but at least everyone was prepared for something worse.\n\nThis is why the warnings and alerts need to be taken seriously. You may be all right if you ignore the warnings, and the event passes you by. But on the other hand, it may be as bad as the warnings, or even worse, and no one can really tell precisely in advance, only give probabilities and these are in any case averages for an area. Some specific locations may have more rain and higher winds, and that is where the damage is most likely.\n\n",

Zimbabwe lost the shortest format 1-2 and will be looking to make amends in the ODI competition. Ervine is the captain of the ODI games. He and Williams will be returning for the ODI series along with Joylord Gumbie, Victor Nyauchi, and Ben Curran, who has received his maiden national team call-up.\n\nThe quartet of Faraz Akram, Ryan Burl, Takudzwanashe Kaitano, and Wessly Madhevere will make way for the quintet.\n\nThe Chevrons need to be in top form to upstage the Afghans, who have dominated the meetings between the two sides with 18 wins against Zimbabwes 10.\n\nThe last time the teams met, Zimbabwe lost 0-3 at Harare Sports Club, two years ago. There is more to play for for the Chevrons, who have been struggling to get series wins of late in all formats. The most recent ODI series against Pakistan last month ended with a 1-2 defeat at Queens Sports Club.\n\nMeanwhile, Zimbabwean players were fined 10 percent of their match fee by the International Cricket Council for maintaining a slow over-rate in the third T20I against Afghanistan on Saturday. Andy Pycroft of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees imposed the sanction after Zimbabwe were ruled to be two overs short of the target after time allowances were taken into consideration.\n\nIn accordance with Article 2.22 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to minimum over-rate offences, players are fined five percent of their match fee for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time.\n\nZimbabwe T20I captain Sikandar Raza pleaded guilty to the offence and accepted the proposed sanction, so there was no need for a formal hearing.\n\nOn-field umpires Iknow Chabi and Forster Mutizwa, third umpire Percival Sizara, and fourth umpire Langton Rusere laid the charge, said a statement from ICC.\n\nZimbabwe ODI Squad:Craig Ervine (captain), Brian Bennett, Ben Curran, Joylord Gumbie, Trevor Gwandu, Tinotenda Maposa, Tadiwanashe Marumani, Wellington Masakadza, Tashinga Musekiwa, Blessing Muzarabani, Dion Myers, Richard Ngarava, Newman Nyamhuri, Victor Nyauchi, Sikandar Raza, Sean Williams\n\nAfghanistan ODI Squad: Hashmatullah Shahidi (captain), Rahmat Shah, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ikram Alikhil, Abdul Malik, Sediqullah Atal, Darwish Rasooli, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Rashid Khan, Nangyal Kharoti, AM Ghazanfar, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Bilal Sami, Naveed Zadran, Fareed Ahmad Malik.\n\n",
