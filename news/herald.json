The whole idea is to transform the economic sector and, the entire GDP of the country, he said.\n\nVardhaan Lithium, said Mr Matoi, was firmly behind Zimbabwes goal of attaining upper-middle-income economic status by 2030.\n\nSo the vision which we are sharing with them, they support the vision of His Excellency, the President of Zimbabwe, Dr ED Mnangagwa of creating an upper-middle-income economy by 2030.\n\nWe actually want to (tap into their expertise) as much as we canthey are coming to us as technical and financial partners, he said.\n\nOver the years, Indian investments in Zimbabwe have surged to a remarkable US$600 million, reflecting the growing depth of the bilateral relations between the two nations.\n\nThis massive investment jump, mostly in the private sector, has provided direct employment to approximately 5 000 Zimbabweans with indirect job creation for an additional 10 000 people.\n\nThe increasing presence of Indian companies in Zimbabwe combined with new expansion projects is poised to further fuel the economic collaboration between the two countries, with several projects already underway including one recently officiated by President Mnangagwa.\n\n",

            "content": "Michael Tome-Business Reporter\n\nGLOBAL economic research firm BMI has projected Zimbabwes economy to grow by 4,9 percent this year, driven by the strong recovery of agriculture, increased investments in mining and accelerated public infrastructure development.\n\nThe projection by the British multinational and unit of UK-headquartered Fitch Solutions, usually very critical of Zimbabwes prospects, signals the huge potential for growth in Zimbabwe this year, even though most multilateral institutions see higher growth, perhaps as high as 6,2 percent.\n\nMultilateral lenders such as the African Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have already projected that Zimbabwe would register the same growth this year, between 5 percent and 6,2 percent.\n\nBMIs head of global operational risk research, Ms Chiedza Madzima, gave the companys forecast on Wednesday at the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) Business and Economic Outlook Symposium for 2025.\n\nFinance and Economic Development Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube forecast the economy to expand by 6 percent this year, partly driven by agriculture after the El Nino-induced drought weighed down growth last year.\n\nZimbabwe was projected to have registered slower growth of 2 percent last year from 5,3 percent the prior year. Even though agriculture saw a decline in output, rising output and value in other sectors including mining, tourism and manufacturing compensated resulting in positive growth.\n\nGrowth is expected to pick up pace, one of the fastest in Africa, driven by the success of the 2024-25 summer cropping season following the good rains received across the country.\n\nMs Madzima said Zimbabwes economy would also benefit from expected strong gold output, amid rising prices on the international markets, propelled by the projected 12,8 percent expansion in agricultural output.\n\nGrowing investments across the economy, as indicated by the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency, would also drive accelerated growth, she said.\n\nThe Chamber of Mines of Zimbabwe is on record as saying that planned investments in the mining sector were expected to surpass US$600 million, primarily driven by new lithium projects.\n\nMs Madzima said Zimbabwes lithium output was expected to grow by 75 percent this year, while platinum group metals production was seen up by 7 percent.\n\nPotential long-term projects like the Zim Cyber City and the Mapinga Mines to Energy Industrial Park into which foreign investors are expected to put US$13 billion, are also expected to drive faster economic growth thisyear.\n\nMs Madzima noted that the countrys net financial accounts had been on a positive trajectory over the past three years, driven by growing foreign investment coming from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), China and South Africa.\n\nImproving weather conditions will facilitate a recovery in agriculture, which means recovery in household incomes and electricity supply in the coming quarters, but our growth projection is 4,9 percent, which is below the governments projection of six percent.\n\nInvestment will strengthen in 2025 as we have seen strong growth in the issuance of licenses by ZIDA, and the Government capex is recovering in line with the budget projections.\n\nLithium output is expected to grow by 75 percent this year, PGMs net is going to be up by seven percent, gold by four percent. Of course, on the agric side, the Government expects agricultural production to peak by around 12,8 percent.\n\nSo all this signals quite a positive trajectory for Zimbabwes current account and its net export position, Ms Madzima said.\n\nDespite positive projections, she noted potential impediments to Zimbabwes economy, saying the countrys currency challenges could hinder growth if unchecked.\n\nAuthorities have already rolled out several policy measures to stabilise the economy, including adopting tight monetary and fiscal positions, which are already paying dividends amid growing exchange rate stability and falling inflation.\n\nMs Madzima also said that although Zimbabwe saw a slight increase in foreign currency reserves in 2024, its external position remained susceptible to unforeseen challenges from global economic volatility.\n\nForeign currency challenges will continue to be an issue within the country, still tight financial conditions, very high interest rates will keep private consumption growth rather muted, and there is a stronger need for fiscal consolidation. Of course, this will limit a sharp uptick in Government spending, she said.\n\nWorld Bank senior country economist for Zimbabwe, Mr Victor Steenbergen, weighed in saying sustaining steady and consistent economic growth was crucial for Zimbabwe to achieve its ambitious goal of transitioning into an upper-middle-income economy by 2030.\n\nHe also emphasised that the private sector played a vital role in Zimbabwes economy, as it was the primary driver of employment and contribution to GDP.\n\nAchieving consistent and sustainable economic growth is a key to Zimbabwes goal to become an upper-middle economy. The role of the private sector is critical in this as it is the largest employer, the largest contributor to GDP, and the largest source of tax revenue.\n\nDespite multiple challenges over the past several decades, Zimbabwes private sector demonstrates strong resilience and has significant potential in the short term, Mr Steenbergen said.\n\nThe annual gathering brought together industry leaders, business executives, economic and market analysts, and policymakers to assess the countrys economic situation and the dynamics shaping the business environment in 2025 and beyond.\n\n",

Altogether they have treated more than 93 000 patients, particularly in remote and underserved areas.\n\nThe commemorations, held at the Chinese Embassy in Harare, underscored the enduring partnership that has profoundly impacted Zimbabwes healthcare landscape. The event also recognised the efforts of the outgoing 21st medical team, which has been in the country since March last year.\n\nSpeaking during the celebrations, Health and Child Care Deputy Minister Sleiman Kwidini commended the Chinese Medical Teams efforts which have made significant impact on the health sector over the past years.\n\nFor the past 40 years, these teams have been at the forefront of delivering quality healthcare to our people, often in the most remote and underserved areas. The 21st China Medical Team has already treated over 14 000 patients, trained more than 1 000 local healthcare workers, and established critical healthcare facilities such as the Telemedicine Centre, First-Aid Training Centre, and Clinical Skills Training Centre at Parirenyatwa Hospital.\n\nThese efforts have not only saved lives but have significantly enhanced the capacity of our healthcare system, leaving a legacy that will benefit future generations, he said.\n\nDeputy Minister Kwidini said the impact of the China Medical Teams extended beyond numbers with the success of programmes like the Bright Journey, which recently completed its most recent mission to Zimbabwe, restoring sight to more than 600 patients.\n\nChina has also supported the development of essential health infrastructure including the construction of Chinhoyi Provincial Hospital, the Mahusekwa China-Zimbabwe Friendship Hospital, and the National Pharmaceutical (NatPharm) Warehouse in Harare.\n\nThe partnership between Zimbabwe and China in the healthcare sector serves as a shining example of what nations can achieve when they collaborate with mutual respect and friendship. As we celebrate this significant milestone, it is important to recognise the role of international cooperation in addressing global challenges. Todays world is marked by profound changes and uncertainties, from health crises to economic disparities. It is more important than ever for nations to come together, as Zimbabwe and China have done, to build a united and prosperous global community, he said.\n\nDeputy Minister Kwidini said Chinas global development initiative aligned closely with the governments vision of leaving no one and no place behind.\n\nHe welcomed the incoming 22nd China Medical Team to the country and expressed hope that the team would also make a positive impact as it begins work.\n\nChinese Embassy Charg dAffaires, Mr Cheng Yan, commended the Chinese medical teams commitment, as well as the support and collaboration of the Government and the people of Zimbabwe.\n\nHe said the 21st Medical teams efforts embodied the spirit of Chinas vision for a global community of health for all, and demonstrated that their mission was not just about treating illness but building bridges of friendship between the two countries peoples.\n\nMr Yan also encouraged the incoming team to work with local experts for continuity of services.\n\nI want to encourage you, please remember, you are not only coming for treating patients, but also for more exchanges of skills and expertise with your Zimbabwean colleagues; you are not only coming as medical professionals, but also as envoys of China-Zimbabwe friendship. I look forward to your greater contribution to the Zimbabwean people and our bilateral relations on the solid foundation cemented by your predecessors, he added.\n\n",

The maize crop was planted by the children as part of their life skills training initiative by Dr Mnangagwa at her skills development centre in Mbare.\n\nThere are many success stories at the centre, including that of a girl whose talent was nurtured by the First Lady and is now playing professional womens soccer at Black Mambas Football Club.\n\nDr Mnangagwa sought to know some of the social vices that the children know and how the children reprimand one another in the event of mischief.\n\nHow do you caution someone who will be misbehaving? she asked. In response, a boy said: We sit him down and tell him that you are ruining your life. Better follow the good morals we are being taught by our mother, the First Lady.\n\nDr Mnangagwa weighed in, expressing her love for the children.\n\nI love you my children that is why I took you from the streets, so that you grow up morally upright. As a mother, I want to work with disciplined children who do not take drugs or engage in naughtiness, she said.\n\nThe learners also expressed gratitude to the mother of the nation for her benevolence.\n\nWe love you Mhamha for sending us to school, a child at the centre said.\n\nAnother one praised the First Lady for restoring their dignity.\n\nMhamha, previously we would be ridiculed wherever we went and were accused for all thefts even when we were not present, pese pataipfura vanhu vaibata homwe nemhino vachiti tiri kunhuwa but Mhamha you embraced us, you are not selective and showed us motherly love.\n\nYou bathed us, clothed us and sheltered us. You also gave us a chance to go to school as education is key.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa interacts with a girl after she finished eating during lunch prepared by former street children after training at the skills development centre in Mbare. The girl had earlier told Amai Mnangagwa that she is a child and should be forgiven if she fails to finish her food.\n\nHis colleague also thanked the First Lady for initiating projects for them.\n\nAmai, we are happy for the projects you initiated here for us. We are now selling our produce like tomatoes, vegetables, and chickens. We are also involved in recycling and making money.\n\nToday we are glad you came to harvest with us the maize that you helped us grow. You have also come to spend the day with us, he said.\n\nAmai Mnangagwa expressed love to the children and in return they shed tears of joy as they told her how much they appreciated her for her love and kindness.\n\nAfter interacting with the children, she then started harvesting the maize with the children before proceeding to the kitchen where the children and community mothers were cooking.\n\nThey prepared chicken, beef, sugar beans, dried vegetables, cabbages, rice, sadza and green mealies. Most of the food cooked is from the centre.\n\nThe chickens are reared at the centre where the vegetables are also grown and dried.\n\nThe female soccer player, Mercy Gada, had words of advice to her peers.\n\nShe said she grew up in the streets and later learnt of the First Ladys Skills Development Centre.\n\nI seized the opportunity and came along to live at the centre. The First Lady spoke to us, asking us what we are capable of doing in our lives, like sports, catering, and sewing.\n\nI am among the girls who had a vision to play womens soccer. The First Lady encouraged me to play soccer to nurture my talent. She facilitated that I joined Black Mambas Queens where I am playing football.\n\nI thank the First Lady very much for what she did for me in my life and I am seeing that my life is changing, unlike in the past. I, therefore, encourage others not to suppress their talents because they can make it in life.\n\nI encourage people to leave drugs. If I were into drugs, I would not be where I am today and I would not be playing soccer, she said.\n\nMr Joseph Rukara, who is taking the children through dressmaking lessons at the centre, praised the First Lady.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa interacts with a boy after he finished eating during lunch prepared by former street children after training at the skills development centre in Mbare.\n\nI thank the First Lady for the work that she is undertaking in this community. Mbare can be viewed as Sodom and Gomorrah, but it is changing because of the mother of the nation. Some children from around the community are also coming seeking to learn and doing vocational skills.\n\nWe have over 40 children who are here learning to sew and I thank the First Lady for her great love, wishing that the Lord grants her more years on earth, he said.\n\nEqually delighted were the children. One of the beneficiaries who identified himself as Admire said he was at a loss for words.\n\nOne of the former street children enjoys a meal where he finished three plates during lunch at the skills development centre in Mbare yesterday.\n\nI just do not know how best I can thank the First Lady for what she is doing to most of us children who were living and working on the streets. She took us from the abyss and is showing us the correct path to follow. I never thought I would acquire decent education like other children of my age, but this has come to pass because of the First Lady. I glorify God for giving us such a loving mother, he said.\n\nAnother beneficiary said she was glad to have learnt to use her hands to earn a living.\n\nFormer street girls sweep the floors showing the skills they were taught by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa at her skills development centre in Mbare yesterday.\n\nI thank the First Lady heartily for bringing us here and equipping us with life skills. I am delighted I can now raise chickens and grow vegetables all because of the First Ladys love.\n\nI had been left without an option but to venture into prostitution owing to the challenges we encountered on the streets. This, however, is now a thing of the past because the First Lady took me and washed me of those ill-thoughts. She taught me to be morally upright and use my own hands to earn a decent living, she said with happiness.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa observes as an ECD teacher conducts lessons at her skills development centre in Mbare yesterday.\n\nProstitution, drug abuse, and petty crimes used to be part of the childrens lives until Amai Mnangagwa, who has a passion for the total empowerment of children, gave them a new lease of life.\n\n",

Maybe, at a time, you will then realise that no, you need 80 percent or 70 percent  naturally without the need of you coming back to this august House to amend, that is my proposal, said Mr Mushoriwa.\n\nDr Muswere supported the suggestion, indicating a willingness to revise the clause to allow for more flexible regulatory powers concerning local and African content.\n\nZanu PF Chief Whip Cde Pupurai Togarepi suggested that the clause should read: That the Minister may, by regulation, prescribe the percentum of local and African content for sport channels.\n\nDr Muswere also defended a provision that requires subscription-based broadcasters to carry three ZBC channels.\n\nHe responded to concerns that this might deter investment, affirming that it aligns with international standards.\n\nIt is a standard procedure internationally that if you are a subscription-based licence operator, you must carry three national broadcaster channels. In Zimbabwe, we have one and we are trying to come up with two more.\n\nWe want this law to help us to ensure that all those that we may license carry two more. We want to add ZBC 2 and 3. This is based on heritage broadcast. We want our content to spread internationally and cater for the 16 languages. There is nothing new as this is international practice, said Dr Muswere.\n\nAs the Bill progresses, these discussions highlight the balance between regulatory oversight and the need for flexibility in content requirements to adapt to the changing broadcasting landscape.\n\n",

We have been in partnership with Geo Pomona from day one, he said.\n\nThere is still more to be done, a big need for modern equipment to come in, and one of the reasons I was impressed is everything is so modern.\n\nI was asking earlier on to say when the city was dumping here, what was the game planit looks like there was no game plan, and for the first time in our lives, we now have a game plan to say this is how we are going to manage waste.\n\nMr Nyazema said the establishment of such a facility was one of Zimbabwes success stories, adding that the general citizenry needed to be made fully aware of its existence and operation.\n\nSo the transformation from a dump site to a waste management facility is a key success that we have recorded as Zimbabweans over the past few years.\n\nAnd I think we should build on that success to ensure that not only Harare benefits, but the rest of the country and indeed the rest of the SADC region before we look at other regions in Africa. I have been thoroughly impressed.\n\nThis is a first on the continent, and its something that we can easily export to other parts of the continent, and indeed other parts of the global village.\n\nI was saying earlier on that I have been having a look at this site from afarit is very impressive, and what I was saying to Doc (Dr Nguwaya) is that the average Zimbabwean is yet to hear the full story.\n\nWe have seen snippets of it, and thanks to our media, but I think we need the end-to-end story to be told to our people, he said.\n\nDr Nguwaya said the waste management firm is working tirelessly to mop-up waste at illegal dumpsites.\n\nHe said the waste management firm had been collecting considerable amounts of waste from the illegal sites since early last month.\n\nSo far we have done well in terms of waste collection (at illegal dumpsites). If you check our statistics, when we started on 10 February, our statistics have been going up.We are collecting 1 500 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes per day, which is a significant figure, he said.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-harare-water-system-now-on-the-rise/",
            "content": "This week will be marked by those who keep records as the low point in the Harare Metropolitan water supply and the turning point as from now on things can only get better, slowly at first but increasingly more rapidly as the whole mess is sorted out and put on a viable financial and engineering footing.\n\nIt is crucial that the finances are sorted out, so that everyone receiving water from the treatment plants in the province pays for what they actually receive rather than some arbitrary minimum that might never arrive or some estimate that makes zero sense. On the other side, those who simply do not pay bills or who have plumbed in a by-pass around their meter need to join the ranks of those who pay.\n\nThe engineering mess is partly the result of the financial mess, with not enough money spent on maintaining the infrastructure of treatment and distribution of water, lack of funds at times to buy treatment chemicals, and even lack of patches and spare parts to fix faults and leaks. The general disorganisation and corruption at upper levels of the Harare City Council have added to the general malaise, with the often competent technical staff given zero backing and zero resources.\n\nThis has now changed. A new entity has taken over the treatment, distribution and billing of the water, presumably across the whole metropolitan province since this is fed by Harare City Council. Or at least it has taken over de facto even if Harare City Council thinks it still owns and controls everything.\n\nWhy Mayor Jacob Mafume thought that publicly maintaining council ownership was reassuring is difficult to understand, considering the record of his council over the past quarter century as one of the best water systems in Africa, doubled in size in the 1980s after independence, was eroded and almost destroyed and now delivers far less water than the old colonial and far smaller city managed before independence.\n\nThe new system is a joint venture by Government, Harare City and Chinese companies. If it has not already been made a formal entity this should be done, to make it clear who carries the effective control and responsibility.\n\nThe main water works, the Morton Jaffray works near Lake Chivero dam wall, were this week handed over, so that the process of making sure what is still working can continue working while the larger part of the works, now non-operational, is brought back into commission.\n\nMeanwhile, the finances can be sorted. A shipment of 650 000 prepaid meters is on the high seas and due for delivery within weeks.\n\nThis is more than enough to give every household and every business in the metropolitan province its own prepaid meter. Depending on what sort of plumbing staff is lined up, it will take time to connect such a meter for every user, but the sooner we start the better.\n\nWe assume that the meters are sufficiently modern that payment will be easy. What almost everyone wants is the same sort of payment system that Zesa uses, that people can grab their phone at 2am on Sunday morning and buy some water using mobile money or, at least for larger users, online banking.\n\nHarare City Councils bright idea when it was testing prepaid meters some years ago was for people to carry their smart card, assuming they had not lost it, to one of the two city centre offices and stand in a long queue during business hours to have it recharged. That alone made the system wrong.\n\nSecondly, as people are connected to a prepaid meter their rates account must be immediately changed so that the water charges do not appear. This has been possibly the biggest bone of contention for years, that people are expected to pay for water they do not get, or only get as occasionally.\n\nThe lack of a proper financial system at Harare City Council will probably make this harder, but some method must be in place to make sure it is implemented in tandem with the prepaid meter installations.\n\nThirdly, the opportunity should be taken to make sure all flats in a block, and all businesses in a joint premises, have their own individual meters, just as Zesa gives everyone their own individual electricity meter. Shared meters are a disaster and become an even bigger one with prepaid meters.\n\nThese meters should be giving the water entity a decent cash flow, which they will need as they take a very deep breath and rebuild the treatment plants and start the lengthy process of repairing and replacing all sections of the distribution network, the piping, the pumps and the reservoirs. But each extra cubic metre they can treat and deliver without losses increases their cash flow, and so makes more money available.\n\nThe pricing of the water will cause some debate. There is no water regulator, and for a near monopoly there should be one, or at least some independent authority that can look at the financial needs and see what price would be fair for a very efficient provider. Consumers should not be asked to pay for inefficiency and waste.\n\nWe would assume that as leaks are sorted out, or pipe sections replaced if they are totally rotten, and because of the prepaid meters everyone paying for what they get, then the present rates will probably be close to what is needed and any adjustments can be explained and justified.\n\nGuaranteed water supplies 24/7 will make consumers more willing to think about a properly presented charge schedule, especially if the water accounts are properly and regularly audited.\n\nWe doubt that Harare City Council has been spending even the water levies it includes on its rates account on water for some time, considering the other more urgent demands such as fancy cars and foreign holidays for senior staff.\n\nWhoever sets the water rates could take another leaf out of the ZESA book and have a lower rate for the first essential number of units and then increase charges later on.\n\nThat is justified by letting everyone have a small ration of water using the old inherited capital investment.\n\nThere used to be such a system in past, and so it not anything brand new.\n\n",
