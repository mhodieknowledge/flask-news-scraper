            "content": "Wallace Ruzvidzo-Herald Reporter\n\nTackling a myriad of pressing global challenges and resolving conflicts amicably needs fostering a culture of constructive dialogue on the international stage, President Mnangagwa has said.\n\nIn his remarks at a belated New Year reception with heads of diplomatic missions and international organisations accredited to Zimbabwe at State House yesterday, the President said on its part, Zimbabwe stood open for progressive dialogue with all nations.\n\nZimbabwe, he said, continued to position itself as a friend to all and enemy to none, guided by theforeign policy of engagement and re-engagement.\n\nMy Governments foreign policy thrust of engagement and re-engagement has seen responsive policies which harness opportunities and manage divergence. Undoubtedly, the ongoing engagements have opened new frontiers of cooperation and partnerships. I commend you all for your role in advancing this focus area.\n\nTogether, let us do more as we entrench a culture of dialogue in our international relations cooperation frameworks, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa\n\nStill on the issue of dialogue, President Mnangagwa added: Zimbabwe remains open for dialogue aimed at the total removal of illegal sanctions.\n\nThe illegal economic sanctions, coupled with the prevalence of climate change-induced natural disasters and weather phenomenon, are negatively impacting our economy. However, domestic resource mobilisation, Diaspora remittances and inflows of foreign direct investments are augmenting the national fiscus.\n\nOur people and the economy are demonstrating extraordinary resilience, unity of purpose, innovation and resourcefulness, he said.\n\nThe President thanked SADC and other partners for their continued support in calling for the illegal embargoes unequivocal removal.\n\nI extend gratitude to our SADC family and African brothers and sisters for their principled support and solidarity as they amplify calls for the lifting of sanctions.\n\nWe also recognise the support we are receiving from the Group of Friends in Defence of the United Nations Charter, the Like-Minded Group and Non-Aligned Movement, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe reaffirmed Governments commitment to fostering inclusive growth, consolidating democracy and constitutionalism, while ensuring peace and stability for the overall economic prosperity of the general citizenry.\n\nThrough our multifaceted and people-centred development strategies, we are lifting more of our people out of poverty into prosperity. We look forward to journey this exciting path with you and the countries as well as organisations you represent.\n\nTogether, let us navigate the complex challenges affecting our world and the immense opportunities presented before us, he said.\n\nYesterdays gathering of ambassadors and international organisations facilitated closer interaction between the heads of missions and the Government.\n\nAs such, the President rallied them to submit objective and factual reports about Zimbabwe to their countries.\n\nMay you find the satisfaction and pride in taking our relations to a new level. Our doors remain open and arms outstretched as we dialogue and work in harmony towards a shared prosperity and brighter future for our peoples, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nZimbabwe, he said, maintained its stance as a friend to all and enemy to none, emphasising that the country was very much open for business.\n\nWe are open for business, and your nationals are welcome to pursue investments in our mining sector. Further, leveraging our strategic central location in the southern region, we are determined to work with our neighbours and investors to expand and modernise the North-South Corridor to enhance global supply chains and logistics, said the President.\n\nAt the broader international level, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was committed to the protection of multilateralism and upholding the principles of the United Nations Charter, while rallying for support in its bid for a non-permanent United Nations Security Council seat.\n\nThe principles of equality and respect for each others interests should always guide us in our interactions. There are no big or small nations. Zimbabwes candidature for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council for the term 2027 to 2028, has been endorsed by SADC and the African Union.\n\nOur candidacy is deeply rooted in our commitment to global peace and security, an inclusive, fair and equitable international rule-based system, said the President.\n\nHe said the Second Republic was undertaking reforms across the board to ensure the countrys attainment of upper-middle-class economic status by 2030.\n\nThis has resulted in various political, economic and legislative reforms as well as the implementation of a broad array of people-centred projects to guarantee household food security, improve incomes and develop critical enablers to propel the modernisation and industrialisation of our economy.\n\nThe projected recovery in agriculture output is expected to drive economic growth to 6 percent, buoyed by the expected bumper harvest, following a successful summer season, said the President.\n\nHe appraised the diplomats on some of the initiatives being rolled out by Government towards the realisation of national goals.\n\nGovernment introduced the concept of village business units and nutritional gardens. Under the Presidential Drilling Programme, we are drilling boreholes in all our 35 000 villages.\n\nWe, thus, invite your missions to partner these initiatives from the perspective of training and capacity building as well as value addition and sourcing of export markets as we promote market driven productivity.\n\nUnder our agriculture transformation strategy and the village business unit concept, Zimbabwe envisions improved incomes and higher standards of living for our grassroots communities and to also contribute to global food security and nutrition, said the President.\n\nIn mitigating climate change, we are expanding dam construction, water conveyancing and resuscitating irrigation schemes. These initiatives provide scope for further partnerships, cooperation, and investments. The growth of the agriculture sector, as the bedrock of our agriculture-based industry, entails the need for retooling, expansion and diversification of our manufacturing sector. I challenge you, Your Excellencies, in your missions, to promote investments along related value chains.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa acknowledged the role played by the ambassadors in promoting Zimbabwe as a favourable and enjoyable tourist destination.\n\nOur national tourism sector has room for expansion across the provinces of our country I encourage you to scale up the promotion of investments and people to people exchanges between Zimbabwe and your jurisdictions, he said.\n\nAfrica, the SADC region and Zimbabwe, said the President, have re- purposed their development towards the modernisation, value addition, and industrialisation of their economies.\n\nRiding on our abundant natural resources, science, technology and innovation solutions, I exhort your missions to deliberately promote cooperation from your capitals around these aspects, as we create stronger synergies for the Africa we all want.\n\nMeanwhile, my Government looks forward to positive outcomes of engagements with the international community under the arrears clearance and debt resolution process, he said.\n\nOn last years El Nino-induced drought, the President said: The humanitarian aid, technical expertise and moral support received last year, from some of your countries and organisations, following my declaration of the El-Nino induced drought as a national disaster, was timely and greatly appreciated. These acts of kindness remind us of the power of unity in overcoming challenges.\n\nAs the current SADC Chair, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe wouldcontinue promoting innovation to unlock opportunities for sustainable economic growth and development towards an industrialised SADC.\n\nOn the peace and security challenges in the region, particularly in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, he said Zimbabwe, was playing its part through SADC and East African Community initiatives, to find lasting peace.\n\nWe continue to call for an immediate ceasefire and the cessation of hostilities as well as the pursuit of dialogue, as a panacea for sustainable peace and stability in the region. We once again appeal for the provision of humanitarian assistance to the displaced persons from the international community, he said.\n\nOn his part, the Dean of the diplomatic corps, Rwandan Ambassador James Musoni, said they would continue rallying behind President Mnangagwas leadership.\n\n",

Let us not entertain such individuals and should they persist with these ruthless tactics, their actions will be met with appropriate responses.\n\nTransporters, retailers, teachers, miners, business owners and citizens also condemned the protests.\n\nOn Thursday, President Mnangagwa urged everyone to carry out their normal daily activities and ignore calls by some chameleon-like characters threatening to cause chaos in the country.\n\nAs of last week, companies and associations had started sending messages to their members and employees, urging them to disregard the protest calls.\n\nWe have totally nothing to do with that, Zimbabwe Teachers Association (Zimta) secretary-general Goodwill Taderera told The Herald yesterday. We are not a political party. We are law-abiding citizens. If we have our issues, we know where to go. We know that we discuss through the National Joint Negotiating Council.And if we have any issues, thats where we direct them.\n\nHe also stated that it would be business as usual for all teachers across the country.\n\nMonday is a working day so our teachers will be at work.

Zimbabwes economy thrives on stability, investor confidence, and a supportive business environment, all of which are undermined by unrest. While grievances may exist, we strongly encourage engagement between all stakeholders; Government, business, civil society, and concerned groups to find lasting and inclusive solutions, Dr Mutashu said.\n\nHe said the retail and wholesale sector plays a critical role in Zimbabwes economy, ensuring the availability of essential goods and services while supporting thousands of jobs.\n\nOur priority is to maintain an environment where businesses can operate smoothly, securely, and without disruption. We urge all parties to consider the broader impact of protests especially on businesses that provide livelihoods for many Zimbabweans.\n\nThe CZR calls upon organisers and participants of the planned 31 March 2025 protests to consider peaceful, lawful, and constructive avenues for addressing their concerns. We urge stakeholders to come together for dialogue, ensuring that the interests of all Zimbabweans especially workers, consumers, and businesses are protected and prioritised.\n\nZimbabwe Passengers Transport Organisation chairman Dr Samson Nhanhanga assured the people that there will be enough transport .\n\nFor us bus operators, its a working day. Buses will be available at all pickup points in all cities and towns. Buses will also be available in most ranks to transport long distance passengers.\n\nWe are assuring the people of enough transport to take them to their destinations.\n\nWe, therefore, urge the ZRP to ensure all buses are given free passage as well as adequate security from any violent behaviour so as to facilitate continued free movement of people, said Dr Nhanhanga\n\nThe Zimbabwe Miners Federation has issued a circular urging its members to focus on mining and avoiddistractions.\n\nPlease be advised that Monday 31 March 2025 is a normal working day.

It shall be business as usual, he said.\n\nInformal traders also added their voice saying it will be business as usual and would never take part in activities that disturb business.\n\nChairperson of traders operating at Glen View Complex Mr Tawanda Utete said it will be business as usual at one of Harares biggest informal trading hub.\n\nAccording to Mr Utete, there are more than 2 500 informal traders operating at Glen View Area 8 Complex.\n\nAs traders at Glen View 8 Complex, we will never join such protests and it will be business as usual.\n\nThere are many families that depend on proceeds from various businesses that are being undertaken at Glen View 8 Complex and we cannot allow such illegal activities to disturb the livelihoods of people, he said.\n\nYouth economic empowerment group Boys DzaMdhara also weighed in urging the public, especially youths, not to be lured by rogue individuals bent on derailing President Mnangagwas economic vision.\n\nZimbabwe is a peace loving nation, whose focus is currently on nation building and nation building alone.\n\nWe urge the public not to be lured into demonstrating by rogue individuals whose aim is to destabilise our peace, rob us of our time and focus towards nation building and growth of our nation.\n\nThese are the same individuals that never lead from the front.\n\nNational Judicial Council of Vapositori added its voice in denouncing the perceived protests urging various church denominations to report any acts that violates public order.\n\nPlease may you report any activity that contravenes the public order of your communities, said National Judicial Council of Vapostori national director Madzibaba Obey Mapuranga.\n\nAny public misconduct, gang activities, hotspots of organised illegal demonstrations and stocking of prohibited weapons or petrol should be reported to the nearest police station.\n\nOur religious counter measures should be solidified with swift real-time observations, surveillance, protection and detection against the ungodly planned 31 March demonstration, said Madzibaba Obey.\n\nMeanwhile, ZRP has launched an investigation into a series of burning down of vehicles that occurred at business premises in Avondale, Highlands, Newlands and Goromonzi early morning on Friday.\n\nIn a statement, national police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the incidents took place yesterday between midnight and 4am.\n\nHe said the vehicles were set on fire using petrol while in motion.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police has received reports of petrol-instigated burning of moving vehicles at business premises in Avondale, Highlands, Newlands and Goromonzi on 28 March between midnight and 4 am.\n\nThis was done by suspects who were driving the vehicles.

He expressed his happiness at witnessing firsthand the developments taking place in Gokwe.\n\nI have seen a lot of progress and am sure by the time we hold the celebrations, we need to keep the momentum because where there are no roads, there is no development. We need to maintain our roads. Development is not just about cities; it is about rural areas where we get most of our votes. To the team on the ground, I want to say well done. We are learning new things every day. I have the feeling that this is going to be more polished. We are impressed, he said.\n\nVP Mohadi noted that decentralising the countrys main events was bearing fruit, with all corners of the country set to witness similar developments.\n\nThis is in line with our Presidents vision of leaving no one and no place behind. The developments we are witnessing in Gokwe are just amazing, he said.\n\nMinister of Information, Publicity, and Broadcasting Services Dr Jenfan Muswere stated that the government had lined up a number of programs to ensure that the event receives enough publicity.\n\nWe have come up with a sound communication strategy to publicize the event.

            "content": "Tendai Rupapa in CHIPINGE\n\nTHOUSANDS of people in Manicaland province, yesterday received free cancer screening services, eyesight checks as well as tests for other non-communicable diseases like hypertension and diabetes courtesy of health Ambassador First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwas drive towards a healthy nation.\n\nWith the assistance of practitioners from the Ministry of Health and Child Care, the First Lady availed her fully-equipped Angel of Hope Foundations mobile hospital and mobile clinic to ensure beneficiaries were screened for cervical, breast and prostate cancers, hypertension, diabetes, and HIV and provided with family planning services.\n\nThere were other supporting tents serving people.\n\nAmai Mnangagwa held discussions with school learners from primary to high school pupils on the dangers of early sexual relations and the need for them to remain in school for a brighter future.\n\nIt was surprising and concerning to learn that younger pupils as young as grade one have in-depth knowledge about sexual intercourse which is inappropriate for their age.\n\nAsked by Amai Mnangagwa how they knew about all this in detail, the children pointed at social media saying that is where they see explicit content.\n\nOthers said it was through peer influence from their peers, who share experiences.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa is hugged by school girls who could not hide their excitement at meeting her in person in Chipinge yesterday\n\nA Grade Six learner told the First Lady that there were girls from the primary school level who were already bedding men owing to a quest for money.\n\nWhats your message to them, the First Lady asked and the young girl said: Our time will come and let us not rush to do things that are not of our ages. Sexual relations are not for young people. What if you fall pregnant? If you drop out of school, what will your future be like? Are you not afraid of sexually transmitted diseases? Let us focus on our studies.\n\nShe thanked Amai for her teachings.\n\nThose who have ears have heard what our mother has said, she said to applause.\n\nThe open communication the First Lady had with the learners ensured they understood the context and implications of sexual intercourse before the time was right.\n\nDr Mnangagwa came across a pregnant under-aged girl.\n\nShe told her that she eloped with a 25-year-old man at the age of 15 while she was in grade seven.\n\nAmai was so touched but she reprimanded her for getting pregnant at such a tender age when she was supposed to be in school. However, she urged her to always go for antenatal checks to ensure she delivered well.\n\nThe Mother of the Nation also held an interactive session with members of the community tackling thorny issues like drug and substance abuse and early child marriages.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa listens attentively to a girl as she distributed sanitary pads and books to school children in Chipinge yesterday.Pictures: John Manzongo.\n\nLearners were given stationery, while girls also received sanitary pads, courtesy of the First Lady who pledged to donate sewing machines to the province for the girls to sew reusable pads.\n\nPregnant women also received baby preparation kits.\n\nDr Mnangagwa commended women and men for prioritising their health by coming for health checks including cancer screening and encouraged them to use all the mobile medical facilities.\n\nShe also rallied them to get tested for HIV.\n\nThe First Lady was delighted after seeing pregnant women being tested for HIV saying HIV testing during pregnancy is crucial for preventing mother-to-child transmission because it allows for timely access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for both the mother and infant, significantly reducing the risk of transmission.\n\nAmai Mnangagwa is leading the fight against non-communicable diseases which are afflicting and claiming millions of lives across the globe.\n\nPeople of various age groups received checks for various ailments to save lives because if treated early, the chances of survival for many diseases are high.\n\nTodays programme is different from the one we had yesterday as I have come focusing on health including cancer screening. The world over, Zimbabwe included, cancer is a leading cause of death. If you are diagnosed early and placed on treatment early, it can be treated. It is critical to get screened for cervical, breast and prostate cancer.\n\nA senior police woman distributes sanitary pads donated by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa to school girls in Chipinge yesterday.\n\nThere is also HPV which causes cancer especially, among children who are sexually active. Young children must desist from engaging in sexual affairs before the time is ripe, but instead value their education, she said.\n\nWhat are the dangers associated with having sexual intercourse at a tender age? the First Lady asked.\n\nSchoolgirls replied pointing at sexually transmitted infections, pregnancies and dropping out of school.\n\nDr Mnangagwa urged schoolchildren to learn to say no to any man or boy who comes with sexual advances.\n\nShe also spoke against drug and substance abuse, especially among youths. She advised people to use her 575 toll-free line and report such cases.\n\nAmai Mnangagwa further urged people to consume healthy traditional food to keep fit.\n\nManicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Advocate Misheck Mugadza praised the First Lady for bringing health services to the people.\n\nAmai has brought a hospital and a clinic at our doorsteps, state-of-the-art medical facilities. The First Lady initiated this programme for us to get early treatment if found with any ailment. This is in a bid to prevent unnecessary loss of lives. Let us all make use of this platform to get screened for diseases. I would like to urge men to also prioritise their health by undergoing medical health checks. Research shows men are lagging, he said.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa is assisted by the Member of Parliament who is also Deputy Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Angeline Gata in distributing books to school children in Chipinge yesterday.\n\nDeputy Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Cde Angeline Gata who is also the legislator for Mutema-Musikavanhu Constituency praised the First Lady for her benevolence.\n\nThank you, Amai for what you have done. We have what we call menstruation poverty so Amai what you have done, giving these girls pads will go a long way in alleviating period poverty among some of these girls. Some girls fail to attend school owing to lack of sanitary ware, which disturbs their studies, she said.\n\nSpeaking at the same occasion, a National Aids Council representative showered praises on the First Lady.\n\nWe would like to thank Amai for her women-centric programmes, especially with regards to health. On HIV and AIDS we managed to reach the 95-95-95 target. We have achieved what is called epidemic control. Im happy to see pregnant women being tested for HIV. As a country, we want to eliminate Mother-to-child transmission. As NAC we urge everyone to get tested for HIV. Women, also rally your husbands to get tested for HIV, he said.\n\nFirst Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa hands over new born baby preparation kits to a visually impaired expecting mother in Chipinge yesterday.\n\nManicaland Provincial Medical Director, Dr Munyaradzi Mukuzunga, said medical outreach programmes were beneficial to the people and praised the First Lady for her thoughtfulness.\n\nWe wish to thank the First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa for bringing the outreach here at Maunganidze in Chipinge District. We have women who have benefited by being screened for cervical cancer and mammography screening for breast cancer. People are also having eyesight examinations, hypertension and other ailments and are being attended to and given medication.\n\nWe have doctors and many nurses who are attending to the people. Some pregnant women were also being attended to as well as being given teachings on what to eat and how to care for themselves. We thank the First Lady verily for her programme. Being tested for HIV is critical because here in Zimbabwe we have what we call triple elimination which seeks to end syphilis, HIV and Hepatitis B so that all children born in Zimbabwe will be free of HIV, free of syphilis and free of Hepatitis B. Women who are pregnant and those who are breastfeeding need to be continuously tested for these ailments so that they do not spread to the children. We want an HIV free generation. These medical outreach programmes are critical because there are some services that are largely not available all the time like at some clinics there will be no dental services but on outreaches we will have such services.

We had grown accustomed to missing school during our monthly cycles but our mother has brought us sanitary pads which help us restore our confidence, said an upper primary school learner at the event.\n\nGogo Marian Timburwa (70) thanked the First Lady for letting her know where she stands health-wise.\n\nA medical Doctor examines a school boy during a free medical outreach organised by Health Ambassador First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa in Chipinge yesterday.\n\nI am so happy that today I have been screened for breast and cervical cancer free of charge because of our mothers love.

May God bless her for her deep love, she said.\n\nEqually happy was Mrs Cynthia Bande who received a baby preparation kit from the mother of the nation.\n\nI want to thank the First Lady for what she has done for us today. Apart from letting us be tested, she gave us baby preparation kits. I had nowhere to start from and I am thankful for her double gift, she said.\n\nBulawayo-based Arts group IYASA provided edutainment.\n\nIyasa drama and dance group perform a drama depicting the effects and dangers of drugs and substance abuse among youths and old at a free medical outreach by Angel of Hope Foundation in Chipinge yesterday.\n\n",

We are prepared to share knowledge and expertise and we will be glad if Zimbabwe can suggest practical steps for operationalising the MOU, he said.\n\nMr Whan also added that the Republic of Koreas efforts had improved its Corruption Perception Index ranking to 30th out of 180 countries in 2024.\n\nZACC chairperson Mr Michael Reza said this collaboration will enable the Zimbabwean commission to adopt and adapt proven mechanisms like the integrity assessment and corruption risk assessment and work towards institutionalising integrity training for all public officials.\n\nZimbabwe has been doing integrity pledges and integrity committees and will consider expanding the programme to incorporate trainings, he said.\n\nThe ACRCs corruption risk assessment mechanism will be an excellent model for Zimbabwe. This systematic approach allows for the identification of corruption risks within public administration processes.\n\nThe Republic of Korea has a strong legal framework which includes the Anti-Graft Act, Conflict of Interest Prevention Act, Public Fund Recovery Act, Code of Conduct for Public Officials, which seeks to prohibit bribery and improper solicitation and the Public Interest Whistleblower Protection Act.\n\nThese laws set behavioural rules for public officials. Zimbabwe and Korea have enjoyed warm and cordial bilateral relations for the past 31 years. The two countries have exchanged high-level visits, including by President Emmerson Mnangagwa who visited Seoul in June last year when he attended the Korea-Africa Summit and held bilateral discussions with the President of the Republic of Korea HE Mr Yoon Suk Yeol, where five agreements spanning trade, aviation, agriculture, and private-sector collaboration were sealed. The new MOU was spearheaded by Zimbabwes Ambassador to Republic of Korea, Ambassador Stewart Nyakotyo, resident in Japan, when he met the ACRC chairperson.\n\nAmbassador Nyakotyo said the MOU is an important milestone in the deepening of bilateral relations between Zimbabwe and Korea.\n\nIt will assist in the strengthening of international partnerships in line with the foreign policy mantra pronouncement by President Mnangagwa, that Zimbabwe is a friend to all and an enemy to none.\n\nThe objectives of the MoU will assist Zimbabwe in the attainment of National Development Strategy goals and those of the soon-to-be-produced NDS2.\n\n",

            "content": "SOME sweet news filtered in for Zimbabwes cricket enthusiasts and the countrys sporting family at large on Thursday.\n\nThis came after Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) secured confirmation from the International Cricket Council that neighbours South Africa will be ending their long hiatus from touring this nation for a Test series and will be at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo for a two-Test Series in June and July.\n\nSimilarly, the Chevrons have also had a rare Test Series against New Zealands Black Caps being lined up for the end of July into early August at Harare Sports Club.\n\nAnd this is no April Fools Day prank.\n\nThe Test Series against some of the games heavyweights will also be spiced by the Twenty 20 International tri-series matches against both the Proteas and the Black Caps also scheduled for Harare Sports Club.\n\nZC managing director Givemore Makoni aptly captured the feeling that greeted the confirmation of the two teams tour when he said: This is the biggest international home season we have had in years and it is an incredible opportunity for our players to test themselves against two of the worlds cricketing powerhouses.\n\nIt is the coming back of the Proteas to this country in particular that has both the Chevrons and their growing legion of fans already savouring the moment and generating a lot of excitement.\n\nDespite South Africa being neighbours and the closest geographically that Zimbabwe have among all the worlds Test Nations, matches between the Chevrons and the Proteas have been few and far between.\n\nTo put into context, the Proteas were last in this country 11 years ago and Harare Sports Club was the site of that Test match in which the South Africans powered to a nine-wicket victory.\n\nA lot has no doubt changed between then and now.\n\nWe, however, urge Makoni, his management team, the ZC board and the Chevrons to seize the moment and make the most of the upcoming tours.\n\nTo their eternal credit, ZC have ensured that cricket has been among the leading sporting disciplines in the country and the fact that with each outing either at Queens Sports Club or Harare Sports have attracted more and more fans.\n\nImages of drum-beating Zimbabwean fans clad in orange or red overalls have captured global attention in the cricket arena.\n\nOn the business side, the more the Chevrons host Test matches, the more they contribute to sport tourism coffers.\n\nSeeing their international idols in action right on their doorsteps will no doubt inspire budding cricketers to pursue the sport at a professional level.\n\nEvery young athlete needs a level to aspire for and nothing beats competing on the global stage, thus paying their way at Queens or Harare Sports Clubs, to watch from the front row as the likes of Temba Bavuma, Lungi Ngidi, Lizaad Williams, Quinto de Kock compete.\n\nIt also a huge inspiration for the fans and the players to see their very own Sikandar Raza, Craig Ervine, Sean Williams, Blessing Muzarabani, Richard Ngarava, Wessly Madhevere, Ryan Burl, Tendai Chatara, Brian Bennett, and Johnathan Campbell shine on home soil against those global superstars.\n\nRefreshingly it is not lost on ZC that hosting South Africa and New Zealand for both Test cricket and an exciting T20I tri-series is a fantastic development for the growth of the game in Zimbabwe.\n\nSouth Africa and Zimbabwe have faced each other in nine Test matches but we believe that building on the 2025 tour that statistic can be boosted and built into more frequent meetings.\n\nThe Chevrons would, however, have to also play their art and become a consistent performer on the Test Arena.\n\nThey have done it before and Craig Ervines generation owe it to all those who have believed and are believing in Zimbabwe.\n\nAnd in the upcoming Test, Zimbabwe could make it their maiden win against the South Africans who have won eight of the previous nine meetings while the other ended in a draw.\n\nTest cricket continues to define the fabled gentlemans game and while the Chevrons have often held their own in One Day internationals and the T20 assignments, it is in the long format that they need to reassert themselves.\n\nAt least in the ODIs the two sides have met on 41 occasions with South Africa winning 38 matches of those meetings.\n\nZimbabwe won two matches with a single match ending in a no result.\n\nIn the short version of white ball cricket, the two countries have met a total of six times, with South Africa winning five matches while the other failed to produce a result.\n\nThe Chevrons can atone for that in the coming tri-series which will also involve the Black Caps.\n\nWith Zimbabwe and South Africa being the only two ICC full member states in Africa much is expected between the two sides in steering the development of the sport on the continent\n\nThe acceptance by South Africa to play Zimbabwe at home is a sign of cordial relationship which is needed between the countries as the continent looks upon them to lead the way.\n\nAnd with South Africa attracting some international players to their domestic league, the tour will play a part for South African franchises owners to have a closer look at Zimbabwe players which could benefit our local players to get opportunities to play in their Premier League and get the much-required exposure.\n\n",
