New UN-verified data also reveals a 30 percent rise in grave violations against children in eastern DRC compared to 2023.\n\n",

            "content": "Mukudzei Chingwere-Herald Reporter\n\nZIMBABWE is keen to strengthen ties with Russia and pursue membership in the BRICS group of emerging economies and its associated international development bank, Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Professor Amon Murwira, has said.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, Russia, on Thursday, Prof Murwira said joining the BRICS economic grouping was not just about political alignment, but enhancing economic growth and development.\n\nBRICS is an economic bloc founded by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, who sought to provide an alternative economic order against the status quo which is skewed in favour of the United States and its political allies, to the detriment of the rest of the world.\n\nIn August 2023, President Mnangagwa participated at the BRICS 15th Heads of State and Government Summit in Johannesburg, where he was represented by Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga, as Zimbabwe formally presented its credentials to join leading economies in the emerging global order for the development of its economy.\n\nAfter the meeting with his Russian counterpart, Prof Murwira spoke about the significance of Zimbabwes potential inclusion in BRICS and the BRICS Bank.\n\nYesterday (Thursday), we discussed about joining economic groupings and one of the economic groupings is BRICS, which is basically made up of the Russian Federation, India, China, Brazil, South Africa, plus other countries that have recently joined, he said.\n\nWe believe that for Zimbabwe to grow, it needs to be in a grouping of countries that trade together, because trade grows economies.\n\nWe are actually taking steps to join BRICS under the direction of President Mnangagwa. So we are on the way to do that and we are doing that in order to grow our economy.\n\nProf Murwira said Zimbabwes Constitution demanded that the country should not only be Pan-African, but must join progressive groups that are good for the socio-economic growth of the nation while promoting peace in the world.\n\nPeace is fostered through economic development and BRICS is one of those groupings which Zimbabwe wishes to be part of.\n\nSo, what we have done with the Russian Federation and many other countries is to coalesce around the idea of growing capabilities, and this comes through education, innovation, science, and technology, he said.\n\nProf Murwira outlined the Governments commitment to economic diplomacy, which seeks to secure trade partnerships and foster local production.\n\nHe elaborated on initiatives such as partnerships in education and technology with Russia.\n\nZimbabwe has applied to join BRICS and the BRICS Bank at a time President Mnangagwa has championed rapid economic growth anchored on infrastructure development and a strong private sector participation.\n\nAll these developments have been achieved using locally mobilised resources as Zimbabwe continues to grapple with the effects of illegal financial sanctions imposed by the US and its Western allies at the turn of the century.\n\nJoining the BRICS Bank head-quarted in Shanghai in China will thus give Zimbabwe the much-needed fillip in its economic development plans as the bank was primarily established by BRICS for the purpose of mobilising resources for infrastructure and sustainable development in emerging markets and developing countries.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa is on record as saying that after applying to join the BRICS Bank, the next stage would be to seek to go beyond the bank and join the grouping.\n\nIt will be an opportune leap for Zimbabwes economic development quest as the groupings global influence continues to grow, with over 40 countries having applied to join the group that already accounts for at least 25 percent of the global economy.\n\n",

Equality. Empowerment.\n\nSen Mutsvangwa said the Government remained committed to empowering women through various initiatives, leaving no one and no place behind.\n\nGovernment recognises that women and girls continue to face significant barriers to achieving their full potential, she said.\n\nFrom discriminatory laws and policies to societal norms and stereotypes, women and girls are often marginalised, excluded, and silenced.\n\nHowever, we also acknowledge the incredible progress that has been made towards achieving gender equality, and we celebrate the courage, resilience and determination of women and girls who are driving this change.\n\nSen Mutsvangwa said Zimbabwe had made significant strides in promoting womens rights and empowerment.\n\nOur Constitution guarantees equal rights for women and men and we have implemented various policies and programmes aimed at promoting gender equality.\n\nHowever, despite these efforts,women and girls in Zimbabwe continue to face significant challenges, including limited access to education, healthcare and economic opportunities, she said.\n\nSen Mutsvangwa said Government recognises that empowering women is not just a moral obligation but a strategic necessity to combat poverty, illiteracy, hunger and malnutrition.\n\nGovernment has made significant strides in ensuring rural women are equipped to conquer adversity.\n\nThrough my ministry, Government is relentlessly providing awareness and training to women on climate change mitigation and adaptation, which is pivotal in fortifying resilience.\n\nWe are tirelessly collaborating with development partners to amplify womens access to renewable energy sources, liberating them from hazardous traditional cooking methods that endanger family health, she said.\n\nThe Minister passionately highlighted how solar-powered boreholes and irrigation schemes have revolutionised livelihoods, while menstrual health training and reusable sanitary wear production have uplifted over 2 000 rural women and girls this year alone.\n\nWe will not rest until every community can reliably supply the much-needed sanitary wear, ensuring no girl is left behind, she declared.\n\nMinister Mutsvangwa expounded on financial empowerment, detailing how microfinance facilities established in collaboration with development partners and financial institutions are transforming lives.\n\nThrough the Zimbabwe Women Development Fund, Community Development Fund, Womens Micro Finance Bank, and SMEDCO funding facilities, we provide affordable loans to women, enabling them to become formidable entrepreneurs who drive economic growth, she proclaimed.\n\nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator, Mr Edward Kallon, praised the nations monumental progress, urging unwavering dedication to the cause.\n\nInternational Womens Day is a clarion call to uphold the dignity and rights of women and girls worldwide.\n\nThe UN stands shoulder to shoulder with Zimbabwe, committed to reversing the regression in womens rights and forging a path to true gender equality, he said.\n\nSwedish Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Per Lindgrde, who was representing European Union nations, lauded Zimbabwes relentless pursuit of gender equality, acknowledging the nations progress while emphasising the need for sustained momentum.\n\nToday is not just a celebration, it is a call to action. Zimbabwes Constitution enshrines gender equality, the Education Act ensures pregnant girls remain in school and the Marriage Act protects vulnerable girls.\n\nYet, the scourge of gender-based violence persists, with one in three women affected. We must unite to obliterate this injustice, he affirmed, reinforcing the EUs resolute support through the Team Europe initiative.\n\nAmbassador Lindgrde said the EU has funded many initiatives in Zimbabwe that have significantly contributed to improving the lives of women and girls.\n\nThese initiatives have supported projects aimed at enhancing access to quality education, promoting womens economic empowerment through small and medium enterprises, and strengthening healthcare services in rural areas, he said.\n\nHe also stressed that the EU remains committed to working with the Government of Zimbabwe to create sustainable opportunities for women, protect their rights, and eliminate gender-based violence.\n\nThrough the Team Europe initiative, the EU has consistently championed gender equality, funding programs that equip women with essential skills, provide start-up capital for income-generating activities, and ensure that vulnerable communities receive the necessary support to thrive, he said.\n\nMinister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Advocate Misheck Mugadza, extolled the indomitable spirit and achievements of women in the province.\n\nWomen constitute approximately 1 035 000 of Manicalands population, and their resilience is unparalleled. Our province has produced trailblazing leaders like Minister Oppah Muchinguri and Minister Monica Mutsvangwa.\n\nManicaland stands as an unyielding pillar of womens empowerment, with girls schools shattering records and achieving historic milestones, he said with pride.\n\nAdv Mugadza applauded transformative local projects spearheaded by President Mnangagwa, including the Chikanga Mushroom Project in Mutare, Jopa Market in Chimanimani, and Cynara Dairy in Mutasa.\n\nThese visionary initiatives have equipped women to ascend as innovators and captains of industry, catalysing community transformation, he added.\n\nInternational Womens Day has been observed since the early 1900s  a time of great expansion and turbulence in the industrialised world that saw booming population growth and the rise of radical ideologies.\n\n",

            "content": "Nqobile Bhebhe-Bulawayo Bureau\n\nGLOBAL modernisation cannot proceed without the full participation of Africa, as the continents stability and development are fundamental to the future of humanity, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said yesterday as he urged the world to actively listen to Africa and respond to its concerns.\n\nUnder the guidance of President Xi Jinping and African leaders, the China-Africa relationship has reached its zenith.\n\nWithin the past three years alone, Chinese enterprises have generated over 1,1 million new jobs across Africa, Minister Wang revealed.\n\nMinister Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, stated that China has forged strategic partnerships with every African nation with which it maintains diplomatic ties.\n\nMinister Wang made the remarks during a meeting with Chinese and international journalists on Chinas foreign policy and external relations, held yesterday during the third session of the 14th National Peoples Congress.\n\nHe reiterated that China and Africa have always been steadfast friends, reliable partners, and close brothers, sharing a common destiny.\n\nUnder the guidance of President Xi Jinping and African leaders, China-Africa relationship is now at its best in history. China has established strategic partnership with all African countries having diplomatic ties with it. The China-Africa community with a shared future has been elevated to an all-weather level.\n\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of FOCAC. Over the past 25 years, China has helped Africa build or upgrade nearly 100 000 kilometres of roads and more than 10 000 kilometres of railways. In the past three years alone, Chinese enterprises created more than 1,1 million new jobs in Africa. China has remained Africas largest trade partner for 16 consecutive years. To African brothers and sisters, China-Africa cooperation is visible, tangible and truly beneficial, he said.\n\nMinister Wang further noted that Africa represents a fertile ground of hope for the 21st century.\n\nThere will be no global modernisation without African modernisation. The stability and development of Africa is vital to the future of humanity, and the world must listen to Africa and heed its concerns. Africa is going through a new awakening, and countries should support Africa in exploring a new development path of self-reliance and self-strengthening, he said.\n\nThe relationship between China and Zimbabwe has deep historical roots, dating back to the liberation struggle of the 1960s, during which Beijing provided crucial military support. This partnership deepened in the early 2000s when Western sanctions were imposed on Zimbabwe, leading China to remain a steadfast ally and a significant trade partner.\n\nUnder President Mnangagwas leadership, trade between Zimbabwe and China has experienced substantial growth, driven by engagement and re-engagement initiatives. China has invested billions in Zimbabwe, particularly in the mining and manufacturing sectors. Notable projects include the US$3,6 billion Palm River Energy Metallurgical Special Economic Zone in Beitbridge, developed in collaboration with a Chinese mining company, and the US$1, 5 billion Dinson Iron and Steel Company project in Manhize.\n\nOther key investments encompass the Afrochine ferrochrome smelters and lithium mining projects through Sinomine Resources, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, and Chengxin Lithium Group.\n\nChina has also supported significant infrastructure projects in Zimbabwe, such as the Hwange Thermal Power Station Units 7 and 8 (US$997 million), Kariba South Hydro Power Station (US$533 million), the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport expansion (US$152 million), and the Victoria Falls Airport upgrade (US$150 million).\n\nIn addition to infrastructure, China has contributed to national development projects, including funding the new Parliament building in Mt Hampden through a US$140 million grant.\n\nThe two nations have also collaborated in health and agriculture, with China providing substantial support during the Covid-19 pandemic and assisting Zimbabwes modernisation efforts through initiatives such as borehole drilling. These robust bilateral ties have solidified Chinas position as Zimbabwes all-weather friend, delivering tangible benefits across numerous sectors and aligning with Zimbabwes Vision 2030 modernisation and industrialisation goals.\n\n",

Cde Patrick Chinamasa, the Secretary for Legal Affairs, clarified the rationale behind this rule.\n\nThis is not an accusation but a housekeeping issue meant to give fresh blood an opportunity to contest in that particular constituency, he said.\n\nCde Chinamasa further explained that while candidates may seek opportunities in other constituencies, they must give way to newcomers in the constituency they previouslycontested.\n\nIt has nothing to do with whether you are good or a bad person, he added, highlighting the partys focus on fostering new leadership.\n\n",

            "content": "SO, the Zimbabwe senior soccer side, the Warriors, will get back into business for the first time this year when they resume their FIFA 2026 World Cup qualification bid.\n\nThey were last in action in November last year when they sealed their place at the 2025 CAF Africa Cup of Nations which is scheduled for Morocco.\n\nIt will be the sixth time that Zimbabwe would be lining up alongside Africas top teams for the jamboree that will run in the North African country in December and into early January.\n\nBut before German coach Michael Nees and his Warriors can shift their attention to trying to become the first class of Warriors to proceed beyond the group stage at the Nations Cup, they have some World Cup qualification bid to dispense with.\n\nZimbabwe are bottom of Group C in the race for the expanded 48-team World Cup scheduled to be co-hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States.\n\nSo, in 12 days time, Nees will take charge of his first Warriors World Cup assignment as the German coach was not in charge when Zimbabwe got off to a horrible start, managing just two points from their opening four games and under two different coaches\n\nIt will also be the first time that Nees will be playing under the Zimbabwe Football Associations first elected executive committee as the German was brought on board by the Normalisation Committee, which was in charge of the association for over a year.\n\nWhile Normalisation Committee chairman Lincoln Mutasa and his colleagues  Rosemary Mugadza and Nyasha Sanyamandwe  may have set off into the sun after completing their mandate, the script has remained the same for the Warriors, which is to try and qualify for the World Cup and do better than previous appearances at AFCON.\n\nNow, ZIFA are under the guidance of Nqobile Magwizi and his 10 colleagues.\n\nRefreshingly, Magwizi and his team have come up with an approach to ensure that all national teams, whether it is the womens juniors, or the CAF schools, are given equal attention and resources to achieve their goals.\n\nWhile we commend the ZIFA approach, which immediately came to life during the Mighty Warriors Women Africa Cup of Nations, whom they afforded all the resources they needed for the qualifier against Angola, we believe that the association alone should not be left to fend for the national teams.\n\nIn Nees, we have found a professional whose approach and work ethic has reportedly charmed players, fellow coaches, the ZIFA secretariat and executive committee.\n\nAs we reported in this publication, the quest to qualify for the World Cup is not and should not be just left on the door steps of the ZIFA headquarters on Number 66 Bishop Gaul Avenue in Harares Milton Park suburb.\n\nInstead, it should be a challenge to the whole nation to rally behind this team which is so long on potential.\n\nFor any team to succeed, a lot is put into the organisation in the build-up to an assignment.\n\nOf course the lack of an approved home stadium remains a worry for the Warriors who, like any football or sporting team, thrive on having a full house backing them.\n\nBut ZIFA have made plans to stage the World Cup assignment against Benin at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on March 20 before the Warriors travel to Uyo in Nigeria to face the Super Eagles.\n\nThe coach has been hard at work assessing all the players before deciding which manpower he can assemble for the upcoming games.\n\nMore importantly is the need for corporates, the Government and individual well-wishers to chip in and help make the organisation of the Warriors assignments a success.\n\nWhile they might be anchoring their long table with two points and five shy of joint leaders Rwanda, South Africa and Benin, all hope is not yet lost as there is still plenty to play for the Warriors.\n\nThey still have more matches against South Africa, Lesotho and the two assignments against Benin at home and away.\n\nNees believes that staying focussed and being adequately prepared and with the right organisation, Zimbabwe can turn things around.\n\nNow the ball is in the court of this nation to ensure the German expatriate is helped to make his job of motivating the Warriors, organising them tactically and inspiring them, an achievable task.\n\nTwo good results against Benin and Nigeria could turn the tide in Zimbabwes favour and the Warriors need to be in the best frame of mind when they tackle the assignments.\n\nThe players travel from their respective bases to around the continent for assignments has to be made smooth and less tiresome in order for them to give coach Nees the best return on the pitch.\n\nAs such, we strongly believe that corporates and individuals can chip in on such tasks like provision of accommodation and the smooth travel for the qualifiers.\n\nFIFA showed the way when they took full charge of ZIFAs welfare during the reign of the Normalisation Committee.\n\nNow Magwizi and crew cannot afford to drop the ball.\n\nInstead, it is now for all concerned football stakeholders and sponsors to come to the party and guarantee a continuation of the good times that were all enjoyed when the Warriors travelled to Uganda, Huye in Rwanda and South Africa for their assignments under the FIFA-assisted and appointed Normalisation Committee.\n\nThe Warriors need support from the terraces, from the corporate and Government corridors and from the engaged support services and just probably, the whole nation could be smiling and celebrating another triumph at the end of the qualifying campaign.\n\nIt may be a tough task indeed, but it certainly is not insurmountable.\n\n",
