The speculation surrounding its alleged sale had caused concern among depositors, prompting the central bank to set the record straight.\n\nAuthorities have cautioned the public against spreading unverified information that could cause unnecessary panic in the financial sector.\n\nWhile the Government has, in the past, expressed intentions to partially privatize some state-owned enterprises as part of economic reforms, there has been no official indication that POSB is on the immediate list for privatization.\n\nPOSB depositors can rest assured that the bank remains under state ownership, with the central bank reaffirming that no sale has taken place or is in the process.\n\n",

The President has opened the doors, its up to the youth to walk through them.\n\nAnother youth, Mr Addington Mpofu, said the Second Republic has done extremely well in empowering young people and making sure they become drivers of the economy and critical party of the mainstream economy.\n\nIf you look at the agriculture sector, we have seen young people now participating and Zimbabwe is now one of the very few countries that have the highest number of young people in the agriculture sector, said Mr Mpofu.\n\nIf you go to the mining sector, most of the people there are young people, traditionally mining is an old sector but now its being run by youth.\n\nThe President has been very instrumental in making sure that young people are the drivers of the economy and if you look at our ministers now, most of them are young capable people who are in key strategic ministries.\n\nZanu PF Bulawayo provincial spokesperson Cde Archie Chiponda said Zimbabwe is blessed to be endowed with hardworking and highly intelligent youths who have shown the ability to adapt to any economic environment.\n\nThe issue of reserved sectors for indigenous needs to be implemented effectively as those sectors are the sectors in which we would naturally see a high amount of youth participation, said Cde Chiponda.\n\n",

            "content": "Columbus Mabika-Herald Reporter\n\nPolitical commentators yesterday said the removal of Zimbabwe Defense Industries (ZDI) from the sanctions list by the European Union (EU) is a sign of acknowledgement by the West that sanctions were wicked and malicious, while it is also a step towards the universal removal of the embargo.\n\nThe EU on Wednesday delisted the ZDI from the restrictive measures imposed in 2002 but maintained an embargo on arms and equipment.\n\n(EU) Council renews restrictive measures framework and delists one entity. The Council today renewed its framework for restrictive measures in view of the situation in Zimbabwe for a further year, until 20 February 2026. The Council also delisted the last remaining entity, the Zimbabwe Defence Industries. The embargo on arms and equipment . . . remains in place, the EU said.\n\nThe development comes as the SADC region and the African continent at large have joined the long growing band of calls for sanctions which have caused untold suffering on the Zimbabwean populace and hampered economic development to be removed.\n\nFormer legislator and National Peace and Reconciliation Commissioner Mr Obert Gutu said the removal was positive but universal removal of sanctions should be immediate.\n\nBy removing the Zimbabwe Defence Industries from the illegal, punitive and ruinous sanctions list, the EU is simply acknowledging the fact that these sanctions were wicked and malicious in the very first place and also that theyre no longer serving any purpose, he said.\n\nRight from the outset there was absolutely no legal justification to place the ZDI under these malevolent sanctions, the whole idea was to punish Zimbabwe for the revolutionary land reform programme that is irreversible and that Zimbabwes sovereignty is not for sale.\n\nFundamentally, Mr Gutu said these illegal sanctions were simply meant to make Zimbabwes economy scream with the aim of collapsing the national economy.\n\nThe removal of ZDI from the sanctions, he said, will enable the company to trade normally and also be able to easily access modern technology in the armaments industry.\n\nHe said this will definitely make the ZDI more efficient, competitive and more profitable.\n\nAnother political analyst, Dr Tongai Dana concurred saying the EU decision to remove ZDI from the sanctions list marks a significant milestone, not just for the defence sector but for the broader national economy.\n\nThis move signals a shift towards re-engagement, opening doors for economic expansion, industrial growth, and enhanced national security. While challenges remain, this development offers Zimbabwe an opportunity to reclaim its place in the global defence and economic landscape, fostering resilience and self-sufficiency in the face of restrictions, he said.\n\nHe said the development signals the possibility of re-engagement.\n\nThis move sits at the intersection of realism, where strategic interests dictate foreign policy, and constructivism, which acknowledges that international relations are shaped by evolving norms and diplomatic recalibration, he said.\n\nDefence industries worldwide, he said, serve as critical engines for industrialisation, job creation, and technological advancement.\n\nIn Zimbabwes case, the development will unlock access to global defence markets, facilitate technology transfer, and enhance financial transactions, previously stifled by restrictions.\n\nFrom a national security perspective, Dr Dana said the ability to develop an independent defence industry reduces reliance on foreign arms suppliers, a challenge faced by many African nations vulnerable to external pressures leading to terrorism.\n\nAnti-sanctions activist, Mr Witness Dube, said the removal of ZDI from the sanctions list has a positive impact on the economy.\n\nThis is a sign that the relationship between Zimbabwe and the EU is thawing and an acknowledgement of the existence of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, which were the reasons cited for the sanctions in the first place, he said.\n\nRemoval of ZDI as an entity is positive for economic growth as this company can now go all out to attract foreign investment while trading on the international stage. Growth in this sector will open doors for the yet unknown economic activity that has been subdued by sanctions, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Rumbidzayi Zinyuke-Senior Health Reporter\n\nZimbabwe has launched an aggressive fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a hidden yet lethal crisis that has already claimed thousands of lives.\n\nIn 2019 alone, more than 15 000 people succumbed to drug-resistant infections, highlighting the urgent need for action.\n\nYesterday, the Government and its partners launched the second National Action Plan for AMR (2024-2028), setting the tone for the country to address the growing threat of AMR through a comprehensive One Health approach.\n\nThe One Health approach recognises the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health.\n\nWith support from the UK government, through the Fleming Fund phase 2 that has committed 2,5 million, Zimbabwe will expand surveillance, strengthen regulations, and promote responsible use of antimicrobials in healthcare and agriculture.\n\nSpeaking at the launch, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora said if unchecked, AMR could cost Zimbabwe up to 7 percent of its Gross Domestic Product by 2050.\n\nIf we dont act now, the cost will be devastatingnot just in lives lost but in livelihoods destroyed, families torn apart, and opportunities missed, he said.\n\nAMR doesnt respect borders; it doesnt care about wealth or privilege. It threatens us all. Its fuelled by the misuse of antimicrobials in healthcare, on our farms, and even in our environment.\n\nIf we do nothing, by 2050, this crisis could claim 10 million lives annually and cut global GDP by trillions. Here at home, the stakes are high, not to mention the strain it will place on our healthcare system and our farmers. But this is not a time for despair; its a time for action.\n\nThe first National Action Plan, which ran from 2017 to 2022, supported the provision of essential medicines and services in health and animal institutions as well as the introduction of AMR modules in nursing curricula, among many other activities.\n\nDr Mombesora said the new plan was built on five pillars that would guide the national response to AMR.\n\nThese included raising awareness, strengthening surveillance systems, promoting prevention practices, optimising antimicrobial use and fostering research and innovation.\n\nThe 2024-2028 National Action Plan is bolder, smarter, and more inclusive. It adopts the One Health approach, which recognises that human, animal, and environmental health are deeply connected.\n\nThis plan is about bringing everyone to the tablehealthcare workers, farmers, scientists, and policymakersto tackle AMR together, he said.\n\nDr Mombesora said the Government would ensure the successful implementation of the plan through the provision of human and financial resources to supply essential medicines and consumables for the populace and animals.\n\nThe Fleming Fund Grant II aims to address gaps in surveillance and the use of data generated for policy-making.\n\nAs Zimbabwe, we are grateful to our development partners who have been providing technical and financial support to the implementation of activities to mitigate AMR.\n\nFellow Zimbabweans, this is our moment to rise to the occasion. Let us commit to this plan, not just in words but in action. Let us show the world what Zimbabwe can achieve when we come together with purpose and resolve, said Dr Mombeshora.\n\nLands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Minister, Dr Anxious Masuka, who was represented by the Chief Director Veterinary Department, Dr Pious Makaya, said the launch of the second Plan was a pivotal moment in the collective fight against AMR.\n\nOver the past five years, we have made strides in improving our surveillance systems, building laboratory capacity, and strengthening the overall one-world effort.\n\nAs we launch the NAP 2, we move forward with renewed energy and purpose. We build on the lessons learned and the challenges faced during the first phase, and we invest in the new opportunities and collaborations that are emerging, he said.\n\nDr Mombeshora commended the collaborative approach used in the fight against AMR.\n\nMinister of Environment, Climate and Wildlife Dr Sithembiso Nyoni, who was represented by deputy director in the Ministry, Mr Abu Matiza, recognised the critical role the environment plays in the maintenance and strength of AMRs.\n\nAntimicrobial residues in our ecosystems stemming from various sources can contribute significantly to the development of resistance.\n\nThe environment is a reservoir of antimicrobial-resistant microbes and pathogens. Ensuring this reservoir does not sieve or pass on these microbes is critical in guaranteeing the success of environmental solutions in addressing the antimicrobial resistance threat, she said.\n\nFood and Agriculture Organisation sub-regional coordinator for southern Africa and representative for Zimbabwe, Eswatini and Lesotho Dr Pratrice Talla said the integration of AMR into agri-food policies was crucial to ensuring that antimicrobial use in livestock, aquaculture and crop production was both responsible and sustainable.\n\nZimbabwes livestock sector plays a vital role in the national economy and rural livelihoods, with a significant proportion of rural households keeping poultry, which serves as a safety net for food security and income generation.\n\nHowever, the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in poultry and livestock farming can accelerate the spread of resistant pathogens, threatening both animal and human health, he said.\n\n",
