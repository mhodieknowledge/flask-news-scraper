            "content": "Tinashe Kusema-Senior Reporter\n\nPRESIDENT Mnangagwa has paid tribute to the Zimbabwe senior mens rugby team, saying their Africa Cup conquest, earlier this year, exemplifies the Governments National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) call for the development of high-performance sports programmes and elite athletes.\n\nThe President hosted the Zimbabwe Sables at State House in Harare yesterday during which he distributed cash rewards of US$6,500 per player for winning the Rugby Africa Cup in Kampala, Uganda, back in July.\n\nMore importantly, he spoke with pride of the teams success during the 2024 calendar year where the Sables finished unbeaten in 24 matches, won their first Africa Cup in 12 years and beat regional powerhouses, Namibia, for the first time in 23 years en route to the African title.\n\nI am pleased to host you, our national rugby team as we celebrate your remarkable victory at the Rugby Africa Cup held in Uganda.\n\nThe nation honours the teamwork and patriotism that you demonstrated throughout the championship which brought the team this success of being crowned champions, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nThis historic achievement further reflects your dedication and perseverance as players, coaches and support staff.\n\nThe President hosted the Zimbabwe Sables at State House in Harare yesterday during which he distributed cash rewards of US$6,500 per player for winning the Rugby Africa Cup in Kampala, Uganda, back in July.\n\nI am aware that the journey that led to this momentous occasion was not an easy one. As a team, you endured rigorous training sessions, and extraordinary pressure on and off the field as you faced competitive as well as aggressive opponents.\n\nHowever, through every scrum, tackle and ultimately try, you embodied the true meaning of sportsmanship, passion and zeal, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa then drew focus to NDS1, which he said was symbolised by the Sables incredible feat.\n\nAt Government level, the National Development Strategy calls for the development of high-performance sporting disciplines and nurturing of elite athletes.\n\nThe success story of you, our Sables, dovetails with these aspirations. Additionally, the victory of our national rugby team is timely, occurring when our nation is re-asserting its place among sporting countries within the international arena.\n\nThis milestone is therefore another testimony that Zimbabwe is ready to compete and excel at the highest levels of continental and global sport.\n\nI acknowledge and express my profound gratitude to the various stakeholders, particularly families of players whose unwavering support and sacrifices have been instrumental to this success.\n\nThe President called upon the Sports Ministry and other relevant stakeholders to take a page out of the Sables success and come together to further develop Zimbabwe sport.\n\nMay the spirit of this victory inspire many more young people as they strive for greatness, said the President.\n\nALL SMILES . . . PRESIDENT Mnangagwa and Sables skipper Hilton Mudariki hold the Africa Cup while the rest of the Sables delegation watches at State House in Harare yesterday.\n\nThe Ministry of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture, industry and business stakeholders are called upon to scale up support for the sport sub-sector towards both quality infrastructure and ensuring that athletes can take sport as a viable career, he said.\n\nZimbabwes rugby team captain Hilton Mudariki described meeting with the President as the highlight of his career.\n\nHe said the meeting now puts the team in good stead as they prepare for the all-important 2025 edition of the Rugby Africa Cup which will double as qualification for the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia.\n\nIt is a truly special moment for me and the team, you cant describe it. It is a day that each of us will remember for the rest of our lives, an opportunity to be hosted by His Excellency, President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nIt will definitely act as motivation for us to keep working hard as we prepare for the all-important Africa Cup next year. We have a target on our back as every team will be gunning for us, but we will surely be up for the challenge, Mudariki said.\n\n",

            "content": "Joseph Madzimure-Senior Reporter\n\nRETIREMENT should not be seen as a period of retreat, but rather as a time of renewal and reinvention, President Mnangagwa has said.\n\nIn a speech read on his behalf by Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri at the inaugural Public Service Commission (PSC) retirement conference 2024 in Harare yesterday, the President said participatory development in communities offers a unique opportunity for retirees to apply their skills where they are most needed, fostering economic and social growth.\n\nThis milestone event is a testimony to the unwavering commitment of the Second Republic to improving the welfare of those who have served our nation with dedication and honour.\n\nThe doctrine of social protection is predicated on dignity in retirement. This dignity is borne out of the prosperity that comes from the sweat of those who selflessly serve the nation, he said.\n\nThe conference, running under the theme, Embracing a New Chapter: Empowering Public Sector Workers for Retirement with Dignity, will end tomorrow.\n\nThe theme, President Mnangagwa said, reflects the significant strides the Government has made through various reforms aimed at strengthening social protection.\n\nAs we write this new chapter, ourfocus is the dignity and empowerment of Government workers. We must ensure that retirement is not an endpoint but a meaningful new chapter contributing to the prosperity of our provinces, districts, and communities, he said.\n\nThe conference, organised by the Public Service Commission, is being attended by retirees; active members of the public service; and retirement experts from different sectors with major focus on discussing opportunities to secure the dignity; financial independence and health of civil servants in retirement.\n\nIt also focuses on financial planning; real estate planning; and life skills capacitation among other issues.\n\nGovernment adopted a Defined-Benefit Pension Scheme which provides eligible employees with guaranteed income for life when they retire.\n\nAs the largest employer in the land, President Mnangagwa said Government guarantees a specific retirement benefit for each participant based on factors such as the employees salary and years of service.\n\nThis means that the Government bears the risk if the returns on the investment do not cover the defined-benefit amount due to a member, he said.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said as Government improved social protection, there was a need to ignore the benefits associated with a Defined Contribution Pension Scheme which does not promise specific benefits at retirement.\n\nWith a Defined Contribution, risk falls on the contributor in that, pension benefits are pegged in relation to returns that are generated from investments.Thus, low investment returns result in low pension payouts. By adopting a Defined-Benefit Pension Scheme, the Government chose to shoulder the risk and guaranteed a specific pension benefit to all eligible beneficiaries, he said.\n\nCurrently, there are 195 000 to 200 000 retirees benefitting from the pensions payouts.\n\nIn any given year, 300 to 500 civil servants retire from active service.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa emphasised that those who join retirement must remain productive and continue to contribute to nation-building.\n\nGuided by the provision of the Constitution and Vision 2030 with respect to social protection, he said the Second Republics developmental thrust is premised on championing inclusivity, innovation, and progress.\n\nTo this end, my Government has developed an array of social protection policies aimed at improving the welfare of retirees to secure their dignity in retirement. In addition, my Government aims to empower retirees whose shoulders have borne the weight of nation-building. This resonates with our espoused mantra, Nyika inovakwa igotongwa igonamatirwa nevene vayo.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said retirement should not be seen as merely the end of active service but as a cornerstone of national progress, embodying the values of the liberation struggle and the dividends of peace and unity.\n\nHe hailed the public servants for being at the forefront of implementing policies that drive national development.\n\nThrough hard work and sacrifice, President Mnangagwa said workers have shaped a government that serves its people with integrity, diligence and resolve.\n\nThe Second Republic, he said, stands firm in its commitment to a Zimbabwe where every citizen young or old, retired or in servicehas the opportunity to thrive.\n\nThe conference was also attended by the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare, July Moyo, Minister of Veterans of the Liberation Struggle Monica Mavhunga, chairman of the Public Service Commission, Dr Vincent Hungwe, Commissioners of the Public Service Commission, Secretary of the Public Service Commission, Mrs Sibusisiwe Zembe among other senior Government officials.\n\n",
