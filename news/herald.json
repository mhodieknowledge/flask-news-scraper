            "content": "Michael Tome, Business Reporter\n\nTHE World Bank says Zimbabwes mining, agribusiness and tourism sectors remain largely untapped, urging the private sector to take advantage of the opportunities to drive economic growth.\n\nThe Second Republic, led by President Mnangagwa, is championing economic diplomacy under the Zimbabwe is open for business mantra and anchor foreign policy thrust, friend to all and enemy to none. It has also implemented ease of doing business reforms to encourage private sector investment.\n\nThe World Bank said Zimbabwe had a better comparative advantage in the identified sectors than other regional economies.\n\nThis is in light of emerging global trends and limitless opportunities for value addition.\n\nWorld Bank senior country economist for Zimbabwe Mr Victor Steenbergen said this last week while delivering a presentation entitled, Mobilising the Private Sector in Support of Economic Transformation, at a Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) Business and Economic Outlook Symposium for 2025.\n\nHe said Zimbabwes agriculture and agribusiness sectors played a vital role in the countrys economy, providing livelihoods for around 70 percent of the population and accounting for approximately 40 percent of the nations export earnings.\n\nMr Steenbergen pointed out that horticulture, in particular, offered relatively higher profit margins and significant opportunities for value addition, particularly in the food and beverage sectors.\n\nThe sector also has significant connections with the manufacturing sector, which creates a valuable multiplier effect, driving growth in production and employment opportunities.\n\nHe highlighted opportunities in the mining sector, noting that it provides a range of highly sought-after global commodities, including gold and Platinum Group Metals (PGMs).\n\nMr Steenbergen cited the growing demand for energy transition minerals, notably lithium, nickel, copper and platinum, saying Zimbabwe had immense platinum and lithium reserves that have not been fully exploited.\n\nLithium, a key mineral in the production of electric vehicle batteries and many modern electrical gadgets, is one of the most sought-after minerals, and Zimbabwe has the largest lithium reserves in Africa.\n\nThe countrys lithium deposits are primarily found in petalite, lepidolite, and spodumene forms, making it an attractive area for investors.\n\nTourism is another strategic economic sector with significant potential to propel Zimbabwes economy, given the countrys storied history and rich cultural and natural endowments.\n\nZimbabwe, which has already achieved its target of a US$5 billion tourism economy, is actively pursuing initiatives to drive short-term to medium-term growth via its vibrant tourism.\n\nMr Steenbergen said Victoria Falls, in particular, the countrys premier tourist destination, was thriving, and its success could be replicated in other world-class attractions to drive growth in Zimbabwes tourism sector.\n\nZimbabwes unique geographic location also presents opportunities for network tourism, which can be leveraged to attract more visitors.\n\nHe said Zimbabwe could capitalise on its natural beauty and cultural heritage to create a more diverse and resilient tourism industry.\n\nWe looked at global demand prospects and areas that Zimbabwe has a comparative advantage in; looking at exports in particular, and how that compares to the global average share of exports in that sector.\n\nIf that is higher, there might be a basis for competitiveness.\n\nAgriculture and agribusiness provide about 40 percent of national earnings, so it is very critical.\n\nA growing demand for energy transition minerals, notably lithium, nickel, copper and platinum suggests that this is an opportunity for investment in the mining industry, and Zimbabwe has large platinum and lithium reserves, he said.\n\nDespite the vast opportunities, he noted that Zimbabwe faces significant hurdles, primarily in the form of legal and regulatory challenges, which can hinder the countrys ability to fully capitalise on its potential.\n\nHe also talked about challenges regarding macro-economic stability, particularly the limited access to funding for the private sector and the high cost of doing business in the country.\n\nThese are the issues which the Government is working at redressing.\n\n",

            "content": "A MAJOR joint drive to bring the large informal sector in Zimbabwe into the realm of the formal economy was set in motion by fiscal authorities in the last Budget and subsequent tax laws for this year.\n\nThis was further reinforced by monetary authorities in the last monetary policy statement.\n\nWith so many people earning their living through the informal sector, no one, least of all the Government or the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, wants to see this sector crushed or closed.\n\nEveryone in fact wants to see it flourish as part of that general effort to see major growth in the micro, small and medium businesses.\n\nBut this flourishing needs to be done within the general legal and regulatory network that all businesses in Zimbabwe, from the smallest to the largest, need to follow.\n\nThere are many reasons for this from ensuring that due taxes are paid, and these may well be minute or even zero for the smallest, and that all business is connected through the banking sector and can serve all potential customers.\n\nThere is also a need to ensure that all businesses operate with the appropriate licence from their local authority, partly because they want the services that this council is supposed to provide and partly to ensure that they meet whatever safety and health standards are seen as absolutely essential.\n\nThe Reserve Bank, through the Bankers Association of Zimbabwe, is now implementing one strand of this formalisation strategy.\n\nAll businesses now require a bank account and a Point-Of-Sale machine before they can be licensed by their local authority. This will require dual pressure by the Reserve Bank and the local authorities, the councils sending their inspectors out to exert pressure and the banks ready and willing to open at least basic bank accounts and issue the POS machines.\n\nVery small businesses have complained that often the bank charges and licence fees are high compared to their turnover and while this is a common complaint right along the business sectors, there could well be a need for special small business licences and cheap basic bank accounts.\n\nThis, after all, seems to fall within the Government policy of backing measures that make doing business ever easier.\n\nHarare City Council inherited a dual licensing system from the settler days, with cheap hawker licences as well as shop licences and this worked well by making sure anyone selling anything in the city had a licence, but in a large group of cases, a very cheap licence.\n\nWe would imagine a triple licensing structure, with three levels of licence, could easily be implemented to ensure universal coverage, but with a strong element of fairness.\n\nBanks have come under pressure from the Reserve Bank to depend less on fee income and continually adding costs to customers and instead return to their traditional role of borrowing from savers and lending to borrowers and making their serious money from the gap between the two interest rates.\n\nIn any case, a basic zero-overdraft bank account for a small business seems a good place to start.\n\nPOS machines that have been stocked include suitable machines for areas where there is no mobile-phone network, not very few, and the more numerous areas where power supplies rely on what sort of solar charging screen the business can mount. That is a good start.\n\nWe also think that customers must be given a real choice about using these POS machines and suggest that businesses are forced to put up the appropriate sticker from their bank, and that there are hotlines that customers can use to register complaints.\n\nWe have seen large formal businesses apologising for having broken POS machines, when they are just switched off and hidden, and this will be a serious temptation for smaller businesses as well. Those claiming a broken machine should be visited promptly, with repair or replacement for a genuine problem and a stiff service fee when the machine is in fact sound.\n\nAt the end of this month a set of very high presumptive taxes come into effect for a wide range of informal businesses. Small informal businesses were encouraged to register with Zimra to avoid these and pay what will be, in the overwhelming majority of cases, a far smaller calculated tax and in a reasonable group of cases perhaps no tax if the profit for a sole trader is within the zero percent tax bracket.\n\nMost will have to pay something, but not very much since they are small businesses. But if they have not registered with Zimra and kept the basic sort of books required, a list of incoming revenue and outgoing costs and expenses would probably work at this level since it is assumed in many cases that they are remarkably flourishing businesses.\n\nA tuckshop for example, with a US$9 000 presumptive quarterly tax bill, will be assumed to be making a profit of almost US$12 000 a month, which would in turn require considerably over US$100 000 a month coming over the counter before stock is bought, wages paid, rentals paid and all the other legitimate expenses, including of course bank charges and licence fees.\n\nHardly any of these little businesses come even close to these levels and would be far better off if they just went legal and paid the far smaller sums that would then be required in almost all cases. The huge presumptive taxes were set to make sure the ultimate exceptions paid enough tax, but tiny businesses will be caught in the net if they do not register and pay their tiny taxes.\n\nSmall family businesses, and this definition covers a vast swathe of the informal sector, flourish as small formal businesses across many countries.\n\nEven what we tend to call tuckshops are seen as the corner grocery convenience stores and mom and pop family stores in many cities and villages, competing against supermarkets with their lower costs, convenience and special services to their customers.\n\nThe formalisation drive, with sensible costs and fees as well as maintaining the progressive tax structure with its lower rates for small sole-traders, must be pressed so we can have what we need, a flourishing and large small business sector.\n\nThis sector must, at least in aggregate when all the little tax payments and special licence fees are added together, make a fair contribution to public finances and offer its customers a safe and secure environment, as well as maintaining the convenience and special service that makes these businesses so desirable and viable.\n\n",

We are moving with pageantry trends in a bid to continue promoting the modelling industry in Zimbabwe, she added, highlighting the dynamic nature of their work.\n\nShe said the Fashion and Dining Market aims to create a vibrant hub where local designers, boutiques, and fashion brands can showcase their collections.\n\nWe are calling on fashion designers, fashion houses, boutiques, couture brands, high street brands, hair shops, makeup brands, shoe brands, and handbag brands, among others, to come and exhibit, Makusha said.\n\nThe event seeks to engage the broader modelling community, offering a platform for collaboration and networking. This is a different event from the pageant, but we will also have models. The concept is done worldwide, and as Zimbabwe, this is our first time having such an event. We are contemplating inviting fashion enthusiasts from other countries, but we want to start with our own to promote local talent, she explained, expressing her commitment to nurturing homegrown talent.\n\nThe Fashion and Dining Market will not only spotlight local designers but will also serve as a promotional vehicle for the Miss Universe pageant itself, which is scheduled for May 17 at Hippodrome in Harare.\n\nWe have released the roadmap for this years edition, and we have started the auditions in various parts of the country. On April 26, we will host the Miss Universe Charity Run and reveal our top 12 who will vie for the coveted title, said Makusha.\n\nMeanwhile, reigning queen Sakhile Dube, who made a remarkable impression by finishing in the top 30 at the Miss Universe pageant in Mexico last year, has been busy launching her own initiatives.\n\nShe recently founded the Zibusiso Foundation and Zie The Label, two projects close to her heart.\n\nExplaining her mission, Sakhile said, The Zibusiso Charity Foundation is a non-profit organisation dedicated to improving the lives of underprivileged communities through education, healthcare, and empowerment initiatives.\n\nHer foundation aims to provide vital resources and support to those in need, fostering sustainable development and long-term positive change.\n\nOn the fashion front, Sakhiles Zie The Label is a clothing brand that merges style with purpose.\n\nIt aims to create trendy, high-quality apparel.

            "content": "Langton Nyakwenda, Zimpapers Sports Hub\n\nTHE Warriors are set to play high-profile international friendly matches against 2022 World Cup semi-finalists Morocco, who are currently Africas number one ranked team.\n\nExchange programs between ZIFA and the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), which will create opportunities for local coaches and administrators across the national structure, are also in the pipeline.\n\nDomestic womens football, for years a marginalised sector, will also have a huge bite of this delicious cake being baked in the smart partnership between Zimbabwe and Morocco.\n\nThis has been made possible thanks to a landmark partnership deal between ZIFA and the FRMR that was thrashed out on Saturday night in the North African country.\n\nZIFA President Nqobile Magwizi was in the North African country, where he signed a two-year agreement with his Moroccan Football Association counterpart, Fouzi Lekjaa.\n\nAccording to a ZIFA communique, the historic deal is expected to strengthen football development in both nations.\n\nThis is set to be done through initiatives, which include:\n\nTraining programs for coaches, referees, and administrators.\n\nYouth and womens football development.\n\nFriendly matches for senior and youth teams.\n\nExchange programs and joint events.\n\nThe North Africans, whose world-class facilities have been an inspiration to many countries, are also billed to host and support ZIFA delegations, while Zimbabwe will, among other obligations, facilitate tours by Moroccan teams.\n\nIn the build-up to his January 25 election into ZIFA, Magwizi had pledged that he would work on establishing international synergies with other successful associations.\n\nThe ZIFA boss and his executive committee, aware of much ground the association needs to cover in areas of development and capacity building, have immediately put shoulders to the wheel in trying to transform an organisation that had lost its way over the years, amid a plethora of challenges that eventually torched Government intervention.\n\nThere have been tangible deliverance on promises inside the boards first 50 days.\n\nAnd the deal with the Morocco FA, one of a number expected to be thrashed with fellow FIFA and CAF member associations, could also transform Zimbabwean football and improve the welfare of players while building the capacities of coaches, other technical officials, and administrators.\n\nPossible friendly matches against Moroccos Atlas Lions could be a boon for Zimbabwe, who are bracing for a sixth appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations finals.\n\nCoincidentally, Morocco will host the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations in December.\n\nThe Moroccans will also stage the 2026 CAF Womens Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nWhile the Warriors will be part of the AFCON jamboree in December, the Mighty Warriors came a cropper in their bid to be at the 2026 WAFCON following their elimination by Angola.\n\nThat ZIFA have sought to emulate the Moroccans is a commendable gesture, especially in view of the fact that junior development had stalled in the country.\n\nMorocco have re-emerged as one of the main actors in the development of football on the continent.\n\nThe North Africans have awakened from a slumber and have transformed into a football powerhouse, with the Atlas Lions now rated the best African side.\n\nTheir rise has been anchored on a sound football development strategy that has groomed star players who include Paris Saint Germain and former Real Madrid right back Achraf Hakimi.\n\nThe other renowned players from Morocco include goalkeeper Yassine Bonou, former Manchester United midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, and ex-Chelsea star Hakim Ziyech. Morocco became the first African country to reach the World Cup semi-finals in 2022.\n\nThe Atlas Lions are also ranked number 14 in the world.\n\nZIFA also underscored the sign they are attaching to development.\n\nThis engagement underscores ZIFAs commitment to fostering strong partnerships with leading football associations across the continent.\n\nMorocco has emerged as a key player in African football development, and this dialogue presents valuable opportunities for collaboration in areas such as technical development, infrastructure, and administration, ZIFA said in a statement shortly before Magwizi flew to Morocco.\n\nThe ZIFA president also toured Niger and had some insight into the West African countrys development programmes and the associations academy.\n\nThis comes as ZIFA have undertaken a massive refurbishment of the ZIFA Village in Mt Hampden using financial assistance from FIFA, which was first availed to the Normalisation Committee.\n\nThere is hope that at the completion of the works, the ZIFA Village will become a fully fledged training centre with boarding lodges, offices, training pitches, and boardrooms where national teams can camp. The new ZIFA board has identified infrastructure development as one of the key deliverables.\n\nResultantly, an Infrastructure Committee led by Harare businessman and board member Brighton Ushendibaba has been established to oversee the improvements and construction of facilities.\n\n",

            "content": "Trust Freddy, Checkpoint Desk\n\nTWO-HUNDRED houses and properties, including two opulent mansions on the foothills of the National Heroes Acre, were illegally constructed on land reserved for the Harare Drive expansion project and now face demolition, The Herald can exclusively reveal.\n\nThis comes as Harare City Council has vowed to demolish all illegally constructed structures, emphasising that Harare Drive was designed to form a circular route around the city, with no changes to its original plan.\n\nDespite councils threats, the Constitutional Court recently ruled that demolishing homes without a court order was unconstitutional, presenting a significant obstacle for local authorities.\n\nHarare Drive is intended to alleviate congestion and provide an alternative route for many, but its expansion is being hindered by land barons and corrupt council officials who have illegally allocated residential stands on land reserved for the project.\n\nAn investigation by The Herald uncovered numerous properties encroaching on the roads designated reserve, threatening its intended purpose.\n\nAccording to the original 1998 detailed engineering designs, the missing links of the Harare Drive ring road are intended to connect key areas, including:\n\nSolomon Mujuru Drive (formerly Kirkman Road) at Warren Hills to Gleneagles Road in Southerton, Houghton Park through Mainway Meadows, Retreat to Seke Road, then to Twentydales Road in Hatfield to Mutare Road in Msasa.\n\nA week-long fact-finding mission revealed widespread encroachment, particularly in Waterfalls and Retreat suburbs, where more than 100 houses are built on the Harare Drive road reserve.\n\nIn Waterfalls, Mainway Meadows, a visible divide exists between areas where residents acknowledge the future path of Harare Drive, leaving a 60-metre wide corridor free of development.\n\nBut in areas like Retreat, construction continues unchecked, with land barons reportedly pegging stands on an area that had been left in anticipation of the road development.\n\nResidents expressed confusion and concern over the status of their homes.\n\nDo you want to demolish our houses? a seemingly panicky Retreat resident asked when he saw this reporter and three city planners counting houses built on Harare Drive.\n\nMine is not on the road, even if you check on your GPS, he added without being asked.\n\nThe man, who requested anonymity, acknowledged that several people were aware that their houses were on Harare Drive.\n\nI think everyone is aware that there must be a road, but they were hoodwinked into thinking their properties would be regularised.\n\nAnother resident, who also requested anonymity, said the talk of Harare Drive had been ongoing, and had halted construction of her house.\n\nI am now confused, she said.\n\nWe were told that Harare Drive was supposed to pass through here, so for the meantime, I have halted plans to build my full house. Others are also saying the road will be diverted.\n\nA man who preferred to be identified only as Mr Tawanda, said: The unbuilt area reserved for Harare Drive has been pegged for new houses.\n\nMy plea to the Government is to complete the entire road to avoid confusion.\n\nA nicely built Church of Grace Ministries in Retreat was also constructed on the path that Harare Drive will take.\n\nHowever, church leader, Minister Oliver Makoni, refuted that.\n\nWe have never been informed by the City Council about any encroachment issues, he said.\n\nWe have a site plan, and our papers are in order, all the papers are at Rowan Martin. Why cant you obtain a GPS report, they have that GPS. It can verify whether we have encroached or not.\n\nMinister Makoni indicated that they were even given an account and pay rates to the City Council every month.\n\nIts nearly 10 years now, but above all the City should know that peoples lives are important than a road.\n\nA further investigation revealed that Retreat residents have been living in the area for over 10 years, with some even constructing permanent homes, even though they had been provided with accurate information regarding the planned route of Harare Drive.\n\nHarare City acting director of urban planning, Mr Samuel Nyabezi, acknowledged the existence of many houses built on Harare Drive, particularly in the Retreat area.\n\nYes, there are many houses that have been built on Harare Drive, particularly in Retreat, but at some point, those structures shall be demolished because our plan for Harare Drive road expansion is clear.\n\nHe also told The Herald that two mansions were built on Harare Drive close to the National Heroes Acre.\n\nThose are two real mansions, and from our plan, it shows that all those two encroached into Harare Drive. I have told the owners that there will be no negotiations; the houses will be demolished.\n\nMr Nyabezi said the homeowners are being hoodwinked by land barons to build without plans. The city council will never approve a house to be built on land reserved for a road. These people are just getting site plans and going on to build a full house.\n\nAt some point, those structures shall be demolished because our plan for Harare Drive road expansion is clear, he said.\n\nHarare mayor, Councillor Jacob Mafume, reiterated the citys commitment to demolishing all illegal structures.\n\nWe will demolish all those illegal structures. If you ask me to provide a solution, I will only push for demolition, because surely, you cannot build on land reserved for a road.\n\nIts perhaps the government that will stop us. You cannot build on land reserved for a road, said Clr Mafume.\n\nThis situation unfolds amid ongoing investigations by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), which has warned city officials that their days are numbered.\n\nZACC Chairperson Mr Michael Reza said: We will allow the commission to complete its report and submit it to His Excellency, after which we will be guided on the way forward.\n\nAs the situation develops, residents, officials, and the city council remain at an impasse over the future of Harare Drive and the homes built on its planned route.\n\n",
