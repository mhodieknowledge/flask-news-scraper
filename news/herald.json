Zimbabwe Sugar Development Association (ZSDA) chairperson Mr Elisha Tamirepi says spilling of the reservoir is a boon for Lowveld farmers.\n\nWe are happy as farmers in the Lowveld because the spilling of Tugwi-Mukosi dam means we have irrigation water for two or three years, he said.\n\nThe rains have brought relief because it is not only Tugwi-Mukosi Dam that has spilled but other water bodies that irrigate the Lowveld have also impounded significant inflows.\n\nThe countrys largest interior dam last spilled in 2022. Tugwi-Mukosis spilling comes as another dam in Masvingo, Lake Mutirikwi, also started spilling two weeks ago after heavy rains across the province.\n\n",
