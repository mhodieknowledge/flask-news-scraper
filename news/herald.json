            "content": "Theseus Shambare in KARIBA\n\nAccess to crucial inputs has become a major obstacle for Zimbabwes aquaculture sector, limiting its growth potential.\n\nThis issue was highlighted during the final consultations for the Fisheries and Aquaculture Bill in Kariba.\n\nAn aquaculture expert under the Fisheries and Aquaculture Resources Department (FARD), Mrs Irene Chihanga said while aquaculture production has become a vital component of global food production, the rising costs of production continues to plague the sector.\n\nA recent survey we conducted revealed that access to essential inputs is a major hurdle for Zimbabwes aquaculture sector, said Mrs Chihanga.\n\nFor an aquaculture enterprise to be productive, it is necessary to ensure that quality and cost-effective inputs are available. Inputs such as feed, fingerlings, chemicals, drugs and quality water are crucial for the sustainability and profitability of aquaculture operations.\n\nThe survey, she said, found that commercial feed is the most commonly used, particularly in the Midlands and Matabeleland South provinces.\n\nHowever, farmers also rely on alternative sources, Chihanga noted.\n\nSpecifically, they exploit kitchen waste (85,71 percent in Matabeleland North and 60 percent in Matabeleland South) and livestock manure (33,33 percent for pig and poultry).\n\nA significant factor contributing to this is the distance that farmers must travel to access feed, with those in the Midlands and Matabeleland North Provinces traveling the furthest.\n\nGenerally, farmers in the Midlands province travel 156km, while those in Matabeleland North travel 126km to access fish feed, she said.\n\nThe survey also revealed price disparities in feed and fingerlings across provinces.\n\nThe cost of fish feed per kilogram is higher in Masvingo Province compared to others, while it is comparatively lower in Matabeleland North and Manicaland, she said.\n\nThe lower fingerling prices in Manicaland could be attributed to the use of recycled fish seed, while in Matabeleland North, it is due to reliance on wild fish seed.\n\nFarmers attending the Bill consultations chipped in.\n\nOn top of limited-service providers, there is a rise in bogus suppliers of pond liners, said Takunda Chikumbindi, a young fish farmer from Chinhoyi.\n\nI had the problem of receiving poor-quality plastic, which I had to replace twice within a single seven-month cycle.\n\nAgnes Samukange from Dzikamidzi, Zvimba District, added, Feed scarcity is weighing down my project. We incur extra costs every time we need fish feed because we dont have suppliers in our area. We end up using substandard feeds like kitchen waste, which dont produce the intended quality fish.\n\nIn response, FARD, in collaboration with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) under the Fish for Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific (FISH4ACP) programme, has begun decentralising aquaculture inputs to bring them closer to farmers.\n\nRecently, fingerling distribution hubs were launched in Masvingo and Manicaland to reduce transportation costs for farmers.\n\nWell-managed fisheries can ensure a sustainable supply of healthy aquatic foods. However, fishery resources are limited, and the increasing global demand for aquatic foods require a well-managed aquaculture sector to fill the gap, said Mr Paul Mwera, FAO FISH4ACP programme coordinator.\n\nFISH4ACP has supported the Government in developing fingerling distribution hubs to address the challenge of accessing fingerlings.\n\nFARD director, Mr Milton Makumbe emphasised the importance of collaborations with development partners.\n\nThe challenges in the fish value chain are numerous and some directly affect the efficiency and growth of the subsector, he said.\n\nThese include but are not limited to the absence of an enabling legal framework, poor seed quality, limited financial capital, poor production technologies, poor marketing, slow uptake and adoption of sustainable community-based aquaculture initiatives, and climate change-induced water shortages. The development of this Bill is a significant step towards our vision.\n\n",
