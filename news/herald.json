Therefore, peace is very important. Their Excellencies will be able to be given the extent of the problem on Friday and they will be able to make decisions on this, said Prof Murwira.\n\nYou will remember that His Excellency Dr ED Mnangagwa issued his statement on Monday condemning violence and actually urging SADC to take action. So, SADC is taking action. Thats why theres a summit on Friday. Everything is set for the meeting and we look forward to the resolution of problems in the eastern part of the DRC.\n\nIn a Communiqu yesterday, the SADC Secretariat said the meeting follows the outcome of the Extraordinary Summit of the SADC Organ Troika plus the DRC and Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs) to the SADC Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC), which was held on Tuesday.\n\nThe Southern African Development Community (SADC) will convene an Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government in Harare, Republic of Zimbabwe, to discuss the security situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe Summit will be chaired by His Excellency Dr Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, and Chairperson of SADC.\n\nThe Summit follows the outcome of the Extraordinary Summit of the SADC Organ Troika plus the DRC and Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs) to the SADC Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC), which was held on 28th January 2025 and was chaired by Her Excellency Dr Samia Suluhu Hassan, the President of the United Republic of Tanzania and Chairperson of the SADC Organ on Politics Defence and Security Cooperation, reads the Communique in part.\n\nThe Extraordinary Summit will be preceded by meetings of the SADC Standing Committee of Senior Officials and the SADC Council of Ministers.\n\nAs of Tuesday night, the death toll from fighting between peacekeeping soldiers and M23 rebels in eastern Congo had reached 17.\n\nThe number includes 13 South African National Defence Force (SANDF) soldiers and others from Malawi and Uruguay deployed as part of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) regional force or under the UN mission in Congo (MONUSCO).\n\nBy the time of going to print, unconfirmed reports were pointing at more casualties.\n\nDirector for International Communication Services in the Ministry of Information Publicity and Broadcasting Services Richard Mahomva said the convening of the Summit was reflective of the high sense of urgency that the regional bloc places on instability in the region.\n\nIn recent weeks, M23 has made rapid advances towards Goma, a city with a population exceeding one million.\n\nIntense fighting in the region has further exacerbated the situation, leading to heightened fears among residents.\n\nAs of early 2025, over 400 000 people had been displaced in the provinces of North and South Kivu, which are located near the border with Rwanda.\n\nThe UNs refugee agency has reported a growing humanitarian need as families are forced to flee their homes in search of safety and shelter.\n\n",

For instance, we need to come and formalise the informal sector so that it begins to behave in a manner similar to how the formal sector players are behaving.\n\nApart from ensuring that the informal sector complies with the countrys laws, Prof Ncube said the Government has embarked on a blitz around the countrys borders to reduce smuggling which was also fuelling informalisation and making it harder for the formal sector to compete.\n\nWe also stand ready as Government to support formal retailers for them to ride the storm and this fierce competition from the informal sector.\n\nWe are doing everything we can; we will be announcing and implementing some measures to support the formal sector, but at the same time making sure the informal sector begins to comply with the tax, licensing and registration provisions that were put in place, he said.\n\nSo far the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) has impounded goods valued at approximately US$2,4 million in a multi-agency operation targeting importers and cross-border transporters involved in smuggling and unethical business practices.\n\nThe operation has resulted in the seizure of dozens of vehicles, including cross-border buses and haulage trucks, and confiscation of illicit goods such as foodstuffs and second-hand clothes.\n\nMeanwhile, Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce president Mr Tapiwa Karoro shared the same sentiments with Government, adding that there was a need to address economic pressures.\n\nHe said the implementation of measures which address disparities between the formal and informal sectors was welcome.\n\nThe growth of the informal sector, where vendors often sell groceries in front of grocery stores and clothes outside established retailers like Edgars, undermines formal businesses.\n\nThese informal traders operate with fewer regulatory and cost burdens, putting formal players at a competitive disadvantage, Mr Karoro said.\n\nZNCC, he said, was advocating for a collaborative approach to addressing the existing challenges.\n\nKey policy recommendations include:- Liberalising the goods market and providing greater flexibility in the exchange rate to ensure fair competition; streamlining tax burdens and licensing requirements to reduce overhead costs for formal businesses.\n\nOthers are tackling informality by creating incentives for formalisation and enforcing fair market practices, and improving access to affordable financing for businesses to sustain operations and support growth.\n\nAddressing these issues through constructive dialogue and co-ordinated action can help restore stability to the retail sector and the broader economy, said the ZNCC president.\n\n",

Addressing growth barriers and fostering a conducive environment for economic transformation will be key, he said.\n\nThis will require steadfast fiscal discipline, macro-economic stability, robust trade and investment, effective enforcement of property rights and sustainable public finance, continuous empowerment and adaptability will be essential in meeting the countrys developmental objectives.\n\nMilestones under NDS1 are in different pillars, including infrastructure and utilities, digital economy, food security and nutrition, economic growth and stability, image building, engagement and re-engagement.\n\nIn an interview, the Deputy Chief Secretary for Policy Analysis, Co-ordination and Development Planning in the Office of the President and Cabinet, Mr Willard Manungo, said all stakeholders from Government, ministries, departments, and the private sector have been invited to give input into the NDS2 mapping.\n\nWe have NDS 1 and it finishes this year, we are now working on NDS2 as a successor programme, we have invited all the ministries, all departments to share their priorities, we have also invited business and industry.\n\nWe are trying to receive all the inputs as provided by all stakeholders, we are now compiling the views to hand over to Cabinet so that it is endorsed at the highest level, he said.\n\nUnder NDS1, success has also been registered in environmental protection, climate resilience and natural resource management, social protection, governance, housing delivery, human capital development and innovation, devolution and decentralisation, and health and well-being, among others.\n\nOn the infrastructure and utilities pillar, the Government implemented projects that focused on provision of road and aviation networks and utilities such as water and electricity.\n\nThey include the expansion and construction of a new VVIP Pavilion at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport in Harare, the Dete Community solar project in Matabeleland North Province and the Harare-Masvingo-Beitbridge Road upgrade.\n\nOthers are the Shurugwi-Mhandamabwe road rehabilitation, the repair of 2 000 boreholes across the country and the drilling of 3 528 boreholes under the Presidential Borehole Drilling Programme.\n\nAdditional projects include the Mbudzi Interchange construction project, the Harare-Kanyemba Road construction, the Great Zimbabwe 5MW Hydro Power Station in Masvingo, and construction of New Parliament Building access roads in Harare, Mashonaland West and Mashonaland Central provinces.\n\nUnder the digital economy pillar, the Government invested in expanding ICT infrastructure, promoting digital literacy, and supporting technology start-ups.\n\nThe start-ups include the Media and Communication Policy, the National E-learning Strategy (computerisation of 1 000 schools to bridge the urban-rural divide), the National ICT Policy launch, the Artificial Intelligence Strategy approval, the licensing of Starlink, electronic passports for citizens in Harare, Guruve, Murehwa, Lupane, Beitbridge, Zvishavane, Marondera and Gweru, among others.\n\nOn the food security and nutrition pillar, many projects including dams were constructed to climate-proof agriculture while irrigation rehabilitation and accelerated dam construction across the country was also done to boost food security.\n\nDams such as Kunzvi in Mashonaland East, Muchekeranwa Dam on the border of Mashonaland East and Manicaland, Tugwi-Mukosi in Masvingo, Semwa in Mashonaland Central and Lake Gwayi-Shangani in Matabeleland North have been constructed and some are complete and already transforming lives while others are over 70 percent complete.\n\nOn the economic growth and stability pillar, the Government initiated many programmes such as the debt and arrears clearance programme, tamed inflation, and introduced a gold-backed currency, among others.\n\nRegarding image building and the engagement and re-engagement programme, the Government rehabilitated infrastructure in foreign missions and installed broadcasting infrastructure, which is critical for enhancing Governments image and improved economic diplomacy.\n\nOn the social protection pillar, the Government focused on the protection of individuals and communities from poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion.\n\nOn governance, there was the construction of magistrate courts, and the implementation and operationalisation of the Integrated Electronic Case Management System, among others.\n\nApart from that, on housing delivery, the Government constructed affordable and decent houses in many towns for its workers.\n\nIn terms of human capital development and innovation, learners were prepared to become socially and economically empowered through quality and innovation education.\n\nYouth, sports and culture emphasis was on fighting socio-economic ills that include drug and substance abuse as well as unemployment.\n\n",

            "content": "Raymond Jaravaza, Bulawayo Bureau\n\nGOVERNMENT has deployed security and environment agencies to the Rhodes Estate in the Matopos National Park to address concerns over rampant illegal gold mining activities, which is threatening livestock production at one of the countrys biggest pedigree cattle farms.\n\nKnown for its famed Brahman and Beefmasters breeds produced by the Pilossof brothers, the farm has been invaded by illegal gold panners whose indiscriminate digging in recent years has caused severe environmental degradation. Many cattle have died after falling into the pits dug by the panners.\n\nThe sprawling 4 000 hectare enterprise, is run by the Pilossof brothers, a household name in the pedigree cattle and genetics business in the country.\n\nIn 2014, the Pilossof brothers entered into an agreement with the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) to run their pedigree business in the Rhodes Estates as means to preserve parts of the Matopos National Park  a world heritage site  while at the same time operating a commercially viable livestock project in the park.\n\nFor years, the Pilossof family has been battling an ever growing influx of illegal gold panners who have been digging pits and deep trenches where the cattle are falling in.\n\nYesterday, Matabeleland South Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister, Dr Evelyn Ndlovu and her delegation of heads of key Government departments visited the farm to have first-hand appreciation of the problem the cattle farmers are facing as a result of the illegal gold mining activities.\n\nPits left unattended after some illegal miners ran away from authorities during the tour by the Matabeleland South Minister of State fro Provincial Affairs and Devolution at Rhodes Estate in Matobo district yesterday.\n\nHead of the farm project, Mr Paul Pilossof, estimated that close to 200 pedigree cattle have died in the last couple of years after falling into the open pits left by the illegal gold panners or from drinking water contaminated with chemicals such as cyanide, whose use is now outlawed in the extraction of gold.\n\nThe pedigree cattle at the farm can cost between US$ 4000 to US$8 000 each.\n\nSome Pilossof Ruvale Brahman bulls from the farm have in the past been sold for as much as US$13 000 each.\n\nOn one end of the farm, at the base of a small mountain, the news crew saw over 30 pits concentrated in a very small area.\n\nA few illegal panners were brave enough to stick around as Minister Ndlovu and her entourage together with officials from ZimParks, Ministry of Mines and Mining Development, Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water, Fisheries and Rural Development, the Environment Management Authority (EMA), the police and other stakeholders assessed the damage.\n\nThe rest of the omakorokoza fled or hid in their deep pits to evade possible arrest as the entourage approached.\n\nWe have been at the farm since 2014 after signing an agreement with ZimParks and we have been encountering problems with illegal miners invading our farm and digging for gold, said Mr Pilossof.\n\nThe illegal mining has been happening for years and it appears nothing is being done to stop the activities. We fenced off a large area where illegal mining is taking place in order to keep our cattle away but the mining just keeps spreading and the panners are cutting the fence.\n\nPits left unattended after some illegal miners ran away from authorities during the tour by the Matabeleland South Minister of State fro Provincial Affairs and Devolution at Rhodes Estate in Matobo district yesterday.\n\nMr Pilossof said they are now being forced to move their cattle from the farm because its no longer safe to keep them there.\n\nWe lose an average of 60 pedigree cattle per year from snares, stock theft, cattle falling into pits or dying after drinking cyanide contaminated water, said Mr Pilossof.\n\nMinister Ndlovu said the province is dependent on agriculture and livestock farming contributes significantly to the regions economy.\n\nThe illegal mining activities that are taking place at this farm are counter-productive and cannot be allowed to continue, said Dr Ndlovu.\n\nShe ordered officials from the mines ministry to report back to her office with a list of miners that were allowed to mine at the Rhodes Estates under special permits issued with the consent of ZimParks.\n\nMining and agriculture can be done side by side but only when both parties are working within the confines of the law. I want a list of everyone who is mining legally so that we flush out the illegal miners, said Dr Ndlovu.\n\nMr Chancellor Chidziva, Matabeleland South acting provincial mining director, said his office can only issue out a special mining permit to a miner after the approval of ZimParks.\n\nZimParks are custodians of the Matopos National Park so anyone who wishes to carry out mining in the national park must first seek a special permit from them, he said.\n\nIt is only after Zimparks issues out the special permit that we do the necessary paperwork and grant the individual the right to mine, said Mr Chidziva.\n\nHe however, said he could not immediately provide the number of miners who hold the special permits to mine in the Matopos National Park.\n\nThe special permits expire after two years and are only renewed when the miner meets all the necessary conditions.\n\nZimParks senior area manager, Mr Thembelani Sibanda, said the majority of gold panners did not have special permits to mine in the area and as such were mining illegally.\n\nThe farm was set aside as a reserved area for cattle rearing and only miners with special grants are allowed to work here. ZimParks acknowledges the growing problem of illegal mining in this area and our plea is for all the stakeholders to work together to flush out the illegal gold panners, he said.\n\nConflict of interest between mining and farming is not peculiar to this farm alone so a holistic approach is needed to solve problems that emanate from such situations,\n\nAccording to the EMA provincial manager, Mr Decent Ndlovu, the area in and around the Pilossof farm is one of the worst degraded places in the province as a result of illegal mining activities.\n\nWe classify this area as a hotspot in terms of illegal mining because it is one of the worst degraded places in the province. The farmers have been here since 2014 and have invested a lot in terms of rehabilitating the area and today it keeps thousands of cattle. So, its sad when all that good work is destroyed by illegal mining activities, said Mr Ndlovu.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-intelligent-traffic-enforcement-proper-infrastructure-key/",
            "content": "Motorists have been complaining that some police officers deployed to roadblocks and checkpoints that are doing such good work have been returning to the days before the Second Republic of concentrating on trivial infringements and overtight enforcement of minor offences.\n\nMost people, and that includes the respectable kombi owners and their drivers and their passengers, go along with the enforcement campaign that has been seeing a lot more public transport owners going through the procedures and registering and licensing their kombis after meeting the set of rational requirements.\n\nThis is enlightened self-interest, since those who do not simply see fines mounting up and risk having their kombis impounded. But a growing percentage of the kombi fleet is now a lot safer and the mushikashika are being tamed at least, even if they still operate on backroads.\n\nNor will most drivers, even if they take chances themselves at times, complain about the police concentrating on proper enforcement of safety laws. So police action to control speeding, drinking while driving, dangerous overtaking, sweeping in front of oncoming traffic when turning and other serious offences will be accepted as right and proper.\n\nBut we have, reportedly, had police officers complaining about the make of fire extinguishers and the colour of reflective jackets, about the type and condition of reflective triangles, about number-plate lights in broad daylight and other trivia. Admittedly laws and regulations need to be enforced but for this sort of offence, if action is thought to be needed, all that is needed is a warning and perhaps an appointment at a local station to show the checking officer the proper extinguisher or whatever in a few days time.\n\nWe have commented before on the need for police to be properly equipped with speed traps and breathalysers. Every traffic expert puts speeding and driving while over the blood-alcohol limit as causing a high proportion of accidents, along with reckless driving which should include unsafe overtaking and swerving suddenly across traffic lanes to make a turn. Even traffic lights and stop signs should be obeyed, although we do not need a return to fining people stopping 2cm over a stop line or stopping for just a second.\n\nTraffic law enforcement requires smart policing, being very tough on the dangerous driving and the dangerous vehicles and putting the public at risk, while at the same time using a combination of warnings and perhaps fix-it checks for minor matters.\n\nFor the very dangerous driving we would like to move away from fines and start seeing community service introduced. Fines are just an irritation for the rich but can hammer the less well off severely. A couple of days of community service would be more egalitarian. Gangs of offenders could be used to cut verge grass and pick up rubbish along our highways.\n\nThe enforcement campaign has also made clear that there is a severe lack of simple and basic infrastructure in some places, and that people were offending because their options were limited.\n\nBus stops are one problem, at least in Harare. There is a serious lack of properly marked bus stops. Informal bus stops can be dangerous for everyone, and we see the point of enforcement to stop their use, but the real bus stops where the bus or kombi pulls into the kerb for a minute or two are safe if they are correctly positioned.\n\nThe city centre terminus is not always the most obvious or convenient place to get off. We would like to see the Harare City Council, in consultation with the major associations representing kombi owners and the police, return to a reasonable grid of proper bus stops as we once had in the city centre and along bus routes.\n\nEach stop might mean the loss of two or three parking bays, but this would be a trivial loss of parking and a massive jump in convenience, as well as removing temptations from kombi drivers anxious to please pleading passengers. We used to have these proper bus stops marked out on the road and with the bus stop signs, made from precast concrete, but they have all gone over the years in the desperate desire to squeeze in just one extra parking bay.\n\nThere is a similar need to have properly signposted bus stops outside the city centre along all bus routes with enough verge graded for a bus to stop, so that buses and kombis can pick up and drop off passengers safely. These stops should not be allowed to become a sort of terminus, with a kombi parked while it awaits customers, those can be at shopping centres, but we do need places where people can wave down a bus or get off to go home.\n\nAnother major jump in safety outside the city centre would be to replace as many suburban traffic lights as possible with roundabouts. Some past city planners used to create road reserves with the adjacent stand corners cut off at major intersections so there is often enough space for a roundabout.\n\nApparently the cost of a roundabout and a set of traffic lights are about the same. So where there is enough space in the road reserve we should go for the roundabout, which enforces a slower speed, works during load shedding, does not have people stopped and waiting for thieves in the middle night, and generally ensures smoother traffic flows.\n\nSpeed humps can help in some places, but again we need proper design rather than a great mound across the road designed to smash the sump on anything smaller than a truck.\n\nThere are some places with low rumble humps, that slow traffic to acceptable speeds but do not force almost everyone to almost stop and this intelligent design should be more common.\n\nThese sort of intelligent infrastructure additions, like proper bus stops, roundabouts, rumble strips and the like can help the police enforce good safety by simply making it a lot harder to commit the offence in the first place, and they work 24 hours a day.\n\n",

The President is there and was elected for five years. This is his second term of office. Why am I making this statement or press statement? There are certain statements which are being made about the President and I dont think they are proper, he said.\n\nCde Ncube said the war veterans body had proper channels of communication and described Cde Gezas recent statements as unconstitutional with potential to destabilise the country.\n\nHe said the war veterans association was fully behind the President and his entire Cabinet to steer the country forward.\n\nIf we find ourselves as war veterans challenging our President and making such statements, I dont think that is proper. Those who feel the President must resign today must revisit the constitution which gives him the mandate because he was voted into office by the majority so they must not make such careless statements, he said.\n\nCde Ncube urged the veterans of the struggle to be patient as the Second Republic was seized with several projects meant to better their lives.\n\nI am pleased to announce that I have managed to meet our Patron President Emmerson Mnangagwa twice since I assumed office. I can safely say we have managed to get a desk at the Ministry of Mines. Minister Chitando has given us a desk where we present grievances. We have also engaged with Minister of Finance and we are compiling projects for Comrades which need start-up capital. When we are done, I will be meeting with President Mnangagwa to give him feedback on our progress. We also have a local businessman who has offered his hospital infrustructure where we can get medical attention for free as war veterans, he said.\n\nPan African Hospital founder Cde Jimayi Muduvuri who also attended the press conference said he established a hospital in Kadoma that will be catering for war veterans.\n\nI want to say as business people, we should be grateful to the gallant sons and daughters who sacrificed their lives for the freedom we enjoy today.\n\nI am building Pan African hospitals in all the countrys provinces which are named after the countrys luminaries.\n\nThese institutions are open for the veterans of the struggle, the elderly as well as people with disabilities who can access services for free, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "CAIRO.  US President Donald Trumps recent remarks on Palestinians have sparked strong rejection across the Arab world, with experts warning of their grave implications for regional peace and stability.\n\nTrump suggested Saturday relocating over a million Palestinians from Gaza to neighbouring countries where they can maybe live in peace for a change, a plan unequivocally rejected by Jordan, Egypt, Palestine, and the Arab League comprising all 22 Arab states.\n\nHis remarks came after Israel and Hamas began implementing a ceasefire agreement on January 19, brokered by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States, halting deadly fighting that had lasted for over 15 months.\n\nPEACE AT RISK\n\nMany Arab experts believed that Trumps proposal limits chances for Middle East peace, derails the two-state solution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and intensifies tensions in a region already plagued by crises.\n\nAhmed Kandil, head of the international studies unit at Cairo-based Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, said such US ideas ignore the root cause of the conflict, referring to Israels occupation of Palestinian territories.\n\nThe insistence of Trumps administration on not addressing the root causes of the Palestinian issue will only prolong and complicate the crisis and spread chaos in the region, the Egyptian said.\n\nKandil stressed that the solution lies in the UN resolutions that affirm the Palestinian peoples right to establish their independent state on the 1967 borders, warning of the consequences of Washingtons blind support for Tel Aviv.\n\nHe further criticised Trumps idea of relocating Palestinians to neighbouring countries as absurd and illogical.\n\nIt is unreasonable to expect these countries to shoulder the liquidation of the Palestinian cause in favour of Israels far-right movement, Kandil said, warning that such a US approach undermines any prospects for lasting peace.\n\nGiven the regions control of the Suez Canal, a vital route for international trade, and its role as a major oil exporter, any chaos or instability in this region will negatively impact US interests, the interests of its European allies, and the global economy, according to Kandil.\n\nFor his part, former Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Barakat Al-Farra said that Trumps proposal adds fuel to the fire in a vulnerable region suffering from chaos in several spots, including Lebanon, Yemen, and Syria, among others.\n\nWhen the United States, the worlds greatest power, puts forward such a proposal, it only complicates the problems and worsens the situation in the volatile Middle East region, he said, stressing that the US complete bias towards Israel harms regional peace, security, and stability, as well as the US interests in the region.\n\nThe consequences will be dire if the United States insists on holding onto this vision, Al-Farra said.\n\nGAZANS RETURNING HOME\n\nThe resilience of Palestinians in the face of adversity has been on full display as hundreds of thousands of internally displaced residents have recently returned to their homes in northern Gaza, even though those homes have been reduced to rubble during the conflict that has left over 47,000 Palestinians dead since October 7, 2023, according to Gazas health authorities.\n\nThis remarkable scene of throngs of Palestinians walking back home sends a powerful message about their determination to stay on their land and rejection of any displacement attempts, Al-Farra said.\n\nThe former Palestinian diplomat continued that the relocation proposal, coming from a so-called Mideast peace sponsor, is entirely unacceptable  both in form and substance  not only to Palestinians but to the entire Arab world, noting that it was also rejected by many European, Asian, and Latin American states, as well as Canada and Australia.\n\nAl-Farras view was echoed by Egyptian political science professor Tarek Fahmy, who saw that the return of hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Palestinians to their homes in northern Gaza practically demonstrates their rejection of the idea of displacement.\n\nFahmy highlighted the necessity of bringing the issue to the international arena, noting that Gaza evacuation is regionally and internationally rejected.\n\nIt seems that Trump, instead of calming the conflict in the Middle East, is further exacerbating tensions in the region, said the Egyptian professor.

I am still in the game though I am now 63 years old.\n\nFor now most of my time I will be in the fields. I am now into farming sorghum, maize, millet, and watermelons.\n\nI have been surviving on this apart from music shows, he said.\n\nThe veteran singer said has been in the music industry for 37 years.\n\nI did my first album  Ukubambana which was recorded in 1988 but before that, I used to work with my brother Solomon.\n\nThis year I have my album which I am currently working on and will be ready by August as I will be launching it at a venue yet to be announced.\n\nI have 35 albums under my sleeve and the new album will be my 36th. It is called, Inhlonipho which means Respect, and will carry eight tracks.\n\nThe album is based on teaching children about respect and to desist from drug abuse and early marriages, he said.\n\nBut how does he stay in shape and balance music and farming as a family man?\n\nI have 18 children and to stay in shape, I work very hard, and drink lots of water. I only eat traditional foods and fruits, I jog every morning and make sure I have enough time to sleep, said Chase.\n\nAsked what is the greatest moment in his career, the musician said was when he did the video of Banolila.\n\nSome say Banolila others Balolila but it is all the same.\n\nIn my career, my greatest moment was when I did a video of the hit song (Balolila), collaborating with IYASA.\n\nI miss that a lot and cherish it. This project stayed on top for seven years even up to date, some weddings without this song will be boring, he said.\n\nChase added that to make it in this industry one needs to be diligent and have integrity.\n\nTalent is an inborn thing that you cant take away from anyone.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the music industry, one needs to have good equipment, transportation to and from one place especially if you stay far away, good management, and be professional.\n\nArtists need to desist from drugs. Drugs are not good for health and mental.\n\nMy role model is Lovemore The Great Majayivana and we had a good working relationship and understanding of each other.\n\nMy band members are doing farming when we are not playing music, I have a project of breeding pigs. So far, the project is doing well, he said.\n\nGiven a chance, Chase said would like to work with the King of Sungura Alick Macheso.\n\nI admire Macheso, his consistency and love for music make me want to work with such a personality.\n\nChase said his last performance was on New Years Day at the Hakuna Keziin, Matabeleland South.\n\nIt is an annual event and this time around they invited me.\n\nThe event served as a gathering for the Kalanga people, a way to revive and celebrate their rich heritage.\n\nAs he continues to inspire through music, Chase remains a vibrant force, intertwining the threads of tradition and modernity, reminding us all of the beauty in both laughter and tears.\n\nThrough his heartwarming melodies and unwavering commitment to his community, Chase embodies the spirit of resilience and hope.\n\nIn every note of Banolila, one can hear the echoes of a life well-liveda life filled with love, struggle, and an unyielding passion for music that transcends time and space.\n\n",
