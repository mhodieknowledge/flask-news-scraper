The authority, working with the Zimbabwe Republic Police, will not hesitate to prosecute offenders.\n\nMCAZ reassured the public that it remained committed to protecting public health by ensuring that only safe, effective and approved medicines are advertised and sold within Zimbabwe.\n\nMembers of the public have been encouraged to contact the MCAZ directly for more information.\n\n",
