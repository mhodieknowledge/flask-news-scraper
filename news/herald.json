            "content": "Zvamaida Murwira\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nSadc has resolved to withdraw its troops deployed in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) while non-military solutions are being pursued to end hostilities in the Great Lakes region.\n\nThis came out from the Extraordinary virtual summit which drew Heads of State and Government from across the region chaired by President Mnangagwa yesterday to reflect on the conflict in eastern DRC.\n\nSadc had deployed troops from Tanzania, Malawi and South Africa to help contain the raging conflict pitting DRC Government forces and armed group M23 in the eastern Congo.\n\nThe conflict has left thousands of people dead, with millions of them including women, children, the elderly and the disabled displaced.\n\nThe regional bloc deployed troops under the Sadc Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC) to help end the conflict.\n\nThe troops were deployed on 15 December 2023 after an Extraordinary Sadc Summit held in Windhoek, Namibia in May of the same year to support the Government of DRC owing to the resurgence of armed groups.\n\nIn his closing remarks, President Mnangagwa described the withdrawal as bold.\n\nOn the basis of well-considered factors and reflections on the initial mandate, this Extraordinary SADC Summit has made the bold decision to withdraw our mission from the eastern DRC. The withdrawal of SAMIDRC notwithstanding, our august regional body will remain seized with the political and security situation in eastern DRC, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nAllow me, as we conclude our meeting, to extend sincere appreciation and gratitude to the Troop Contributing Countries and all Member States, for the backing rendered to SAMIDRC. As our mission enters a withdrawal phase, we appeal for continued support, to facilitate the safe withdrawal of all our troops and evacuation of our equipment.\n\nHe called for the implementation of decisions made at the Joint SADC-East African Community meeting.\n\nThese include the merger of the Luanda and Nairobi Peace Processes, more so that dialogue is a key cog to usher lasting peace to the people of DRC. Our collective pursuit for peace is the greatest tribute we can accord our heroes and heroines, both living and fallen, who selflessly answered the call of duty. Their sacrifice can never be in vain, he said.\n\nThe summit resolution followed an Extraordinary Troika summit on the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Affairs chaired by Tanzanian President Dr Samia Suluhu Hassan that met last week and tabled their report for consideration yesterday.\n\nIn his speech to officially open the Extraordinary Summit, President Mnangagwa called for the cessation of hostilities in DRC, saying it had the potential to spread to other borders.\n\nAs we convene today, we remain cognisant of the fact that repercussions of the instability extend beyond the DRC borders, affecting the broader region at large. It is noteworthy that the implementation of the resolutions of the Joint SADC-EAC Summit is now underway, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nEmphasis must be on collaborative strategies to improve peace and security in the DRC. SADC thus, welcomes efforts by the International Community to end the conflict, particularly, the adoption of Resolution 2773 by the United National Security Council. This resonates with the ongoing initiatives by our African regional bodies. As SADC, we reaffirm our commitment to play our part in promoting lasting and sustainable peace. In this regard, an inclusive and comprehensive dialogue process is essential, to strengthen security mechanisms that safeguard the human rights and dignity of the affected communities. Undoubtedly, there have been many setbacks and challenges in our quest for peace in eastern DRC.\n\nDelivering his introductory remarks, SADC Executive Secretary Mr Elias Magosi said there was need to protect the Sadc-EAC platform saying it was the only trusted structure by stakeholders including the belligerents.\n\nI wish to also highlight, Your Excellencies, that the EAC-SADC engagement process must be protected and nurtured. It is probably the only structure in recent times that has brought some level of trust for both the DRC and Rwanda, and hope to multiple stakeholders, namely the SADC and EAC regions, the African Union Peace and Security Council, the UN Security Council, and the international community.\n\nThe two RECs must, therefore, jealously guard this structure and ensure it does not become another failed process. We must do everything in our power, as SADC especially, and ensure this structure achieves its objectives, and that it remains credible, trusted and free from blemishes, said MrMagosi.\n\nHe described the security situation in eastern DRC as worrisome and continued to be a concern for the region.\n\nThe attacks by the M23 armed group against DRC Government Forces, SAMIDRC Troops, and the civilian population and the subsequent capture of various cities and towns in the area, have resulted in the loss of lives and injuries, and led to a sharp increase in internally displaced persons, forcing many people, particularly women, children, the elderly and disabled, to flee their homes. SADC strongly condemns the unwarranted attacks on innocent people by the rebel groups and is resolute in standing in solidarity with our sister country, to address the prevailing security challenges through the relevant SADC structures, he said.\n\nThe situation is compounded by the blockade of main supply routes and the capture by the M23 Armed Group of both Goma International Airport and Kavumu Airport in Bukavu. Urgent diplomatic intervention is, therefore, needed to open these airports to facilitate delivery of humanitarian assistance and allow SADC and its structures to find an immediate and workable solution for our Mission.\n\nAfter the two-hour engagement, Mr Magosi, leading a secretariat team from the regional bloc in Harare, read out the communique which indicated that Heads of State and Governments had resolved to withdraw their troops.\n\nYesterdays meeting was attended by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister, Professor Amon Murwira, Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri Kashiri, Minister of State for National Security, Lovemore Matuke, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Barbara Rwodzi, and Zimbabwe Defence Forces Commander General Valerio Sibanda.\n\n",

Your hospitality has indeed enabled us to have a deep appreciation of Zimbabwes culture and strengthen our bonds of friendship with the people of Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nMr Magosi expressed gratitude to the Second Republic for the exquisite hospitality and facilities availed to them since the commencement of Zimbabwes tenure as chair.\n\nWe thank you for the warm reception and excellent facilities put at our disposal for the conduct of our meeting today, and for the meetings lined up in the coming days, he said.\n\nMr Magosi said Zimbabwes capability, in not only hosting but championing the SADC agenda during its tenure, had set the bar for future Chairpersons, particularly Madagascar, which is the incoming Chair.\n\nI am certain that the Incoming Chair of Council, Honourable Rasata Rafaravavitafika, and her team are taking copious notes and drawing enriching lessons from Zimbabwes hosting of SADC and driving its agenda. The reception for SADC in Antananarivo can only be better, if not at the same level, he said.\n\nUnder President Mnangagwas leadership as Chair, Mr Magosi said the regional bloc had attained several milestones.\n\nThis includes taking ownership of the SADC Secretariat Headquarters Building in Botswana, which, for the past 15 years, was managed through a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) Agreement.\n\nThe SADC House was officially received by the Chairperson of SADC, His Excellency Dr Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, together with the President of the Republic of Botswana, Advocate Duma Gideon Boko, on 13 December 2024, on behalf of the SADC Heads of State and Government.\n\nThis represents a significant milestone, as the SADC region now owns that magnificent building, towering at the foot of the Gaborone Central Business District, he said.\n\nMr Magosi said on the same day, the SADC Chairperson and President of Botswana led the groundbreaking ceremony, marking the commencement of the construction of the SADC Standby Force Regional Logistics Depot in Rasesa Village, in the Kgatleng District of Botswana, on behalf of all SADC Heads of State and Government.\n\nThis Depot will strengthen the capability of the SADC Standby Force for rapid deployment in peace support and humanitarian operations.\n\nThrough the regional blocs missions in Mozambique and now in the DRC, SADC has already secured equipment that will be housed at the Regional Logistics Depot once construction is completed.\n\nPeace and security remain critical to our regions integration and economic development, Mr Magosi said.\n\n",

Such behaviour only benefits opposition forces, Cde Muchinguri-Kashiri said.\n\nShe commended the partys Information and Publicity Department for developing a robust social media policy to curb the misuse of online platforms by members.\n\nCde Muchinguri-Kashiri urged party leaders to focus on highlighting the partys achievements and fulfilling its promises to the people to gain the electorates confidence.\n\nShe said President Mnangagwa, as the partys First Secretary, is the face of Zanu PF, and any member found denigrating him would face penalties.\n\nOur President and the entire Presidium must be protected by shunning factionalism, which is a creation of self-serving individuals. This behaviour poses a national security risk, Cde Muchinguri-Kashiri said.\n\nThe indaba was attended by Politburo members, Central Committee members, Ministers of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, provincial chairpersons, and other senior party officials.\n\nCde Muchinguri-Kashiri reiterated the importance of discipline and adherence to party protocols, emphasising that unity is crucial for achieving the partys goals.\n\nWe cannot afford indiscipline, distractions, or lethargy. Let us draw inspiration from our partys rich history and the sacrifices of our forebearers, she said.\n\nCde Muchinguri-Kashiri also addressed concerns about the handling of disciplinary cases, noting that some Provincial Disciplinary Committees (PDCs) were failing to exercise due diligence.\n\nShe warned against the escalation of unresolved primary election disputes and the misuse of disciplinary processes to settle personal scores.\n\nSome members are using Government resources to campaign in constituencies where there are duly elected MPs. This behaviour will not be tolerated, Cde Muchinguri-Kashiri said, adding that a circular would be issued to address these issues.\n\nShe emphasised the importance of empowering women and veterans of the liberation struggle through self-help economic projects.\n\nCde Muchinguri-Kashiri praised President Mnangagwas initiatives, such as the Presidential Solar, Borehole, and Loan Schemes for war veterans, as examples of his commitment to building the nation through itspeople.\n\n",

            "content": "Columbus Mabika\n\nHerald Reporter\n\nGovernment has taken a tough stance to curtail the influx of smuggled goods into the domestic market to protect local industry from unfair competition, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube, has said.\n\nThis comes amid the growing twin challenge of smuggled goods and counterfeit products.\n\nDelivering a presentation titled, Macro Economic Stabilisation Policies to participants of the Joint Command and Staff Course at the Zimbabwe Staff College in Harare yesterday, Prof Ncube said, going forward, authorities would treat all alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages and basic commodities, including refined sugar, detergents, and dairy products, as smuggled items unless the owner can produce evidence of customs duty payment.\n\nHis presentation was read on his behalf by the ministrys chief director of economic affairs, Mr Joseph Mverecha.\n\nProf Ncube said while authorities have already rolled out a nationwide blitz targeting smuggled goods, the channel through which most counterfeits find their way into the domestic market, some of the imitations are being manufactured in\n\nlocal backyard industries.\n\nSmuggled and counterfeit goods worth millions of United States dollars have been seized since the authorities started the raids.\n\nSmuggled goods command a huge demand among consumers given their low prices since they neither pay import duties nor taxes.\n\nBy reducing demand for goods sold by registered or compliant operators, smuggled goods and cheap counterfeits cause viability challenges for affected companies or industries, resulting in their inability to meet statutory tax obligations, keep jobs or create new ones.\n\nThe affected companies or industries incapacity to pay their tax obligations also negatively impacts the Governments ability to implement public programmes such as building roads, rail, schools, and hospitals and equipping public institutions with requisite resources.\n\nApart from their potential negative impact on the economy and local companies, authorities say the illicit and smuggled goods pose serious health risks.\n\nIn his presentation, Prof Ncube said the economy remains on a firm growth trajectory, although it faces several challenges including a trade deficit, low fiscal revenue, unsustainable public wage bill and debt, energy and infrastructure deficiency, price instability and exchange rate volatility, lack of funding and growing informalisation.\n\nDespite mounting headwinds, Zimbabwe is projected to register a six percent growth driven by a strong recovery in agriculture and strong performance of the mining and tourism sectors.\n\nMost smuggled goods and counterfeit products are traded in the informal sector, which has negatively impacted fiscal revenue, the viability of registered companies and the manufacturing industry.\n\nAlcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, dairy products, washing powder, detergents and sugar, among others, are now deemed as smuggled unless sellers provide documentary evidence that customs duty was paid for, said Prof Ncube.\n\nTo address informalisation, he said, the Government had taken measures to level the playing field.\n\nThese include the introduction of a 5 percent withholding tax payable to wholesalers and manufacturers to enforce tax compliance among unregistered small to medium enterprises.\n\nThe value-added tax registration threshold was reduced from US$40 000 to US$25 000 to promote formalisation.\n\nProf Ncube said the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe established the targeted finance facility to provide affordable working capital to the productive sectors of the economy, while Micro and Small enterprises are required to transact through point-of-sale machines and operate a bank account linked to the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority.\n\nProf Ncube said given the persistent inflationary pressures, the Government had adopted tight monetary and fiscal policy measures that include interest rate adjustment, exchange rate management mechanisms such as forex auctions, and the gold-backed Zimbabwe Gold currency.\n\nHe said his ministry implemented fiscal consolidation measures to ensure disciplined public expenditure and reduce reliance on monetary expansion as a financing tool.\n\nIn the outlook, Prof Ncube said inflation and the exchange rate were projected to remain stable on account of tight monetary and fiscal policies.\n\nSince 2018, the Government has implemented a mix of policy adjustments and compliance measures to increase revenue collection and reduce fiscal deficits.\n\nThe implementation of these revenue enhancement measures has played a crucial role in substantially reducing the budget deficit that has been a challenge to the economy for years, Prof Ncube said.\n\nGovernment, he said, was engaged in discussions with the International Monetary Fund on a new Staff Monitored Programme to stabilise the economy and support debt resolution efforts.\n\nThe SMPs reflect our ongoing efforts to implement economic reforms and normalise relations with international creditors, Prof Ncube said.\n\nThe minister gave an update on efforts to address the countrys infrastructure deficit, saying over the years, Zimbabwe had faced infrastructure challenges that include deteriorating roads, inadequate water and sanitation systems, unreliable energy supply, shortage of schools, hospitals, bridges and limited telecoms.\n\n",

The goal is to reach drought-affected communities, assisting both urban and rural communities, he said.\n\nHe commended the First Lady for her charity work and her role as Wildlife Ambassador.\n\nHe expressed his willingness to work with her.\n\nWe have a lot of projects we want to undertake in different sectors, such as agriculture, health, and education. We will coordinate with you, he said.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, the First Lady expressed gratitude for the donation.\n\nThe donation will definitely play a vital role in addressing the food challenges faced by our affected communities, and we are really appreciative of this gesture. There is so much human and wildlife conflict in that area and our people are found walking up and about to get food. They even go to areas that they are not allowed to go, hence disasters like being trampled upon by elephants, being killed by lions. The donation has come at a time when we needed it most, so that we can save our peoples lives, she said.\n\nThe mother of the nation said she extended her heartfelt appreciation to the Government of United Arab Emirates for its unwavering support following the devastating El Nino-induced drought of 2023-2024 season.\n\nThis drought, she said, marked one of the most challenging periods in the countrys history, necessitating the need for robust drought mitigation programmes and the continued support from long-standing partners like the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThis donation will significantly alleviate some of the hardships encountered by our communities, including food destruction by wildlife.\n\nWildlife Ambassador First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa, Minister Sithembiso Nyoni and other delegates listen to United Arab Emirates Ambassador to Zimbabwe Dr Jassim AI Qasimi during the donation of mealie meal at Zimbabwe House yesterday\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Government and people of United Arab Emirates, particularly the Ambassador, His Excellency Dr Jassim Mohammed Al-Qassim, for your instrumental role in facilitating this generous contribution. Supporting community levels is essential for achieving long-term conservation success.\n\nWhen local communities are invested in conservation efforts, we foster collaboration and partnerships among communities, development partners, the Government and the private sector.\n\nDistinguished guests, allow me to also extend my sincerest appreciation to the various Ministries for their instrumental role in building a very strong relationship between the United Arab Emirates in all their conservation and community support. Your tireless efforts and commitment to supporting vulnerable communities have not gone unnoticed, she said.\n\nThe intervention by the UAE, she said, clearly resonates well with the call by President Mnangagwa to promote engagement and re-engagement at various levels.\n\nThis re-engagement programme has seen us be able to communicate with other countries. We are now getting all this help to develop our country. This community support programme aligns seamlessly with our Governments commitment to achieving an upper-middle-income economy by 2030, whilst ensuring that no one and no place is left behind. As we receive this donation today, let us remember that it is more than a handout. It symbolises our shared humanity.\n\nTogether we can build stronger, more resilient communities that thrive in harmony with our environment. I strongly believe that this contribution will significantly impact the lives of individuals and families living near protected areas, who often bear the brunt of human wildlife conflict, she said.\n\nDr Mnangagwa pointed out that Matabeleland North Province was a dry province, and the food assistance would alleviate hunger and help people in that province.\n\nZimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority director-general Professor Edson Gandiwa said as part of the engagement and re-engagement thrust, they had engaged colleagues based in the National Arab Emirates who were leasing an area in the Matetsi Safari Area, which is in the north-west of Zimbabwe.\n\nWe are leasing Matetsi Unit 1, to an institution from the Arab Emirates by the name Umlando Hunters. So this area basically manages the wildlife, but they also draw conservative tourism, which is more of hunting. And following that agreement, which was signed last year, we then, as part of the engagement, also seeing areas of support, the embassy and Umlando secured the donation targeting communities that are living next to protected areas.\n\nYour Excellency, the issues of human-wildlife conflict are challenging. And also that last season, the Government declared a drought due to El Nio-induced conditions, so we are grateful that the embassy saw it fit to support our communities. The target basically is the underprivileged and disadvantaged communities, whom we know you always have passion to try and uplift Amai. The target is approximately 600 households that will benefit, he said.\n\nProf Gandiwa said the first distribution will be conducted as from next week and indicated the challenges they were facing linked to human-wildlife conflict.\n\nJust to indicate that communities that live adjacent to National Parks and as we also highlighted during the World Wildlife Day commemorations, they encounter a number of challenges. The first being related to climate change. This affected cropping particularly and also livestock production, which made our communities become more vulnerable.\n\nJust to pick your Amai, from the period 2023 to date, we have lost 17 people that have been killed by wild animals. And many livestock have also been killed, he said.\n\nProf Gandiwa said he looked forward to working with the First Lady in community awareness programmes.\n\nIn her remarks, Environment, Climate and Wildlife Minister Dr Sithembiso Nyoni said: Our natural heritage, a cornerstone of our economic prosperity and national identity, demands a proactive and multifaceted approach to ensure its long-term sustainability. Specifically, I wish to champion the strategic utilisation of both foreign partnership initiatives and robust corporate social responsibility programmes.\n\nBy supporting sustainable livelihood projects, promoting environmental education and partnering with local organisations, business can contribute to a thriving and resilient ecosystem where both people and wildlife can flourish, she said.\n\nDr Nyoni said she understood the profound challenges faced by communities living in close proximity to wildlife.\n\nThe realities of human-wildlife-conflict, including livestock predation, crop destruction, limited access to vital resources and the escalating pressures of climate change and infrastructure development are significant hurdles to sustainable livelihoods, she said.\n\nThe minister also expressed gratitude to the embassy of the UAE for the maize meal donation.\n\n",

            "content": "Eddie Chikamhi\n\nZimpapers Sports Hub\n\nNGEZI Platinum Stars coach Takesure Chiragwi was at Rufaro last Sunday when star-studded newboys Scottland upstaged giants CAPS United in a fiercely contested Castle Lager Premiership match.\n\nHe was flanked by national team coach Michael Nees, as the two were on a mission to have a final look at some of the local players they intended to call up for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers.\n\nEventually, six of the nine locally based players were called up from Scottland, cementing their status as one of the strongest teams in the country.\n\nThis afternoon, Chiragwi is expected to return to the same venue knowing exactly what to expect as his Ngezi Platinum Stars face the Mabvuku side.\n\nThis ultimately could turn out to be another strong test for the newboys, who have so far passed with flying colours after facing Triangle and CAPS United in their opening two league games.\n\nNgezi Platinum Stars, who won their only league title in 2023 under Chiragwi, have started the season on a promising note.\n\nThey collected a point away from newly promoted side Kwekwe United before their 1-0 win over GreenFuel at home last week.\n\nThe Mhondoro side have a competitive side with players like Obrey Chirinda, Malvin Gaki, Farai Madhanaga, Richard Hachiro, Nyasha Gurende, and former Golden Boot winner Takunda Benhura.\n\nBut the quality Scottland would boast more in terms of quality after the newboys raided the market during the pre-season and beefed up with some of the best players in the league.\n\nScottland coach Tonderai Ndiraya admitted he was spoilt for choice because of the depth of his squad. Six of his players, led by Khama Billiat, Walter Musona, Mthokozisi Msebe, Godknows Murwira, Tymon Machope, and Peter Muduhwa, are expected to leave for national team duty soon after the match.\n\nNdiraya indicated that he would be rotating the players as he looks to build a strong unit. Ndiraya believes Scottland are still under construction despite a strong start that saw them winning both games against highly competitive sides Triangle and CAPS United.\n\nWere still in the process of building a team, he said.\n\nHopefully in the next few matches, after a few games, those players will start to understand each other.\n\nThey will start to play as a team. And then ultimately, the distance. So, at the moment, theres nothing to talk about apart from certain individuals who came from other teams.\n\nTheres nothing to talk about, apart from talking about Khama himself, in his individual capacity, Walter Musona, Mthokozisi Msebe, and Tymon Machope in their individual capacities. But of course, football is all about quality, if you ask me.\n\nWith quality, what we are expecting from the squad at the moment is for those individuals to perform and give us results. At least we are in the process of building a team. So in the next few games, well be talking of a different story.\n\nBut as of now, nothing to talk about. We are still a new team, newly assembled. A team that is still getting to understand each other. Look, coming to our preparations, no complaints, no complaints despite the rains.\n\nScottland are the only team with a 100 percent winning record. But the situation at the top of the table could change overnight should Ngezi Platinum Stars prevail.\n\nThere will be six matches tomorrow as GreenFuel hosts giants Highlanders while Simba Bhora welcomes bogey side Herentals at Wadzanayi Stadium. Dynamos will be at Rufaro again this week as they entertain Hebert Maruwas TelOne.\n\nNewboys MWOS will be looking to continue with their positive start to Premiership life when they host Yadah at Baobab, while a battle of minnows featuring Kwekwe United and Bikita Minerals awaits at Bata Stadium. Former champions FC Platinum will travel to Luveve to face Chicken Inn, who are still looking for a first win after drawing the two opening fixtures. FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza was optimistic ahead of the trip despite the rain disruptions to their preparations this week.\n\nI think it has been raining since Monday, said Mapeza.\n\nThe pitch is a little bit muddy.\n\nIts always very important for us to manage our training sessions. The pitch is a little bit heavy. But I cant say much in terms of our preparations. (They have been) brilliant, brilliant. The guys are pushing. You can tell everybody is ready for the game.\n\nWeve been talking about the Chicken Inn game since Tuesday when we started training; a very important game for us. Last year, we went there, and we lost 2-0. But then, I thought we had a very good first half. Second half, we just collapsed. But its part of football. So, we know the challenges were going to face on Saturday.\n\nFixtures:\n\nToday:Scottland v Ngezi Platinum Stars (Rufaro),\n\nTomorrow:GreenFuel v Highlanders (GreenFuel Arena), Simba Bhora v Herentals (Wadzanayi Stadium), Dynamos v TelOne (Rufaro), Chicken Inn v FC Platinum (Luveve), MWOS v Yadah (Baobab Stadium), Kwekwe United v Bikita Minerals (Bata Stadium)\n\nSunday: Manica Diamonds v ZPC Kariba (Sakubva), Triangle v CAPS United (GreenFuel Arena)\n\n",

She contends that she will suffer irreparable harm if the court does not intervene urgently.\n\nDespite her claims, Justice Zhou dismissed the application, though the specific reasons for the dismissal were not detailed in the report.\n\nThe ruling means Mabvirakures request for an interim order to regain control of the project and halt the respondents actions was denied.\n\n",

Isnt it crazy?\n\nActually, I have only been to one country in Africa through my singing, one country in Africa and thats Zimbabwe.\n\nCould you really believe that Cocoa Tea hasnt been to anywhere in Africa besides Zimbabwe, he said in an interview following the death of South Africas first black president and anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela in 2013.\n\nThe reggae singer, born Colvin Scott, was passionate about African unity and repatriation.\n\nBeing the son of a slave, our ancestors came from Africa. We belong to Africa but we were taken from Africa by our slave masters and sent to where I would like to call it, to the Carry  beyond.\n\nNow people call it the  Caribbean, I had to say Carry-beyond because it was far away from our land, he said.\n\nOur ancestors mean so much to us. Our identity, our past lead us to our future and if there is no Africa, there is no future for I man.\n\nSo repatriation means so much to me because I would like to go back to my mama land, to be with my tribe and my people and to be able to know where I am truly from.\n\nYou know it burns my heart every day when I dont know what tribe I am from, which village my tribe are from and where my ancestors are from.\n\nHis genuine love for Zimbabwe shone through as he spoke glowingly about the country as a key marker in his musical career.\n\nThe highlight must be the time I went back home to Zimbabwe and to see the reception I received from the people of Zimbabwe.\n\nIt was overwhelming. It touched my heart, tears came from my eyes to know that I am finally on the side of my mama land and to see all the people responding with love, he said.\n\nThey love us so much that I cant even talk about it. It is crazy to know that the people have so much love for us. I havent seen this yet.\n\nI am just thinking of people in Ghana, Botswana and Kenya, and places like Namibia, and places like Gambia, South Africa and all those places who have never seen me yet.\n\nCocoa Teas electric performance in Zimbabwe touched the hearts of reggae music lovers and the local Rastafari community.\n\nHis presence here solidified his place on the global musical arena.\n\nThe reggae stars death shocked many in Zimbabwe and left his fans in mourning.\n\nTributes are pouring in various social media reggae platforms, with many expressing their condolences and gratitude for Cocoa Teas music in his life.\n\nMany are celebrating the rich legacy he leaves behind, a legacy of melody, compassion, and cultural pride.\n\nMany took to their social media accounts to express their sorrow and pay tribute.\n\nDark moment for reggae fans. I will always cherish the day I met the legendary Jamaican musician Colvin George Scott aka Cocoa Tea, said Classic263 reggae producer and presenter Terry Mapurisana.\n\nIt was a great opportunity to share reggae notes with the iconic bredda when he visited Zimbabwe.\n\nI was one of those few journalists who were afforded the opportunity to interview Cocoa Tea. Deepest condolences to his family and all reggae fans. Said one reggae fan from Tafara: Thank you Cocoa Tea for your amazing music that had a great impact on my life. Rest in power my icon.\n\nReggae music lover and Bless It Up bus operator Absolom Muyambiri has so many memories of Cocoa Tea during his youth and when he attended the show by the reggae star in 2011.\n\nMy memories about Cocoa Tea are much more about his songs we listened to in the 1990s during dancehall shows at a club called Rumours.\n\nWe used to call it the Agony Centre and Cocoa Teas music was part of my youth, he said.\n\nWhen he came to Zimbabwe, I enjoyed his show. It was massive. It reminded me of my youthful days when we were growing up in Tafara listening to his powerful reggae tunes.\n\nHe is one great artist from Jamaica I admired. His death is a huge loss, he had a great voice.\n\nNo one can replace that great voice.\n\nI am mourning the loss of one of the finest voices.\n\n",
