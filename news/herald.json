However, he said Zimra had stated that those offering phone repair and other services were not being targeted.\n\nThey are targeting those who are not paying duty, especially those who deal with clothing, mobile phones, and accessories. However, those who repair phones do not seem to be affected, said Mr Manasidze.\n\nThey have instructed us to compile all the stock and submit it to them so they can calculate how much duty is owed.\n\nAffected traders, who were gathered outside the closed market, expressed their frustration, stating that the shutdown was a significant blow to their livelihoods. Many now face an uncertain wait for Zimra officials to resolve the issue.\n\nI dont know what to do; I will just wait for Zimra officials to see what they say next. I am hoping for an immediate resolution to this unexpected shutdown, said one trader, who chose to remain anonymous.\n\nOthers voiced concerns about losing customers and struggling to provide for their families due to the uncertainty of when they would be able to resume business.\n\nMeanwhile, retail outlets adjacent to the Central Police Station, among others, have also been closed in recent weeks as part of the same operation.
