Therefore, an earthquake with a smaller magnitude but with its epicentre closer to the dam wall could be more damaging than a large earthquake with an epicentre located far away from the dam wall.\n\nWithin this context, the earthquakes that have been experienced in Kariba, Siavonga and surrounding areas since the construction of the Kariba Dam are relatively small and have not generated large ground accelerations or vibrations as to cause concern regarding the safety of the dam wall.\n\nThe area experienced seven earthquakes this month, the most recent one with a magnitude of 4.9 occurring at 5:39 am this Monday.\n\nIts epicentre was triangulated to approximately 19km in the South-South East direction from Kariba Dam, at a depth of 10km within the Kariba reservoir, directly behind Antelope Island in Zimbabwe.\n\nHe added that earthquakes were primarily reservoir-induced seismic (RIS) activities that are triggered by not only the presence but also the water level fluctuations from the drawing down of the Kariba reservoir.\n\nSimilar experiences have been reported from the filling and subsequent operation of several other large dams and reservoirs worldwide.\n\n",

SADC, thus, expects all parties to the electoral process, both individually and collectively, to abide by the decision of the Council which should provide a constitutional way forward for the country, and facilitate the way to greater peace, normalcy, and stability in the interest of all Mozambicans, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nHe added that SADC stands ready to assist the incoming government, and people of Mozambique, in consolidating their electoral democracy on the basis of the court decision, which should be held sacrosanct by all.\n\nIndeed, this is what the rule of law is all about. Further, SADC urges the international community to respect the sovereign will of the people and the Republic of Mozambique, exhorting all concerned to constructively support all processes towards peace, law and order which the country and people sorely need and deserve.\n\nOur region witnessed a record number of national elections in the last two years, itself a loud testimony that democracy continues to find deeper roots and to flourish in our SADC region, he said.\n\nThe calls for peace in Mozambique come after opposition parties, which lost by a wide margin, rejected the ruling and started mobilising their supporters to destabilise the country.\n\nAlready, there are reports that since Mondays court ruling, 21 people, including two police officers, have died and 25 others injured.\n\nLaw enforcement remains on the ground to ensure peace and stability.\n\nFrelimo won the presidential election with 65,17 percent of votes cast, while Venncio Mondlane got 24,19 percent, Ossufo Momade of Renamo 6,62 percent, and Lutero Simango 4,02 percent.\n\nConstitutional Council President Lcia Ribeiro acknowledged irregularities in the electoral process, like any other election, but said they did not influence the outcome.\n\n",

Their rejection is based on political grounds because they are from the opposition party.\n\nThis has affected the councils revenue inflows, obviously the effect of such misdirected efforts is poor revenue inflows resulting in dwindling service delivery, said Cllr Chaombezvi.\n\nThe council has been coming under fire from residents for its failure to send monthly bills and collect refuse from businesses and residential areas.\n\nThe council also confirmed its advanced plans to issue monthly electronic bills. The chairperson also said the council had included lower fees for people who want to occupy market stalls it built last year to attract occupants.\n\nThe stalls had remained vacant because of exorbitant rental fees.

May the New Year ahead bring hope and greater prosperity for our motherland, Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, Christmas is a time for family, unity, and spirituality.\n\nZimbabweans are embracing the holiday season with enthusiasm and optimism, reflecting the countrys rich cultural heritage and strong sense of community.\n\nThe President said Zimbabwe remained a composite and solid unitary state despite its diverse norms, customs, languages and culture.\n\nFrom Zambezi to Limpopo, from Plumtree to Mutare, and across the most remote villages in our country, we sing with pride one national anthem and fly one national flag. We are diverse, but one.\n\nTo this end, this past week saw my administration concretise the Constitutionally enshrined obligation to give rights to every Zimbabwean citizen to hold and occupy agricultural land.\n\nHence, the bold decision to empower the beneficiaries of the Land Reform Programme through the issuance of Deeds of Transfer that will unlock the value of our land.\n\nThrough this historic act, these new tenure documents will be issued to the over 23 500 A2 and over 360 000 A1 farmers.\n\nThe celebration of this years Unity Day is, therefore, equally a jubilant occasion affirming that the land is now irreversibly with its people, and the people with their land, said President Mnangagwa.\n\nUnity, patriotism, peace, love and respect, he said, remained indispensable values in the countrys development matrix.\n\nI, therefore, call upon all citizens to commemorate this National Unity Day with sober reflections and recommit to the rich national heritage embodied in the historic Accord of 1987.\n\nNever, never, never again, should anything ever divide us.\n\nUnited we must stand, strong and solid as the walls of Great Zimbabwe, from which we derive our nations name.\n\nHand-in-hand, in unity, from village to the provincial level; sector-by-sector and industry-by-industry, Vision 2030 shall surely become a reality, said President Mnangagwa.\n\n",

Dr E. D. Mnangagwas term of office as President of the Republic of Zimbabwe and First Secretary of ZANU PF be extended beyond 2028 to 2030. The Party and Government should, therefore, set in motion the necessary amendments to the National Constitution so as to give effect to this resolution, reads the resolution.\n\nCde Muswere said any other meetings outside Zanu PF forums were private and of no relevance to partys processes.\n\nHe said noise makers outside Zanu PF were not part of the decision-making process.\n\nCde Muswere recently took time to explain and defend the partys ED2030 slogan and growing calls for President Mnangagwa to remain in office and continue the development trajectory beyond 2030.\n\nCde Muswere, who is also Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, and legislator for Makoni West Constituency, emphasised that the call for Mnangagwas continued leadership was an agreed party position, resolved and adopted at the annual national peoples conference.\n\nHe was responding to a question raised by Cde Gilbert Zowa, a recently elected war veterans association member, to clear the air on the slogan.\n\nCde Zowa had sought clarity on the ED2030 slogan, noting that President Mnangagwa himself had expressed disinterest in extending his term beyond 2028, despite the partys enthusiasm for his continued leadership.\n\nHe raised the issue during the Zanu PF Makoni District Coordination Committee (DDC) meeting held at the Makoni Rural District Council boardroom in Rusape.\n\nThe ED2030 slogan has garnered significant traction as party supporters overwhelmingly urge President Mnangagwa to extent his Presidency beyond the current constitutional two-term limit.\n\nCde Muswere said the resolution to extend President Mnangagwas leadership beyond 2030 is in line with Zanu PFs constitution, since the conference that endorsed the resolution had a full quorum, making it legally and properly constituted.\n\nHe highlighted importance of maintaining constitutional integrity and adherence to party principles and values when implementing such resolutions.\n\nCde Muswere said the extension of President Mnangagwas leadership is an opportunity to consolidate the ongoing economic, infrastructural and social transformation programmes, guaranteeing continuity in policies aimed at achieving Vision 2030. Stability and consistency in leadership, he said, are crucial for realising the countrys long-term goals.\n\nRegarding the ED2030 slogan, as Cde (Gilbert) Zowa mentioned, the President made his own announcement. However, our guiding principle on this matter should be the ZANU PF constitution, which stipulates the holding of the annual National Peoples Conference. The last conference was held in Bulawayo, which was attended by all the requisite party organs. Most of you here today attended that conference. This conference was attended by various party organs, including the Central Committee. It was legally and properly constituted, with the required quorum, he said.\n\nThe Central Committee report, which encompassed all resolutions from Provincial Coordination Committees (PCCs), was tabled. The resolutions from Zanu PF provinces were read out and unanimously adopted. The meeting also reviewed thematic committees deliberations. Most of you were in attendance at the conference, which was chaired by Zanu PF national chairperson, Cde Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri.
