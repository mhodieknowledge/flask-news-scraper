These approaches illustrate diverse methods of strengthening administrative justice.\n\nWe have gained first-hand exposure to best practices, which could inform discussions on improving service delivery.\n\nThe Zimbabwean public stands to benefit from enhanced accountability mechanisms. Government and public institutions may also experience improved oversight and service delivery practices as a result of knowledge gained during the visit.\n\nImmediate considerations may include efficiency improvements in ADR and case-handling procedures, with timelines dependent on institutional deliberations, resource availability and legal frameworks.\n\nObservations from all three benchmarking visits highlight different enforcement mechanisms, including the IGUs binding rulings and prosecution authority, which contribute to strengthening administrative justice.\n\nHowever, any considerations for changes will need further deliberations within the Commission, which are underway, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking during a meeting held in Bulawayo recently, ZHRC chairperson, Ms Jessie Majome said there is need to track the implementation of the recommendations of the National Inquiry on Access to Documentation.\n\nAdministrative justice was not receiving adequate attention yet it is so important. This resulted in the Commission establishing a department that deals with maladministration issues, she said.\n\nThe Commission has also escalated administrative justice awareness campaigns in its operations.\n\nThe inquiry brought to the fore the challenges faced by various groups in acquiring identity documents, including border lying communities, indigenous minorities, persons with disabilities, older persons and vulnerable children.\n\n",

Thousands of young people celebrated National Youth Day in style,packing three halls at the ZIEC. President Mnangagwa was the guest of honour.\n\nFor young Prince and his Form Four classmates from Milton High School, seeing and touching paving bricks made from discarded tyres was a first. The expressions on their faces showed they recognised the ingenuity of the innovation.\n\nIsheanesu Mukome, a Biochemistry graduate from the University of Zimbabwe (UZ), said that the paving brick innovation was born from a desire to protect the environment by repurposing non-biodegradable materials. Discarded tyres, a significant environmental hazard, can be transformed into durable and attractive paving blocks.\n\nOld tyres can be harmful to the environment if not disposed of in an environmentally friendly way, and we have found a way of turning them into paving bricks. One old tyre is shredded into very small pieces, and the wires are removed before we compact the material into paving bricks that are both durable and beautiful, said Mukome.\n\nHer stand proved popular with schoolchildren, fascinated by the idea of transforming old tyres into building materials traditionally made from sand and cement.\n\nNearby, Benson Manjengwa, another UZ graduate, was kept busy answering questions from schoolchildren eager to understand his innovation  a machine that turns plastic into fuel. Like a patient teacher, Manjengwa explained the process of converting this other notorious environmental pollutant into usable energy. The innovation, a Pyrolysis Plant, cost the team of innovators US$600 to build.\n\nPrincess Moyo of Lobengula High School was thrilled by the innovations she and her friends saw.\n\nThis years National Youth Day celebrations were different from previous ones because we learned a lot about how other young people are making all kinds of products and inventions that will make a difference in peoples lives. President Mnangagwa said the future is in our hands and that we should use science and technology to build our country, so Im happy that we got a chance to see how innovation and technology are good for Zimbabwe, said Princess.\n\nThe exhibitions provided a perfect opportunity for universities and colleges to showcase their offerings to students who will soon be choosing their tertiary education paths.\n\nThe world is now in the technological revolution, and this years National Youth Day celebrations gave us the perfect opportunity to show young learners what our university has to offer. The learners want to know what separates us from other universities and colleges so that they can make informed decisions when they finish high school, said a lecturer from a local university.\n\nIn Hall 3, the Mpopoma High School choir entertained exhibitors, schoolchildren, and guests with an impromptu singing session.\n\nIn Hall 4, where the main proceedings took place, the Head of State and Government addressed thousands of young people from across the countrys ten provinces. The hall erupted in applause when President Mnangagwa announced the countrys digital skills training programme, which aims to empower 1, 5 million young people nationwide.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the initiative will enhance digital literacy and skills among Zimbabwean citizens and empower a new generation of professionals who can contribute to technological innovation.\n\n",

Price fluctuations are primarily driven by global oil prices and exchange rate volatility.\n\nMinister Moyo acknowledged that while Zimbabwe cannot control external factors affecting fuel prices, the Government will focus on internal factors.\n\nThese include import duties and transportation costs.\n\nThe minister said the price of fuel at the port of discharge when compared to regional countries was significantly higher.\n\nFuel costs are a major expense, and their relatively high prices compared to regional countries disadvantage local products. This makes domestically produced goods more expensive, impacting their competitiveness both at home and abroad.\n\nWhile acknowledging the role of the existing fuel importers, Minister Moyo said the Governments goal was to provide predictable and competitively priced fuel to economic enablers to operate more efficiently.\n\nWe analyse and say, are we as competitive as Zimbabwe among those who we trade with? he said.When we look at ourselves here in the region, I think we are very expensive.\n\nSo, the Government is looking at all this, and as I said, we applaud those who are delivering fuel into our country.\n\nBut as Government, we have made some strides nowboth the Minister of Finance (Professor Mthuli Ncube) and I have been directed to make sure that we buy fuel for Government use and for other enablers of the economy, because Government is there to enable the economy to do well.\n\nWe have been directed to make sure that on the Government side and in any way, we should buy our fuel competitively because we used to do that so that we dont buy spot purchases on the international market, as the other 10 (traders) are doing.\n\nThe other 10, we think they are doing very well, but as Government . . . to compete, we should discuss with them, Minister Moyo added.\n\nThe Minister pointed to successful models in regional countries like Mozambique, Zambia, and Tanzania, where fuel traders collaborate with their governments to achieve competitive pricing.\n\nHe explained that while these countries have found effective ways to work with existing traders, Zimbabwes current strategy involved direct Government procurement to drive down fuel costs.\n\nMozambique has fuel traders, Zambia has fuel traders, Tanzania has fuel traders, but working with the Government, they have found a way of buying competitively, said Minister Moyo.\n\nBut for now, we want the Government (to) directly buy competitively, so that we can reduce the cost of fuel in the country, which impacts on your competitiveness.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA) has set the February maximum fuel prices at US$1,58 or ZiG 41,58 per litre for diesel, and US$1,53 or ZiG 40,50 per litre for blended petrol (E15).\n\nIn February, Zambias Energy Regulation Board (ERB) set the price of petrol at US$1,24 per litre and diesel at US$1,16 perlitre.\n\nMinister Moyo applauded existing fuel traders for maintaining a stable fuel supply despite challenges and assured the public that current fuel reserves, including supplies at ports and in pipelines, are sufficient.\n\nHowever, he reiterated that the Governments focus was now on improving the competitiveness of fuel procurement to lower costs.\n\n",
