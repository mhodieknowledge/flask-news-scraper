This is collective punishment at its worst, said Ambassador Almassri.\n\nThe ambassador also highlighted the broader implications of Israels actions, particularly in the wake of the recent military escalation in Gaza.\n\nThe world must see this for what it is, it is a war crime. Israels disregard for international law not only undermines Palestinian sovereignty but also sets a dangerous precedent for the rule of law globally, he said.\n\nThe State of Palestine has called on the international community to take decisive action.\n\nWe urge nations to demand the immediate and unconditional return of these funds, Ambassador Almassri said.\n\nAccountability must be enforced. The time for silence has passed.\n\nPalestine has also pledged to continue pursuing all available legal and diplomatic avenues to recover the seized funds and address what it describes as systematic violations of Palestinian rights.\n\n",
