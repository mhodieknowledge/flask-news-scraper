The trust that citizens place in our systems depends on how well we protect their information, she said.\n\nDr Beaullar Chirume urged the Government to accelerate digital transformation, which provides the foundation for safeguarding personal data.\n\nAs the Government accelerates digital transformation under the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), the success of e-government, e-commerce, and digital financial services depends on how well we implement and enforce data protection measures.\n\nPOTRAZ director Data Protection Unit Mrs Tsitsi Mariwo said as data controllers, they recognise that protecting individuals personal information is crucial for upholding human dignity and promoting trust in digital services.\n\nIt is everyones right to be free from intrusion on matters of a personal nature. The Cyber and Data Protection Act was put in place to promote accountability by all data controllers, she said.\n\nZimbabwe Human Rights Commissions Commissioner Martin Muduva said the workshop was a testament to the commitment of protecting the fundamental rights of Zimbabweans in the digital age.\n\nAs the ZHRC, we recognise the importance of this legislation in safeguarding the rights of individuals and promoting a safe and secure online environment.\n\nHe said Zimbabwes Constitution guarantees citizens rights to dignity (Section 51), security (Section 52), and privacy (Section 57), which are essential in protecting people against online harassment, cyber threats, and data breaches.\n\n",
