            "content": "Wallace Ruzvidzo and Gari Fadzi\n\nAfrican leaders have agreed that dialogue is the best way forward to the security crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, hence efforts will be made to persuade both parties to come to the table and cease the hostilities, President Mnangagwa has said.\n\nSpeaking to journalists upon his arrival from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, yesterday, where he attended the 38th Ordinary Session of the African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government, the President, who is also the SADC Chairperson, said the DRC security situation had been extensively discussed at the well-attended summit.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa was welcomed at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport State Pavillion by Vice Presidents Dr Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi, Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Dr Martin Rushwaya, Cabinet Ministers, Service Chiefs, Permanent Secretaries and other senior Government officials.\n\nWell, I can say it was well-attended by all the regions of Africa. And, of course, the main issue which we discussed, which I think was more critical, was the DRC.\n\nThe eastern DRC issue took centre stage and all Heads of State discussed about the promotion of dialogue in that area and that both sides should be persuaded to come to the table and cease the hostilities and the dislocation of communities, especially in the eastern DRC.\n\nI can say those are the major highlights, but the rest of Africa is okay, he said.\n\nPrior to the AU Ordinary Session, SADC and the East African Community (EAC) recently convened a joint summit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which President Mnangagwa said was testament to the two regional blocs commitment to the values of the AU.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa poses for a picture with other leaders at the at the opening ceremony of the 38th African Union Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, yesterday.  Picture: Presidential Photographer Tawanda Mudimu\n\nOn reparations for historical injustices suffered by Africans at the hands of imperial powers, the President said African leaders had agreed to join forces and form a platform, although the modalities would be region specific.\n\nYes, we discussed about that one, but it is a long, long, long journey. We agreed that we should form a platform where Africa must seek reparations from imperial powers, but that is a long journey.\n\nThat may be championed by the regions . . . region by region, and then we coordinate because the impact of imperialism was different in different parts of the continent, he said.\n\nThe AU summit was held under the theme Justice for Africans and People of African Descent through Reparations and the theme dovetails with the AUs efforts to institutionalise reparatory justice and racial healing.\n\nIt paves the way for the development of a common African position on reparations and establishment of an African Reparatory Programme of Action, as well as strengthen collaboration with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the global African diaspora through a joint mechanism on reparations.\n\nZimbabwe has already taken steps towards demanding reparations from Britain.\n\nLast year, President Mnangagwa launched an academic study into the impact of colonialism on Zimbabwe.\n\nThe study, led by Dr Felix Mukonowengwe of the Zimbabwe National Elders Forum, will serve as the basis for a formal reparation claim.\n\nZimbabwe was a British colony from 1890 to 1980 and authorities argue that colonial rule left lasting socio-economic scars that require redress.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa is welcomed back home from the African Union Summit by Vice Presidents Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport in Harare yesterday. Picture: Joseph Manditswara\n\nIn a speech read on his behalf by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Professor Amon Murwira, at the AU Peace and Security Council Session yesterday, President Mnangagwa called for African solutions to challenges facing the continent.\n\nZimbabwe reiterates that the principle of African solutions to African problems should continue to serve as the beacon for conflict resolution and peace-building mechanisms on our continent.\n\nWe must redouble our efforts for a secure and prosperous Africa, he said.\n\nThe President reaffirmed an immediate end to hostilities in South Sudan and DRC.\n\nWe therefore echo calls for the urgent cessation of hostilities and unhindered access of the affected population to humanitarian assistance in the eastern DRC and an end to the protracted conflict in Sudan.\n\nWe emphasise the need to achieve an enduring and mutually acceptable political solution in Western Sahara.\n\nBefore the President left Ethiopia,he met his Mozambican counterpart President Daniel Chapo.\n\nEmerging from the closed-door meeting, President Chapo called for increased economic cooperation between the two neighbours.\n\nOur two countries are facing economic challenges which l believe we need to fight side by side. Even in our fight for political freedom, Zimbabwe and Mozambique were together.\n\nNow it is very important to talk about our economic freedom. Our political, diplomatic and economic relations are equally important, he said.\n\n(From left) Zanu PF Secretary for Information Cde Christopher Mustvangwa, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Dr Jenfan Muswere, Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Dr Martin Rushwaya and Information Permanent Secretary Nick Mangwana at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport to welcome President Mnangagwa .

            "content": "Samuel Kadungure in RUSAPE\n\nTHERE is a strong sense of unity, singleness of purpose and comradeship within the Presidium, with the ruling partys top leadership unanimously supporting President Mnangagwas continued leadership up to 2030 to continue with his transformative development programmes.\n\nThis follows Zanu PFs resolution Number 1 at the partys Annual National Peoples Conference held last October in Bulawayo to extend President Mnangagwas term of office until 2030.\n\nInformation, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Dr Jenfan Muswere announced this on Saturday at the launch of the Presidential War Veterans Fund, Presidential War Veterans Rural Home Scheme, and Presidential War Veterans Borehole Drilling Scheme at Dewedzo High School in Makoni West Constituency.\n\nDr Muswere, who is also the legislator for Makoni West and Zanu PF Central Committee member, said there was nothing amiss about amending the Constitution as the supreme law has provision allowing for that.\n\nTo those who think there are divisions at the top, listen, there is no noise in the cockpit. There is unity. Do you think there is anyone who loves the President more than those in the Presidium? Those people are united. Our leaders are truly united. There is no disharmony, we are driving the boat towards 2030, said Dr Muswere, adding that extending President Mnangagwas leadership was an opportunity to consolidate the ongoing economic, infrastructural and social transformation programmes, guaranteeing continuity in policies aimed at achieving Vision 2030.\n\nStability and consistency in leadership, he said, are crucial for realising the countrys long-term goals.\n\nDr Muswere said the party, from districts to the Central Committee, passed the resolution to amend the Constitution to allow the party leadership to continue beyond 2028.\n\nThere is nothing unconstitutional about amending the constitution. The role of Parliament is multifaceted, encompassing oversight, representation, and legislative responsibilities, which include amending the constitution. Notably, our current Constitution is not the first we have had. We began with the Lancaster House Constitution and in 1999, a new Constitution was proposed, which went to a referendum where the majority voted against it.\n\nIn 2013, under the inclusive Government, we adopted our present Constitution. Parliaments duty is to enact laws, including delegating legislative authority to other legally and properly constituted institutions. Therefore, its untrue to claim that a constitution cannot be amended; after all, the constitution is made for the people, he said.\n\nDr Muswere also defended the First Ladys philanthropic work across the country.\n\nI would like to address those who criticise the First Ladys efforts. The truth is, she has done a wonderful job and we remain resolute in our support for her cultural, humanitarian, health and educational initiatives, which contribute to our countrys macro-economic growth. We should continue to support the First Lady. She has visited Makoni South, Headlands, and Makoni Central, and will also be visiting Makoni North to unite and assist us in various programmes. Her initiatives have attracted numerous investors, injecting significant funds, and we appreciate her efforts towards Vision 2030, he said.\n\nDr Muswere added that Zanu PF is a robust institution with grassroots support, capable of overcoming opposition even if the constitutional amendment goes to a referendum.\n\nWe have massive grassroots support as Zanu PF, and with the collective resolution we have passed, it is a foregone conclusion  we have already won, regardless of whether we proceed to a referendum or plebiscite. We must dispel the misconception that amending the constitution is unconstitutional. Our Constitution has democratic processes in place for amendments, he said.\n\nDr Muswere noted that there were some party members, who participate in the Central Committees decision-making, and bypass internal remedies and platforms to discuss party issues in the media.\n\nWhen a decision is made, they are part of it. When asked if anyone opposes it, they dont raise objections. Instead, they want to discuss conference business in newspapers. We must be principled. If given the opportunity to express concerns, we should do so promptly, he said.\n\nDr Muswere assured victory, citing Zanu PFs colossal presence and revolutionary capacity to drive national progress.\n\nHe highlighted the Presidents revolutionary economic empowerment programme, which recognises veterans contributions in line with the national and party constitutions.\n\nThe minister also stated that President Mnangagwas issuance of title deeds marks the conclusion of the land reform programme.\n\nNo one will seize land from black owners, thanks to the Presidents efforts to provide security of tenure and bankable documents.\n\nDr Muswere urged journalists not to provide a platform for reckless individuals who issue treasonous, inflammatory, and defamatory statements violating citizens rights.\n\nLets respect each other, acknowledging everyones rights. We should support democratic discourse and adhere to constitutionalism.\n\n",

There has been massive infrastructure development in our area and we want the President to continue, a party member attending the meeting said.\n\nCommunity members have also showered the President with praises for availing food assistance following the Cyclone Idai-induced drought.\n\nMhondoro-Mubaira Member of Parliament Cde Simba Chiwanza said the President deserved a the term extension because the empowerment programmes his Government has been implementing have changed the lives of multitudes of people.\n\nHe noted that through the Constituency Development Funds (CDF), his area was headed for massive infrastructure development.\n\nZanu PF Womens League provincial chairperson Cde Constance Shamu said President Mnangagwa had put in place empowerment programmes for women.\n\nZanu PF provincial chairperson Cde Mary Mliswa-Chikoka said the calls for President Mnangagwas term extension were coming from the people.\n\nThe President has never requested that his term of office be extended. We the people, have made calls that he should be in office until 2030. This is not anywhere near third-term bidding as he is not interested in running for any more terms, she said.\n\nIn Mashonaland Central Province, the party leadership and membership said they remain steadfast on the provinces term extension stance because President Mnangagwa has earned it through his hard work.\n\nAt a meeting in Bindura yesterday, Politburo member and Minister of Veterans of the Liberation Struggle Affairs, Cde Monica Mavhunga, emphasised that this sentiment reflects the wishes of the masses.\n\nThe meeting was called to give feedback from the National Peoples Conference.\n\nParty leaders have been assigned the task of conveying this information to their respective communities.\n\nCde Mavhunga assured participants at the meeting that there was nothing to fear in calling for the Presidents term extension.\n\nThe Constitution can be amended; that is the duty of Parliament. While some claim President Mnangagwa is a constitutionalistwhich is truethe voice of the people is the voice of God, she said.\n\nThe majority believe that your transformative work as President makes it essential for you to complete what you started. If someone does not support Vision 2030, that is their own issue. We will adhere to the party resolutions, she said.\n\nCde Mavhunga spoke against individuals trying to create divisions within the party leadership, stating that the Presidium is united and party cadres should refrain from such tendencies.\n\nShe encouraged respect for leaders and unity within the party.\n\nSometimes we assume that people know things when they dont. The information must reach the grassroots level. I urge party members to read and understand the party constitution; this is essential for your growth within the party, she said.\n\nOur resolution as a party is that President Mnangagwa must continue until 2030 to fulfil his vision. The roadmap has been outlined in the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1).\n\nZanu PF Mashonaland Central provincial vice chairperson, Cde Christopher Magomo, said yesterdays meeting was the fifth of its a series of briefings the party has been holding as it aims to communicate outcomes from last years National Peoples Conference across the districts.\n\nHe noted that disgruntled, resigned, and frustrated individuals are spreading misinformation.\n\nThey want to create factions, but we reject this disharmony. We want all leaders here to convey the message that Zanu PF is united and strong, he asserted.\n\nWe do not take orders from social media, the party has established proper structures. We know where to address our grievances, not on WhatsApp.\n\nCde Magomo indicated that anyone opposing the partys resolution to extend the Presidents term ceases to be a member, as the party constitution requires members to follow the rules and regulations.\n\nParty members must strengthen, defend, popularise, and promote the party. Dont stand by and watch as your country and President are insulted, he said.\n\nThe President is working hard, and we have an obligation to support him in realising Vision 2030. Inform people back home about the truth, so they are not swayed. Zanu PF is a party for the masses and we want everyone on board.\n\nProvincial youth chairperson Cde Emmerson Raradza said the youth will defend President Mnangagwa and Zanu PF.\n\nHe said 2030 belongs to President Mnangagwa and no one should undermine his achievements.\n\n",

            "content": "It keeps happening. On Thursday, 25 people were killed when an Urban Connect bus collided head-on with a large truck along Beitbridge-Masvingo Road and on Saturday another three people died when a Mandaza Bus collided head-on with a Glen View 2 High School bus along the Harare-Masvingo Highway just 10km after Beatrice.\n\nA head-on collision on a major highway means one of the vehicles was in the opposing lane, probably overtaking.\n\nThat is what happened in the Beitbridge accident, according to witnesses, and the driver of one of the first cars to arrive at the scene to offer help said he had been overtaken by the bus a few minutes earlier.\n\nIn the Saturday accident involving two buses, one was obviously overtaking another vehicle although early reports did not pinpoint which one was in the wrong lane.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure Development has been highly active in trying to prevent accidents involving public service vehicles.\n\nThese measures include have speed limiters and real-time speed monitoring by both bus owners and the police, to ensure all buses obey the legal speed limits on each type of road.\n\nAt the same time, the ministry suspended licensed services by companies it thought were to blame for accidents until they had taken approved measures to reduce risk.\n\nThis is based on the quite sensible proposition that an employer can give safety orders to drivers, and at the same time an employer can take zero action, or just slap a wrist, if a driver breaks the laws.\n\nIn the timetables that accompany route licences, the Ministry works out the time a bus properly driven at a reasonable speed, that will obviously average below the limit, will take between each stopping point on the licence. If a bus arrives early, it has obviously been speeding.\n\nIt now looks as if the measures already taken, while necessary, are still inadequate to force all bus drivers to drive safely. And these latest two accidents make it clear that something must be done to stop unsafe overtaking.\n\nA bus is a large, heavy vehicle, which means that acceleration and deceleration take more time than would be the case of a modest car with a large engine.\n\nThis means that bus drivers, and truck drivers, need a really clear view of the road ahead before they can overtake as they cannot just nip in an out of the traffic.\n\nIt is an interesting point that drivers of heavy trucks seem to be involved in fewer accidents than bus drivers, yet there are far more heavy trucks on the roads than buses.\n\nIn theory, a bus driver is better trained than a truck driver since you have to have a truck drivers licence before you can take the road test for a bus drivers licence.\n\nWhen we compare the operations of large trucks and buses we find that owners of trucking companies stress the need to deliver the goods, with speed not being an issue.\n\nLike bus owners, they will have tracking devices, so they can take action if a driver decides to divert from the laid-down route, but generally the stress on truck drivers is to deliver, and if they are a couple of hours late then reasonable explanations are accepted. No one is ever pressing a truck driver to go faster.\n\nThat, regrettably, is not the case with buses. Sometimes the pressure comes from the bus owner; sometimes passengers urge a driver on to make the journey shorter.\n\nSometimes even drivers have indulged in silly speeding games with other drivers.\n\nSo one solution is to upgrade the bus drivers licence and the tests needed to earn one.\n\nTests tend to be in urban areas, yet it is on the open road at speed when the fatal accidents tend to happen.\n\nThe urban test will cover many important areas, such as the ability to manoeuvre properly and obey road signs, but will not cover how good the driver is at high speed along the highways.\n\nSome countries invest a great deal more into training of bus drivers, which among other things makes such drivers better remunerated since they have to be better.\n\nThey also have tight rules for bus drivers, such as zero blood alcohol so bus drivers can only drink on the first of their two consecutive days offs each week.\n\nMost importantly even fairly minor failures to drive according to law means a bus drivers licence can be suspended with retesting to follow, where a car driver might just have a modest fine for the same offence.\n\nThe other factor we need to look at is to make buses safer and give passengers a better chance of survival should the worst happen when there is an accident. We can start with seat belts.\n\nWhile the driver and all passengers in a car are now required to be wearing a seat belt, and these have been fitted as standard for many years now, belts are unusual in buses and even when fitted they are often not worn.\n\nFrom initial reports it appears that many of those who died in the Beitbridge crash had severe head injuries, especially those who died on the way to hospital.\n\nIt should be worthwhile to see if these injuries were likely to have been far less severe if the passenger had been belted in.\n\nUnlike urban services, where standing passengers are permitted and kombis, who are now banned from rural trips, who can pack four passengers in a row of seats, intercity buses operate under different rules with every passenger required to be in a proper seat. So having a seat belt and enforcing use does not seem to be anything very difficult.\n\nWe must keep up the improvements that have already been implemented by the Transport Ministry in recent years, and keep adding to what is needed to make public transport exceptionally safe.\n\n",

            "content": "Martin Kadzere\n\nZimbabwes future is closely tied to global energy trends and critical minerals demand, requiring thorough geological surveys to accurately assess resources, inform decisions and attract potential investors, according to a new study by the Southern Africa Resource Watch (SARW).\n\nSARW, an independent, non-profit organisation monitoring natural resource extraction in the region, has noted Zimbabwes abundant critical mineral deposits, highlighting the countrys potential to play a key role in the global energy transition.\n\nThe global energy transition is a worldwide shift from fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, towards renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro and geothermal.\n\nThe shift is driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change, while also providing clean and sustainable energy.\n\nKey aspects include decarbonising the energy sector, expanding renewables, increasing electrification, improving energy efficiency and developing the necessary infrastructure.\n\nZimbabwe possesses abundant critical minerals essential for the energy transition, such as lithium, Platinum Group Metals, manganese, cobalt, copper, chromium, nickel and rare earth minerals.\n\nThe study notes that accurate resource assessment, informed decision-making and investor attraction depend on comprehensive and up-to-date geological surveys to determine the quantity and quality of the minerals.\n\nRegular geological mapping and exploration initiatives are essential to maintain an up-to-date inventory of Zimbabwes mineral wealth, ensuring that the country can effectively leverage its natural resources for sustainable development, SARW says in the study titled Critical Minerals and Renewable Energy Value Chains in Zimbabwe: A Study of Actors and Initiatives.\n\nIt notes that developing strong mineral value chains is hindered by inconsistent policies, a lack of technical expertise and weak local content policies.\n\nStrengthening these value chains requires a holistic approach that includes the development of a national critical minerals strategy and list.\n\nThis should spell out critical minerals value chains, capacity building, infrastructure development and policy reforms to ensure that these minerals extraction, processing and export contribute maximally to the national economy, it says.\n\nThe Critical Minerals Strategy, meant to optimise its benefits, will provide a national framework for identifying a list of critical minerals and strategies for sector growth.\n\nWithin the Southern African Development Community (SADC), only Zambia has drafted a National Critical Minerals Strategy, following the lead of nations like Australia, Canada, the US,and EU members.\n\nZimbabwes energy mix is diverse, including hydroelectric, thermal, solar, oil, gas, biodiesel, biomass and other renewables, but is primarily dominated by coal and hydropower.\n\nChina, known for its strategic approach, including export bans on materials like graphite, actively manages its critical mineral resources and global imports.\n\nThe importance of such resources is underscored by Zimbabwes position as home to Africas largest and the worlds sixth-largest lithium deposits, a crucial component in electric vehicle batteries.\n\nWith four major projects underway, the Government aims to supply 20 percent of global lithium demand.\n\nChinese companies have become dominant investors in Zimbabwe, led by Sinomines acquisition and expansion of the Bikita Mine, now capable of producing significant amounts of spodumene and petalite.\n\nOther key projects include the Arcadia Lithium Project (acquired by Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt), the Zulu Lithium Project, and the redeveloping Kamativi Lithium Project.\n\nZimbabwe also holds the worlds second-largest reserves of platinum group metals (PGMs) like platinum, palladium and rhodium, which are essential for various industries, including automotive and electronics.\n\nIts PGM deposits are mainly located in the Great Dyke region, making Zimbabwe a key player in the global PGM market.\n\nThe country possesses resources vital for green energy, including manganese, used in steel and batteries.\n\nCobalt, essential for lithium-ion batteries, is also present, and Zimbabwes cobalt imports are projected to increase significantly, positioning the country to contribute to the electric vehicle market.\n\nFollowing the closure of its major copper mine in 2000, Zimbabwe is actively working to revive its copper industry.\n\nThe country has launched the Greater Chinhoyi Copper Development Programme and partnered with Chinese and other international investors to re-exploit old mines and mining dumps.\n\nWhile significant investment is still needed to fully reactivate Zimbabwes copper assets, the country is positioning itself to capitalise on the increasing global demand for this crucial metal.\n\nNickel, a critical mineral for nations like Japan, the US and Canada due to its use in various technologies crucial for the energy transition, is produced at the Trojan Nickel Mine, the countrys sole nickel operation.\n\nRare earth elements (REEs), crucial for renewable energy technologies like wind turbines and solar panels, are gaining global importance.\n\nWhile China currently dominates the REE market, Zimbabwe possesses REE deposits in several regions, including Binga, Rushinga, Mt Darwin and Buhera.\n\nThis has attracted international interest, with companies like Australias MRG Metals and UK-based Rainbow Rare Earths investing in Zimbabwean REE projects, signalling the countrys potential to become a significant player in this critical mineral sector.\n\n",
