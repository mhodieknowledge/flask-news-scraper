It is important to always be aware of the truism that we can never beg ourselves to prosperity.\n\nWe can always work ourselves to prosperity. We struggled and strived for this regions political independence and we shall strive for its economic independence, building the region stone upon stone and brick and upon brick.\n\nProf Murwira said the Council of Ministers had culminated in decisions that reflect SADCs collective aspirations of a peaceful, inclusive, competitive, middle to high-income industrialised region.\n\nThis shall continue to eternity; it is an eternal wave to freedom and we as a generation are part of this wave to progress and the calling from our founding fathers is that we have to play our part and never back down.\n\nOur deliberations and the decisions that we have reached reflect our collective aspirations, that of a peaceful, inclusive, competitive, middle to high-income industrialised region, where all citizens enjoy sustainable economic well-being, justice, and freedom.\n\nWe have addressed pressing issues including peace and security, socio-economic and humanitarian concerns, he said.\n\nThe meeting, said Prof Murwira, had noted the progress made in the implementation of the Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP 2020-2030) and the attendant challenges.\n\nWe all agree that these challenges provide an opportunity for us to learn, rethink and re- strategise in this ever-changing international system.\n\nAs we move forward, it is important to prioritise the implementation of our decisions and ensure that our words translate into tangible progress for the benefit of our people, he said.\n\nThe minister then expressed gratitude to his counterparts and other delegates in attendance for their participation at the meeting.\n\nPlease allow me to express my appreciation to all of you for engaging in meaningful dialogue on these very important issues for the development of our region.\n\nThis shows your commitment and desire to the success of our regional integration, Prof Murwira said.\n\n",

It spoke of the games they played, and the memories evoking the warmth and closeness of their relationship.\n\n . . . we used to play together games such as playing cards I used to get sad and also cry, I love you, mom. The best in the wholeworld. I want to see you because you made me cry. Rest in peace mom, she wrote.\n\nBeyond its emotional impact, the letter has also become a focal point, amplifying the familys insistent demands for a transparent investigation into the precise circumstances surrounding Detective Constable Hoves death.\n\nThe letters impact was further evident during her emotional funeral service held at Nyaradzo Funeral Parlour last Sunday, where heightened emotions among mourners and close family members led to verbal confrontations. They insulted police officers who were present, and the familys calls for accountability grew stronger, demanding to know whether Detective Constable Hoves death was an accident or deliberate.\n\nShe was shot dead in what police had initially reported to be a shoot-out with armed robbers in Bulawayos Pumula South suburb during a covert operation. However, it has since emerged that she was allegedly shot by a colleague and not armed robbers.\n\nAccording to the police, Detective Constable Hove sustained gunshot wounds to her upper limbs during the exchange of fire with robbers at around 8:40 PM on Thursday last week and was rushed to a nearby private clinic, where she was pronounced dead upon arrival.\n\nIt was only following the incident and after her family raised concerns as to how she was killed that the matter raised eyebrows.\n\nThe familys pursuit of the truth intensified, demanding to know the identities of the officers deployed in the Pumula South raid and the individual who authorised Detective Constable Hoves post-mortem. They stated that they were not involved in the process and were shocked to learn that someone else had signed documents at the hospital as her next of kin.\n\nDetective Constable Hove was 37 at the time of her death and is survived by four children.\n\nPolice Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba has since ordered a comprehensive investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death while assuring the family that no stone will be left unturned, and that justice will be served.\n\n",

Several key health indicators have shown notable improvement, and we can confidently say that our healthcare system is on the right track.\n\nDr Mombeshora said the ministrys goal is to ensure that every Zimbabwean, regardless of where they live, has access to affordable quality healthcare services.\n\nWe are resolute in our belief that the gains we have made will serve as the foundation to overcome these challenges as we work together towards Vision 2030.\n\nDr Mombeshora said life expectancy has increased from 61 years to an average of 65 years, and to as high as 68 years for women. On maternal and under-five mortality rates, there has been a declining trend since 2010, with the maternal mortality declining from 525 maternal deaths per 100 000 live deaths in 2012 to 363 per 100 live deaths in 2022.\n\nThis was according to the Zimbabwean population census report.\n\nDr Mombeshora said from November last year to date, 608 suspected cholera cases, 124 confirmed cases and 15 deaths were recorded.\n\nOn HIV and AIDS, he said Zimbabwe has surpassed the 95-95-95 uni-AIDS targets. 95 percent of people living with HIV know their status, more than 95 percent of those are on antiretroviral therapy, and 95 percent on ART are virally suppressed.\n\nThe malaria incidence has also declined from 16 per 1 000 cases in 2023 to 2,4 per 1 000 last year.\n\nZimbabwe has also controlled Mpox and measles outbreaks.\n\nDr Mombeshora added that the country has accelerated the decentralisation of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) to lower levels through the World Health Package of Essential NCDs Interventions Programme.\n\nFurther, despite the suspension of USAID to Africa, HIV and AIDS, TB, and malaria programmes will be conducted by the Government.\n\nSo these are the areas that we realised there will be a gap because of that (United States) Executive Order, those employees who were doing clinical staff are now back at work.\n\nWe have got enough Government funding up to September and some already on standby to procure more medicines to cover us to end of the year, he said.\n\nDr Mombeshora said there will be no shortage of transport as the sector is engaging Treasury to increase its fleet, and become self-sufficient.\n\n",

            "content": "Eddie Chikamhi, Zimpapers Sports\n\nScottland.. 0\n\nNgezi Platinum Stars 0 (1)\n\nIF anyone doubted the magnitude of the rivalries new boys Scottland created on their arrival to the big stage, then the celebrations by an alliance of neutral supporters that followed the Mabvuku sides first defeat of the season at Rufaro yesterday were sufficient to tell the depth of the acrimony.\n\nThis is not the first time that the majority of fans at Rufaro, believed to be disgruntled Dynamos and CAPS United, have stood up in alliance to back any team that plays against Scottland.\n\nConsequently, Ngezi Platinum Stars yesterday enjoyed the support they never knew they had in Harare as their captain Kudzai Chigwida converted a second half penalty to settle the matters in this highly contested tie.\n\nWhat made the victory more pleasant to the alliance of the fans was that it was the first time seeing the new boys defence breached and moreso losing a match.\n\nScottland presumably irked the fans from rival PSL clubs by raiding their teams for the best talents using their financial muscle after gaining their maiden promotion this season.\n\nThey started off the campaign on a high with victories over Triangle and CAPS United, to set them on a path to emulate the likes of Black Rhinos, who made similar waves when they stormed the topflight and won the league in their debut season in 1984.\n\nThe predominantly Makepekepe fans, who hoisted the Green Machine flag for the most part of the game yesterday, erupted into wild celebrations at the conclusion of the 90 minutes and called the visiting players to the City End bay to toast to the result.\n\nHowever, Scottland coach Tonderai Ndiraya was a bit bothered by the way his team lacked the cutting edge yesterday. He was also not entirely satisfied with the penalty call by referee Brighton Chimene, which contributed to their defeat.\n\nChimene pointed to the spot after substitute Tinotenda Ditima was brought down in the box by Frederick Ansa-Botchway.\n\nI dont know what really happened. Well have to see the video, said Ndiraya.\n\nBut it was careless to concede a penalty in such a manner; in such times of the game. So in the end we had to lose the way we lost.\n\n And thats part of the game. So we tried to push after that. We were risking, but in the end we could not create any meaningful chance to come back into the game.\n\nSo, thats how it is. Thats part of the game. Look forward to the next match, said Ndiraya.\n\nThe first half was well balanced with both teams playing a positive and entertaining brand of football. Chances were created at both ends of goal but the first half ended goalless.\n\nIt was difficult to ignore the exciting duels in the park with former Zimbabwe international Richard Hachiro leading the fight for the visitors. Hachiro freed up the park for the likes of Obrey Chirinda, Talent Chamboko, Malvin Gaki and Ashwin Karengesha to explore the Scottland half.\n\nBut Ngezi Platinum Stars could have paid dearly for a defensive gaffe between goalkeeper Darlington Murasiranwa and his defender Leslie Kashtigu in the 18th minute.\n\nScottland poster boy, Khama Billiat, who also had a brilliant outing in the exciting midfield duels, stole the ball and released Tymon Machope who, however, took a bit longer to pull the trigger before the visitors recovered and thwarted the move as he came face to face with the goalkeeper.\n\nThen, Gaki curled his effort just wide at the other end of goal but Scottland had a better chance following a dazzling touch by Billiat deep inside the Ngezi Platinum half to find Machope at the half hour mark.\n\nMachope laid the ball for equally impressive Mthokozisi Msebe but the former Simba Bhora midfielders booming shot sailed just over the crossbar.\n\nGaki could have broken the ice when he gathered a loose ball inside the Scottland penalty box, but he volleyed his shot wide just before the breather.\n\nNgezi Platinum Stars appeals for penalty were turned down by the referee after Gaki tumbled inside the crowded box at the hour mark, much to the disapproval of the predominantly CAPS United supporters housed behind the Scottland goal.\n\nBut the visitors felt mollified when a penalty was awarded with about 10 minutes remaining after substitute Ditima was brought down inside the box.\n\nSkipper Chigwida took the honours and sent goalkeeper Talbert Shumba the wrong way in the 83rd minute to give Ngezi Platinum Stars their second win of the season and claim pole position going into the weekend games.\n\nVisiting coach Takesure Chiragwi, who is also the national team assistant coach, was thrilled by the win and he paid tribute to the quality in the Scottland side that has six players called for the World Cup qualifiers.\n\nTo be honest, this is a strong side and I would want to say that its a studded team. Its a very good team. On a good day they could even beaten us. We could even go out and draw.\n\nTo be honest they are very competent. Theyve got a good quality but today it was our day. We used our chance that we got to make sure we can make the difference.\n\nBut its a very good team that we also need to respect. They had their chances to make sure they can bounce back or even punishing us.\n\nBut they couldnt manage to utilise their chances. That was the difference. But I think its a very good team, said Chiragwi.\n\nTeams:\n\nScottland:Talbert Shumba, Godknows Murwira (S. Urikhob, 82nd min), Ronald Pfumbidzai ( M.

            "content": "Trust Freddy, Herald Correspondent\n\nPolice have called for peaceful dispute resolution after over 1 100 killings were recorded last year, with many attributed to remarkably trivial disputes, such as arguments over a chair or a US$1 note.\n\nNational police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi yesterday, at a lunch organised by a local security company to discuss ways to curb crimes, presented crime trends in Zimbabwe and how to minimise chances of being victims or minimise potential losses.\n\nComm Nyathi said there was a surge in killings last year compared to 2023. Every killing is first investigated by police as a murder, although when the culprit is taken to court often a charge of culpable homicide, or blameworthy death, is preferred since there was not intention to kill but still actions that a reasonable person would recognise could lead to serious injury of death.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police recorded 1 085 murder cases in 2023, and in 2024, we recorded 1 115 cases and in the very same year a total of 953 arrests were made, of which 487 were cleared, Comm Nyathi said.\n\nAmongst those recorded last year, some involved security personnel who were killed while on duty. However, most of the challenges emanate from disputes, whether marital disputes or otherwise.\n\nWe have also recorded cases where people fought over even US$1, and we have reported cases where somebody fought over a chair, just to say, Move from this chair so that I can sit in a bar.\n\nComm Nyathi said there were disturbing incidents where children were brutally beaten to death over issues such as eating a slice of bread without permission.\n\nThats why we are saying we need a total change in our mindset. We need to value human life. In whatever we are doing, whether its in the business sector, in the social sector, at the family level, at the common level, we must value human life in whatever we are doing, first, he added.\n\nTo reduce the risk of being victims of robbery, theft, or murder during armed robbery incidents, Comm Nyathi said security organisations, individuals, and businesses can increase supervision and leverage on technology.\n\nThere is a need to regularly monitor and supervise security personnel, employees and business operations to prevent insider complicity.\n\nThere is also need to conduct regular patrols and surveillance in high-risk areas to deter potential criminals and quickly respond to incidents and also leverage technology, such as CCTV cameras, alarms and GPS tracking, to enhance security and facilitate rapid response to incidents.\n\nChief Public Prosecutor Mr Clemence Chimbari noted that prosecuting murder cases is a complex process, often marked by challenges that result in backlog.\n\nYes, the police are given statistics that they have arrested about 900 or so accused persons for cases of murder and only about 400 or so have been brought to court. So, what happens with the discrepancies? Maybe these are other cases that the police are still investigating; they havent yet finished the investigations.\n\nThese are cases that are still pending, or maybe these are two sets of cases under consideration by the National Prosecuting Authority, which we are considering to indict accused persons for trial in the High Court.\n\nCulpable homicide cases, the lower charge where there is a killing without the intent to kill of a murder, are usually tried before a regional magistrate rather than a judge sitting with assessors in the High Court.\n\nPeace Security chief executive officer, Dr Abel Mubango said: We should always be ahead of these criminals and we are working together, the police, ourselves and the general public, so that people share information and learn from what is happening.\n\nLets say a company is hit today, what can we learn from there? What is it that they could have done maybe to try to avoid the armed robbery that took place and also being ahead of security technologies that are coming up in the world and so on, that will help us a lot.\n\nThe meeting garnered significant interest from several industry leaders who attended to share their insights and learn strategies for combating the rising tide of crime. However, he said the NPA was working diligently to clear the backlog, as evident from the recent setup of High Court circuits in provinces.\n\n",
