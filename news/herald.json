We must work towards formalisation of the informal economy, which according to the International Labour Organisation, is around 58.8 percent in Africa.\n\nAddressing informality through appropriate policies and strategies is important for promoting decent work, reducing poverty and achieving sustainable development.\n\nIn addition, the integration of small to medium enterprises into the formal economy is important given their role as engines of job creation and innovation in our region, said Mr Masanga.\n\nHe said there is need to create an environment that fosters innovation, entrepreneurship and sustainable job creation.\n\nThe meeting continues with closed-door meetings that will culminate in the ministerial session on Thursday.\n\n",

This violates World Health Organisation guidelines that indicate that a cemetery should be at least 1-2 km from a water treatment site.\n\nIn addition, a buffer zone is required between the cemetery and the water treatment plant. There are water pipes that run through the cemetery and this exposes the water to contamination from fluids and chemicals from graves, reads Minister Mombeshoras letter.\n\nIt is my duty as Minister of Health and Child Care to enforce laws and regulations that protect public health and safety; and (n) to administer the provisions of the Public Health Act. In the interest of public health, this project must be stopped. The council is advised to be guided by a health impact assessment when dealing with such projects.\n\nThe Harare City Council had issued a permit for the project despite an earlier warning from the Harare Water Department.\n\nEarly this year, Minister Garwe expressed strong objections to the councils decision, attributing it to possible corruption and lack of due diligence.\n\nHe said initially, some councillors from Harare City Council had been sold the land through corrupt means as stands, but the Government reversed the decision. This prompted some crooked council officials to change plans and seek to establish a cemetery.\n\nHarare City Council acting director of Urban Planning, Mr Samuel Nyabezi had defended their decision to issue a permit before an Environmental Impact Assessment was done saying the EIA process is expensive, adding that it would not be proper for one to incur such high costs when there was no guarantee that a permit would be granted.\n\n",
