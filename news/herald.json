Charltan Trust provides them with a safe place to live, grow, and learn while raising their children, read the statement.\n\nWe donated fabric materials and two sewing machines to enhance their skills training and income-generating projects.\n\nThe club added that this is not just a donation of tools but an investment in their future.\n\nThe young mothers, who produce handmade bags and hats, recently secured a contract to supply an exclusive international outlet in Harare, a major step toward economic independence, said the club.\n\nThese are the people we are called to serve those society has forgotten. Empowering them is the essence of Rotary.\n\nIn Beatrice, the club is overseeing the local implementation of the Manyoshwa Primary School Project. The US$67 703 project involves constructing classroom blocks and toilets for a rural farming community.\n\nThis is a community-driven initiative. Residents are providing labour and materials, and we are ensuring transparency and accountability, said the club.\n\nA site visit held on September 20 2024, confirmed readiness for the implementation stage.\n\nWe are excited to witness transformation where it is needed most, the Club said.\n\nDaramombe Mission Clinic located in Chivhu and serving both Chikomba and Buhera districts, is also receiving attention.\n\nThe clinic urgently needs a reliable water supply, solar power, and modern equipment, the Club said.\n\nWe are actively seeking partners to help rehabilitate the facility and restore dignity to rural healthcare.\n\n",

Traditional grains do well in this region and we encourage our farmers to grow crops according to their agro-ecological regions. They should go by nature.\n\nWhere there is low rainfall we must respond by growing traditional grains which give us good yields, he said.\n\nThis initiative aims to improve food security by providing farmers with the necessary support and inputs to increase their yields, improving their livelihoods and promoting the production and consumption of traditional grains.\n\nProf Jiri emphasised that sorghum yields that had been achieved this season are a testament to the potential of traditional grains in Muzarabani District.\n\nThat is the grain we must eat because it is naturally bio fortified with rich nutrients like zinc, magnesium and so forth, he said.\n\nProf Jiri said the swap programme whereby farmers could exchange their traditional grains for maize was still operational.\n\nHe however, urged farmers to eat traditional grains which are healthier.\n\nThe field day was aimed at providing a platform for farmers to share knowledge and best practices on sorghum production.a\n\n",

This is a difficult moment for us and the church as a whole, he said.\n\nHe was a man who instilled a sense of hard work in all of us. He taught us to be self-reliant; he told us to use our hands and earn a decent living. He taught everyone including youths to use their hands to earn a living.\n\nHe was a man who loved discipline, he taught us to be self-disciplined. As a family, we are saddened by this huge loss. We pray that another great man will come up and lead the church and the family.\n\nWe want to thank President Mnangagwa for the (liberation) hero status given to our father. We never expected our father to be bestowed with hero status. We are so humbled by this and the whole family is grateful.\n\nZION Church Archbishop Jameson Pedzisai, popularly known as Archbishop Andreas the Third, said the death of Bishop Shava was a blow to the church.\n\nHe had a large following, and the flock has been left without its shepherd, especially now that we are about to celebrate the Easter holidays, he said.\n\nThis is hard for the church. Our wish is for the church to remain united as they look for a successor. The Bishop was hardworking and a unifier.\n\nWe pray that the one who is going to be a successor will also be a disciplined person and a unifier just like the late Bishop Shava.\n\nWe also want to thank the Government for the hero status. You see, Bishop Shava supported the ruling party wholeheartedly. He supported Government programmes in this community and he commanded a lot of respect from everyone.\n\nTo the Shava family, we are with you in our prayers and our wish is for you to be comforted and also to remain united, he said.\n\nBishop Shava left behind three wives, 26 children, 75 grandchildren and 35 great-grandchildren.\n\n",
