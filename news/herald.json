We want to put murals on the walls, which will unpack the story of the liberation struggle, he said.\n\nThe budget is now there, and the procurement team is on the move. There are a lot of touch-ups to be done, but we dont want the detention centre to lose its originality.\n\nThis way, we will be able to preserve our rich history by highlighting the brutality that was unleashed on our liberation heroes by the settler regime.\n\nThis year, Midlands Province will host the national Uhuru celebrations at Mutora Business Centre, further highlighting its historical importance in Zimbabwes journey to independence.\n\n",
