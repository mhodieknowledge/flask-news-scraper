Our thoughts are with all the families of the deceased, and our prayers are with those injured as they continue to receive treatment and care. We wish them a speedy recuperation, said Minister Mhona.\n\nIn light of the recent road fatalities, Minister Mhona said he has taken a bold stance to reduce road carnage by enforcing road laws and safety regulations.\n\nGoing forward, we shall build on this momentum of strict enforcement of road motor transportation and safety regulations for the safety and well-being of the people, said the Minister.\n\n",

A search led to the discovery of Moleen Chabayanzaras body about 40 metres away from the homestead while headman Nyikadzino, Kuwesi Masawus body was found in a disused latrine with the head severed from the torso.\n\nThe teenager, Anets body was found buried in a shallow grave near a hut. Chief Chundu confirmed the incident and called for amicable ways of solving domestic disputes.\n\nIt is a very sad development where three lives have been lost. It must be noted that this man (Tore) had a known violent streak in the area, said Chief Chundu.\n\nNational police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the tragic incident adding that investigations were in progress.\n\n",
