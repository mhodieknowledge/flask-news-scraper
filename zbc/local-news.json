            "content": "Story by Gay Matambo\nCOMMUNITIES in Chiredzi South constituency have joined hands with the government in the temporary rehabilitation of the Chilonga causeway, which was destroyed by heavy rains during last summer\u2019s cropping season.\nThe damage to the key crossing point has significantly disrupted travel for residents in Chikombedzi, Mabhalauta, and Malipati, who are now forced to detour via Rutenga or Mupapa to reach Chiredzi town, adding at least 125 kilometres to their journeys.\nIn a demonstration of unity and self-reliance, local residents have come together to provide labour, resources, and logistical support to restore the causeway.\n\u201cWe decided as a community to mobilise building materials, rocks and many for the rehabilitation of our causeway. Some are cooking for the people who are working here, others have come in with transport to transport the material and others are sending through funds from wherever they are so that this programme is a success,\u201d a community member said.\n\u201cWe decided to take part in this programme because the causeway is important to us. We have government officials, schoolchildren and farmers who need to constantly travel to Chiredzi town and back, so, without this causeway, life would be difficult,\u201d a concerned resident.\n\u201cWe value this bridge, it makes life easy for us hence, as a community we are working with the government in repairing this structure. We are being driven by President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s mantra, \u201cNyika inovakwa nevene vayo, Ilizwe lakhiwa ngabanikazi balo,\u201d a community member said.\nThe Chilonga causeway rehabilitation works are expected to be completed in the shortest possible time.\n\u201cWe commenced works here on March 31. We hope that in two weeks the causeway will be accessible. We are trying our best so that when government assistance comes at a later stage resources and manpower will be there already and nothing can stop work here. That is why you see that the community has gone all out,\u201d the Chairperson of the Chilonga Causeway Restoration Programme, Mr Tiyani Chilonga said.\nThe local leadership cited the need for the construction of a high-rise bridge that links the constituency to Chiredzi town as four possible sites for another standard bridge have already been identified by the government.",
