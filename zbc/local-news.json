            "content": "Story by Kenias Chivuzhe\nTHE uptake and implementation of the Heritage-Based Education Curriculum is on course, with issues of inclusivity and infrastructural development at the centre of the strategy to deliver quality education under the Second Republic.\nTo assess progress recorded so far in the construction of schools and classroom blocks, the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education has embarked on schools joint monitoring visits countrywide.\nPrimary and Secondary Education Minister Honourable Torerai Moyo who led a team in Manicaland province, expressed satisfaction with progress in the implementation of the heritage-based curriculum, revealing plans to construct 125 schools and 350 classroom blocks this year.\n\u201cThe issue of inclusive education is being respected in all our schools and we noticed that ramps have been established in all learning facilities as well as ablution facilities. We are also looking at libraries, science and computer laboratories to ascertain whether we are in line with the expectations of the National Development Strategy. As you are aware, we have rolled out the heritage-based curriculum.\n\u201cWe are targeting to build more than 350 classroom blocks. We also want to refurbish the classrooms so that the environment prevailing is conducive to effective learning. We are targeting not less than 125 schools in 2025. These are the key legacy projects that the Second Republic is doing in trying to provide quality, relevant and equitable education,\u201d he said.\nManicaland education authorities and development partners concurred on the need to improve the quality and access to education in the country.\n\u201cWe are implementing the heritage-based curriculum that is focusing on the production of goods and services and which is premised on the philosophy of \u2018Unhu\u2019 which encourages the impartation of the identity for our students must be able to identify themselves as Zimbabweans. In that respect, we are mounting workshops to ensure that all our stakeholders in education receive some training concerning the tenancy of the heritage-based curriculum so that we advertise the curriculum for acceptance by stakeholders and learners.",

            "content": "Story by Providence Maraneli\nTHE government\u2019s ongoing commitment to transforming communities and providing modern public services continues to take shape, with Gwanda Rural District Council recently procuring essential service equipment.\nAligned with the Second Republic\u2019s ethos of leaving no one and no place behind, Gwanda Rural District Council is making significant strides in improving service delivery to its citizens.\nThis is reflected not only in the procurement of service equipment through devolution funds but also in the provision of 27 motorcycles for councilors, who previously had to walk over 20 kilometers to fulfil their duties.\n\u201cWe have used RDC funds to procure a tipper truck, a backhoe loader and motorcycles for the councilors. We realised that some of the wards are inaccessible and it was difficult for our councilors to serve their communities and hence we decided to procure these for them.\n\u201cWith Matabeleland south province largely rural, there is consensus among local leadership that the provision of motorcycles and the procurement of service equipment by the rural district council will go a long way in the implementation of the inclusive development agenda,\u201d Gwanda RDC CEO, Mr Ranganai Sibanda said.\n\u201cThis kind gesture serves to ensure that councilors can efficiently access all areas hence simultaneously fostering greater engagement and coordination in the province\u2019s development activities,\u201d Matabeleland South Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Honourable Evelyn Ndlovu said.\n\u201cThis resonates well with President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s mantra of leaving no one and no place behind. It indeed embodies the President\u2019s vision of ensuring that no one or no place is left behind in pursuit of prosperity and development.\u201d\nThe government is on a drive to build modern communities.",

The third pivot is yet to be used as we await more funding and as soon as we get it, we will start planting. As you can see for yourselves our crop is good and we are satisfied,\u201d Bubi-Lupane Irrigation Scheme Chairperson, Mr Gerald Khumalo said.\nThe farmers in the scheme have also received modern day scientific knowledge on farming as the Second Republic emphasises the need to take agriculture as a business.",

We have a setback where Liberty Masvaure had a fracture while Ransom Pavari has an angle injury. We have players to fill up the positions as we aim for a win.\n\u201cOur team is very strong in defense as we have our goalkeeper Tedious Baye, and defenders who include Lawrence Mhlanga, Farai Banda, Ask Rupande, Chipo Tsodzo among others. In the past two seasons, we were failing to win the first game of the season but this time around we have managed to win. This gives us hope to have a good season as we aim to be champions. We ended last season on number four and we want to improve from that position to finish on number one or two,\u201d Manica Diamonds Head Coach, Jairos Tapera said.\nThe Mutare-based outfit will miss the services of utility Rainsome Pavari who joined from FC Platinum this year, while defender Liberty Masvaure is also nursing a fracture.\nManica Diamond fans are optimistic of a good season but warned their team against complacency when they face FC Platinum.\n\u201cWe are happy with the team but there is need to improve on our attacking department. We need to score goals and we have a tough game with FC Platinum away. We need to play offensive football to win the match,\u201d a football supporter said.",
