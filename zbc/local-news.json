On Saturday, ZBC News observed contractors on-site erecting the barriers as part of efforts to restore order and protect the integrity of the newly commissioned road network.\nMotorists and transport operators welcomed the intervention, citing visible improvements in traffic discipline and safety at the busy junction.\n\u201cThis is a step in the right direction meant to curb reckless driving here. It was too much, and we were now experiencing traffic jams because of these drivers, so we are happy that the government is putting these barriers,\u201d a motorist, Tawanda Muza, said.\n\u201cI want to thank our President, Cde Emmerson Mnangagwa, for transforming our nation. So installing these jersey barriers will go a long way in bringing order to this place,\u201d Luckson Tachi said.\n\u201cIt was now all chaos here because commuter omnibus crews are doing what they want, so doing this will reduce cases of accidents and bring normalcy,\u201d another motorist added.\nTransport operators themselves also endorsed stricter enforcement, calling for accountability and greater discipline within their ranks.\n\u201cAs operators, we are saying anyone who commits an offence or damages public infrastructure must be arrested without fear or favour. We also urge all operators to become organised and adhere to the law,\u201d Mr Edmore Gwengwe said.",

This transformative project is a reflection of the dreams and dedication of its architect, His Lordship, the Right Reverend Bishop Sekuru Rudolf Nyandoro,\u201d he said.\nHe recalled that the vision for the centre was first publicly shared during Bishop Nyandoro\u2019s Silver Jubilee celebrations in Gweru last year, a vision that has now become a reality.\nThe highlight of the event was the ordination of six priests, each of whom had completed several years of theological and pastoral formation. The newly ordained include:\nReverend Kudzai Mabhena (Kwekwe)\nReverend Gerald Dube (Mberengwa)\nReverend Brian Kanyai (Gweru)\nReverend Reynold Machirori (Kwekwe)\nReverend Carlos Masiya (Kwekwe)\nReverend Calvin Mbenene\nOffering words of encouragement, Vice President Chiwenga described the priesthood as a noble and sacrificial vocation.\n\u201cTo our newly ordained priests, I extend my warmest and most heartfelt congratulations. You have embraced a calling that demands sacrifice, faith, and unwavering devotion. It is not an easy path, but it is one of eternal purpose and profound impact. May your hands bring healing to the broken, your words offer hope to the lost, and your hearts remain open to the will of God. You are now stewards of the sacred, walk boldly, humbly, and faithfully in that holy charge,\u201d he said.\nBishop Raymond Mupandasekwa, who leads the Masvingo Diocese, also addressed the congregation, urging the new priests to carry out their duties with integrity and compassion.",

It also helps in improving efficiency through the filing of cases online, tracking of cases and virtual hearings.\u201d\nTraditional leaders in the province also expressed support for the initiative, highlighting its potential to improve access to justice in rural communities.\n\u201cWe are happy that our courts are now going to be digital, it shows that as a country we are also adopting new technologies, hence it is going to be easier for many who had to travel long distances for court hearings, Case filing and payments,\u201d Chief Murinye said.\n\u201cThe programme is quite commendable and we encourage stakeholders to adopt it, however, we appeal for more awareness programmes so that communities, including those who are illiterate, will be able to access the digital court system for justice to be served,\u201d Chief Musara added.\nJSC Secretary, Mr Walter Chikwana said the goal is to ensure improved efficiency in all the courts through the use of technology, hence the implementation of IECMS.\n\u201cAs you are aware, since May 2022, as the JSC we started rolling out the IECMS programme, and now we are focusing on digitising our Magistrates\u2019 courts. We rolled out the programme in July and started with Mashonaland Central and Matabeleland North now, we are focusing on Masvingo and Matabeleland South.\n\u201cThis week we have been engaging our stakeholders in Gutu, Bikita, Zaka, Chiredzi, and now we are in Masvingo, conscientising our staff and other stakeholders that IECMS is coming, hence they have to embrace it and ensure it improves efficiency within our courts.\n\u201cThis programme will see our Magistrates\u2019 Courts going paperless, hence adopting new technology in our courts.
