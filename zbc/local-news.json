            "content": "Story by Theophilus Chuma\nHarare water treatment and provision services are heading for massive transformation under a private-public initiative sealed between Harare City Council and private players this Thursday.\nThe arrangement is expected to provide relief to the perennial water challenges that have haunted the capital city for years.\nThe new scope of arrangement for service delivery in Harare, culminating in a new water treatment plant for the capital city as well as the provision of smart metering, forms part of the strategies being implemented to enhance service delivery in local authorities.\nEarly this week, the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works announced a green light for private players to participate in service delivery in local authorities.\nA Memorandum of Understanding signed between Harare City Council and private players this Thursday signals the start of a new chapter for the capital.\n\u201cWe have said that our focus is to see improvement in service delivery within local authorities. The arrangement between Harare City Council, Helcrow and Laison will cover water purification, the construction of a treatment plant as well as the provision of smart metering. This falls in line with our vision to improve service delivery in Harare,\u201d said the Minister of Local Government and Public Works Honourable Daniel Garwe\nThe new arrangement is expected to reduce Harare\u2019s water purification bill running into several millions of dollars annually.\nHarare Mayor Councillor Jacob Mafume said, \u201cThe net effect is that all the money that we were using to purify water will be directed for other service use. What we anticipate is that when we reduce the loss of non-revenue water and reduce leakages, we increase our revenue collection, it will reduce the cost per head, and generally it will make it a bit more efficient than what we were having. We hope that we will get more water for the money we have been using.\u201d\nImplementing partners, Helcrow Private Limited and Laison Technology Company, are confident the deal will enhance the provision of reliable and portable water services for the capital city.",

To make matters worse our clinics are far,\u201d said a resident.\n\u201cSewage flowing into houses has become a normal site here, and this is exposing us to health hazards like cholera,\u201d said another resident.\n\u201cWe have been reporting to the local authority, but it seems they are not interested,\u201d another resident noted.\n\u201cWe are pleading with the Bulawayo City Council to hear our cries. We are tired of being neglected. We will end up dying because of this,\u201d added another resident.",

For NRZ, we are supporting it to source a credit from outside to fix the railway line, get more rolling stock and to fix the signaling system. So we are close to concluding a deal for an external credit line. l think we will see some progress during 2025 so that we can get some of the heavy trucks off the roads. We need to shift all that cargo to the railway infrastructure and this can be done commercially and profitably so that we can be able to service the loan.\u201d",
