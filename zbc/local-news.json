            "content": "Story by Oleen Ndori\nHARARE \u2013 THE two-day National Multi-Faith Economic Dialogue has ended with agreements to push the church\u2019s participation in the country\u2019s economic activities.\nAs part of its broader inclusive development thrust, the ruling ZANU PF party has been engaging religious stakeholders to ensure their participation in national economic activities.\nThe latest dialogue session, which brought together representatives from various faith-based organisations, ended with delegates pledging to support the government\u2019s economic vision.\nBishop Nehemiah Mutendi affirmed the church\u2019s active role in national growth.\n\u201cAs the church we are not listening in and observing, but we are taking part in this growth of the economy.\u201d\n\u201cThe meeting was important in shaping and exchanging ideas in how the church can support Government vision,\u201d Sheikh Ishmael Duwa said.\n\u201cWith empowerment we can strengthen community \u2013 government cooperation,\u201d Luxod Mutova said.\n\u201cAs the church we applaud the inclusion of our voices in shaping the country\u2019s economic outlook,\u201d Apostle Biggy Mutazu said.\nThe Special Presidential Advisor, Dr Paul Tungwarara, says the inclusion of everyone feeds directly into the \u201cleaving no one and no place behind\u201d vision by President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\u201cPeople from different churches are spread across all provinces. If they are empowered, we will see development across the entire country\u2014including in remote areas. That is what the President wants: inclusive development involving everyone. He remains the President for all churches and he wants everyone to be involved in development,\u201d he said.\nZANU PF National Political Commissar, Cde Munyaradzi Machacha, enunciated the goal of the interface in bridging the gap between government, the party, and interfaith groupings.\n\u201cWe had a productive two-day engagement between the party and various church and faith-based organisations. Our aim was to build bridges, so churches can better understand national development frameworks such as NDS1 and NDS2, and identify roles they can play to help achieve Vision 2030\u2019s goal of becoming an upper-middle-income economy. We are encouraged that the message has been well received.\u201d",
