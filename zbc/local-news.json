            "content": "Story by Fairstars Mukungurutse\nA national study on violence against women in politics by the Zimbabwe Gender Commission has revealed that gender-based violence is a significant barrier to women\u2019s full participation in politics.\nThe national study commissioned by the Zimbabwe Gender Commission in partnership with United Nations Women in Harare this Wednesday seeks to promote zero tolerance to all forms of gender-based violence against women in politics.\nThe survey revealed a worrying trend of women parliamentary candidates experiencing some form of violence including harassment, cyber-bullying, emotional and verbal abuse perpetrated by both men and women.\nChairperson of the Zimbabwe Gender Commission, Commissioner Margaret Mukahanana Sangarwe called for a multi-stakeholder approach to effectively address violence against women in the politics.\n\u201cNo single solution can eradicate this vice. Instead, we must adopt a wide array of measures across different levels to effectively address the various forms of violence women face in the political arena while taking into account the complex contexts in which these incidents occur. The report comes with a set of recommendations for multi-sectoral stakeholders on preventing and responding to violence some of which include the implementation of legislation and policies that address violence against women in politics and holding political parties accountable to gender equality and women empowerment commitments,\u201d Commissioner Sangarwe noted.\nJapanese Deputy Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Hiro Yuki expressed commitment to continue supporting the country\u2019s efforts to eradicate GBV, sentiments echoed by a representative from the French embassy Mrs Lucie Gal-Ong.",

Previously we would rely on Gweru City Council to deal with fire. This meant that we could not move with speed in addressing such outbreaks and chances of serving lives and properties were slim. Now we have just been equipped with this truck and hopefully our services will improve,\u201d said Vungu Rural District Council acting chairperson, Miss Loreen Maheru.",

            "content": "IN a bold step toward combating climate change and fostering sustainable development, Zimbabwe has officially launched a comprehensive carbon market framework.\nThe initiative, unveiled at a high-profile event at the COP29 Climate Conference in Balu Azerbaijan, aims to position the country as a leader in carbon market development, while advancing national commitments under the Paris Agreement.\nThe new framework, developed in collaboration with international environmental experts and local stakeholders, provides a regulated platform for the development and trade of Article 6 compliant carbon credits.\nBuilding on the experience of other early movers like Ghana, Zimbabwe\u2019s framework includes several first of their kind innovations, including;\n\u2022 A blockchain based national carbon registry: designed to support seamless digital transactions within a secure digital ecosystem.\n\u2013 Strict environmental and social safeguards: ensuring that all carbon projects make meaningful contributions to sustainable development and do not come at the expense of the wellbeing of local communities and the natural environment.\n\u2013 Strengthened legal protections: securing the rights of investors and local communities.\n\u2013 An improved regulatory framework: designed to provide clear guidelines for public and private sector participation while providing all projects a clear pathway to Article 6 eligibility.\nThe framework introduces clear guidelines for verifying, registering, and trading carbon credits, ensuring transparency and alignment with international standards.\nClear guidelines not only guide investors through the project development process but streamline the steps needed for end users to purchase and use Article 6 eligible credits.\nIn addition to requiring all project developers to increase their investment in community development, the government has pledged to allocate the majority of all carbon market proceeds to the National Climate Fund (NCF) to finance national climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives.\nThe framework comes at a crucial moment, paving the way for existing projects to transition to Article 6 eligibility.\nBy generating Article 6 eligible credits, local developers will not only be able to achieve higher profits but will be able to access new markets, including CORSIA and national compliance markets abroad.\nWith this framework, Zimbabwe joins a growing list of African nations leveraging carbon markets to address climate change while creating economic opportunities.\nThe country\u2019s abundant natural resources and commitment to sustainability make it well-positioned to become a key player in the global carbon trading ecosystem.",
