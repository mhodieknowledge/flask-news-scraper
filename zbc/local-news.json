            "content": "Story by Providence Maraneli\nAS the country commemorates 45 years of Independence in the coming week, the nation has a lot to celebrate, given the massive transformation at the busiest port of entry in sub-Saharan Africa, the Beitbridge Border Post which has become an epitome of efficiency.\nCutting-edge, futuristic, innovative, smart, advanced and tech-powered this is the Beitbridge border post in Matabeleland South Province.\nFor the busiest port of entry in Sub-Saharan Africa, clearing more than 12 000 travellers a day, the place was susceptible to illicit activities.\nNot so long ago, the area was a haven for all forms of criminal activities one may think of.\nTales of impersonation of immigration officials, human trafficking and contraband dealing were no longer newsworthy.\nOf major concern, however, was the rampant smuggling and leakages which made the country lose millions in potential revenue.\nFor a country that is on a great recovery and surging towards a national vision of an upper middle-income society by 2030, the government entered into an agreement with the Zimborders consortium for the total transformation of the border post injecting US$300 million.\nFitted with biometric scanners and e-gates, the border post is now a marvel to all and sundry and travellers like Mrs Chipo Basopo who took only seconds to be cleared have a lot to celebrate.\n\u201cI am so impressed with the systems at the border, now we can scan our passports on our own, and it is so fast, you do not need anyone to help you and it is so efficient,\u201d Mrs Basopo said.\n\u201cWe are proud of our government for coming up with this border modernisation project, it is now efficient, you do not spend time and it has reduced theft and middlemen,\u201d a cross border said.\n\u201cNow no one can use your passport because the biometric machines will catch you, we are so proud of our country. It took me just below two minutes to be done,\u201d a traveller added.\nUnder the new system, the e-gates enable travellers to scan their biometric passports and undergo automated identity verification, replacing the need for manual checks by officials.\n\u201cThese are used to clear travellers with E-passports and we have a major acceptance by our travellers and it has enhanced efficiency,\u201d the Assistant Regional Immigration Officer in Charge of the Beitbridge Border post, Mrs Canisia Magaya said.\n\u201cWe have moved a step further, in making our importers and travellers aware of all the necessary requirements before they come to the border and this has improved efficiency,\u201d ZIMRA Manager for the Beitbridge Border post, Mrs Winfred Chiyangwa said.\nThe automation of the border post, installation of 600 CCTV cameras and drone surveillance have also aided in winning the war against marauding touts.\n\u201cWhat we do now is, once we catch touts in the border post we enter them into facial recognition and whenever they trespass they are detected and arrested and it has helped us weed the problem,\u201d The officer commanding crime and operations in Beitbridge, Superintendent Philisani Ndebele said.\nThe adoption of hi-tech at the border impressed the joint Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Defense, Home Affairs and Thematic Committee on Peace and Security which recently toured the facility.\n\u201cWe are proud of this project, we want travellers to appreciate us as a country, to say we have really upgraded our border, we have got E-gates, and we have got everything else. So we want to make sure that when our travellers come through they pass through without any problem, so thank you so much keep up the good work,\u201d Legislator, Honourable Thokozani Khupe said.",
