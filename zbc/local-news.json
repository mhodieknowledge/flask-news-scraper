            "content": "\nStory by Tapiwa Machemedze\nMVURWI town which has been experiencing rapid growth is targeting to achieve municipal status after the commissioning of several projects in line with its aspirations.\nDevolution-funded initiatives, including sewer ponds with the capacity to support 23 000 households, a refuse compactor, and a fire tenderwere commissioned by the government in Mvurwi this Friday.\nThe servicing of 600 medium-density stands has also commenced, with residents welcoming these positive developments.\n\u201cWe are happy and hopeful that the new refuse compactor will improve service delivery. We also expect the fire tender to help mitigate the danger of fires. However, we urge the council to ensure that the hydrants are functioning properly, otherwise, the fire tender will be ineffective,\u201d one of the beneficiaries said.\n\u201cAs young people, we applaud the devolution fund for making projects possible. However, we cannot afford the current stands and call upon the council to support us by availing high-density stands tailored for the youth,\u201d another beneficiary noted.\nMvurwi Town Council leaders praised the devolution funds for contributing towards the completion of projects.\n\u201cAs Mvurwi Town Council, our vision aligns with the national agenda. His Excellency, Cde E.D. Mnangagwa and his government have emphasised the goal of achieving an upper-middle-income society. We are committed to that vision and are also working toward attaining municipal status, which is why we have commissioned these projects today,\u201d Mvurwi Town Clerk, Dr Sheryl Nyakudya said.\n\u201cWith regard to the minimum service delivery standards recently set by the government, I can confidently say that Mvurwi is ahead, we are leading. Agriculture is the backbone of our town, so our vision is to establish support services that promote not only agriculture but also manufacturing. We also plan to establish an agricultural university to ensure young people can acquire skills and perfect their trade,\u201d Mvurwi Town Chairman Tonderai Samhu added.",

The window latches are also coming apart, and some of the door hinges are already coming apart. Especially for a health post building, it does not meet our minimum requirements for a medical facility,\u201d Hwange DMO, Dr Fungai Musinami said.\n\u201cFor this clinic, we are not happy. Locals should be involved in tenders for such projects. We cannot even talk about this clinic, let alone inviting dignitaries to see such shoddy work, no, we are disappointed and we think this should be destroyed and rebuilt afresh,\u201d Traditional Leader, Chief Nekatambe\u00a0added.",
