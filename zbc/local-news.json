We have seen it fit to come and learn so that we know how to develop a landfill since we have decommissioned our dumpsite,\u201d Masvingo City Council\u2019s Deputy Director of Environmental Health Services, Ms Sitabile Matava said.",

It will help us greatly.\u201d\nTraditional leader, Chief Negomo extended his gratitude to NAC for complementing government efforts in providing safe and clean water to various communities.\n\u201cI want to thank NAC for responding when we call, but it is saddening to note that we have gathered for a disease caused by uncleanliness. Let us change our habits so that we gather for good things,\u201d Chief Negomo said.\nFor the NAC, the boreholes signify a step in promoting good health, while the government maintained its commitment to providing clean water for all people.",

            "content": "Story by Lisa Masuku\nA family in Bulawayo is living in fear as it is reportedly being plagued by inexplicable fires that erupt spontaneously, destroying property and leaving them in financial ruin.\nJournalist Methuseli Moyo and his family have been experiencing these mysterious fires since late February, with the blazes breaking out without warning and wreaking havoc in their home.\n\u201cThese fires started towards the end of February. They ignite from nowhere, and this has been happening for some time now. We no longer feel safe here,\u201d said Moyo.\nThe inexplicable infernos have already consumed most of the family\u2019s possessions, including US$20 000 in cash, money they had just received from selling one of their properties.\n\u201cThe fires intensified on March 1, and now it has become a daily struggle to put them out. If you look at our walls and furniture, they are in a terrible state,\u201d he added.\nMoyo\u2019s wife, Ntombizodwa Mhlanga, recounted the devastating moment when the family lost their money in one of the sudden blazes.\n\u201cWe had planned to move out, but as soon as we collected the money and placed it in the wardrobe, the section where the cash was stored mysteriously caught fire. Within seconds, it was gone,\u201d she said.\nIt is even more difficult for Moyo\u2019s wife, Ntombizodwa Mhlanga, who has had to watch her husband sustain severe burns from the strange fires.\n\u201cThe fires have not only destroyed our property. My husband has sustained serious burns. The funny thing is that when the fire attacks him, it\u2019s invisible. He will be screaming that he is on fire, but we won\u2019t be seeing anything,\u201d Ntombizodwa Mhlanga said.\nThe heart-wrenching mystery fires experienced by the Moyo family have left the community in shock and grief.\n\u201cWhat is happening to the Moyo family is very sad. The family has suffered, and they no longer feel safe in their own house,\u201d Community member, Skha Dlodlo said.",

So that will act as a deterrent to stamp out all the malcontents within the education sector,\u201d Minister of Primary and Secondary Education, Honourable Torerai Moyo said.\nThe government and private sector partnership in the education sector, registration of schools as well as mushrooming of illegal learning institutions also hogged the limelight.",

They are very wary of the trouble of mayhem because they know what it does, so they were cautious, it is called vigilance on their part. They wanted to see the depth, scale and scope of what the detractors were up to. So they were assessing the situation, that is what happened yesterday. They did not want to fall into the trap of those in Mozambique, in Maputo and then have unnecessary loss of life.\nAmbassador Mutsvangwa also paid tribute to the security services for ensuring peace across the country.",
