            "content": "Story by Gay Matambo\nPERSONS with disability often face marginalisation, lack of access to employment and life opportunities owing to their incapacity.\nOne often wonders what the daily struggles of a family comprising of seven visually impaired members include.\nWhenever it is dark, we rush to find comfort and security in a place where there is light, but for the Matavire family nature and genetics was not so kind as it embedded darkness in their everyday lives.\nMrs Maria Matavire and her husband of village 18 in Feversham area, Chiredzi North who are both visually impaired, never dreamt that all their five children were also going to inherit the same impairment.\nThere is an adage which says \u201cwhen going through difficult times, there are few friends to help you\u201d, and this has made the family learn to get on with their day to day lives on their own, despite the huge risk of hurting themselves in the process.\n\u201cWhen I gave birth to my first child, after noticing that he could not see we took him to the Doctors in Morgenster and they told us to return with him at the age of five. We went back and they said they could not figure out how to help him regain his eyesight.\n\u201cWith my second born, I decided to go to give birth in Mozambique where I was born. The doctors confirmed she could see when she was born, and when we were walking home from the hospital that is when my aunt told me that the baby could not see anymore. So this has been the trend, on all of my children. When they were born the midwives told us they could see but shortly after, a few days at most, the elders would confirm that the children could not see anymore. I have learnt to do things on my own. I cook, fetch water and clean on my own. Sometimes our relatives assist us but we have learnt to do things on our own,\u201d Mrs Matavire said.\nThe couple\u2019s wish is to know what caused the blindness of their children and maybe, if it is an illness that can be cured, they hope that maybe in future, their children will be able to regain their eyesight.\n\u201cIf funds would permit I would be more than happy to know what caused the blindness and get to the bottom of this because with me, I could see when I was born up to the age of seven and my parents said measles caused the loss of my eyesight same with my wife she could see when she was born. For me, my wish is to know the cause of this demise that has befallen my family.\n\u201cBack then I used to own goats but I lost most of them from diseases so we would sell the goats to make ends meet and even pay school fees for the children who are at school at Copota School of the blind in Masvingo.\n\u201cAt the moment it is a bit difficult for us. I do not want to lie though the future is bright because the children are registered under the government\u2019s BEAM programme,\u201d Mr Shackmore Matavire said.\nAlthough relatives and neighbours seem to share their pain, they can only do so much.\n\u201cI am the grandmother and the family lives with me here. It is a sore sight to see my children and grandchildren like this. I have always asked myself what caused this but I have no answers,\u201d Gogo Matavire said.",

I want to thank the government and the President for giving me this opportunity,\u201d a beneficiary said.\n\u201cI will look after my goats and grow them to a herd that sustains my business,\u201d another beneficiary said.\n\u201cFor me as a woman, this means a lot. It means being involved in a business mainly a preserve for man. Thank you, President Mnangagwa,\u201d a beneficiary added.\nThe project seeks to ensure women are kept in the mainstream national means of production and economic development.",
