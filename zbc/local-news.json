By 2019, she was unable to walk, and her relatives resorted to transporting her in a wheelbarrow.\nTouched by her circumstances, thegovernment moved swiftly to provide assistance and alleviate the family\u2019s burden.\n\u201cIt has been a difficult moment for us. Back then, she would struggle with her walk and talk, but it was a bit better. However, things turned worse when her mother died in 2019. At the hospital, several tests were done, but nothing was found. We have been struggling to take her from point A to B, as we had to push her in a wheelbarrow.\n\u201cShe is a devout Christian who doesn\u2019t want to miss church, and this wheelchair will help her a lot. We want to thank the government for remembering us at our hour of need,\u201d Mrs Rosemary Sibanda, a relative of Zvapera.\nThe government says meeting the social needs of communities is part of the Second Republic\u2019s inclusive development approach.",
