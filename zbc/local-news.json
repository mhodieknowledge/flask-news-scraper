What is striking about this decision that she made was that she had not even attained that age of majority at that time. Despite this, she felt compelled enough to sacrifice her life for Zimbabwe to attain independence.\u00a0 In addition, this decision defied the gender stereotype that only males could fight for their country.\u201d\nGeneral Sibanda challenged members of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces to jealously guard the gains of the hard-won independence.\n\u201cThe next challenge ahead is to consolidate the gains of our hard-won Independence by attaining high development standards and levels as envisaged by the President and Commander in Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, Comrade Dr ED Mnangagwa.\u00a0 To this end, we all have a responsibility to ensure that Zimbabwe attains an upper-middle income status, which will translate into the improvement of welfare of citizens and ourselves as members of the ZDF.\u201d\nTo the family and friends, Air Vice Marshal (Retired) Mandeya was a unifier.\n\u201cWe have lost a family unifier and the void she left will be difficult to fill,\u201d brother, Dr Eric Mandeya said.\nBorn on July 14, 1960, in Rusape, Air Vice Marshal (Retired) Mandeya joined the liberation struggle in 1975 at the age of 15 and survived the Nyadzonya bombings.\nAfter receiving military training in Nachingweya in 1976 in Tanzania, Air Vice Marshal (Retired) Mandeya was deployed to Gaza Province, Mozambique, where she served in the medical corps.\nWhile at Nyadzonya after the attack, Air Vice Marshal (Retired) Mandeya participated in the construction of the Barracks along Nyadzonia River.\nAt ceasefire, the late AFZ senior officer remained with other Comrades in Mozambique and only came back to a new Zimbabwe in 1980, along with the last group of patients.\nCde Cabby Rujekorwehondo, as she was known during her post-independence military career, was distinguished by a series of firsts.",
