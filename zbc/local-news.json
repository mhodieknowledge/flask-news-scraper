The youths should stand up and demand to be included in national and community development programmes. I am saddened by the prevailing situation of drug and substance abuse which is not only affecting the youths alone, but adults as well.",

            "content": "Story by Gay Matambo\nThe five-megawatt Mutirikwi Mini-Hydro Power Plant in Masvingo has become one of the significant milestones under the Second Republic, which has identified energy as a key driver of Vision 2030.\nThe plant was completed late last year and is now operating at full capacity.\nThe Mutirikwi Mini Hydro Power station is one of the major projects implemented by the Second Republic in Masvingo Province as part of government\u2019s energy self-sufficiency drive.\nThe project is harnessing the abundant water resources of Mutirikwi to generate electricity which is being fed into the national grid.\nMasvingo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Honourable Ezra Chadzamira said, \u201cMasvingo was receiving two megawatts of electricity from the national, but because of the devolution policy that says when you are generating electricity you have to use it locally, now we have an additional 5 megawatts which have been added to what we were receiving, that means an end to load shedding in Masvingo town. All the institutions which are very critical such as the hospital and also the pump station which supplies water to Masvingo urban and security departments now have permanent electricity supply.\u201d\nThe Mini Hydro Power plant, which has been operational since November last year, has emerged as a major boost to the country\u2019s energy needs.\n\u201cOn 9 November, we reached commercial operation stage which means we started to put power into the national grid. This means we are fully operating at 100 percent, 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year and we are generating 5 megawatts. As of now, we are exceeding 5 megawatts which means our plant to some extent can exceed the 5 megawatts rated for this plant,\u201d Mutirikwi Hydro Power Plant site manager Mr Austin Boora noted.\n\u201cWe get around 120 megawatt hours per day. This is the energy that the plant can produce for 24 hours, 5 megawatts is the power but then if we want to find the amount of energy that is actually supplied in 24 hours is 120 megawatt hours. The 5 megawatts is able to supply 3000 households with electricity,\u201d noted Mutirikwi Hydro Power Plant Manager Engineer Justice Jangano.\nThe Mutirikwi Mini Hydro Power Station will not only contribute to closing energy gaps in Zimbabwe, but will also ensure irrigation pumping from the lake is maintained while providing some assured power for users in the area, in a development that has excited the community.",

            "content": "Story Tafara Chikumira, Midlands Bureau Chief\nTHE Government continues to improve learning conditions for students by constructing classroom blocks and availing Information Communication Technology (ICT) gadgets across the country.\nSelukwe High School in the Midlands province was the place to be this Thursday as the government commissioned a classroom block and distributed ICT gadgets, some of which were made available by development partners.\n\u201cWe are very excited as parents at Selukwe High. The Block has been on the cards for quite some time now and its completion is a huge relief to us. Children were overcrowded in a situation that was making the learning process a toll order. Now we can safely say our children can learn in a friendly environment,\u201d SDA chair for Selukwe Chrome High School, Mrs Eunice Kokai.\nThe Second Republic\u2019s engagement and reengagement efforts are also bearing fruit with World Vision donating one thousand 100 tablets, while Unki Mine donated 22 digital learning instruments for schools in the province to enhance interactive learning and access to digital educational content.\n\u201cMy school is one of the schools in remote areas. Heritage-based learning requires ICT gadgets. The gadgets we have here will help even in the pass rate of the school as our children can now compete with their peers in urban areas. We have indeed managed to achieve some positive development with the help of our government,\u201d Totonga Primary School Head Mr Tauya Gova.\n\u201cAs students, we were failing to realize our full potential. Some of us might be good at ICTs but fail to get the necessary exposure. The ICT gadgets will go a long way in identifying future ICT gurus.\u201d\nThe government is excited by the progress which is in line with the Second Republic\u2019s vision 2030.\n\u201cBy investing in education and infrastructure, we are not only addressing current needs but also laying the groundwork for future generations.\n\u201cThis vision underscores the commitment to inclusivity, ensuring that marginalized and disadvantaged communities are given the support they need to participate fully in society. Through initiatives like the STEP-UP programme, we are actively working to bridge gaps in access and quality, empowering every child to reach their full potential,\u201d the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Honourable Torerai Moyo.",

The chasing away of enterprise resource package in 2019 at the recommendation of management has resulted in the City Council not managing to produce audited accounts.\n\u201cERP is the only tool the auditor general and management can verify accounts hence management conspired to get rid of ERP,\u201d Mayor Mafume said.\u201cThe books of accounts are done manually, which means documentation can be changed and very difficult to chase.\u201d\nCouncillor Mafume admitted financial mismanagement within the city council\u2019s operations is contributing to a marked decline in service delivery across the capital.",
