            "content": "Story by Tafara Chikumira\nTHE transformation of Mtapa Hall in Gweru into a national monument is progressing well, with workers on site.\nLocated in the middle of one of Gweru\u2019s oldest high-density suburbs of Mtapa is a building of historical significance by the name Mtapa Hall.\nThe building is famed for having hosted the first ZANU congress in 1964, ushering in a political leadership that would complement other political movements in fighting the liberation struggle.\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa was among the many nationalists who attended the congress which saw the late national hero, Cde Ndabaningi Sithole being elected President, while the late former President Robert Mugabe was elected Secretary General.\nThe hall has since been identified as a historical monument due to its significance after the newly formed political outfit came up with a resolution to wage an armed struggle against the settler regime and correct some injustices that were being perpetrated by the white minority against the indigenous black majority.\nWhile the hall held this essential congress, nationalists had to strategise and come up with new ways of meeting and discussing the way forward after the hall became a no-go area as soon as the white minority got wind of the decisive congress, leading to the ban of ZANU a year later by the Ian Smith regime.\n\u201cI only came to Gweru in 1969. However, the situation had changed then, we would do meetings inside people\u2019s houses as it was no longer possible to host political meetings in the hall. One of us would play surveillance on top of the roof and as soon as they see police officers approaching, they will whisper and we would go dead silent. We needed to be extra vigilant and the hall was mainly used for boxing after the 1964 congress,\u201d nationalist, Cde Parwaringira Matiki said.\n74-year-old war veteran, Cde Joseph Bvura says after the congress, it was no longer possible to use the hall as all eyes were now fixed on the infrastructure.\n\u201cWhen I tried crossing to Mozambique, we were stopped by the colonialists. I had to come here but it was no longer easy to say I was looking for ZANU. We were using the name the People\u2019s Movement. We used to meet at the Gweru River there or sometimes in people\u2019s houses. We only managed to use this building well after independence thus when we started hosting meetings in the hall.\u201d\nThe transformation of the historical hall into a national monument has brought about positive change to the Mtapa suburb.\nThe hall has received massive renovations and a solar-powered borehole has since been installed to provide clean water to the people, and the government is happy with the development.\n\u201cThe President\u2019s mantra that no one and no place should be left behind in national development is being experienced across the country. Today we see this Mtapa Hall getting some renovations. The idea to decentralise Independence Celebrations is changing the Midlands. President Emmerson Mnangagwa is a visionary leader who is transforming communities,\u201d Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Honourable Kazembe Kazembe said.",
