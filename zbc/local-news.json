            "content": "Story by Providence Maraneli\nThe Second Republic\u2019s commitment to the provision of quality education for its citizenry is on display after a new modern school, Mathendele Primary in Plumtree, was commissioned this Friday.\nAccording to the 2022 census, Plumtree town has experienced a rapid growth in development coupled with a relatively high population of children of the school-going age.\nIt further points out that of the estimated 20 000 people that live in the border town, each homestead has an average of four people, with two being children of school-going age.\nThe number of schools, however, did not meet the needs of this population, with Dingumuzi Primary School accommodating almost 2000 pupils.\nAs such, in line with the government\u2019s commitment to provide quality education for all, Plumtree Town Council channeled devolution funds to the construction of a new school.\nPlumtree Town Secretary Mr Thembalami Nyoni said, \u201cWe noted the increase in population and the growth of the town and thought we should construct this school so that we provide quality education for our children. We used money from revenue collection and devolution funds.\u201d\n\u201cWe as Plumtree Council are in full support of Vision 2030, where we are saying education for all by 2030. Our wish is to have a lot of schools here in Plumtree by 2030 so that we don\u2019t have children who may fail to get a place in schools. We want all children to access education. We are open to investors in education so that we transform our area,\u201d Plumtree Town Councillor Maxwell Washaya said.\nThe project, which gobbled US$198 000, joins a long list of new schools constructed in Matabeleland South, including Poli-Magama in Matobo, Jonsley Primary in Gwanda and Pezulu Primary School teachers quarters in Insiza, as the government commits to the provision of quality education to its citizenry.\n\u201cThe coming in of Mathendele decongest schools in this town, the ministry remains committed to fulfilling the potential of learners in the education sector, provision of better access and quality education to every pupil and this remains very key. By investing in schools, the government is investing in future leaders who will drive Zimbabwe to a prosperous economy,\u201d Matabeleland Provincial Education Director Mrs Beatrice Manjere said.",

This move has come at the right time as we look forward to do all we can to avoid accidents because most of them are because of human error,\u201d Zimbabwe Passenger Transport Organisation\u2019s secretary, Mr Wilfred Chibage said.",

            "content": "Story by Memory Chamisa\nTHE Government is forging ahead with the implementation of people-centered development programmes to accelerate the country\u2019s transformation to an empowered, modern, prosperous, and highly industrialised society by 2030.\nFrom the borehole sinking programme, construction of the temporary market to accommodate traders, and now the Presidential Vendors Fund launched this Friday, Musha Mukuru as Mbare is popularly known, has come out the biggest winner of the developmental trajectory being spearheaded by the Second Republic.\nThe Launch of the US$50 000 Presidential Vendors Fund is expected to uplift the livelihoods of vendors at zero percent interest.\nFor the beneficiaries, the initiative is set to ensure the competitiveness of their enterprises.\n\u201cHis Excellency has shown that he loves us people from Mbare. The various programmes he has implemented have eased the challenges we have faced before from water, workspace, and now the vendors\u2019 fund at zero interest for that matter we really appreciate him,\u201d said one beneficiary of the programme.\n\u201cAs youths, the President is on record saying go and make money and him providing us with the Vendors Fund has shown the confidence he has in us and this is going to make a huge impact and take youths away from drug and substance abuse,\u201d added another.\n\u201cMbare has been one of those places that have been frowned upon and associated with all society\u2019s ills but since the coming of the Second Republic the narrative has changed from residential to the business side and we are grateful to the President for giving us that dignity,\u201d noted a resident.\nHanding over the fund to the ZANU PF leadership, Presidential Business Advisor Dr Paul Tungwarara reaffirmed the governments\u2019 commitment to spurring development in communities for the attainment of Vision 2030.\n\u201cThe President is one leader who is committed to ensuring his people are prosperous from health, business-wise, and all the programmes he has implemented have ensured that livelihoods are sustained. Mbare has proved itself that it is a powerhouse and business evolves from here hence this fund will go a long way in ensuring vendors are capacitated and their businesses are sustained.\n\u201cWe know the fire that gutted the market last year affected many but we now have to look forward to the completion of the temporary structure that will ensure wares are safe and vendors have a conducive place to sell their wares too. The President has said if this money is put to good use he is going to add another US$50 000 to make it US$100 000 in the Fund.\nThe ZANU PF leadership noted the significance of the fund in propelling the growth of the SME sector in Mbare.",

Upon our return, we passed through the water-filled pit and Tanaka said I want to test how deep the water is, that\u2019s when he slipped inside. He called my name once before his whole body was submerged in water. That\u2019s when I rushed to look for help,\u201d a young boy who was with Tanaka narrated the ordeal.\nHelp came, but it was already too late to save the young boy.\n\u201cWhen I heard a child had drowned, I quickly dashed to the spot, removed my clothes and went inside the water. My whole body was submerged in water because the pit was deep.\u00a0I then managed to locate the child and carried him out of the water, but I noticed that we had already lost him,\u201d a neighbour, Mr Japhet Chinganga said.\nHis mother, Mrs Mercy Taimo narrated her sad story.\n\u201cI spent the greater part of the day with Tanaka and his friend here at home. I didn\u2019t even notice the time they left home. I only became aware they were not home after my other son came running saying Tanaka had drowned. We then rushed to the spot and by the time we arrived, my child had been taken out of the water. We then drove to a nearby clinic, but unfortunately, it was too late.\u201d\nAdelaid Park residents have raised concern over the open pits dotted across the area.\n\u201cThis is not the only pit in this area, there are a lot of holes dug by the quarry mine and we don\u2019t even know why they are putting the lives of our children at risk,\u201d a resident said.\n\u201cWe have little children and how are we supposed to ensure our kids are safe? Kids being kids, they love to explore,\u201d voiced another.\n\u201cApart from these dangerous pits, our children are at risk of being run over by speeding trucks from the mine,\u201d another stated.",
