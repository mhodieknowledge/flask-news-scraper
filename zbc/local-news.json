            "content": "Story by Kenias Chivuzhe\nTHE Second Republic\u2019s drive to improve the national road network is recording huge progress, with Buhera residents praising the ongoing tarring of the Murambinda-Birchenough Road.\nFollowing the commissioning of the Sabi Star Lithium Mine, President Emmerson Mnangagwa assured the people of Buhera that the Murambinda-Birchenough Road would be rehabilitated as part of the broader effort to upgrade the country\u2019s road network.\nTrue to his word, road construction and tarring works from the Birchenough side have reached five kilometres, with villagers appreciative of the landmark development in their area.\n\u201cWe were facing transport challenges and it was expensive to go to Birchenough Bridge before the surfacing of this road. We therefore appeal to road authorities for road surfacing works to continue,\u201d a resident stated.\nWork is also underway from the Murambinda side as the surfacing is being conducted from both sides of the 120-kilometre road stretch.\n\u201cMany people in Murambinda were employed following the commencement of this project. We thank the government for rehabilitating our road and we are looking forward for this section to be completed before August,\u201d a Buhera resident said.\nManicaland Provincial Construction Engineer Patrick Muropa spoke on the progress recorded so far.",

            "content": "Story by Tafara Chikumira\nTHE Midlands province has been plunged into mourning after the death of prominent Gweru businessman and philanthropist Mr Lazarus Chikadaya this Wednesday.\nThe Drawlink founding Director, Mr Chikadaya died in Harare this Wednesday after a short illness.\nFamily spokesperson Ms Conceptor Mpofu told ZBC News they have been robbed of a key figure in the family.\n\u201cHe was everything in this family. He would take everyone on board without segregation. The void he has left will be difficult to fill. We have just been robbed, and it took us by a huge surprise.\u201d\nThe construction industry has been left poorer as Mr Chikadaya was among those who are pushing the country\u2019s industrialisation agenda.\n\u201cI must say it is not only the Southern Region that has lost, but the whole country at large. Mr Chikadaya was instrumental in road construction currently being spearheaded by the Second Republic. In Gweru, he is in the top two of those in the construction industry in terms of capacity. He changed the lives of many,\u201d Businessman, Dr Josiya Tayi said.\n\u201cHe inspired me to return to the construction industry after I had stopped. He has contributed immensely to the country\u2019s development. One thing I liked about the way he was doing business was his ability to romp in his family. This will ensure continuity, so I am generally not worried about the company going forward.\u201d\nWorkers from his establishments added their voices saying although they have lost the head of the ship, they will work hard to ensure Mr Chikadaya\u2019s dream remains alive.\n\u201cHe was not only my boss, but rather a mentor. He taught me some serious life lessons that have changed my life in general. I am who I am today because of Mr Chikadaya,\u201d an employee said.\n\u201cTo me, Mr Chikadaya was more than my boss. He took me from the streets and offered me a life. He was more like a father figure to me,\u201d another said.",
