We are working closely with the police and the judiciary to achieve our goal of zero poaching and I want to reiterate and warn members of the public to make sure they are not found in protected areas while armed. We also recovered more than 80 rifles and other ammunition. Over 58 convictions of mandatory sentences were done. We have also managed to recover live pangolins which people are poaching for different reasons. Community engagements have also played a significant role in protecting our wildlife and ensuring perpetrators are brought to book and justice is delivered.\u201d",

            "content": "Story by Oleen Ndori\nGOVERNMENT has implored home seekers to ensure all applications and acquisitions are above board, as the Second Republic targets to deliver one million housing units by 2025.\nResponding to questions from the media during the inaugural Ministers Meet the Media Forum in Harare this Thursday, National Housing and Social Amenities Minister Honourable Zhemu Soda said the current crisis of home demolitions stem from irregular acquisition or building on improperly acquired land, urging all potential home seekers to be diligent.\n\u201cTo our potential home seekers, all applications and acquisitions must be above board. Whenever that is done irregularly, obviously the harm of the law will take its course. We encourage all home seekers, despite their desperation, that acquisition of ten houses must be done properly. Whenever it is not done properly, there are problems that are associated with that. Already, we are grappling with the issue of regularisation of dysfunctional settlements that were created previously where people just went on to construct their homes without adequate supporting services like roads, the other amenities, schools, cr\u00e8ches and even the shopping centres. They are supposed to be there to support a community or a settlement. So we are at the moment grappling with that correction,\u201d he said.\nHonourable Soda also revealed government is intervening in providing solutions to poor town planning by the City of Harare which has led to illegal structures, with some being built on wetlands.\n\u201cThe issue comes back to Harare City Council, where there has to be new planning for the discharge of waste, especially from the houses that are being constructed and also the other link has been to the wetlands where we are finding that some houses are now being constructed in wetlands which ordinarily are not supposed to be available for house construction.\n\u201cAll that comes back to the issue of planning, which the city of Harare is responsible for and even the upgrades of the waste management and waste reticulation assistance. But as a ministry, working together with them, it is our wish that whenever people are being settled, the places must be habitable, places which are not susceptible to hazards like natural hazards. Plus, for instance, what we did in Budiriro 5B in 2021, where some families were left homeless as a result of poor planning. So it is our hope that whenever our local authorities are allocating areas for settling people, the areas must be suitable, properly planned so that we don\u2019t have a repeat of what\u2019s currently obtaining.\u201d\nThe Housing Minister also celebrated significant milestones his portfolio has made towards national housing targets which have been revised to one million housing units by 2025.",
