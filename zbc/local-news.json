            "content": "Story by Fairstars Mukungurutse\nTRANSPORT operators have been urged to desist from setting unreasonable targets which are exerting unnecessary pressure on drivers, leading to an increase in road traffic accidents.\nWith statistics indicating that 94 percent of road accidents are due to human error, the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe (TSCZ) has implored transport operators to shun unreasonable daily targets for drivers as they end up defying road rules and regulations.\n\u201cWe urge transport operators to avoid giving hard targets. When you do an analysis of the accidents, particularly during this festive season, they are a result of speeding, and we believe they are a result of targets given to drivers that forces the driver to go beyond their limits. Our appeal to operators is to avoid giving those targets, they are not helpful, they endanger passengers,\u201d said TSCZ\u2019s managing director, Mr Munesu Munodawafa.\nAcknowledging the risk associated with high daily targets, local transport operators highlighted measures put in place to curb road carnage during the crossover into the New Year.\n\u201cWe have a team which engages even the passengers on board because they spend more time with the drivers than us. We urge them to report to us whenever they feel like their lives are in danger and we take action,\u201d said transport operator, Dr Afra Nhanhanga.",
