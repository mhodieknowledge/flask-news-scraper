Public Servants are reminded that their core mandate is to serve the people of Zimbabwe faithfully, diligently, and without interruption,\u201d the statement read.\nHighlighting the crucial role of the Public Service in the delivery of essential services and the realisation of Vision 2030, the PSC emphasised that any participation in the planned stay-away would be considered a dereliction of duty and an act of insubordination.\n\u201cSuch actions are unpatriotic, undermine national unity, damage the economy, and hinder the collective progress of the nation,\u201d the Commission stated.\nThe PSC clarified that both 22 and 23 April are normal working days.",

            "content": "Story by Anashe Murombedzi\nAFRICA is home to numerous icons who have excelled in various fields. Among them was Zimbabwe\u2019s late national hero, Dr Joshua Malinga, a relentless advocate for the recognition and inclusion of people with disabilities in the nation\u2019s development.\nDr Malinga did not only champion the rights of persons with disabilities but also fought for their full participation in the fruits of independence\u2014laying a foundation for a more inclusive Zimbabwe.\nWith a life marked by both hardship and triumph, Dr Malinga\u2019s unwavering determination and passion for justice inspired generations of Zimbabweans and echoed across borders.\nBorn on 20 April 1944, in rural Filabusi, Matabeleland South Province, his life changed dramatically at the age of two when he contracted polio, resulting in a permanent physical disability.\nYet, rather than allow this to define or limit him, he used it as a platform to drive advocacy for the rights of the disabled.\nAs a young man, Dr Malinga attended school and learned a craft as a cobbler at Jairos Jiri Centre in Bulawayo.\nThis foundation would serve him well in his future endeavours, as he became a vocal advocate for the rights and interests of people with disabilities in Zimbabwe and beyond.\nDr Malinga\u2019s entry into politics was sparked by the injustices and oppression faced by black people under the colonial regime.\nHe joined the nationalist movement, becoming an activist for the liberation struggle, and after independence he rose through the ranks of ZANU PF to become a Central Committee and Politburo member.\nThroughout his illustrious career, Dr Malinga was a champion of disability rights, becoming the founding member of the National Council of Disabled Persons of Zimbabwe (NCDPZ) in 1975 and serving as the World President of Disabled Peoples\u2019 International (DPI).\nHe played a pivotal role in shaping government policies and programmes that addressed the needs and challenges of people with disabilities, and his legacy continues to inspire and empower individuals with disabilities to this day.\nHaving served as the chairperson of the National Disability Board, Dr Malinga also worked tirelessly during the constitution making process by mobilising disability organisations which went around the country collecting views from the disability constituency and other stakeholders.\nThe views from the disability sector led to a constitutional provision for the reservation of two senatorial positions for people with disabilities.\nHis efforts did not go unnoticed after President Emmerson Mnangagwa appointed him Advisor on Disability Issues in the Office of the President and Cabinet.",

            "content": "Story by Kenias Chivuzhe\nPLANS are underway for the establishment of the country\u2019s first Institute of Civil Protection and Disaster Management as a resilience measure against climate-induced disasters.\nThe establishment of the Institute of Civil Protection and Disaster Management is described as a milestone development in the country\u2019s quest to promote excellence in civil protection and emergency management in the face of recurrent disasters affecting the country and the region.\nManicaland State University of Applied Sciences Vice Chancellor Professor Albert Chahwanda whose institution signed an MOU with the city of Mutare spoke on the scope and timeframes in implementing the new initiative.\n\u201cThis MOU is between the state university and the city of Mutare to establish an institute of civil protection and disaster management. This is the first of its kind in Zimbabwe and in the Southern Africa region. The training will benefit all councils, private companies, timber companies and fuel companies among others.\n\u201cThe training will be conducted in partnership with the Belarus Civil Protection and Disaster Management University. In the short term, we are going to start with a certificate in disaster and firefighting engineering. It will take us about 10 years to establish the institute as the first five years will see the personnel being sent to Belarus for training,\u201d Professor Chahwanda said.\nMutare City town Clerk Mr Blessing Chafesuka spoke on the focus of the new initiative.\n\u201cWe are looking forward to training firefighters who are able to do sea diving and who are able to respond to any type of disaster. We hope this will be a solution for the whole country. The government recently procured firefighting equipment and distributed it to all local authorities. There is now a gap in terms of personnel hence this partnership. As a city for the next 10 years, we are ok in terms of equipment. The challenge has been a mass exodus of personnel overseas and the training of more personnel will create a big buffer,\u201d Mr Chafesuka said.\nGovernment believe the establishment of the civil protection institute in the country was long overdue due to a number of disasters affecting the country.\n\u201cThe signing of a memorandum of understanding will give birth to the Institute of Civil Protection. The development resonates with the Second Republic\u2019s thrust to strengthen disaster preparedness and improve community-based recovery mechanisms. Manicaland has been greatly affected by cyclones that include Eline and Idai and these experiences taught us valuable lessons therefore we are heartened by this initiative and we will give you our maximum support. Last year we had a serious fire incident which we could not control in Nyanga,\u201d the Director in the Office of Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution- Manicaland, Mr Munyaradzi Rubaya said",
