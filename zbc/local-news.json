            "content": "Story Tafara Chikumira, Midlands Bureau Chief\nTHE Government continues to improve learning conditions for students by constructing classroom blocks and availing Information Communication Technology (ICT) gadgets across the country.\nSelukwe High School in the Midlands province was the place to be this Thursday as the government commissioned a classroom block and distributed ICT gadgets, some of which were made available by development partners.\n\u201cWe are very excited as parents at Selukwe High. The Block has been on the cards for quite some time now and its completion is a huge relief to us. Children were overcrowded in a situation that was making the learning process a toll order. Now we can safely say our children can learn in a friendly environment,\u201d SDA chair for Selukwe Chrome High School, Mrs Eunice Kokai.\nThe Second Republic\u2019s engagement and reengagement efforts are also bearing fruit with World Vision donating one thousand 100 tablets, while Unki Mine donated 22 digital learning instruments for schools in the province to enhance interactive learning and access to digital educational content.\n\u201cMy school is one of the schools in remote areas. Heritage-based learning requires ICT gadgets. The gadgets we have here will help even in the pass rate of the school as our children can now compete with their peers in urban areas. We have indeed managed to achieve some positive development with the help of our government,\u201d Totonga Primary School Head Mr Tauya Gova.\n\u201cAs students, we were failing to realize our full potential. Some of us might be good at ICTs but fail to get the necessary exposure. The ICT gadgets will go a long way in identifying future ICT gurus.\u201d\nThe government is excited by the progress which is in line with the Second Republic\u2019s vision 2030.\n\u201cBy investing in education and infrastructure, we are not only addressing current needs but also laying the groundwork for future generations.\n\u201cThis vision underscores the commitment to inclusivity, ensuring that marginalized and disadvantaged communities are given the support they need to participate fully in society. Through initiatives like the STEP-UP programme, we are actively working to bridge gaps in access and quality, empowering every child to reach their full potential,\u201d the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Honourable Torerai Moyo.",

The chasing away of enterprise resource package in 2019 at the recommendation of management has resulted in the City Council not managing to produce audited accounts.\n\u201cERP is the only tool the auditor general and management can verify accounts hence management conspired to get rid of ERP,\u201d Mayor Mafume said.\u201cThe books of accounts are done manually, which means documentation can be changed and very difficult to chase.\u201d\nCouncillor Mafume admitted financial mismanagement within the city council\u2019s operations is contributing to a marked decline in service delivery across the capital.",

Massive corruption has exposed city fathers and the reasonable thing is to throw in the towel as they have failed to deliver on their mandate.\u201d",
