I highlighted that we have not done as much as we want in our leather sector. We will be working with rural communities to create a system where leather will be produced. Bata is on its recovery path,\u201d Minister of Industry and Commerce, Honourable Mangaliso Ndlovu said.\n\u201cWe are trying to make sure we expand the domestic market, and we are expanding to export to other countries, including Zambia. Government departments have been directed to make local purchases, which will also help expand the leather industry,\u201d he added.\nIt also came to light that the country is keeping abreast with current trends and technological advancements after introducing automated border control systems at various ports of entry to increase security and reduce smuggling cases.\n\u201cWe have done a lot in deploying technology at airport and border technology. We have tried to computerise all our systems and the online border management systems, and we now have e-gates without the help of any officer. We have deployed this at Victoria Falls and Beitbridge. Now e-visas are available, and we have started embarking on this journey,\u201d the Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, Honourable Kazembe Kazembe said.",

            "content": "Story by Lisa Masuku\nA family in Bulawayo is living in fear as it is reportedly being plagued by inexplicable fires that erupt spontaneously, destroying property and leaving them in financial ruin.\nJournalist Methuseli Moyo and his family have been experiencing these mysterious fires since late February, with the blazes breaking out without warning and wreaking havoc in their home.\n\u201cThese fires started towards the end of February. They ignite from nowhere, and this has been happening for some time now. We no longer feel safe here,\u201d said Moyo.\nThe inexplicable infernos have already consumed most of the family\u2019s possessions, including US$20 000 in cash, money they had just received from selling one of their properties.\n\u201cThe fires intensified on March 1, and now it has become a daily struggle to put them out. If you look at our walls and furniture, they are in a terrible state,\u201d he added.\nMoyo\u2019s wife, Ntombizodwa Mhlanga, recounted the devastating moment when the family lost their money in one of the sudden blazes.\n\u201cWe had planned to move out, but as soon as we collected the money and placed it in the wardrobe, the section where the cash was stored mysteriously caught fire. Within seconds, it was gone,\u201d she said.\nIt is even more difficult for Moyo\u2019s wife, Ntombizodwa Mhlanga, who has had to watch her husband sustain severe burns from the strange fires.\n\u201cThe fires have not only destroyed our property. My husband has sustained serious burns. The funny thing is that when the fire attacks him, it\u2019s invisible. He will be screaming that he is on fire, but we won\u2019t be seeing anything,\u201d Ntombizodwa Mhlanga said.\nThe heart-wrenching mystery fires experienced by the Moyo family have left the community in shock and grief.\n\u201cWhat is happening to the Moyo family is very sad. The family has suffered, and they no longer feel safe in their own house,\u201d Community member, Skha Dlodlo said.",
