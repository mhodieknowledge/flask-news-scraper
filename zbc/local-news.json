            "content": "Story by Peter Chivhima\nPIRATE taxis continue to wreak havoc and endanger lives on the country\u2019s roads, despite repeated warnings and enforcement offensives by law enforcement agents.\nTheir reckless conduct is not only causing chaos and traffic jams but also putting innocent lives at risk each day.\nFrom speeding to dangerous overtaking and blatant disregard for traffic signals, these Mushikashika operators have turned the country\u2019s roads into death traps.\n\u201cThis is not good, I think the police must work together with commuter omnibus operators so that there is order in town. Look at what is happening here, they are loading and offloading passengers in the middle of the road.\u00a0This is bad,\u201d a commuter, Mr Barnabas Mapisa said.\n\u201cWe are no longer comfortable coming and doing business here because of mushikashika,\u201d another commuter, Vimbai Maredza added.\nZBC News revisited several well-known hotspots in Harare this Monday, where it seems the situation is getting worse when compared to the past years, as commuter omnibus crews continue to flout road rules.\nPublic outrage is even louder than ever, and their cry is for guaranteed safety.\n\u201cWe are no longer safe to travel in town because these kombie crews behave as if they are the owners of the road. It is so sad. The police should do something,\u201d a Harare resident, Ms Kundai Kuyeri noted.\n\u201cI think the police must also arrest both the owners of the commuter omnibuses for flouting road regulations, and by doing that, this will deter them from giving bad drivers their vehicles,\u201d Harare resident Mr Thomas Kachiti said.\nAnother Harare Resident, Mr Morgan Chakaipa, said, Harare is no longer safe with these mushikashika operators because they do not even care for our safety.",

We angle to fix the road infrastructure as well as do the necessary plumbing for the facility to be usable,\u201d the institution\u2019s acting vice chancellor, Professor Grace Mugumbate, said.\nThe government is equally impressed by the progress at the facility, which feeds into the National Development Strategy One.",

As young women, we can be self-reliant, and we can be able to pass on to the next person and all be empowered. We witnessed these projects being done in other provinces, and today, we are happy to be given goats to start a goat project. I am going to grow this project and earn a living from it,\u201d one of the beneficiaries said.\nThe ongoing programme seeks to promote the empowerment of the girl child and, at the same time, fulfilling the rural industrialisation drive.",

We run conjointly with Mbare Musika as farmers come here after selling their produce by agriculture equipment which major companies sell but are expensive, you can get them for half the price as we work on targets if we are given an order we make sure that we deliver as early as possible,\u201d one of the Artisans said.\nAnother Artisan noted that Siyaso is an industrial Hub that makes everything, and this has resulted in many innovations and products being made.\n\u201cAs the men and women here are skilled. Everyone here is capable of making something, and even our children who have finished school are coming here to learn how to make something of the products, and this also ensures continuity in the event of our demise,\u201d the artisan noted.\n\u201cAs a woman, this place has changed my life financially, and I have also managed to create employment as my business records significant growth. The just-ended tobacco selling season brought brisk business as farmers came to retool and we sold most of the equipment they need in their fields to them,\u201d another Artisan added.\nChairperson of the Mukuvisi Manufacturing Cooperative, which houses Siyaso traders, Mr Simeon Nikisi, applauded the Government for creating an enabling environment that has seen the site being recognised as an economic driver.",

On Saturday, ZBC News observed contractors on-site erecting the barriers as part of efforts to restore order and protect the integrity of the newly commissioned road network.\nMotorists and transport operators welcomed the intervention, citing visible improvements in traffic discipline and safety at the busy junction.\n\u201cThis is a step in the right direction meant to curb reckless driving here. It was too much, and we were now experiencing traffic jams because of these drivers, so we are happy that the government is putting these barriers,\u201d a motorist, Tawanda Muza, said.\n\u201cI want to thank our President, Cde Emmerson Mnangagwa, for transforming our nation. So installing these jersey barriers will go a long way in bringing order to this place,\u201d Luckson Tachi said.\n\u201cIt was now all chaos here because commuter omnibus crews are doing what they want, so doing this will reduce cases of accidents and bring normalcy,\u201d another motorist added.\nTransport operators themselves also endorsed stricter enforcement, calling for accountability and greater discipline within their ranks.\n\u201cAs operators, we are saying anyone who commits an offence or damages public infrastructure must be arrested without fear or favour. We also urge all operators to become organised and adhere to the law,\u201d Mr Edmore Gwengwe said.",
