            "content": "\nA judge has ordered that US President elect, Donald Trump, will be sentenced on January 10 in his hush-money case in New York, less than two weeks before he is set to be sworn in as president.\nNew York Justice Juan Merchan signalled he would not sentence Trump to jail time, probation or a fine, but instead give him an \u201cunconditional discharge\u201d, and wrote in his order that the president-elect could appear in person or virtually for the hearing.\nThe president-elect has posted on social media dismissing the judge\u2019s order as an \u201cillegitimate political attack\u201d and calling the case \u201cnothing but a rigged charade.\u201d\nTrump was convicted in May of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 (\u00a3105,000) payment to adult-film star Stormy Daniels.\nThe charges related to attempts to cover up reimbursements to his ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, who in the final days of the 2016 election campaign paid off the adult-film star to remain silent about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.\nThe president-elect has denied all wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty, arguing the case was an attempt to harm his 2024 presidential campaign.\nIn the post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday Trump said the judge\u2019s sentencing order \u201cgoes against our Constitution and, if allowed to stand, would be the end of the Presidency as we know it\u201d.\nTrump\u2019s spokesperson Steven Cheung earlier called the order part of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d.\n\u201cPresident Trump must be allowed to continue the presidential transition process and to execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this or any remnants of the witch hunts,\u201d Cheung said.\n\u201cThere should be no sentencing, and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead.\u201d\nIn his latest motion against the case, Trump had argued the case would hang over him during his presidency and impede his ability to govern.\nJustice Merchan said he had been advised of several measures he could employ that could assuage Trump\u2019s concerns about being distracted by a criminal case while serving as president that fell short of the \u201cextreme remedy\u201d of overturning the jury\u2019s verdict.\nHis options included delaying the sentencing until Trump, 78, leaves the White House in 2029, or guaranteeing a sentence that would not involve prison time.\nTrump had initially, and unsuccessfully, argued the case against him ran afoul of a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.",
