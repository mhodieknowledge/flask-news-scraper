            "content": "Story by Tichaona Kurewa\nTHE Government has underscored the centrality of sustainable wetlands management in achieving Vision 2030, noting the need for a holistic approach to protecting the ecosystem.\nThis came out during the 2025 National Wetlands Day commemorations held in Hwange District this Thursday.\nThis year\u2019s commemorations also come at a time when the City of Victoria Falls has been designated a Wetland City by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.\nDefence Minister, Honourable Oppah Muchinguri Kashiri, who was representing President Emmerson Mnangagwa at the Wetlands Day celebrations in Kasibo Village, indicated the centrality of sustainable wetlands management in achieving Vision 2030.\n\u201cThrough the involvement of the youths, we can foster a new generation of environmental stewards committed to preserving this critical ecosystem and creating the future we all want.\u201d\nZimbabwe is committed to meeting all its obligations under the Wetlands Convention.\n\u201cZimbabwe is one of the 173 member states to the Treaty on Wetlands, having ratified the treaty in 2014. We are fully committed to meeting its obligations of ensuring sustainable wetlands management through preserving their regenerative capacities and maintaining their pristine state. As such, conservation and wise use of wetlands is a vital pillar of our National Development Strategy,\u201d Honourable Muchinguri Kashiri said.\nThe Ramsar Convention commended Zimbabwe for preserving marshlands as witnessed at Kasibo Wetland under Chief Hwange.\n\u201cI am impressed with what I saw, it shows the country\u2019s commitment to the preservation of wetlands. In most cases when there is a drought like what we witnessed last year, normally wetlands dry, but here, the wetland has not dried up. I would love the world to come and see for themselves what I saw,\u201d the Secretary General for the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Dr Musonda Mumba said.\nThe importance of wetlands in people\u2019s livelihoods was also brought to the fore.\n\u201cWetlands are a source of livelihood as people can get water for Irrigation and other uses. From wetlands people also get fish and other plants hence communities need to preserve wetlands. Since 1990, the world has lost 64 percent of wetlands and deliberate effort must be made to preserve the remaining wetlands and work towards reviving those that dried up,\u201d \u00a0the Minister of Environment, Climate and Wildlife, Honourable Sithembiso Nyoni said.\n\u201cWe are deeply committed to the preservation of wetlands as traditional chiefs. We are custodians of the wetlands and it is our responsibility to teach our communities the importance of wetlands,\u201d Chief\u2019s Council president, Chief Mtshane Khumalo added.",

            "content": "Story by Providence Maraneli\nRURAL schools in Matabeleland South province have benefited from the government\u2019s school feeding programme, which has reduced dropouts, and absenteeism and bolstered the fight against stunting in once marginalised communities.\nThe clock strikes 1324 hrs at Ntalale High School in Gwanda South of Matabeleland South province and a young student, Forget Nyathi is anxiously waiting for something that has become a crucial part of the day at the school.\nAs each minute goes by, the concentration levels drop.\nWith his eyes fixated to the digital clock on the wall, this boy\u2019s face suddenly changes with a ball of nerves filled with excitement listening to the school bell.\nHe quickly gets up and joins a long queue that is already forming just outside his classroom.\nIn no time, his peers are eating what is on the day\u2019s menu and each gulp matters to him as parents are still recovering from the last drought.This is the mandatory school feeding programme that has been introduced by the government to counter the effects of drought in schools.\n\u201cI am so happy that we eat at school, and I want to come every day,\u201d he says.\u201cI walk from Mawaza and if I don\u2019t eat at school I get home tired and hungry but thanks to the government we eat here. Some learners would want to take medication at school now they can because we eat here.\u201d\nBeyond the nourishment, the school feeding programme has recorded major inroads in curbing absenteeism and school dropouts with many schools in the province recording an average of 96 percent attendance.\n\u201cAbsenteeism is now a thing of the past, everyone now is coming and confident because they would have eaten,\u201d Gwanda Junior councilor Ruth Mpofu says.\n\u201cThe attendance has tremendously improved compared to the preschool feeding programme, we are assured that we teach all our concepts from Monday to Friday, with everyone in attendance,\u201d Zhampale Primary School Head, Mr Vusumuzi Makheto said.\nThe mandatory school programme has uplifted the burdens on the shoulders of parents who were battling last year\u2019s ravaging elnino-induced drought.\u201cSome children travel long distances and you would be assured that children can walk because there is food at school, we are so grateful to the government,\u201d said one parent.\nThe programme has also aided in the fight against anemia in young girls.\n\u201cThe feeding programme is playing a major role in the fight against anemia especially in adolescent girls of school going age, this is a condition that is usually caused by poor diet and with it girls might fail to concentrate at school. So there is a relationship between nutrition and academic performance,\u201d Matabeleland South Provincial Education Director, Mrs Beatrice Manjere noted.\nGovernment introduced the mandatory school feeding programme to improve the nutrition and welfare of children.",
