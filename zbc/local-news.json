This year alone, we planted 10 000 trees in January, and we added another 800 last week, and today we are doing 1 000,\u201d said Freda Rebecca Mine managing director, Mr Patrick Shayawabaya.\nThe local leadership has hailed the initiative as critical in promoting sustainable woodland management practices.",

We are being supported to start agricultural projects. The inclusive development thrust by President Emmerson Mnangagwa is transforming our lives,\u201d a community member said.\n\u201cThe empowerment drive has capacitated us not to over-rely on men for survival. The empowerment programmes are improving our worth in society. We also want to thank the Women\u2019s Bank for giving us money to start businesses. The support has transformed my life,\u201d another added.\nDevelopment partners reflected on the strides made in the promotion of gender equality and women empowerment in Zimbabwe.\n\u201cZimbabwe has shown promising progress in advancing women\u2019s equality. We will continue to support gender equality in our collaborative efforts. We want to guarantee access to technology and support the fight to end all forms of violence against women. Let us commit ourselves to promote gender equality and empowerment,\u201d United Nations Resident Coordinator His Excellency Edward Kallon said.\n\u201cThrough the Team Europe initiative on gender equality, we are supporting this cause with over \u20ac280 million from 2021 to 2027. We also recently committed an additional \u20ac7 million to further strengthen these efforts.\n\u201cAdditionally, the European Investment Bank and STANBIC Bank have launched a \u20ac20 million gender facility to provide loans to women-owned businesses. This is because we believe that by investing in women, we are investing in Zimbabwe\u2019s future,\u201d Swedish Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Per Lindgarde stated.\nThe government says while empowerment initiatives are bearing fruit, priority should also be on fighting vices such as discrimination, child sexual exploitation and gender-based violence.\n\u201cAs Manicaland province, we are enjoying investments aiming to uplift the lives of women. Jopa Safe Market, Hauna Processing Plant, Cynara Diary and Chikanga mushroom project are some of the flagship investments brought to the province to uplift women. We are proud that impactful change is noticeable among these and many women in Manicaland.",
