            "content": "Story by Fairstars Mukungurutse\nUrban farmers in Harare are optimistic of recording a good harvest following the heavy rains currently being received across the country.\nSlowly evolving into a vibrant urban agriculture ecosystem, nearly every household in Harare has its own small plot or back yard garden where a variety of crops are grown for consumption and profit.\nWhile most crops had suffered severe moisture stress following a prolonged dry spell characterized by high temperatures, the rainfall currently being received across the country has brought some relief to farmers as most crops have been rejuvenated.\u201cWe are happy the rains are back, we had lost hope of getting something because the heat wave was too much. Now we are expecting a bumper harvest,\u201d said a farmer who spoke to the ZBC News.",

At the moment, we are seized with the issue of establishing biogas plants at our prisons to ensure that our prisoners get clean energy in their cooking activities.\u201d",

            "content": "Story by Tamuka Charakupa\nGovernment has distributed over 700 mobile digital gadgets to agriculture extension officers from across Mashonaland West Province this Friday, cementing the centrality of digitisation to all economic activities.\nThe move is expected to enhance data collection, storage and communication systems.\n\u201cOur daily duties involve data collection and processing so the coming on board of mobile gadgets will enhance our operations,\u201d said an Agritex officer.\u201cManual data entry is tiresome and is associated with many risks especially now during the rainy season. Sometimes papers get lost, burnt or get soaked with rain so this is a welcome development,\u201d said another Agritex officer.\n\u201cWe needed to communicate in real time with our colleagues and supervisors so that we will be able to advise farmers accordingly. We are delighted that this programme is leaving no one and no place behind,\u201d another added.\nThe Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Honourable Vangelis Haritatos presided over the ceremony where he spelt out the advantages of using the gadgets.\u201cOver 6 thousand gadgets are set to be distributed countrywide. So far we have distributed to other province except for the Midlands Province. As government we remain committed towards transforming the agricultural sector and we believe the capacitation of extension workers will go a long way in ensuring that farmers benefit from timely, well researched information informed by enhanced communication channels between the ministry and its ground forces,\u201d said Minister Haritatos.",

This is good for our projects\u201d another farmer added.\n\u201cWe got a lot of water even for Irrigation with our dam now full. We have no doubt that we are going to have a good harvest,\u201d noted another farmer.",

The more we have means that justice will be delivered timeously,\u201d said Mrs Guwuriro.\nShe also indicated that the introduction of Fast Track Courts will reduce witness fatigue.\n\u201cFast track courts that will be introduced at all court houses are going to be a game-changer because cases won\u2019t take long to be heard. If all the parties are there, the cases will be heard instantly and this will reduce backlogs,\u201d she said.",
