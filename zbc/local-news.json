As young women, we can be self-reliant, and we can be able to pass on to the next person and all be empowered. We witnessed these projects being done in other provinces, and today, we are happy to be given goats to start a goat project. I am going to grow this project and earn a living from it,\u201d one of the beneficiaries said.\nThe ongoing programme seeks to promote the empowerment of the girl child and, at the same time, fulfilling the rural industrialisation drive.",

We run conjointly with Mbare Musika as farmers come here after selling their produce by agriculture equipment which major companies sell but are expensive, you can get them for half the price as we work on targets if we are given an order we make sure that we deliver as early as possible,\u201d one of the Artisans said.\nAnother Artisan noted that Siyaso is an industrial Hub that makes everything, and this has resulted in many innovations and products being made.\n\u201cAs the men and women here are skilled. Everyone here is capable of making something, and even our children who have finished school are coming here to learn how to make something of the products, and this also ensures continuity in the event of our demise,\u201d the artisan noted.\n\u201cAs a woman, this place has changed my life financially, and I have also managed to create employment as my business records significant growth. The just-ended tobacco selling season brought brisk business as farmers came to retool and we sold most of the equipment they need in their fields to them,\u201d another Artisan added.\nChairperson of the Mukuvisi Manufacturing Cooperative, which houses Siyaso traders, Mr Simeon Nikisi, applauded the Government for creating an enabling environment that has seen the site being recognised as an economic driver.",

On Saturday, ZBC News observed contractors on-site erecting the barriers as part of efforts to restore order and protect the integrity of the newly commissioned road network.\nMotorists and transport operators welcomed the intervention, citing visible improvements in traffic discipline and safety at the busy junction.\n\u201cThis is a step in the right direction meant to curb reckless driving here. It was too much, and we were now experiencing traffic jams because of these drivers, so we are happy that the government is putting these barriers,\u201d a motorist, Tawanda Muza, said.\n\u201cI want to thank our President, Cde Emmerson Mnangagwa, for transforming our nation. So installing these jersey barriers will go a long way in bringing order to this place,\u201d Luckson Tachi said.\n\u201cIt was now all chaos here because commuter omnibus crews are doing what they want, so doing this will reduce cases of accidents and bring normalcy,\u201d another motorist added.\nTransport operators themselves also endorsed stricter enforcement, calling for accountability and greater discipline within their ranks.\n\u201cAs operators, we are saying anyone who commits an offence or damages public infrastructure must be arrested without fear or favour. We also urge all operators to become organised and adhere to the law,\u201d Mr Edmore Gwengwe said.",

This transformative project is a reflection of the dreams and dedication of its architect, His Lordship, the Right Reverend Bishop Sekuru Rudolf Nyandoro,\u201d he said.\nHe recalled that the vision for the centre was first publicly shared during Bishop Nyandoro\u2019s Silver Jubilee celebrations in Gweru last year, a vision that has now become a reality.\nThe highlight of the event was the ordination of six priests, each of whom had completed several years of theological and pastoral formation. The newly ordained include:\nReverend Kudzai Mabhena (Kwekwe)\nReverend Gerald Dube (Mberengwa)\nReverend Brian Kanyai (Gweru)\nReverend Reynold Machirori (Kwekwe)\nReverend Carlos Masiya (Kwekwe)\nReverend Calvin Mbenene\nOffering words of encouragement, Vice President Chiwenga described the priesthood as a noble and sacrificial vocation.\n\u201cTo our newly ordained priests, I extend my warmest and most heartfelt congratulations. You have embraced a calling that demands sacrifice, faith, and unwavering devotion. It is not an easy path, but it is one of eternal purpose and profound impact. May your hands bring healing to the broken, your words offer hope to the lost, and your hearts remain open to the will of God. You are now stewards of the sacred, walk boldly, humbly, and faithfully in that holy charge,\u201d he said.\nBishop Raymond Mupandasekwa, who leads the Masvingo Diocese, also addressed the congregation, urging the new priests to carry out their duties with integrity and compassion.",
