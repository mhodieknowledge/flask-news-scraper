            "content": "Story by Owen Mandovha\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe\u2019s (RBZ) willing buyer willing seller exchange rate system is bearing fruit, with the central bank leaving the market to determine the exchange rate.\nIn a statement released this Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) clarified that it has no control over the referral exchange rate being used by economic agents, saying the rate is derived from the interbank market through the willing buyer willing seller system announced in the 2024 Monetary Policy Statement.\nAnalysts have weighed on the subject given that over the past six months, the exchange rate has remained relatively stable, and premiums have been gradually declining, pointing towards convergence between the interbank and parallel foreign exchange rates.\n\u201cThe interbank market has been used to determine the exchange rate by the central bank and what it means is that holders of foreign currency can set the price of foreign currency they have to the buyer using banks. There is no fixed exchange rate that is being done by the RBZ. It is essentially the market forces of supply and demand that is determining this rate,\u201d economist, Mr Malone Gwadu said.",
