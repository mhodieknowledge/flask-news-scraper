The arrangement between Harare City Council, Helcrow and Laison will cover water purification, the construction of a treatment plant as well as the provision of smart metering. This falls in line with our vision to improve service delivery in Harare,\u201d said the Minister of Local Government and Public Works Honourable Daniel Garwe\nThe new arrangement is expected to reduce Harare\u2019s water purification bill running into several millions of dollars annually.\nHarare Mayor Councillor Jacob Mafume said, \u201cThe net effect is that all the money that we were using to purify water will be directed for other service use. What we anticipate is that when we reduce the loss of non-revenue water and reduce leakages, we increase our revenue collection, it will reduce the cost per head, and generally it will make it a bit more efficient than what we were having. We hope that we will get more water for the money we have been using.\u201d\nImplementing partners, Helcrow Private Limited and Laison Technology Company, are confident the deal will enhance the provision of reliable and portable water services for the capital city.",
