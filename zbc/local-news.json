For NRZ, we are supporting it to source a credit from outside to fix the railway line, get more rolling stock and to fix the signaling system. So we are close to concluding a deal for an external credit line. l think we will see some progress during 2025 so that we can get some of the heavy trucks off the roads. We need to shift all that cargo to the railway infrastructure and this can be done commercially and profitably so that we can be able to service the loan.\u201d",

After that, we are also going to develop a primary school here. We are indeed grateful to the government for releasing the devolution funds in time,\u201d Mvuma Rural District Council chief executive officer, Mr Lovemore Chatikobo said.\nThe community is equally excited by the new facility which confirms the Second Republic\u2019s inclusive development is in motion.\n\u201cOur young children used to travel long distances. So with this facility is going to be helpful. We did not expect this from our President. What he did, we hope this will be taken to some other areas, around here. At least it shows that our government has a good vision, and also recognises young learners from this area,\u201d said one local resident.\n\u201cThe construction of this block has helped a lot here. The reason being that the learners used to travel long distances. We thank our government for addressing this issue. In fact, there was no school at all around this place. I want to commend our government for the sterling efforts in mobilising locally available resources towards construction of the ECD centre,\u201d added another.\nThe government has promised to continue with its developmental trajectory in line with Vision 2030.\n\u201cI applaud the new dispensation under the able and visionary leadership of President Emmerson Mnangagwa of the Republic of Zimbabwe for implementing rural development 8,0 vision 2030 accelerator model in an endeavour to modernise and industrialise marginalised areas underpinned by the development approach of leaving no one and no place behind,\u201d Midlands Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Honourable Owen Ncube said.\n\u201cThe Second Republic through the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, local authorities and private sector, is providing modern infrastructure to ensure all learners both in rural and urban schools are empowered to excel in their studies.",
