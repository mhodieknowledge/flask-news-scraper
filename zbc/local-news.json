            "content": "Story by Peter Chivhima\nTHE urgent need for a traffic circle at the Dzivarasekwa Turn-Off, a known high-accident zone along Bulawayo Road, was highlighted on Monday as various Christian denominations gathered at the site.\nThe gathering took place at the location where eight people tragically lost their lives, and eleven others sustained serious injuries following a collision involving a commuter omnibus, a haulage truck, and a UD truck last week.\nThe collective initiative sought to raise awareness and explore measures to reduce accidents at the site, which has become notorious for frequent road fatalities.\nThe Chairperson of the Zimbabwe Council of Churches Dzivarasekwa Ecumenical Fellowship and Resident Pastor of The Salvation Army Dzivarasekwa Citadel, Major Joseph Nyamuzihwa, has urged the government to construct a traffic circle at the high-accident zone\n\u201cOur gathering here is so important but the most critical thing is that the government can assist us by construction of a traffic circle. I think this will go a long way in reducing accidents here. Last year, we lost a member of our church as a result of an accident which occurred here,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is a need for the government to consider the construction of a traffic circle and put warning signs here so that issues of accidents are minimised,\u201d Reverend Munyaradzi Mukorombindo, of the Methodist Church in Zimbabwe said.\n\u201cOur gathering here as churches is to seek divine intervention from God. We are convinced that our prayers will be heard,\u201d Mrs Laina Kurebwaseka of the Methodist Church in Zimbabwe said.\nCommunity members noted the need for enforcement of road rules, as the driver involved in the latest fatal accident did not possess a driver\u2019s licence.",

            "content": "Story \u00a0by Tichaona Kurewa\nTHE desiltation\u00a0of Chidobe Dam in Hwange\u00a0District is making a tangible difference, with the reservoir now providing a lifeline for the community and other surrounding areas.\nFor years, Chidobe Dam suffered from severe siltation, drastically reducing its capacity, and leaving local communities vulnerable to acute water shortages, particularly during the dry season.\nHowever, a collaborative effort spearheaded by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) under its Climate Adaptation and Protected Areas Initiative, in partnership with local authorities, the community, and other development partners, has revitalised the reservoir.\nThis offers a crucial lifeline to the community and in the attainment of national and international development targets such as Vision 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\u201cWe are grateful for the partners that come to our rescue, water has been a challenge in this community but now we can do various horticulture projects, that can earn us money to survive,\u201d a community member said.\n\u201cIt is a blessing to us youths, we can now do various projects such as horticulture taking us away from vices such as drug abuse and prostitution,\u201d another community member said.\nProject partners, traditional leaders, and local authorities are equally optimistic about the project\u2019s\u00a0transformative impact.\n\u201cWe thank WWF and its partners for assisting our community in rehabilitating our dam and our springs, it took us years trying to rehabilitate the source but we faced many challenges in the process, the rehabilitation will alleviate water challenges, especially for our livestock, we can now venture into fisheries and other income generating projects that will uplift our community livelihoods,\u201d Acting Chief Mvuthu, Mr Bishop Mathatha Sibanda said.\n\u201cBefore we struggled, our livestock suffered, and we had to travel long distances for water. Now, with the dam full, our animals are healthy, and we have water for our gardens. This is a blessing,\u201d Hwange RDC Ward 2, Councillor Bonginkosi Moyo said.\n\u201cFellow residents this is your project that WWF and other partners are bringing to our community, let us protect and preserve our dam and our natural resource, as the Hwange Rural district council and the traditional leadership we pledge to allocate land that will be used for income generating projects like gardens, beekeeping, and others that will assist the community to raise capital to assist in paying school fees for less privileged children of our community and also keep our youths busy and keep away from drug and substance abuse,\u201d CEO of Hwange RDC, Mr Pindile Ncube said.\n\u201cWe have largely been working in protected areas but as time moved we also realised that communities are an integral part of conservation. You can\u2019t do conservation without considering communities,\u201d WWF Country Director, Mr Itayi Chibaya said.\n\u201cAs you are aware, over recent years, rainfall has declined by 40%, and our dams are being filled with silt while also drying up. But these dams also bring a number of challenges because communities rely on them for their livelihoods.",
