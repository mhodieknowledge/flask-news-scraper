            "content": "Story by Memory Chamisa\nPottery has saved a 25-year-old Chitungwiza man, as the craft represents a dividing line in his life between drug abuse and finding purpose.\nWhile some of his peers still abuse drugs and other substances, Gift Zirende, popularly known as MaCenturion has turned a new leaf and is optimistic about what the future holds for him.\nHaving hanged around the wrong crowd which contributed to him using drugs, MaCenturion received his Damascus moment when he met a well-wisher who took him in and rehabilitated him through pottery.\nFrom just passing time, the craft has now become a part of his identity and purpose.\n\u201cI was a troubled young man and was always in trouble as I associated with the wrong crowd which contributed to a lot of wrong decisions I made in my life. It also affected my life to the extent that I was thrown out of our family home by parents. I became homeless and was taken in by a well-wisher who then taught me pottery,\u201d he said.",
