            "content": "Story by Tamuka Charakupa\nTHE Zimbabwe Gender Commission is celebrating a decade of championing gender equality and justice, with the institution confirming to have resolved over 4 000 gender-related cases over the years.\nThe Mashonaland West Gender Forum hosted in Chinhoyi this Tuesday brought to the spotlight the need for increased gender balance amid concerns of men suffering in silence.\n\u201cAs traditional leaders, we have witnessed firsthand the positive impact of the Zimbabwe Gender Commission, particularly in addressing gender-based violence in our communities. Their interventions have brought justice and healing to many, especially women and girls who for long suffered in silence. I also want to highlight the growing concern around men who are quietly enduring abuse and feel ashamed to speak out due to societal expectations. Gender-based violence affects everyone, and we must increase awareness and support systems for male victims as well,\u201d traditional leader, Chief Nemakonde said.\n\u201cThe Zimbabwe Gender Commission is helping expose historical injustices against the girl child, such as child marriages and denial of education. Through advocacy and policy influence, the Commission is promoting equal opportunities in education, leadership, and economic participation, breaking long-standing cycles of marginalisation and ensuring a fairer future for girls,\u201d Institute for Young Women Development official, Mr Kudakwashe Munemo said.\nGovernment says to date, at least over 4000 gender-related cases have been resolved, influencing key initiatives such as the establishment of a dedicated call centre and decentralisation of offices as explained by Zimbabwe Gender Commission chairperson, Dr Nyepudzai Nyangulu.\n\u201cWhile we celebrate institutional achievements, it is also important that we reflect on successes made in the gender sector as a collective over the past decade. Among the key milestones are pivotal legislative reforms which include the Amendment of the Marriages Act (2022) which raised the legal marriage age to 18, ending child marriages and recognised unregistered customary marriages, protecting women from exploitation. Data Protection Act (2021) which strengthens protection of women and children from online violence. Education Amendment Act of 2020, ensuring that girls are not excluded from education due to pregnancy or motherhood and the recently launched National Gender Policy, meant to give effect to constitutional provisions.\u201d",

            "content": "Story by Fairstars Mukungurutse\nGOVERNMENT in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has launched the Gender Equality Seal for public institutions aimed at integrating gender equality standards across various organisations.\nPositioning Zimbabwe as one of the gender equality champion countries within the Southern African region, UNDP\u2019s flagship programme; the Gender Equality Seal for Public Institutions was officially launched this Monday with the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) becoming the first institution in the country to undertake the certification programme.\n\u201cIt is a comprehensive and holistic approach that takes public institutions into a learning journey of about 24 months, really working with these institutions to make sure that SDG 5, as well as other gender commitments that Zimbabwe is part of are also implemented through these institutions. Zimbabwe is one of the pioneer countries in the region when it comes to implementing the Gender Equality Seal. We\u2019ve got a number of countries in the region, but beyond the region this is something that is also being implemented across four regions that is Latin America, Asia and others,\n\u201cZimbabwe, is also joining a number of other countries that have been implementing this, like Uganda, Rwanda, and Ghana. So in the context of Zimbabwe, the focus is around helping the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, to really support them to systematically integrate gender into their processes, procedures, as well as policies, and to see how this align with their mandate of tax revenue. But most importantly, to apply the gender lens and make sure that within their mandate, gender is also integrated and upheld,\u201d UNDP Regional Service Centre for Africa gender team leader, Mrs Cleopatra Hurungo said.\nZIMRA acting commissioner general, Mrs Constance Shumbayawonda weighed in, \u201cWe will be training the trainers who will then go around ZIMRA to train our staff on gender equality in public institutions under fiscal services. We are also going to support the SMEs, UNDP is coming to bridge the gap of educating our small and medium enterprises, not all of them alone, but across the whole tax divide, because we know that without the taxpayers, we are not able to surpass our targets. So we actually have picked hundreds of similar staff that are going to go around the country to train all our staff, so that we\u2019ll be able to educate and reach out to our clients and provide the necessary expertise and reduce the cost of compliance, because We want them to concentrate on payment of tax and not any other costs that come with that.\u201d\nThe Minister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa, said the initiative aligns with the national strategy to advance gender equality in Zimbabwe.\n\u201cZIMRA\u2019s commitment to implement this initiative as one of the pioneer public institutions in Zimbabwe to implement the Gender Equality Seal framework is commendable and demonstrates strong leadership. This process will enable ZIMRA to enhance its operations and establish a national standard for gender-responsive public service. This also conveys a significant message, gender equality is not solely the responsibility of my Ministry, but rather a priority for the entire government and the whole Zimbabwean society,\n\u201cI therefore call upon all other government entities, including the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the Office of the Auditor General, and the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development, and Investment Promotion, to adopt the Gender Equality Seal programme, and we can see that ZIMRA is ready now to work with everybody, more so the SMEs.",
