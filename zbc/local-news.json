            "content": "Story by Fairstars Mukungurutse\nGOVERNMENT in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has launched the Gender Equality Seal for public institutions aimed at integrating gender equality standards across various organisations.\nPositioning Zimbabwe as one of the gender equality champion countries within the Southern African region, UNDP\u2019s flagship programme; the Gender Equality Seal for Public Institutions was officially launched this Monday with the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) becoming the first institution in the country to undertake the certification programme.\n\u201cIt is a comprehensive and holistic approach that takes public institutions into a learning journey of about 24 months, really working with these institutions to make sure that SDG 5, as well as other gender commitments that Zimbabwe is part of are also implemented through these institutions. Zimbabwe is one of the pioneer countries in the region when it comes to implementing the Gender Equality Seal. We\u2019ve got a number of countries in the region, but beyond the region this is something that is also being implemented across four regions that is Latin America, Asia and others,\n\u201cZimbabwe, is also joining a number of other countries that have been implementing this, like Uganda, Rwanda, and Ghana. So in the context of Zimbabwe, the focus is around helping the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, to really support them to systematically integrate gender into their processes, procedures, as well as policies, and to see how this align with their mandate of tax revenue. But most importantly, to apply the gender lens and make sure that within their mandate, gender is also integrated and upheld,\u201d UNDP Regional Service Centre for Africa gender team leader, Mrs Cleopatra Hurungo said.\nZIMRA acting commissioner general, Mrs Constance Shumbayawonda weighed in, \u201cWe will be training the trainers who will then go around ZIMRA to train our staff on gender equality in public institutions under fiscal services. We are also going to support the SMEs, UNDP is coming to bridge the gap of educating our small and medium enterprises, not all of them alone, but across the whole tax divide, because we know that without the taxpayers, we are not able to surpass our targets. So we actually have picked hundreds of similar staff that are going to go around the country to train all our staff, so that we\u2019ll be able to educate and reach out to our clients and provide the necessary expertise and reduce the cost of compliance, because We want them to concentrate on payment of tax and not any other costs that come with that.\u201d\nThe Minister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa, said the initiative aligns with the national strategy to advance gender equality in Zimbabwe.\n\u201cZIMRA\u2019s commitment to implement this initiative as one of the pioneer public institutions in Zimbabwe to implement the Gender Equality Seal framework is commendable and demonstrates strong leadership. This process will enable ZIMRA to enhance its operations and establish a national standard for gender-responsive public service. This also conveys a significant message, gender equality is not solely the responsibility of my Ministry, but rather a priority for the entire government and the whole Zimbabwean society,\n\u201cI therefore call upon all other government entities, including the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the Office of the Auditor General, and the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development, and Investment Promotion, to adopt the Gender Equality Seal programme, and we can see that ZIMRA is ready now to work with everybody, more so the SMEs.",

We also believe that this is the biblical message as well. We are also guided by marriage laws in our different cultures that do not allow same sex marriages and even when paying a bride price, they will not accept if it\u2019s for the same gender,\u201d Muyondo said.\nCongregants at the service welcomed the church\u2019s reaffirmed position, expressing relief that the leadership has publicly clarified its stance.",

            "content": "Story by Zanele Ndlovu\nIN a small workshop nestled in Thorngroove, Bulawayo, a team of passionate creatives is transforming clay into artwork which ranges from kitchenware to decorative vases and plates.\nEach piece is individually designed and handcrafted with passion and style to create a unique product. These artists do not just mould ceramics, they mould stories.\nInspired by Zimbabwe\u2019s rich wildlife and cultural heritage, much of their artwork prominently features bold depictions of the Big Five alongside traditional patterns drawn from Shona and Ndebele artistic motifs.\nAmong the team is a female painter, Marion Moyo, who stands confidently in a male-dominated space, proving that creativity knows no gender.\n\u201cWhen I arrived, I was told the company still existed. I had left my pieces at the art gallery and had come to collect my money. That\u2019s how I ended up here. I had studied at Mzilikazi and, though I had never drawn on ceramics before, only canvas, I passed the interview. I was the only woman among 33 men in the art production industry. But I never felt intimidated. I challenged myself to stand out. Art and pottery are my passion; they keep me going,\u201d she said.\nColin Mpofu, a highly experienced and decorated artist, says art is more than his profession, it\u2019s his identity.\n\u201cFirst of all, we are given concepts, and then I express them in a way that someone can easily understand, depending on the colours that are wanted. Sometimes they can make demands, like they want certain colours and variations, hence I sit down and get cracking on it. Each piece can take me about two weeks, and then I hand it over to glazing. This is my life.\n\u201cI am passionate about art. I joined ceramics in 1995, so that is about 29 years. I could say I have spent my whole life here. With this work, we can take our kids to school and support the family through this art. Apart from this, I do canvas art to supplement my income,\u201d he noted.",
