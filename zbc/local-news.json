            "content": "Story by Memory Chamisa\nTHE government has reaffirmed its commitment to the media sector transformation but warned players to always operate within the confines of the law.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the third anniversary of a local broadcasting media house in Harare this Friday, the Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Dr Jenfan Muswere said, that while media freedom is fully guaranteed in Zimbabwe, advocating for the overthrowing of a legitimate government is unconstitutional.\n\u201cThe government says the media has no room to fuel the overthrowing of a legitimate government. As the nation journeys towards Vision 2030, it is important to appreciate and understand the constitutional obligations particularly Section 61 and Section 62 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe,\u201d Dr Muswere said.\n\u201cSection 61 of the Constitution is clear in terms of the freedom of expression and the freedom of media and Section 62, also speaks to access to information. We should also be very clear in terms of the supreme law of the country, the right to broadcast the overthrowing of a legitimate and democratic government does not exist in our Constitution. The media freedom, the freedom of expression that we have should always be guarded jealously and we should always protect our journalists.\u201d\nMinister Muswere also said the Zimbabwe Media Commission and the Ministry will continue to work together with members of the fourth estate to give direction for the nation\u2019s development as witnessed by the opening up of airwaves.",

The wife accused Chiwaya of infidelity. Last week she had packed her bags with the intention of quitting the marriage and I helped them reconcile. Then I woke up to see missed calls from the husband, and when I tried to call back it was too late, a child was at my door knocking to tell me about this tragic event,\u201d she said.\nThe incident has left the neighbourhood shell-shocked.\n\u201cThis is painful, why do people kill each other when they have problems in marriage?\u201d a community member asked.\n\u201cIt is better to walk out of a toxic marriage than killing each other, I am pained by the loss,\u201d another community member said.",

            "content": "Story by Theophilus Chuma\nTHE Second Republic is tightening accountability and transparency within central government operations, with Deputy-Ministers, Deputy Secretaries and Public Service Commissioners set to sign performance contracts, with effect from this year.\nRe-affirming a programme targeted to strengthen the capacity of government and increase accountability, the Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Dr Martin Rushwaya engaged Deputy-Ministers, Deputy Secretaries and commissioners at an induction workshop convened in Kadoma this Thursday.\n\u201cAs Zimbabwe strives to achieve Vision 2030 and respond to the diverse needs of our citizens, performance contracting emerges as a strategic approach that aligns our efforts with the priorities of our government. It establishes clear expectations, measurable outcomes and a culture of accountability that is essential for effective public service,\u201d said Dr Rushwaya.\nThe focus of the engagement was to prepare the officials on performance contracts, a mandatory initiative that will now rate the performance of Deputy Ministers.\n\u201cAs you perform your daily duties, you are expected to drive implementation of the national vision. Your responsibilities are multi-faceted, and your success will be measured against the impact you will make in the lives of Zimbabweans.\n\u201cAccountability is the barometer for entrenching a market-facing and people-centred government as espoused by His Excellency the President. Performance contracts are not developed in isolation, they are directly linked to Zimbabwe\u2019s national blueprints, including Vision 2030,\u201d noted Dr Rushwaya.\nGovernment reckons performance contracting and service delivery are critical for enhanced public administration and governance.\n\u201cThrough performance contracting, you are now part of a framework where results of your work are not only seen but measured. What Gets Measured Gets Done,\u201d stated Dr Rushwaya.\nSince its launch by President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2021, performance contracting continues to post significant traction and is on a critical pedestal in driving accountability.",
