Now we are expecting a bumper harvest,\u201d said a farmer who spoke to the ZBC News.",

Sometimes papers get lost, burnt or get soaked with rain so this is a welcome development,\u201d said another Agritex officer.\n\u201cWe needed to communicate in real time with our colleagues and supervisors so that we will be able to advise farmers accordingly. We are delighted that this programme is leaving no one and no place behind,\u201d another added.\nThe Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Honourable Vangelis Haritatos presided over the ceremony where he spelt out the advantages of using the gadgets.\u201cOver 6 thousand gadgets are set to be distributed countrywide. So far we have distributed to other province except for the Midlands Province. As government we remain committed towards transforming the agricultural sector and we believe the capacitation of extension workers will go a long way in ensuring that farmers benefit from timely, well researched information informed by enhanced communication channels between the ministry and its ground forces,\u201d said Minister Haritatos.",
