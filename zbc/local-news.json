The main thrust of the courses was to mould junior and senior non-commissioned members to be efficient members in the discharge of their respective duties. The Air Force of Zimbabwe remains dedicated to the protection of the Zimbabwean air space and territorial integrity as well as its sovereignty.\u201d\nAmong the graduates was Earnmore Raurai, a surgeon from 1 Commando Regiment, who reflected on the demanding nature of the training.\n\u201cThe course was challenging and demanding, especially in terms of discipline and hygiene. But I have acquired skills that I am proud to pass on to others.\u201d\nMaster Surgeon Jacqueline Moyo, one of the women in the cohort, encouraged fellow female officers to embrace leadership roles within the forces.\n\u201cIt is important to put your heart into everything you do. As women, we must prove our capability and rise through the ranks. I hope fellow women will follow suit.\u201d",

The area, typically teeming with traders and customers, resembled a state of mourning when ZBC News visited the scene on Sunday.\nMany shop owners were too emotional to speak, overwhelmed by the scale of the destruction. Those who managed to voice their plight pleaded for intervention.\n\u201cIt is a great loss that we have suffered. We need assistance now because this is too much for us,\u201d a business owner said.\n\u201cThe fire has left us in a difficult place, where do we start from?

            "content": "Story by Fungai Jachi\nTHE government\u2019s intention to introduce a School Financing Policy has been welcomed by stakeholders who believe it will help to address challenges in the education sector.\nThis comes as the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education is conducting public consultations to allow stakeholders in the education sector to contribute towards the formulation of the policy.\nThe Schools Financing Policy is a legislative framework that aims to establish a more equitable and sustainable framework for financing education, ensuring resources are distributed fairly and minimising the impact of financial constraints on the quality of education.\nThe policy which is expected to be finalised this year will emphasise the crucial role of parents and communities in supporting education.\nStakeholders believe the policy should include how development partners as well as communities and businesses can assist to ensure basic education is not compromised.\nThe Chairperson of Zimbabwe Independent Colleges Association, Dr Tapera Chikandiwa said, parents should support the government in ensuring that every child has access to education by 2030.\n\u201cYes it is a government responsibility to finance education but with the 16.9 million people that we have, the government cannot finance each child.\u201d\n\u201cWe know that we need to engage every child in line with our mantra no child left behind no school left behind. So our marginalised communities must be addressed and be funded and benefit from these consultations,\u201d the University of Zimbabwe lecturer, \u00a0Dr Vongai Chakanyuka added.\nThe School Development Committees\u2019 national representative, Mr Tarirai Samambwa said the introduction of the Heritage-based curriculum coupled with this introduction of the financing policy is working together to improve the education sector.\n\u2018If there are viable ways of financing education, then every child will have the same opportunity to learn,\u201d he said.",
