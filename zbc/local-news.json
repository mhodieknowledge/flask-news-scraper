University Ttransportation, donation of vehicles to support the university\u2019s transportation needs, including nine SUVs, two double-cab vehicles for senior personnel, one single-cab truck, two UDI lorries, two buses with 65-passenger capacity each, five tractors, enhanced Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), successful rehabilitation of the campus water supply and sewer systems, with ongoing improvements to ensure sustainability,\u201d Solusi University Vice Chancellor, Professor Khumbulani Mpofu said.Seventh Day Adventist Church General Conference Director for Education, Dr Lisa Hardy said Bridging Gap Foundation Founder Mr Tagwirei is the first black person to scoop the award owing to his immense contribution to education in Zimbabwe, Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe.\u201cThrough his Bridging Gap Foundation, Tagwirei\u2019s outreach extends well beyond the university. His dedicated capacity-building and welfare programmes are making a significant impact across the region\u2019s primary and secondary schools.\u201cUnder the Centers of Influence Department, numerous beneficiary institutions, including Bindura University, among others, are receiving enhanced support designed to uplift educational standards and foster community growth,\u201d she said.In his acceptance speech, Dr Tagwirei said education is a centre of influence hence it must transform nations through the implementation of tangible projects.\u201cWhen we dedicate ourselves to the Lord\u2019s work, we do not do it for accolades or recognition, we do it out of obedience, love, and a deep sense of mission. Yet, standing here today, I feel profoundly humbled that the work we do has been noticed and appreciated at such a high level.\u00a0 For me, Solusi University has been more than just an institution, it is a pillar of Adventist education, a beacon of excellence, and a center of influence. This is why we have invested over US$7 million in capacity building at the Solusi farm not merely as a financial contribution but as a deliberate and strategic effort to ensure that our beloved university has long-term sustainability, self-sufficiency, and a future of excellence. Our institutions must not only survive, they must thrive, and that requires leadership, vision, and commitment,\u201d he said.Besides investing in education, Dr. Tagwirei has contributed to the country\u2019s health sector through Arundel Hospital in Harare, which provides free medical services with more than half a million people having been assisted so far. Over US$3,5 \u00a0million has been channeled to six church conferences.\nStory by Yolanda Moyo\nDR Kudakwashe Tagwirei, the Chief Executive Officer of SAKUNDA Holdings, made history this weekend at Solusi University by becoming the first black individual to be honoured with the Global Award of Excellence by the General Conference of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church.\nThe Global Award of Excellency is a prestigious accolade in the Seventh Day Adventist Church awarded to an individual who has made a global impact in education worldwide.\nDr Tagwirei became the first black person to receive such an award owing to the work being done by his foundation, bridging the gap which has transformed 63 schools across Zimbabwe through availing tractors, farming implements and infrastructure development.\nAt Solusi University, projects worth at least US$7 million have been implemented and are at different stages of completion.\n\u201cInstallation of a comprehensive turnkey irrigation system at Mananda Farm, including electrical and pump plants, conveyance systems, infield setups, fencing, and telemetry control systems.\u00a0 Over nine kilometers of pipeline were installed for five of six center pivots, covering 127 hectares, alongside 5 850 meters of perimeter fencing.\n\u201cEnhanced water access through the drilling of six boreholes (three operational) and the fabrication of a pontoon at Mananda Dam.

This year alone, we planted 10 000 trees in January, and we added another 800 last week, and today we are doing 1 000,\u201d said Freda Rebecca Mine managing director, Mr Patrick Shayawabaya.\nThe local leadership has hailed the initiative as critical in promoting sustainable woodland management practices.",
