We are grateful to the Mother of the Nation for giving us this learning platform,\u201d a prisoner said.\n\u201cWe will apply this knowledge when we leave this place because we now know how they can help us. We know about traditional foods that our forefathers used to eat and we are now taking this knowledge and applying it in our lives,\u201d another added.\nGovernment says taking Amai Mnangagwa\u2019s cooking competition to prisons is a positive step towards rehabilitating inmates and preparing them for reintegration into society.\n\u201cThe competition shows how Amai is committed to making sure that inmates are remembered and integrated into society.\u00a0 This demonstrates the mantra of leaving no one and no place behind.\u00a0 We believe that after this competition, inmates will gain culinary skills that will help them in their lives after incarceration,\u201d Midlands Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Honourable Owen Ncube said.",

As of today, with their addition, we now have 253 magistrates who can sit in our courts and preside over cases.\u201d\nThe chief magistrate also cautioned the newly-recruited magistrates against engaging in corrupt practices.",
