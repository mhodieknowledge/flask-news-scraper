Initial grading and detour works have been completed, and we are now in the major construction phase. The initial focus is on the first 10-kilometre segment,\u201d Provincial Roads Engineer, Mangisi Nkomo said.\nOnce completed, the road is expected to significantly reduce travel time between Gwanda and surrounding districts, particularly Matobo, improving access to services and opening up new economic opportunities in mining, agriculture, and tourism.\n\u201cWe are thankful to the government for choosing our province to host the Independence celebrations. This road is the heartbeat of Matabeleland South. With its completion, we are reducing travel distances by over 150 kilometres to some areas, which is transformative for business and service delivery,\u201d the Minister of State for Matabeleland South Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Honourable Albert Nguluvhe said.",

At the hospital, several tests were done, but nothing was found. We have been struggling to take her from point A to B, as we had to push her in a wheelbarrow.\n\u201cShe is a devout Christian who doesn\u2019t want to miss church, and this wheelchair will help her a lot.
