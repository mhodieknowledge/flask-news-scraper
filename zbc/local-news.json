            "content": "Story by Tamuka Charakupa\nTHE Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) says it is strengthening mechanisms to combat wildlife crime.\nThis comes as 53 rangers graduated at a pass-out parade at Chinhoyi Caves in Mashonaland West province this Saturday.\nThe graduating group comprises 29 female rangers under the Akashinga and Peace Parks Foundation (PPF) initiative and 24 male counterparts from Zimparks.\nThe new recruits completed a rigorous three-month paramilitary training programme that covered foot and arms drills, advanced weapons handling, bushcraft, and law enforcement, among other disciplines.\n\u201cI am so delighted to have undergone this training. It has not only sharpened my skills, but also deepened my understanding of the critical importance of wildlife conservation,\u201d one graduate said.\n\u201cThis was a tough challenge that required full dedication and courage. I am grateful for the opportunity, especially as a woman making strides in a traditionally male-dominated field,\u201d another noted.\nSpeaking at the pass-out event, Zimparks Mid-Zambezi Senior Regional Manager, Mr Felix Chimeramombe, said the initiative is the result of a tripartite agreement between ZIMPARKS, the Peace Parks Foundation, and Akashinga.\n\u201cThese rangers represent a broad national outlook. The recruitment process involved meticulous consultation with local stakeholders and aligns with the Government of Zimbabwe\u2019s devolution agenda which aims to transform communities, districts, and provinces into economic hubs, thereby contributing to the country\u2019s goal of attaining upper-middle-income status by 2030,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Story by Tafara Chikumira\nGWERU \u2013 The Midlands Hotel in Gweru was gutted by fire which destroyed property and reduced a room to ashes Friday evening.\nThe fire has left a trail of destruction at the facility, although no injuries or fatalities were recorded.\nPreliminary investigations by the fire fighting department point to an electrical fault as the cause of the fire.\n\u201cWhen we got an SOS about the fire around 7pm we managed to rush to the scene. We had to use our ladders to climb to the first floor since the doors to the stairs were locked. We had to break the ceiling to contain the fire since it was already spreading.  All the goods including the beds and the clothing for the tenants were burnt by the fire. We however managed to contain it before it had spread further.  Our investigations so far point to a water heating kettle which we suspect to have been left on and led to the fire outbreak,\u201d said Gweru City Council chief fire officer, Mr Felix Muguti.\nTenants who spoke ZBC News praised the timely intervention of the fire brigade team.",

            "content": "Story by Josephine Mugiyo, Diplomatic Correspondent\nHARARE \u2013 President Emmerson Mnangagwa says the renaming of Tomlinson Depot to Chimoio Camp marks yet another milestone and a step towards dismantling the remaining colonial legacies.\nHe was speaking at the commissioning of new housing units for the Zimbabwe Republic Police in Harare this Friday, which coincided with the renaming of the key institution.\nThe renaming is a move from the colonial names that had been given to key institutions across the country.\nThe Second Republic is on a drive to replace colonial names at key institutions with those that speak to the country\u2019s history and identity.\n\u201cColonialism saw the naming of places and institution being used as a means of dispossession, both physically and psychologically, for asserting dominion over our land and us its rightful owners. As such, following the advent of the Second Republic, my administration took a deliberate decision to accelerate the name changes of numerous strategic national institutions, buildings and streets across the country. This bold move is designed for the memorialisation and recognition of our rich liberation history, as well as the prominent figures who helped to shape it,\u201d he said.\nRenaming Tomlinson Depot to Chimoio is an honour to those who perished at the Chimoio Massacre 1977.\n\u201cThe renaming of this depot to Chimoio Camp marks yet another milestone and step towards dismantling the remaining colonial \u2018legacies. The sacrifices made by our gallant sons and daughters, including at Chimoio Camp, should inspire our officers to conduct their duties diligently. Through such deliberate initiatives, we are giving our country a truly Zimbabwean identity and memorialising the significance of Chimoio Camp in Mozambique, among other places, and incidents that connect us permanently to the liberation struggle. In doing so, we are paying special tribute to our brothers and sisters in the Frontline States, both departed and living,\u201d he explained.\nPresident Mnangagwa also commissioned four new blocks of flats comprising of 96 units.\nHe emphasised the need for government to provide decent accommodation.\n\u201cThe need for housing remains a priority for the government and the country\u2019s uniformed forces are not being left behind.The importance of decent accommodation for any employee cannot be overemphasised. To this end, the commissioning of four blocks of residential flats is part of my government efforts towards ensuring better working and safe conditions for our public officers. Our public servants require safe and good places to stay with their families for them to be effective in the delivery of quality services,\u201d noted the President.",

We are seeing a real shift. I engage them on health-seeking behaviour and the importance of early diagnosis. It is gratifying to witness this transformation,\u201d Gogo Mpofu said.\nLocal men expressed how the programme has changed their attitudes and encouraged them to seek medical attention.\n\u201cWe have learnt the importance of early testing and treatment. I went to the hospital after one of these meetings, and my condition was addressed,\u201d an elderly man said.\n\u201cMen here are now more health-conscious, and we are thankful for this intervention,\u201d one of the men said.",
