            "content": "Story by Tapiwa Machemedze\nA total of 17 health institutions in Mount Darwin have received resources from Senator Dr James Makamba\u2019s health facilities initiative, aimed at complementing government efforts.\nOn Saturday, seven clinics in the area became the latest beneficiaries of donations from Senator Makamba, which included consumables and cash worth nearly US$20 000.\nThe initiative, launched on the first of January this year, aims to support 28 health institutions in the senatorial constituency. Stakeholders, including traditional leaders, government officials, war veterans, and ruling party members, commended the efforts, emphasising the importance of community contributions to development.\n\u201cI encourage us to unite and join hands with our President in this program being done by our Senator. He is doing a good programme and this job is going on well. What is being done encourages unity of purpose, self-reliance is what is required. For example, if a roofing sheet is damaged on our roof, let us repair it while we wait for government interventions,\u201d Mount Darwin War Veterans Chairman, Cde Andrew Chikukwa said.\n\u201cI am very happy we have been visited by our Senator, we feel very happy we have development in the area. We have our ruling party which raised us so I am happy that we are developing,\u201d Chief Madziwa added.\n\u201cThis programme being carried out by our senator is very good for the district. He is helping our clinics and the community so that areas get what they need. He is leaving money and consumables which is supporting the government\u2019s mandate. He is reminding people that a country is built by its people,\u201d Mt Darwin District Development Coordinator Mr White Nkoma weighed in.",

As the nation journeys towards Vision 2030, it is important to appreciate and understand the constitutional obligations particularly Section 61 and Section 62 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe,\u201d Dr Muswere said.\n\u201cSection 61 of the Constitution is clear in terms of the freedom of expression and the freedom of media and Section 62, also speaks to access to information. We should also be very clear in terms of the supreme law of the country, the right to broadcast the overthrowing of a legitimate and democratic government does not exist in our Constitution. The media freedom, the freedom of expression that we have should always be guarded jealously and we should always protect our journalists.\u201d\nMinister Muswere also said the Zimbabwe Media Commission and the Ministry will continue to work together with members of the fourth estate to give direction for the nation\u2019s development as witnessed by the opening up of airwaves.",
