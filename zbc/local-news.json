We used money from revenue collection and devolution funds.\u201d\n\u201cWe as Plumtree Council are in full support of Vision 2030, where we are saying education for all by 2030. Our wish is to have a lot of schools here in Plumtree by 2030 so that we don\u2019t have children who may fail to get a place in schools. We want all children to access education. We are open to investors in education so that we transform our area,\u201d Plumtree Town Councillor Maxwell Washaya said.\nThe project, which gobbled US$198 000, joins a long list of new schools constructed in Matabeleland South, including Poli-Magama in Matobo, Jonsley Primary in Gwanda and Pezulu Primary School teachers quarters in Insiza, as the government commits to the provision of quality education to its citizenry.\n\u201cThe coming in of Mathendele decongest schools in this town, the ministry remains committed to fulfilling the potential of learners in the education sector, provision of better access and quality education to every pupil and this remains very key. By investing in schools, the government is investing in future leaders who will drive Zimbabwe to a prosperous economy,\u201d Matabeleland Provincial Education Director Mrs Beatrice Manjere said.",
