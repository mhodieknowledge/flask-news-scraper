            "content": "Story by Yolanda Moyo\nA vibrant horticultural project is blossoming at Ntabazinduna in Umguza district, where women and youths have become active players in the country\u2019s economic development.\nVillagers in Ntabanzinduna, many of whom previously relied on subsistence farming, are cultivating a diverse range of crops which have become a source of economic empowerment.\nThe project is being implemented by government in collaboration with Gender Links and was launched two years ago and provides crucial support to the farmers in the form of technical expertise and market linkages.\n\u201cBefore the project, our lives revolved around struggling to grow enough food for our families. Now, we are able to not only feed ourselves but also generate income. This has empowered us women, giving us financial independence and a sense of self-worth,\u201d a villager who spoke to the ZBC News said.Another stated, \u201cWith this project, as women we are seeing a change in the gender-based violence because of the self-independence we have gained here. In most cases financial constraints perpetuate GBV, but having an income as a woman reduces this.\u201d\nLooking ahead, Thuthukani Luthi B project is set to shift towards piloting high-value crops specifically for the export market.",

            "content": "Story by John Nhandara\nHarare City Council is operating at below capacity in the production of water for the capital owing to a number of challenges at its sewage and water treatment plants.\nResidents are receiving 300 megalitres of water per day, against a demand of about 1 000 megalitres as the city council is currently operating below capacity.This emerged during an appreciation tour of Morton Jaffrey Water Works and Firle Sewage Treatment works by a technical committee formed to address the on-going water supply crisis in the city.\nHarare City Council Acting Town Clerk, Engineer Phakamile Mabhena Moyo told the ZBC News, \u201cFor Harare we are currently treating water at our Morton Jaffrey Water Works and we not operating at full capacity. We have an installed capacity of 614 mega litres but we are only producing 300 megalitres. This is as a result of high cost of treating water from Lake Chivero which is heavily polluted. Some of our chlorifiers are also not working and need repairs.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the city council\u2019s sewage treatment facilities that include Firle Sewage Treatment plant in Harare have been severely impacted by inadequate processing capabilities as a result of archaic equipment, leading to significant reductions in water production.\u201cOur sewage treatment works are not operating at full capacity. Ordinarily, our production capacity is at 176 megalitres per day against our capacity of 234. We are producing 72 megalitres,\u201d said Director Water, Engineer Tapiwa Kunyadini.",

One of our neighbours then rushed inside the gate screaming that the roof was on fire. I quickly dashed in the house and switched off the electric socket. The fire was coming from my tenant\u2019s room so I unlocked the door, that\u2019s when the flame spread across the house. I only came out holding my phone, national ID and my NSSA card. We managed to get hold of the Fire Brigade, but when they finally came, everything was destroyed, they only managed to contain the fire. We literally have nothing left,\u201d said Gogo Maliselo.\n\nThe incident has also left the neighbourhood devastated.\n\u201cWe only thank God for preserving lives, but the incident has left us baffled. After the electricity was disconnected and the guys from ZESA pronounced the yard safe, fire started again inside the cottage and we all rushed inside to remove property, the fire brigade also came back and managed to contain the cottage fire,\u201d said a neighbour, Mrs Agnes Muringai.",

We can now look into the future with hope because our incomes are now more secure. We utilise the water all year round and this allows us to diversify our produce. That way, we can sell different products.\u201d\n\u201cWe are grateful to this programme that has revived the wetland. We can safely say that we are now resilient to the effects of climate change as we no longer depend on rains for production,\u201d another farmer added.\nEnvironmental protection and resilience is one of the priority areas under the Second Republic, with government implementing the Zimbabwe National Wetlands Policy and Wetlands Management Guidelines of 2022.\nThe Environmental Management Agency reveals that over 300 000 hectares of wetlands have been rehabilitated so far.\nThe restoration of wetlands has emerged as a critical resilience tool for communities, important for poverty reduction and livelihood security in the face of climate change.",
