            "content": "Story by Theophilus Chuma\nTHE Second Republic is tightening accountability and transparency within central government operations, with Deputy-Ministers, Deputy Secretaries and Public Service Commissioners set to sign performance contracts, with effect from this year.\nRe-affirming a programme targeted to strengthen the capacity of government and increase accountability, the Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Dr Martin Rushwaya engaged Deputy-Ministers, Deputy Secretaries and commissioners at an induction workshop convened in Kadoma this Thursday.\n\u201cAs Zimbabwe strives to achieve Vision 2030 and respond to the diverse needs of our citizens, performance contracting emerges as a strategic approach that aligns our efforts with the priorities of our government. It establishes clear expectations, measurable outcomes and a culture of accountability that is essential for effective public service,\u201d said Dr Rushwaya.\nThe focus of the engagement was to prepare the officials on performance contracts, a mandatory initiative that will now rate the performance of Deputy Ministers.\n\u201cAs you perform your daily duties, you are expected to drive implementation of the national vision. Your responsibilities are multi-faceted, and your success will be measured against the impact you will make in the lives of Zimbabweans.\n\u201cAccountability is the barometer for entrenching a market-facing and people-centred government as espoused by His Excellency the President. Performance contracts are not developed in isolation, they are directly linked to Zimbabwe\u2019s national blueprints, including Vision 2030,\u201d noted Dr Rushwaya.\nGovernment reckons performance contracting and service delivery are critical for enhanced public administration and governance.\n\u201cThrough performance contracting, you are now part of a framework where results of your work are not only seen but measured. What Gets Measured Gets Done,\u201d stated Dr Rushwaya.\nSince its launch by President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2021, performance contracting continues to post significant traction and is on a critical pedestal in driving accountability.",

            "content": "Story by Peter Chivhima\nDISCIPLINE among members of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) has been identified as a vital component in the country\u2019s defence and security apparatus.\nThe two Infantry Brigade has a new command after Brigadier General Million Ndlovu took over from Brigadier General Charles Mashava at a colourful handover and takeover ceremony held in Harare this Wednesday.\nHanding over the command and Brigade formation colours, Brigadier General Mashava implored his successor to carry forward the Brigade\u2019s legacy of excellence and commitment to service, while Brigadier General Ndlovu pledged loyalty to the nation.\n\u201cIn that regard, I want to urge my successor to take note of those projects that remain outstanding and embrace them so that the dream reaches fruition. That leaves me to thank Commander ZNA for giving me the opportunity to lead this great formation and for me to preside over this important parade. Your wise counsel and guidance has always given us the impetus and energy to carry or also embark on the new journey and mandate,\u201d said Infantry Brigade Outgoing Commander, Brigadier General Mashava.\n\u201cAs I take over Command from, my former DS / teacher, Brigadier General Charles Mashava who taught me a lot during his days at the Staff College, I would like to thank the outgoing Commander for his selfless service to the two Infantry Brigades. I will endeavour to build from where he left and I will always knock on his door for advice and wisdom, he will no longer be my DS but will be my consultant,\u201d said Infantry Brigade Incoming Commander, Brigadier General Ndlovu.\n\u201cMy clarion call to service to all the officers and men of 2 Infantry Brigade is to continue to give the same support that you were rendering to the outgoing commander. I want us to work as a team together to fulfil our obligation as a brigade,\u201d\nCommander Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) Lieutenant General Anselem Sanyatwe challenged the incoming Commander to consolidate the Brigade\u2019s achievements and mission of safeguarding national security.\n\u201cThe people of Zimbabwe have high hopes and expectations for the future and as the Zimbabwe National Army, we should ensure that the conducive and tranquil environment prevails so that all government developmental programmes, citizenry of this nation and its visitors alike enjoy a sense of belonging and security in this beautiful motherland. We should all therefore understand the government\u2019s vision for development in its entirety to contribute meaningfully to improving the lives and security of our people in this regard, the modernization of the ZNA\u2019s capabilities is one of my priorities despite the prevailing economic challenges. We shall therefore continue to engage government through the ministry of defence to ensure that ZNA gets the requisite equipment to ensure that it remains a formidable force, operationally ready and capable of responding rapidly to any eventuality,\u201d said Commander ZNA, Lieutenant General Anselm Sanyatwe.\nBrigadier General Mashava has been appointed ZNA Director General of Civil Military Relations at the ZDF Headquarters.\nMeanwhile, in a separate ceremony, Commander Air Force of Zimbabwe Air Marshal Jacob John Nzvede presided over the promotion and investiture of Air Commodore Ekironi Madzanira who has been elevated from the rank of Group Captain to Air Commodore upon his retirement.",
