We are now able to travel without fear of any inconvenience such as floods,\u201d Lupane East legislator, Honourable Siphathisiwe Machangu said.\nThe story of the Somgolo Bridge began many years ago.\n\u201cThe bridge was started in 2005.

The responsibility to protect and serve Zimbabwe does not end with a change in leadership or a change in command.\u00a0 Accordingly, I implore you to carry the torch forward and I have no doubt that the next chapter,\u00a0 which now begins with the incoming of my brother, Lieutenant General Emmanuel Matatu, will be filled with even greater accomplishments, continue to raise our flag, national flag, very high to even greater heights,\u201d Lieutenant General (Retired) Sanyatwe said.\n\u201cMy leadership will be guided by the values that we all share, and these are loyalty, dedication to duty and respect. In everything that we do, let us be guided by our mandate, as prescribed in the Constitution of Zimbabwe,\u00a0Section 212, and the provisions in the Defence Act Chapter 1102,\u201d Lieutenant General Matatu stated.\n\u201cAs we embark on this new chapter together, I want you all to know that communication channels, to me, will always be open.\u00a0I will encourage you to share your thoughts, ideas and concerns using formal channels. Let us avoid using unofficial channels in other media, as this often mislead us.\u201d\nChief witnessing officer and Commander Zimbabwe Defence Forces General Phillip Valerio Sibanda highlighted the importance of interactions between the ZDF and communities.\n\u201cI therefore call upon you, the incoming commander of the Zimbabwe National Army, to pay particular attention to principal leadership that is responsive to the dictates of the current operating environment and to be highly vigilant and professional. I implore you to provide quality leadership to the communities that you will be interacting with during your tenure of office. I refer you to the critical role you play as the security focal point throughout our country,\u201d he said.",

So Parliament\u2019s role in ensuring that it carries out oversight on security is that it must ensure that the process of government is going smoothly, resources are allocated to ensure that security services are adequately sponsored and that government and its agencies act constitutionally within the parameters of the law so that everybody in the nation is secure. Parliament must also ensure that multi-party democracy policy as enshrined in the constitution is observed,\u201d he said.",

It symbolises the resilience and determination of the Zimbabwean people, including their resolve to win and defend their sovereignty by all means necessary.\n\u201cAs we celebrate 45 years of independence, we acknowledge our progress as a people and the challenges that remain.\u00a0 It embodies the promise that, despite the challenges we face, our commitment to uphold the ideals of our liberation will never waver. The Independence Flame, too represents the spirit of unity, hope, and determination that has fueled our journey as a nation,\u201d he said.\nThe lighting of the independence flame at the historical monument is significant as the Mtapa Hall hosted the ZANU congress of 1964 which came with a resolution for the commencement of an armed struggle against the white settler regime.\nThe Midlands provincial leadership welcomed the independence flame, while some government ministers who attended the occasion at Mtapa Hall in Gweru, weighed in saying the country\u2019s independence should be cherished as it came through a gruelling war where sons and daughters of the soil lost their lives.\n\u201cThis flame is a symbol of supreme sacrifice and resilience by the veterans of the liberation struggle. Let us cherish what the living and those who lost their lives sacrifices which brought what we enjoy to this very day,\u201d Minister of Veterans of the Liberation Struggle Affairs, Senator Monica Mavhunga said.\n\u201cThis occasion not only marks a significant moment in our national calendar, but also serves as a vibrant reminder of our shared history, resilience, and the enduring spirit of our people. Independence is not merely a date on our calendar, it is a living legacy that embodies our shared struggles, triumphs, and aspirations as a nation. It beckons us to reflect on our progress and to celebrate our achievements. Today, we reaffirm our commitment to uphold the values of unity, peace, and cultural heritage that bind us as a nation,\u201d Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Hon Kazembe Kazembe added.",
