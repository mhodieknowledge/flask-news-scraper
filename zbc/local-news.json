He was someone approachable and used to assist community members in times of need,\u201d said one of his subjects.\n\u201cHe used to encourage us to be part of programmes that empower us and our children, and he would always lead from the front,\u201d added another.\nChief Mourner, , Masvingo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Honourable Ezra Chadzamira described Chief Chivi as a distinguished war collaborator and a selfless leader, sentiments shared by the Chiefs Council and the ruling ZANU PF party.\n\u201cWe gather here today to celebrate and pay our last respects to the life of a selfless leader, the late Chief Chivi, Cde Tavagwisa Magura, a gallant and distinguished war collaborator and exemplary leader. Masvingo Province has been left poorer and with a void too hard to fill as Cde Tavagwisa Magura was an inspiration in our fight for independence, autonomy, economic emancipation and in defending our national sovereignty through unmatched commitment and dedication to harmony and national security,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAs Chiefs, we are saddened by the death of one of us, and he used to be part of all our programmes. He has always been one of our advisors given his age and experience,\u201d Senator Chief Chitanga who was representing the Chiefs Council said.\n\u201cAs a party, we salute Chief Chivi for his contribution to unity and development in his area. He would not miss our party meetings because he was a district leader before being a chief, and he used to support us a lot,\u201d added ZANU PF Masvingo Provincial Chairperson, Senator Robson Mavhenyengwa.\nThe Magura family expressed gratitude to the government for supporting them during their time of grief.\n\u201cWe appreciate the support we got from government, the ZANU PF party and the community at large. Here we lay to rest our unifier, our father, and our tower. Hence, we are saddened as a family,\u201d Mr Petros Magura said.",

            "content": "\nA judge has ordered that US President elect, Donald Trump, will be sentenced on January 10 in his hush-money case in New York, less than two weeks before he is set to be sworn in as president.\nNew York Justice Juan Merchan signalled he would not sentence Trump to jail time, probation or a fine, but instead give him an \u201cunconditional discharge\u201d, and wrote in his order that the president-elect could appear in person or virtually for the hearing.\nThe president-elect has posted on social media dismissing the judge\u2019s order as an \u201cillegitimate political attack\u201d and calling the case \u201cnothing but a rigged charade.\u201d\nTrump was convicted in May of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 (\u00a3105,000) payment to adult-film star Stormy Daniels.\nThe charges related to attempts to cover up reimbursements to his ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, who in the final days of the 2016 election campaign paid off the adult-film star to remain silent about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.\nThe president-elect has denied all wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty, arguing the case was an attempt to harm his 2024 presidential campaign.\nIn the post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday Trump said the judge\u2019s sentencing order \u201cgoes against our Constitution and, if allowed to stand, would be the end of the Presidency as we know it\u201d.\nTrump\u2019s spokesperson Steven Cheung earlier called the order part of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d.\n\u201cPresident Trump must be allowed to continue the presidential transition process and to execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this or any remnants of the witch hunts,\u201d Cheung said.\n\u201cThere should be no sentencing, and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead.\u201d\nIn his latest motion against the case, Trump had argued the case would hang over him during his presidency and impede his ability to govern.\nJustice Merchan said he had been advised of several measures he could employ that could assuage Trump\u2019s concerns about being distracted by a criminal case while serving as president that fell short of the \u201cextreme remedy\u201d of overturning the jury\u2019s verdict.\nHis options included delaying the sentencing until Trump, 78, leaves the White House in 2029, or guaranteeing a sentence that would not involve prison time.\nTrump had initially, and unsuccessfully, argued the case against him ran afoul of a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.",
