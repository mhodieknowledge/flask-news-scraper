            "content": "Story by Lisa Masuku-Kurira\nTHE Minister of Tourism and Hospitality Industry, Honourable Barbara Rwodzi, together with the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Bulawayo, Honourable Judith Ncube, visited injured crew members from the Rovos Rail train accident who are currently admitted at Mater Dei Hospital in Bulawayo and Gwanda Hospital.\nDuring the hospital visits, the ministers interacted with the accident victims, who were all reported to be in stable condition.\nMany of the tourists expressed deep appreciation for the warmth and care they received from Zimbabwe\u2019s medical professionals and citizens.\nOne of the accident survivors, Cherilo Fagan, a tourist from California, USA, remained in high spirits despite her unexpected detour to a hospital bed.\n\u201cYou guys are lovely, I must say. The love and warmth have been really amazing,\u201d Fagan said.\nWith her goal being of touring all the continents, the American national is eager to explore the country\u2019s magnificent falls,\n\u201cWe started off in Capetown. The goal was to get to Victoria Falls. Then things happened. I have a goal to visit all the continents. I grew up travelling, so I saved up my money to make sure I get to realise my dream of travelling all the continents,\u201d Fagan said.\nOf the 47 international tourists who were involved in a train accident, four of them were doctors, and these helped calm the situation before those who were injured were ferried to the hospital.\n\u201cAmong all of us, we discovered that there were four doctors on the train. This helped a lot. Above all, the Zimbabwean Police and medical experts acted swiftly. This is one of the main factors that contributed to ensuring there were no fatalities,\u201d another tourist, Peter Anderson said.\nHearing all the positive reviews from interacting with the train accident victims, the government said Zimbabwe\u2019s policy of being a friend to all and an enemy to none is bearing fruit.",

            "content": "Story by Theophilus Chuma, Investigative Editor\nA syndicate of recruiting agents is prowling on desperate job seekers, fleecing them of their hard-earned cash through non-existing job promises.\nThe adverts are printed in bold black and white, listing what appear to be attractive packages for job seekers that include accommodation and a starting salary of between US$200 and US$300 for a post as a security guard or shop merchandiser.\nAdverts are strategically placed across residential suburbs, waiting for the next catch on innocent victims who are made to pay an agent consultation fee of US$40 before they can be linked to the job.\n23-year-old Hazvinei Foroma (not her real name) is among many lured into this web of fake promises.\n\u201cI got the number of the agent from a WhatsApp group and contacted them over a job that was said to be in a supermarket. He asked for US$40 but I told him I had US$20, which I paid on the agreement I was going to pay the balance after I got my first salary,\u201d she said.\nBut there is no guarantee that after paying this fee, the job will be available.\n\u201cI was told to go and start work on a Monday, but when I got to the place, I was told a different story,\u201d another victim said.\nAfter hearing this story, the ZBC News placed a call to the agent.\nThe conversation with the agent seals the fears from a previous engagement with another recruiting agent.\nHe had demanded cash payment before he could provide details of the job.\nThe job adverts were not clear on the number of candidates needed for the vacancy, leaving the possibility of the agent collecting more money for a non-existing placement.",
