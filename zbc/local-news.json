We therefore appeal to road authorities for road surfacing works to continue,\u201d a resident stated.\nWork is also underway from the Murambinda side as the surfacing is being conducted from both sides of the 120-kilometre road stretch.\n\u201cMany people in Murambinda were employed following the commencement of this project. We thank the government for rehabilitating our road and we are looking forward for this section to be completed before August,\u201d a Buhera resident said.\nManicaland Provincial Construction Engineer Patrick Muropa spoke on the progress recorded so far.",

He would take everyone on board without segregation. The void he has left will be difficult to fill. We have just been robbed, and it took us by a huge surprise.\u201d\nThe construction industry has been left poorer as Mr Chikadaya was among those who are pushing the country\u2019s industrialisation agenda.\n\u201cI must say it is not only the Southern Region that has lost, but the whole country at large. Mr Chikadaya was instrumental in road construction currently being spearheaded by the Second Republic. In Gweru, he is in the top two of those in the construction industry in terms of capacity. He changed the lives of many,\u201d Businessman, Dr Josiya Tayi said.\n\u201cHe inspired me to return to the construction industry after I had stopped. He has contributed immensely to the country\u2019s development. One thing I liked about the way he was doing business was his ability to romp in his family. This will ensure continuity, so I am generally not worried about the company going forward.\u201d\nWorkers from his establishments added their voices saying although they have lost the head of the ship, they will work hard to ensure Mr Chikadaya\u2019s dream remains alive.\n\u201cHe was not only my boss, but rather a mentor. He taught me some serious life lessons that have changed my life in general. I am who I am today because of Mr Chikadaya,\u201d an employee said.\n\u201cTo me, Mr Chikadaya was more than my boss. He took me from the streets and offered me a life. He was more like a father figure to me,\u201d another said.",
