            "content": "\n\nStory by Fairstars Mukungurutse\nPLAY-time ended tragically for an 11-year-old boy from Adelaide Park in Harare this Sunday after he drowned in a water-filled open pit that had been left unattended.\nThe deceased, Tanaka Makosa, was in the company of his friend when he slipped inside the water-filled pit.\n\u201cI asked Tanaka to accompany me to Area 600. Upon our return, we passed through the water-filled pit and Tanaka said I want to test how deep the water is, that\u2019s when he slipped inside. He called my name once before his whole body was submerged in water. That\u2019s when I rushed to look for help,\u201d a young boy who was with Tanaka narrated the ordeal.\nHelp came, but it was already too late to save the young boy.\n\u201cWhen I heard a child had drowned, I quickly dashed to the spot, removed my clothes and went inside the water. My whole body was submerged in water because the pit was deep.\u00a0I then managed to locate the child and carried him out of the water, but I noticed that we had already lost him,\u201d a neighbour, Mr Japhet Chinganga said.\nHis mother, Mrs Mercy Taimo narrated her sad story.\n\u201cI spent the greater part of the day with Tanaka and his friend here at home. I didn\u2019t even notice the time they left home. I only became aware they were not home after my other son came running saying Tanaka had drowned. We then rushed to the spot and by the time we arrived, my child had been taken out of the water. We then drove to a nearby clinic, but unfortunately, it was too late.\u201d\nAdelaid Park residents have raised concern over the open pits dotted across the area.\n\u201cThis is not the only pit in this area, there are a lot of holes dug by the quarry mine and we don\u2019t even know why they are putting the lives of our children at risk,\u201d a resident said.\n\u201cWe have little children and how are we supposed to ensure our kids are safe? Kids being kids, they love to explore,\u201d voiced another.\n\u201cApart from these dangerous pits, our children are at risk of being run over by speeding trucks from the mine,\u201d another stated.",

            "content": "Story by Kenias Chivuzhe\nSnail production has become a lucrative enterprise, with a Mutare based farmer raising edible land snails for cosmetics and human consumption.\nHeliciculture, commonly known as snail farming, has not been widely practiced in the country, but Mutare-based Godfrey Gurupira is seeking to take the initiative to another level.\nGurupira, from Natiview, is now a knowledge repository of snail production and currently boosts of a collection of over 300 snails.\nAlthough the introduction of snail relish in global dishes is still low, Gurupira targets to reach 1 000 snails by the end of February, buoyed by the good rains and anticipated returns from cosmetic products developed from slime.\n\u201cI breed snails to make lotions, soaps and dyes. I started the project last October after being motivated by President Mnangagwa who encourages the youths to be productive. The snails can live up to 15 years. We can also make use of shells to produce buttons and necklaces among other products. In Nigeria and Kenya there are snail farmers. So far, I have 350 snails and I am targeting to increase the number of snails to 1 000 by end of February. Snails lay four or five eggs every four weeks. This is a profitable business but the biggest challenge is the demand for my products is growing yet I lack capacity to expand the venture in line with the increasing demand,\u201d said Mr Gurupira.\nWith snail slime primarily used for cosmetics, Gurupira believes with more support he can acquire a bigger place to operate from, thereby increasing production.\n\u201cSnails eats lettuces, cabbage, greens and bulgur. The snails passes out slime as an act of defense. Each snail produces three millimetres of slime per day. The slime is used to make lotions, soaps and dyes. Snails have a highly delicious meat more than chicken. We are eating the snails alone at the moment.",
