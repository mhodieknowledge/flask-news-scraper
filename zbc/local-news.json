Together, the GBVF Response Fund and Team EU aim to enhance prevention, protection, and support mechanisms for those affected by GBVF.\u201d\n\nA UNFPA representative also noted, \u201cThe UNFPA together with its agencies are committed to combatting GBV and fostering safer, more resilient communities. By working together, we strive to create lasting change and empower survivors while addressing the root causes of GBV.\u201d\n\nMinister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa acknowledged the support of development partners as instrumental in enabling the fund to offer crucial assistance to communities impacted by GBV.\n\n\u201cSustainable funding solutions are therefore critical, equipping these institutions with the necessary resources to provide high-quality support to survivors. The needs of those institutions range from stationery, food provisions, hospital equipment and supplies, operational costs, allowances and salaries for GBV specialized services (counselling and legal aid) dedicated staff to provide administrative and security duties as well as continuous training of staff. There is also need for income-generating projects at the safe shelters and infrastructure maintenance and development where new institutions need to be set up. We cannot sit on our laps but rather dream big to consider even setting up more institutions to cover all provinces and districts of the country considering that the available institutions are not able to meet the growing demand while at the same time, they have to be within reach of those in need,\u201d she said.\n"

Despite the interventions by veterinarians from the University of Zimbabwe and our Vet department, the contamination has also impacted other wildlife in the area resulting in the loss of three zebras, four wildebeests, four fish eagles, as well as goats and cattle from nearby farms. To mitigate the risk, we implemented measures to deter the animals from drinking from the affected dam by placing salt blocks and game nuts around the park, as well as distributing water drops. Regrettably, these efforts proved to not be enough, as the animals continued to drink from the lake,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Farawo called for collective responsibility to protect and preserve wildlife by addressing threats to their populations and habitat loss.\n\n\u201cRhinos symbolise strength and resilience, but they face unprecedented threats that require immediate and sustained action.

This area is in Region 5 and many times we are food insecure, but this season was worse due to the El-Nino season experienced last year. The donation we received will cushion us and our children for the next months,\u201d a villager.\n\nAnother said, \u201cToday we received cereals, oils and pulses and these will go a long way in ensuring a balanced diet for us and our children. The government is doing its best in ensuring food security for us and our livestock and we appreciate the support including sinking boreholes for clean and safe water.\u201d\n\nThe Russian government which donated oils and pulses worth US$2 million pledged to continue supporting Zimbabwe in ensuring food security.\n\nRussia Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Mr Nikolai Krasilnikov NOTED, \u201cToday we are handing over to Zimbabwe another humanitarian supply coming from Russia. It consists of 559 tonnes of nutritious pulses and 164 tonnes of cooking oil enriched with Vitamins A and D. This donation by the Russian Federation amounts to 2 million USD. This is a part of my country\u2019s contribution to the United Nations World Food Programme. Its purpose is to assist the most vulnerable communities affected by El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought \u2013 the worst in four decades that hit the sub-region of South East Africa. We are well aware of the successful efforts that the Government of Zimbabwe has been taking to build up resilience of agriculture the main sector of the country\u2019s economy. At the same time, it is clear that the aftermath of a natural disaster of such a magnitude can be overcome only by urgent and collective actions at all levels \u2013 including the UN bodies, national governments and ordinary farmers.\u201d\n\nBarbara Clemens, World Food Programme Country Director also spoke about the WFP\u2019s programmes.\n\n\u201cBetween now and March 2025, WFP, aims to assist close to 1 million people across the country with food assistance. This demonstrates our shared commitment to addressing immediate needs while laying the groundwork for recovery and resilience. As we respond to this challenge, we must also look to the future. To protect people against future shocks we need to strengthen resilience at all levels. This includes investing in climate-smart agriculture, scaling up social protection systems and climate risk insurance, and empowering communities to build sustainable livelihoods.\u201d\n\nThe government of Zimbabwe thanked its partners for the support, reiterating that no one will die of hunger.\n\nHonourable Ezra Chadzamira, Masvingo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution said, \u201cThe Declaration of State of National Disaster for the 2023/24 agriculture season by President Emmerson Mnangagwa triggered the United Nations family, the donor community, private sector and individuals to complement Government efforts with diverse resources. I am glad that the Russian Federation heeded the call and responded by providing vegetable oil and pulses complementing Government which is providing cereals while WFP is providing associated costs for the twinning. This programme will go a long way in helping our populace which was negatively affected by drought.\u201d\nThe gesture was hailed by the Deputy Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Engineer Benjamin Kabikira.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Zimbabwe is a shining example of how global solidarity can address some of the most pressing challenges of our time. Russia\u2019s consistent support demonstrates a deep understanding of the importance of international cooperation in the face of global challenges. Their commitment to humanitarian aid is not only commendable but essential in our shared mission to alleviate hunger and malnutrition in Zimbabwe,\u201d he said."
