            "content": "Story by Anashe Murombedzi\nAFRICA is home to numerous icons who have excelled in various fields. Among them was Zimbabwe\u2019s late national hero, Dr Joshua Malinga, a relentless advocate for the recognition and inclusion of people with disabilities in the nation\u2019s development.\nDr Malinga did not only champion the rights of persons with disabilities but also fought for their full participation in the fruits of independence\u2014laying a foundation for a more inclusive Zimbabwe.\nWith a life marked by both hardship and triumph, Dr Malinga\u2019s unwavering determination and passion for justice inspired generations of Zimbabweans and echoed across borders.\nBorn on 20 April 1944, in rural Filabusi, Matabeleland South Province, his life changed dramatically at the age of two when he contracted polio, resulting in a permanent physical disability.\nYet, rather than allow this to define or limit him, he used it as a platform to drive advocacy for the rights of the disabled.\nAs a young man, Dr Malinga attended school and learned a craft as a cobbler at Jairos Jiri Centre in Bulawayo.\nThis foundation would serve him well in his future endeavours, as he became a vocal advocate for the rights and interests of people with disabilities in Zimbabwe and beyond.\nDr Malinga\u2019s entry into politics was sparked by the injustices and oppression faced by black people under the colonial regime.\nHe joined the nationalist movement, becoming an activist for the liberation struggle, and after independence he rose through the ranks of ZANU PF to become a Central Committee and Politburo member.\nThroughout his illustrious career, Dr Malinga was a champion of disability rights, becoming the founding member of the National Council of Disabled Persons of Zimbabwe (NCDPZ) in 1975 and serving as the World President of Disabled Peoples\u2019 International (DPI).\nHe played a pivotal role in shaping government policies and programmes that addressed the needs and challenges of people with disabilities, and his legacy continues to inspire and empower individuals with disabilities to this day.\nHaving served as the chairperson of the National Disability Board, Dr Malinga also worked tirelessly during the constitution making process by mobilising disability organisations which went around the country collecting views from the disability constituency and other stakeholders.\nThe views from the disability sector led to a constitutional provision for the reservation of two senatorial positions for people with disabilities.\nHis efforts did not go unnoticed after President Emmerson Mnangagwa appointed him Advisor on Disability Issues in the Office of the President and Cabinet.",

The development resonates with the Second Republic\u2019s thrust to strengthen disaster preparedness and improve community-based recovery mechanisms. Manicaland has been greatly affected by cyclones that include Eline and Idai and these experiences taught us valuable lessons therefore we are heartened by this initiative and we will give you our maximum support. Last year we had a serious fire incident which we could not control in Nyanga,\u201d the Director in the Office of Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution- Manicaland, Mr Munyaradzi Rubaya said\nThe Institute of Civil Protection is also expected to benefit regional countries since it is the first such initiative within the SADC region. be a solution for the whole country.
