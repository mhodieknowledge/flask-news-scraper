It is possible, all we need is a collective drive to harness our capabilities and roll out projects that reflect the Zimbabwe we want,\u201d Minister Mavima said.\n\u201cThis ceremony is not merely about recognising outstanding achievements, it is about acknowledging the immense potential these young leaders hold for Zimbabwe. It is about honouring their ambition, tenacity, and vision for a brighter tomorrow.
