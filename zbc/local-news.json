            "content": "Story by Memory Chamisa\nHARARE \u2013 THE government says it remains committed to including children in the decision-making processes that affect their lives.\nAs preparations for the official opening of the 33rd Junior Parliament in Mt Hampden gather momentum, an alumni dinner is set for this Wednesday evening to proffer guidance to the incoming members of the Junior Parliament.\nGiving an update of the official opening set for Friday, the Minister of Youth Empowerment, Development and Vocational Training, Honourable Tino Machakaire said since the establishment of the Junior Parliament in 1991, the gathering has become a strategic institution among the youth of Zimbabwe.\n\u201cThe government is committed to developing our young people into productive citizens and responsible leaders of tomorrow. The Ministry of Youth Empowerment, Development and Vocational Training as well as other stakeholders have continuously enhanced programmes that enable them to reach their full potential . It is worth noting that this year\u2019s 33rd Session of the Junior Parliament\u00a0will see the ascending of the former parliamentarians to a Junior Senate which enables continuity. This has enriched the quality and scope of debates within the August House,\u201d he said.\nMinister Machakaire also said the Junior Parliament has not only served as a leadership development and advocacy platform, but also a vehicle through which representatives of young people from all provinces participate in the governance of Zimbabwe.\n\u201cThese young men and women are the duty leaders of tomorrow and it is imperative that their grooming starts now to prepare them. We are excited to be working with the Junior President who was recently elected and is also expected to announce his cabinet. The Second Republic continues to roll out programmes based on digital and other ICT-related platforms. As a result, more children now have access to a wide range of educational material and information.\u201d\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa is expected to preside over the official opening this Friday, with junior parliamentarians aged between 12 and 18 representing their peers in each of Zimbabwe\u2019s ten provinces.",

I am able to weld various items, and business is going well,\u201d Ngwenya said.\nMembers of the Ntepe community have commended the transformation they have witnessed in Ngwenya since his release.\n\u201cIn the past, we believed that once someone was convicted, they could not be reintegrated. But with Norman, we are witnessing a true transformation,\u201d a community member said.\nWithin the walls of Gwanda Prison, more inmates are following a similar path.\nMatshitshi Khumalo and Kholwani Mazwi, both serving sentences, have taken up sculpting and artificial flower-making respectively, and hope to pursue their crafts upon release.\n\u201cI am now engaged in sculpting using inexpensive materials, and you can see the beauty of what we are creating. I appreciate the knowledge being imparted to us,\u201d Khumalo said.\n\u201cI have learnt how to make artificial flowers, and I intend to turn this into a business once I am released,\u201d Mazwi added.\nThe ZPCS has placed strong emphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration, with a deliberate focus on skills development to reduce recidivism.\nThe Officer in Charge at Gwanda Prison, Superintendent Ishmael Madzimbamuto said the department is proud of the positive outcomes.",
