We cannot fold our hands when the law is clear on what needs to be done. The consultations we are carrying out will culminate in a policy position to be approved by the cabinet. We want to see the industrialisation of communities being driven by CSOTs which remain vital in the development matrix,\u201d Minister of Industry and Commerce, Honourable Mangaliso Ndlovu said.\nIn mineral-rich provinces like the Midlands, authorities believe the revival of CSOTs will play a catalytic role in boosting local economies and unlocking entrepreneurship potential.\n\u201cThe revitalisation of the Community Share Ownership Trusts resonates with the Second Republic\u2019s Heritage-based Modernisation and industrialisation agenda which is anchored on harnessing local resources and empowering Indigenous people to spearhead innovation that addresses local problems guided by His Excellency, President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019 s mantra: \u2018Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatirwa nevene vayo,\u201d Minister of State for Midlands Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Honourable Owen Ncube said.\nEstablished to foster community development in areas where extractive industries operate, CSOTs were initially envisioned as a mechanism to fund local infrastructure, education, health, and income-generating projects through a percentage of profits from mining companies operating in those areas.\nHowever, years of inactivity, poor oversight, and lack of clarity in implementation frameworks led to stagnation.",
