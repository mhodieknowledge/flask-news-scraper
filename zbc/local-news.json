As such, the government has sourced mealie meal to cushion the Sibona community of Gwanda to sustain themselves before the harvest period.\n\u201cWe are grateful for this donation, you see we are yet to harvest anything from the fields and we were in need of food,\u201d a food beneficiary said.\n\u201cThe rains came late so most of our crops are still not yet ready, so getting this donation will go a long way,\u201d a local farmer said.\nZANU PF 2023 election candidate for Gwanda North constituency Cde Lungisani Ncube who is spearheading development in the community thanked the government and development partners for the timely intervention.\n\u201cThis is what the Second Republic is all about, being people-centred, no one is being left out and we are so grateful to the government and its development partners,\u201d Cde Ncube said.\nThe consignment, a culmination of an engagement between Matabeleland South Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution and a development partner -Tzu Chi Foundation Zimbabwe, is set to sustain vulnerable members of the community until the next harvest.",

However, after the harvest, we realised that the concept is a noble, life-changing programme. Since then we have not looked back,\u201d farmer, Mrs Mukungunugwa said.\nOther farmers paid tribute to the government for helping to transform the dry area of Chivi into a food-secure community.\n\u201cAs a community, we remain indebted to our government for the support they are giving us. We received inputs and technical support hence the crop you are seeing around our villages,\u201d a community member said.\n\u201cApart from the Pfumvudza Intwasa programme we now have many village business units including fish ponds and it has helped us to take farming as a business,\u201d a communal farmer addded.\nAgriculture experts are assisting farmers in Chivi to focus on traditional grains.\n\u201cWe continue to urge farmers in this area to focus on traditional grains given their resilience to climate change. Yes maize might do well in a season like this, but we recommend traditional grains. As Valley Seeds, we are working with more than 300 farmers supporting them in producing those traditional grains,\u201d agronomist for Valley Seeds, Mr Tinashe Bvukumbwe said.\nGovernment representatives are confident of a good harvest this summer cropping season from assessments carried out.",

            "content": "Story by Fairstars Mukungurutse\nGOVERNMENT has reaffirmed its commitment to continue fostering the growth of the tourism and hospitality industry as the country targets to attain an upper middle-income society by 2030.\nSurpassing agriculture and mining, the tourism and hospitality industry registered tremendous growth in 2024, accounting for 12 % of the country\u2019s GDP.\nIn an interview with ZBC News after addressing students at the Zimbabwe Staff College this Monday, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister, Honourable Barbara Rwodzi said the government has put in place a raft of measures to consolidate the tourism industry as one of the top contributors to the Gross Domestic Product, alongside mining, agriculture and manufacturing.\n\u201cWe had an engagement with the Staff of the Defense Forces today, where we were discussing the contribution of the tourism industry to the country\u2019s economy, and we were giving them a layout of what the tourism industry is all about, how we are guided by the constitution, the President\u2019s Vision 2030, as well as the policies and how we have formulated our strategies to be where we are,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe were telling them the figures for 2023, in comparison with 2024 figures, whereby tourism was the highest sector that contributed to the GDP by 12 %, and how we achieved that. Agriculture was affected by climate change due to the drought that we experienced in 2024, and mining was affected by the fluctuation of global prices, and, that resulted in tourism being the number one contributor to the GDP.",

            "content": "Story by Abigirl Tembo, Health Editor\nA growing trend of childhood obesity in Zimbabwe is sounding alarm bells among health experts who warn of severe long-term health consequences if left unchecked.\nLatest statistics from the 2024 ZimLAC Survey reveal that more than 5% of children in Zimbabwe are overweight, with a higher prevalence in urban areas at 7.4% compared to rural areas at 4.5%\nThe Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2023 also reported that over 6% of children under the age of five are overweight, while more than 3 % are obese.\nAccording to nutritionist Dr Nyasha Grace Mushonga, the prevalence of childhood obesity in Zimbabwe is a cause for concern.\n\u201cOverweight among children is not a very good sign of a healthy future population because these are the people who are going to be the adults of tomorrow,\u201d Dr Mushonga said.\n\u201cWhat it means when one is overweight, you have more cells than you should have, and when we lose weight, the cells only shrink but they do not decrease in number. This only means that the potential to regain that weight is there. That is why you find adults who try to do weight-losing programmes, after a few months or a few weeks, they regain because the cells are still there, and the potential to gain weight is there.\n\u201cThe same thing applies to children, when they have so many cells, they are not going to go away because you are losing weight, but they will be enlarged as one gains weight.\n\u201cSo we say let us teach these children at an early age the correct ways of eating food. We know as parents the way we manifest love to our children is very different, some parents think if the child says I want this, and you give them, you are loving them. But that is not the issue. You need to teach these children how to eat properly.\u201d",
