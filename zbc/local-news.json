Spotlight Initiative\u2019s high-impact, comprehensive approach to eliminating violence against women and girls has made impressive gains since launching in Zimbabwe in 2019.\n\u201cThe programme has also recorded significant achievements, through the Government of Zimbabwe from enacting laws and policies that better protect the rights of women and girls, to mobile one stop centres serving survivors of gender-based violence in the country\u2019s most remote provinces, to working with civil society organizations to end child marriage,\u201d UN Women Representative in Zimbabwe, Ms Fatou Aminata said.\nThe Minister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa, acknowledged the significant gains recorded in the country\u2019s efforts to eliminate gender based violence.",

If we are to talk about gender equality or gender sensitivity, we ought to go to the villages because that is where it should start. We must have people change their behaviours and perceptions of gender equality from the household level, and then move to the community, village, ward, district, province, and finally, the national level,\u201d he said.",
