The two victims died on the spot.\n\u201cI was travelling in front of the bus when the accident happened. The driver of the bus was behind the Honda Fit, which suddenly applied the brakes upon seeing the stationary truck. He then tried to save to the extreme right to avoid the oncoming lorry, but the driver of the small lorry appeared to have panicked and pulled off the road, resulting in the head-on collision,\u201d eyewitness, Mr Enock Mupanzarimwa said.\nThe Midlands Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Honourable Owen Ncube, who arrived at the accident scene soon after the incident, appealed to drivers to exercise caution ahead of the heroes\u2019 holidays.",

            "content": "Story by Providence Maraneli\nRURAL community leaders have been urged to ensure that human rights are upheld at household level for the nation to achieve gender equality.\nStatistics have shown that rural communities have a higher percentage of gender related violence cases.\nOn the same note, the Zimbabwe Gender Commission has handled 4 000 cases of gender-based complaints this year, with cases of murder, child marriages, chieftainship conflicts, and crimes of passion being some of the topical complaints.\nAs such, stakeholders who attended this year\u2019s Gender Forum in Gwanda are convinced that a lot needs to be done in communities in the fight to achieve gender equality.\n\u201cWe dream of a situation where women and children enjoy gender equality, sustainable peace, and development,\u201d Women Coalition of Zimbabwe representative, Ms Mercy Mukwane said.\n\u201cThe national policy recognises the diversity of various groups and the need to address the stereotypes regarding gender roles,\u201d Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Gwanda District officer, Mrs Sipho Maphosa noted.\nThe Minister of State for Matabeleland South Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Honourable Albert Nguluvhe, called on community leaders to spearhead behaviour change campaigns in communities.\n\u201cI believe this issue of gender equality should start from the grassroots, just as development should start from the grassroots. If we are to talk about gender equality or gender sensitivity, we ought to go to the villages because that is where it should start. We must have people change their behaviours and perceptions of gender equality from the household level, and then move to the community, village, ward, district, province, and finally, the national level,\u201d he said.",
