We have set up processing plants that process fruits found in specific areas and this has created jobs and changed the face of the communities. Now, the focus is on the commercialisation of these products so that the same areas get to enjoy their local products as well,\u201d research specialist at the University of Zimbabwe, Professor Ancila Nhamo said.\nBulawayo Polytechnic Principal, Mrs Chiedza Masanganise, echoed similar sentiments, highlighting the sector\u2019s critical role in skills development.\n\u201cAs tertiary institutions, our area of specialisation is skills training and through this, we are providing expertise in the development of rural communities, be it in the construction of schools, clinics or bridges. We invest in human capital with the right skills, contributing to improved communities.\u201d\nThe Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development, Professor Fanuel Tagwira, outlined how the Heritage-Based Education 5.0 Model has shaped the rural industrialisation agenda.",
