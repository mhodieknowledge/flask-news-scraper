The responsibility to protect and serve Zimbabwe does not end with a change in leadership or a change in command.\u00a0 Accordingly, I implore you to carry the torch forward and I have no doubt that the next chapter,\u00a0 which now begins with the incoming of my brother, Lieutenant General Emmanuel Matatu, will be filled with even greater accomplishments, continue to raise our flag, national flag, very high to even greater heights,\u201d Lieutenant General (Retired) Sanyatwe said.\n\u201cMy leadership will be guided by the values that we all share, and these are loyalty, dedication to duty and respect. In everything that we do, let us be guided by our mandate, as prescribed in the Constitution of Zimbabwe,\u00a0Section 212, and the provisions in the Defence Act Chapter 1102,\u201d Lieutenant General Matatu stated.\n\u201cAs we embark on this new chapter together, I want you all to know that communication channels, to me, will always be open.\u00a0I will encourage you to share your thoughts, ideas and concerns using formal channels. Let us avoid using unofficial channels in other media, as this often mislead us.\u201d\nChief witnessing officer and Commander Zimbabwe Defence Forces General Phillip Valerio Sibanda highlighted the importance of interactions between the ZDF and communities.\n\u201cI therefore call upon you, the incoming commander of the Zimbabwe National Army, to pay particular attention to principal leadership that is responsive to the dictates of the current operating environment and to be highly vigilant and professional. I implore you to provide quality leadership to the communities that you will be interacting with during your tenure of office. I refer you to the critical role you play as the security focal point throughout our country,\u201d he said.",

Parliament must also ensure that multi-party democracy policy as enshrined in the constitution is observed,\u201d he said.",
