However, the issue has been addressed.\nThe contractor of the project, Zwane Enterprises, signed concession agreements with the government through the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development.\n\u201cWe are grateful to the villagers who agreed to have their homesteads moved and today marks the day we start the construction of the homesteads and we are going to make sure that it is done to the satisfaction of everyone,\u201d Zwane chief executive officer, Engineer Bhekithemba Mbambo said.\nThe local leadership has welcomed the project.\n\u201cWe are so happy that this project has started.

Despite us having children, he never changed, and he continued with the same love and respect. He always defended me. Even to the wider community, he was a caring and loving man. If you ask many people, they\u2019ll tell you how he assisted them.\u201d\nCde Chigudu\u2019s love for his family was echoed by his daughter, Rudo, who shared fond memories of her late father.\n\u201cMy dad was a loving man. He didn\u2019t believe that the father should eat first. He always made sure we were served first. Even when he came home from work, he would check to see if we had eaten. He was a family unifier. He was strict about time. If he was taking us to school and you were late, he would drive off without you.\u201d\nCde Chigudu was one of the first liberation combatants trained in North Korea under ZIPRA, the military wing of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU). He played a pivotal role in the liberation struggle and was dedicated to the cause of Zimbabwe\u2019s independence.\nAs an intelligence operative in the then-Salisbury, Cde Chigudu worked tirelessly in pursuit of freedom. His mission led to his capture by the Rhodesian regime, and he endured 12 years of imprisonment.\nUpon his release, the former Manicaland Province Governor rejoined comrades in Zimbabwe and resumed his duties in the armed struggle.",
