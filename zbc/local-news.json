            "content": "Story by Providence Maraneli\nGovernment thrust to bridge the digital divide between the once marginalised communities and urban areas continues to gain traction, with the Mlamphelele community of Gwanda South set to benefit from the POTRAZ tower relocation programme.\nOn our way to Mankonkoni Irrigation Scheme along the Shashe River in Gwanda South, we passed through a business centre in Mashaba area and we asked for a spot to make a call because of network challenges.\nTo our surprise, we were told that we only needed to have a neighbouring Botswana network line to make calls because all three Zimbabwean networks were not available in the border-lying area.\nThis scenario poses difficulties to the villagers who cannot cross the flooded Shashe River during rainy season which makes it difficult to communicate.\n\u201cWe only buy MASCOM and sell it around here because our local network is not there and now with the rains we can\u2019t cross to Botswana to order so it\u2019s a challenge,\u201d said a community member.\n\u201cThere is no network even if you have a problem you can\u2019t call an ambulance,\u201d said another community member.\n\u201cThere is an information gap around this area because of network,\u201d added a community member.\nAll hope is, however, not lost after the Posts and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority Zimbabwe (POTRAZ) through its tower relocation programme has started the erection of a tower at Mlambaphele border post which the local leadership say will bridge the information gap that existed between the border lying areas and the urban areas.\n\u201cI am happy that we have been remembered, it has been difficult for people here, they could not communicate, we have cattle rustlers but even when we try to coordinate raids on cattle rustlers there was no way. If someone is sick you cannot call the ambulance, but with what is going on we are hopeful now,\u201d said Headman Rantasi.\n\u201cThis will solve most of our challenges in this area, we have elephants that destroy fields and one has to travel to Gwanda to deliver the message. This is a welcome move,\u201d said area councillor, Cde Andrew Ndlovu.",

So we must have that oiling in the form of devolution funds to enable local authorities to deliver on their projects,\u201d added Murewa RDC\u2019s CEO Dr Alois Gurajena.",
