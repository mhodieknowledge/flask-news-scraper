I was raised by my grandmother so I realised I can cook just like anyone and I said let me try,\u201d a contestant said.\n\u201cAs a person with a disability, I participated in this year\u2019s competition, and I cooked the traditional dishes of the San culture,\u201d another contestant said.\n\u201cI am delighted to be part of this competition. I am glad to be the winner of this competition. I took the notes from my mother and here I am,\u201d another participant said.\nThe local leadership is convinced Amai\u2019s Traditional Cookout Competition dovetails with the Second Republic\u2019s mantra of not leaving anyone and any place behind in terms of development.\n\u201cThe choice of Makhulela as the other venue for the cookout programme in the province tells us that the First Lady is serious in terms of inclusive development. We are so grateful,\u201d the Acting Director for Coordination in Matabeleland South, Mrs Sikhangele Ndlovu said.\n\u201cWe are so grateful to the First Lady that she has this community at heart and having a cookout here is evidence enough that she loves these once marginalised people,\u201d Provincial Officer in the Ministry of Women Affairs, Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Mrs Marjory Sikhundla said.",
