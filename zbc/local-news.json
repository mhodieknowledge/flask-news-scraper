            "content": "Story by Memory Chamisa\nAS the rains pour down over Harare, the city\u2019s residents have long welcomed the much-needed relief from the dry spell, however, alongside the refreshing showers comes the familiar sight of flooding, caused not by the intensity of the rains but by the persistent failure of the city\u2019s drainage systems.\nMotorists and pedestrians find themselves navigating impassable streets, as clogged drains become a significant source of frustration and danger.\nFor years, Harare has faced the same story every rainy season: the city\u2019s stormwater drains, once intended to carry away rainfall, are instead choked with debris, waste, and neglect.\nThis recurring problem is a stark reminder of the Harare City Council\u2019s ongoing shortcomings, particularly in its preparation for the rains, despite the evident need for timely action, the local authority\u2019s inability to address the drainage issue has now become a permanent feature of the rainy season.\u201cThis has become a perennial issue, Harare was once clean and organized, now, it feels like a disaster zone. The council must do better,\u201d one frustrated citizen said.\n\u201cThis is not just an inconvenience, it is a serious hazard. The city council must act urgently to restore Harare\u2019s glory and fix the drainage system,\u201d another echoed the same frustrations.\n\u201cDrainage in the CBD is a critical issue requiring immediate attention. Workers must ensure that debris removed from blocked drains is properly disposed of at the Pomona Dumpsite or other appropriate locations. Poor workmanship is often a problem, and many broken drainage systems need reconstruction using bricks and cement.\nHarare Mayor His Worship Jacob Mafume acknowledged the challenge.",

            "content": "Story by Memory Chamisa\nCOMMUTER omnibus passengers and pedestrians are raising concerns about reckless driving by omnibus drivers, who are jeopardising their safety while evading arrest on the roads.\nThe ongoing cat-and-mouse games between local authorities and commuter omnibus operators have left passengers as the primary victims of this situation.\nSome drivers are going to extreme lengths to avoid capture, including jumping out of moving vehicles and leaving passengers stranded and frightened on board.\nPassengers are now urging both the operators and local authorities to collaborate on a solution that prioritises their safety.\n\u201cThis issue has gone out of hand and both the police and commuter omnibus drivers need to solve it. We are at risk as the driver sometimes drives off with a passenger disembarking or worse still trying to get on board,\u201d a citizen said.\n\u201cThese cat and mouse games have resulted in many injuries and no one is held accountable when it happens, they all leave and the injured one foots the bill on their own,\u201d another added.\nTransport operators have weighed in saying the local authorities must not chase after commuter omnibus drivers but should take the offence through the associations they are registered with.",

            "content": "Story by Tapiwa Machemedze\nA sudden surge of water from Ran Mine in Bindura caused alarm among residents of Chipadze Friday morning, raising concerns about contamination and potential health risks.\nHeavy rains that fell on Bindura Thursday night led to unexpected chaos as floodwaters overflowed into homes and churches in Chipadze.\nWhen ZBC News arrived at the scene, the water had receded, but residents were still reeling from the shock of the flooding. Many expressed concerns about contamination since the water originated from the nearby Ran Mine.\n\u201cThis happened at around 3 am when the water came from the mine, flowing down their dam, it filled the church and then got into some of the houses. Now we do not understand what this is,\u201d a concerned resident said.\n\u201cWe were surprised when we saw water flowing from Ran Mine. We woke up and went and told them water was flowing from their dam, kindly asking them for a solution.\n\u201cWe have stayed here for so many years and never encountered such a problem, it is their water, they should correct this situation, where will we get drinking water? How will we bath?\u201d\nRan Mine\u2019s Corporate Affairs Manager, Mr Jack Murehwa, alleviated concerns about potential chemical contamination, stating that the mine is situated on a hill and that the water mainly comes from run-off.\nHe added that tests have been conducted, confirming no contamination has been found.\nThe Environmental Management Agency (EMA) Provincial Environment and Publicity Officer, Mr Maxwell Mupotsa, mentioned that the agency is collaborating with relevant stakeholders to address safety concerns effectively.",

He has consistently called for global leaders to take concrete steps to address climate change, criticising irresponsible lifestyles while prioritising the needs of the poor in the fight against environmental degradation.\n\u201cAs young people, we have the mandate to protect our environment through engaging in actions that do not contribute towards climate change. We should plant more trees and avoid littering the environment.\n\u201cNature provides solutions to our daily needs be it food, medicine, ecosystem, etc and without proper and safe practices we are on the verge of destroying everything including humanity.\u201d\nMakonde District Forestry Officer Mr Wisdom Nduku revealed the district has surpassed its 5 000 indigenous tree planting target.",
