If someone is sick you cannot call the ambulance, but with what is going on we are hopeful now,\u201d said Headman Rantasi.\n\u201cThis will solve most of our challenges in this area, we have elephants that destroy fields and one has to travel to Gwanda to deliver the message. This is a welcome move,\u201d said area councillor, Cde Andrew Ndlovu.",
