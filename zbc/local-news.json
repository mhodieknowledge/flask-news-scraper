Everybody in the world, no matter what age group, no matter what race, no matter what culture, there are two things we relate to, that is music and sports, which is why we have chosen sports.\n\u201cWhen people do sport, they feel confident, they are more open, and it seems to be a crowd puller, we are looking at every individual, from the addicts, families that are suffering because of somebody who has an addiction, to communities trying to get people to know where they can get help and how they can overcome the drug addiction. All of us are affected indirectly. So we are looking at the nation as a whole,\u201d Mr White said.\nSince its inception, the campaign has inspired people to prioritise their health and well-being.",

This is not the first time we have had this in the Matabeleland region, we have seen it in the Dakamela Chieftancy. The ministry is currently working towards the alignment of the Traditional Leaders Act in line with the constitution.\n\u201cTraditional leaders and their respective communities have various rights enshrined in the Constitution.
