            "content": "Story by Kenias Chivuzhe\nSnail production has become a lucrative enterprise, with a Mutare based farmer raising edible land snails for cosmetics and human consumption.\nHeliciculture, commonly known as snail farming, has not been widely practiced in the country, but Mutare-based Godfrey Gurupira is seeking to take the initiative to another level.\nGurupira, from Natiview, is now a knowledge repository of snail production and currently boosts of a collection of over 300 snails.\nAlthough the introduction of snail relish in global dishes is still low, Gurupira targets to reach 1 000 snails by the end of February, buoyed by the good rains and anticipated returns from cosmetic products developed from slime.\n\u201cI breed snails to make lotions, soaps and dyes. I started the project last October after being motivated by President Mnangagwa who encourages the youths to be productive. The snails can live up to 15 years. We can also make use of shells to produce buttons and necklaces among other products. In Nigeria and Kenya there are snail farmers. So far, I have 350 snails and I am targeting to increase the number of snails to 1 000 by end of February. Snails lay four or five eggs every four weeks. This is a profitable business but the biggest challenge is the demand for my products is growing yet I lack capacity to expand the venture in line with the increasing demand,\u201d said Mr Gurupira.\nWith snail slime primarily used for cosmetics, Gurupira believes with more support he can acquire a bigger place to operate from, thereby increasing production.\n\u201cSnails eats lettuces, cabbage, greens and bulgur. The snails passes out slime as an act of defense. Each snail produces three millimetres of slime per day. The slime is used to make lotions, soaps and dyes. Snails have a highly delicious meat more than chicken. We are eating the snails alone at the moment.",

When we have local languages we included more people in the digital economy. Local languages in AI makes it possible for no one to be left behind,\u201d said Ms Dzinotyiwei.\nShe is also self-assured that adopting Local languages in AI will also help in the preservation of cultural heritage.",

We have lost two ECD learners from Tafadzwa ECD Satellite School for Matendeudze Primary School. The learners were swept away on their way from school. This points to a scenario where learners attempted to cross Umvumvumvu River on their way from school. Parents or caretakers should pick their children from school and continue to discourage them from playing around water bodies as children are fascinated by water,\u201d he said.\n",
