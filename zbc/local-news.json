They are very wary of the trouble of mayhem because they know what it does, so they were cautious, it is called vigilance on their part. They wanted to see the depth, scale and scope of what the detractors were up to. So they were assessing the situation, that is what happened yesterday. They did not want to fall into the trap of those in Mozambique, in Maputo and then have unnecessary loss of life.\nAmbassador Mutsvangwa also paid tribute to the security services for ensuring peace across the country.",
