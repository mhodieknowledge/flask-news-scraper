We also believe that this is the biblical message as well. We are also guided by marriage laws in our different cultures that do not allow same sex marriages and even when paying a bride price, they will not accept if it\u2019s for the same gender,\u201d Muyondo said.\nCongregants at the service welcomed the church\u2019s reaffirmed position, expressing relief that the leadership has publicly clarified its stance.",

            "content": "Story by Zanele Ndlovu\nIN a small workshop nestled in Thorngroove, Bulawayo, a team of passionate creatives is transforming clay into artwork which ranges from kitchenware to decorative vases and plates.\nEach piece is individually designed and handcrafted with passion and style to create a unique product. These artists do not just mould ceramics, they mould stories.\nInspired by Zimbabwe\u2019s rich wildlife and cultural heritage, much of their artwork prominently features bold depictions of the Big Five alongside traditional patterns drawn from Shona and Ndebele artistic motifs.\nAmong the team is a female painter, Marion Moyo, who stands confidently in a male-dominated space, proving that creativity knows no gender.\n\u201cWhen I arrived, I was told the company still existed. I had left my pieces at the art gallery and had come to collect my money. That\u2019s how I ended up here. I had studied at Mzilikazi and, though I had never drawn on ceramics before, only canvas, I passed the interview. I was the only woman among 33 men in the art production industry. But I never felt intimidated. I challenged myself to stand out. Art and pottery are my passion; they keep me going,\u201d she said.\nColin Mpofu, a highly experienced and decorated artist, says art is more than his profession, it\u2019s his identity.\n\u201cFirst of all, we are given concepts, and then I express them in a way that someone can easily understand, depending on the colours that are wanted. Sometimes they can make demands, like they want certain colours and variations, hence I sit down and get cracking on it. Each piece can take me about two weeks, and then I hand it over to glazing. This is my life.\n\u201cI am passionate about art. I joined ceramics in 1995, so that is about 29 years. I could say I have spent my whole life here. With this work, we can take our kids to school and support the family through this art. Apart from this, I do canvas art to supplement my income,\u201d he noted.",
