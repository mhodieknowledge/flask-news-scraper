            "content": "Story by Kenias Chivuzhe\nHOT Springs in Chimanimani are set for a major facelift ahead of the Sanganai/Hlanganani/Kumbanai World Tourism Expo with the commercialisation of the place opening up avenues to attract new investments.\nThe decision by the government for Manicaland provinnce to host the Sanganai/Hlanganani/Kumbanani World Tourism Expo for the first time in 18 years is expected to promote the growth of the tourism industry within the province.\nBridal Veil Private Limited company, which was formed by Chimanimani Rural District Council to revamp and run the operations of Hot Springs resort spoke on the progress being recorded in upgrading infrastructure at the resort.\n\u201cWe have repainted the area and re-thatched the conference room and four other chalets and the works are continuing. We are targeting to upgrade this place ahead of Sanganai. This is an international resort so we need it to retain its world-class resort status. We are also looking for partnerships to recapitalise,\u201d the company\u2019s board chairperson, Mr Charles Mazhomwe said.\nChimanimani Rural District Council CEO, Mr Nehemiah Deure is happy with the transformation taking place.\n\u201cHot Springs is a potential revenue-generating institution for the council. The RDC Act restricts councils from conducting commercial activities directly, so we established Bridal Investments to take on this role. Some infrastructure projects are already underway, and we are close to finalising a partnership with a state-owned enterprise to further fund developments. We aim to bring this resort up to international standards and attract tourists from around the globe.\u201d\nAmong developments expected to take place at Hot Springs is the construction of a state-of-the-art hotel among other investments.",

            "content": "Story by Mhlomuli Ncube\nTHE Judicial Service Commission (JSC) has intensified public awareness campaigns ahead of the fourth phase rollout of the Integrated Electronic Case Management System (IECMS), set to commence in July.\nThe fourth phase will focus on digitising magistrates\u2019 courts, beginning with pilot implementations in Matabeleland North and Mashonaland Central provinces.\nAs part of the preparations, the JSC is conducting intensive training for court officials and stakeholders, upgrading internet and network infrastructure, and equipping courts with essential hardware to ensure a seamless transition to the digitised system.\n\u201cSince 2022, the system has been introduced in the higher courts under Phase One. Now we are moving into Phase Four, which covers magistrates\u2019 courts, handling over 90% of our litigation cases. The rollout will be staggered to ensure smooth implementation,\u201d JSC Secretary Mr Walter Chikwana noted.\nThe JSC says the programme aligns with the crucial targets of ensuring justice delivery for all citizens.\n\u201cThe guiding principle is based on Vision 2030 and NDS1, to ensure access to justice for the general populace. We are ensuring decentralisation to ensure at least every district has a courthouse and every province has a High Court to ensure justice is as close as possible to our people. The days of missing documents in court files will soon be over, as electronic records will be maintained. IECMS will also enhance justice delivery even in the comfort of your home,\u201d Mr Chikwana noted.",

Now that permanent classrooms are being built, we are truly grateful,\u201d a villager noted.\n\u201cThese developmental efforts show that ZANU PF is genuinely concerned about the people\u2019s welfare. Such projects are essential for our community\u2019s growth,\u201d another added.\nIn line with the ruling ZANU PF party\u2019s empowerment drive, the legislator also managed to mobilise resources for income-generating projects, including poultry, piggery, and goat rearing, to enhance household incomes and improve rural livelihoods.",
