I believe the private sector has a role to play in community development so that we cut the burden on our government.\u201d",

These include strides that we have made, for example, in asset recovery and forfeiture as well as money laundering.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Zimbabwe has improved its corruption perception rankings as evidenced by the 2024 Corruption Perception Index Report released this Tuesday.",

Some have human capital challenges. Others are swimming in corruption like the City of Harare. Others are immersed in incompetence. So we wanted to clean all that mess as we audit the land. In areas where we think we are happy that this area is now clean, like Mutare for instance, Chiredzi Rural District Council, Chipinge Rural District Council, Chipinge Town Council, those ones we are ready to say look we can lift the moratorium here so it\u2019s not a blanket lift throughout the country. It\u2019s local authority based.\u201d\nThe ongoing land developers audit is bearing fruit in some local authorities.",

There are always fire outbreaks where some accidents occur and lives are lost because there will be no immediate assistance,\u201d said a firefighter.\n\u201cThere was nothing we could do if a huge fire incident occurred because it was dangerous to try to put it out, but with this fire tender, we can easily overcome that obstacle,\u201d added another fire fighter.\nTongogara Rural District Council chief executive officer Engineer Liberty Ncube expressed gratitude to government.\n\u201cAs the Tongogara RDC, we are one of the recipients of the fire tenders procured by the government, and we are grateful to the central government for this. This will go a long way in enhancing our capacity response to emergency services. We are there to ensure public safety through providing emergency services to the communities that we serve,\u201d he said.",
