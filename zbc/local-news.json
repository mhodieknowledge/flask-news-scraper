            "content": "Story by Tamuka Charakupa\nTHE Zimbabwe Gender Commission is celebrating a decade of championing gender equality and justice, with the institution confirming to have resolved over 4 000 gender-related cases over the years.\nThe Mashonaland West Gender Forum hosted in Chinhoyi this Tuesday brought to the spotlight the need for increased gender balance amid concerns of men suffering in silence.\n\u201cAs traditional leaders, we have witnessed firsthand the positive impact of the Zimbabwe Gender Commission, particularly in addressing gender-based violence in our communities. Their interventions have brought justice and healing to many, especially women and girls who for long suffered in silence. I also want to highlight the growing concern around men who are quietly enduring abuse and feel ashamed to speak out due to societal expectations. Gender-based violence affects everyone, and we must increase awareness and support systems for male victims as well,\u201d traditional leader, Chief Nemakonde said.\n\u201cThe Zimbabwe Gender Commission is helping expose historical injustices against the girl child, such as child marriages and denial of education. Through advocacy and policy influence, the Commission is promoting equal opportunities in education, leadership, and economic participation, breaking long-standing cycles of marginalisation and ensuring a fairer future for girls,\u201d Institute for Young Women Development official, Mr Kudakwashe Munemo said.\nGovernment says to date, at least over 4000 gender-related cases have been resolved, influencing key initiatives such as the establishment of a dedicated call centre and decentralisation of offices as explained by Zimbabwe Gender Commission chairperson, Dr Nyepudzai Nyangulu.\n\u201cWhile we celebrate institutional achievements, it is also important that we reflect on successes made in the gender sector as a collective over the past decade. Among the key milestones are pivotal legislative reforms which include the Amendment of the Marriages Act (2022) which raised the legal marriage age to 18, ending child marriages and recognised unregistered customary marriages, protecting women from exploitation. Data Protection Act (2021) which strengthens protection of women and children from online violence. Education Amendment Act of 2020, ensuring that girls are not excluded from education due to pregnancy or motherhood and the recently launched National Gender Policy, meant to give effect to constitutional provisions.\u201d",
