This dip tank, initiated by the villagers, is a huge step. I must point out that one of our villagers recently succumbed to high blood pressure after losing 37 cattle to January disease. This intervention comes not a moment too soon,\u201d he said.\nSenator, Engineer Daniel Mackenzie Ncube, also present at the eventlauded the community for embodying the national development vision.\n\u201cI am very proud of you, the people of Zhombe. You have fulfilled the President\u2019s mantra that \u2018Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo\u2019. It is through your commitment and unity that we are celebrating these achievements today,\u201d he said.\nTraditional leaders and villagers echoed similar sentiments, expressing deep appreciation for the life-changing infrastructure developments.\n\u201cThings were not well in this area. We used to travel long distances to access dipping services. Now we have this dip tank here, and the difference it makes is beyond words,\u201d Headman Sikhanya said.\n\u201cThis place is dry. We used to struggle for water, but now we can simply open the tap and collect clean water. Life has truly changed.\u201d a villager, Gogo Shumba said.\nMrs Melita Ncube, a young mother and beneficiary of the Village Business Unit\u2019s nutritional garden, also spoke with hope.\n\u201cI am very grateful. Through this initiative, we are growing cash crops and can now support our children\u2019s education,\u201d she said.\nPresiding over the commissioning ceremony, Midlands Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Honourable Owen Ncube, reaffirmed the Government\u2019s commitment to inclusive development.",

            "content": "Story by Tapiwa Machemedze\nMOUNT DARWIN \u2013 EFFORTS to eliminate child sexual exploitation in Mashonaland Central Province have reached a critical stage with traditional leaders now spearheading community engagement activities under the \u2018Not in My Village\u2019 campaign launched in August last year by President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\nThe campaign, which aims to tackle child sexual abuse, early marriages, and gender-based violence has entered its grassroots implementation phase, with 28 chiefs across the province actively engaging local communities.\nEducational outreach efforts are being undertaken through village meetings, school visits, health centres, and community gatherings.\nMiss Agnes Kamudyariwa, the provincial facilitator of the Young People\u2019s Network on Health and Wellbeing, welcomed the involvement of traditional leaders in addressing a challenge that has long affected girls in the region.\n\u201cAs a girl child, it pained me greatly to see my peers\u2019 rights being violated through early marriages. Many of them had to abandon their education, losing the chance to fulfill their dreams. There are also serious health risks so I am happy that this campaign has been embraced by the Chiefs. They have promised to educate their communities on the dangers of marrying off young girls,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, Chiefs are taking a firm stance against communities that facilitate or celebrate child marriages, with some warning that attendees at such events may also be held accountable.\nSpeaking during a community sensitisation session, Chief Negomo emphasised the urgent need for a coordinated and comprehensive approach to end child sexual exploitation.\n\u201cWe are ready to go to our headman and all those we meet, teachers, in schools\u2019, hospitals, where ever people are gathered, we are ready to make a holistic approach and end this problem of child sexual exploitation. Here in Mashonaland Central, especially Mount Darwin, Shamva, and here in Mazowe is where the greatest problems are because of mining activities. Now on the issue of child marriages, As Chiefs we have seen that those who will gather and celebrate marriage of children will be culpable of crime because you cannot take part in such gatherings, so we have taken it upon ourselves to go to all areas and homes to end this scourge,\u201d he said.\nChairman of Mashonaland Central Provincial Chiefs Council, Senator Chief Matsiwo, raised concerns about cross-border challenges along the Mozambique frontier.\n\u201cThis programme is enriching us as traditional leaders. It aligns with our cultural values which discourage child marriages. However, in some areas near the border, young girls are being married by individuals from Mozambique. Our powers are limited beyond the border. It is our hope that other SADC countries adopt similar laws to protect children across the region,\u201d he said.\nMr Edgar Muzulu, Provincial Manager of the National Aids Council (NAC), said the campaign would rely on data gathering and documentation to monitor progress and identify hotspots of gender-based violence.",

He called upon lawmakers to uphold human dignity, promote equity, and ensure peace through sincere interfaith engagement.\nThe Pontiff also emphasised the ethical governance of emerging technologies, especially Artificial Intelligence. While acknowledging AI\u2019s potential to enhance communication and understanding, he cautioned against its misuse, asserting that technology must always serve humanity rather than override human dignity and freedom.",

The main thrust of the courses was to mould junior and senior non-commissioned members to be efficient members in the discharge of their respective duties. The Air Force of Zimbabwe remains dedicated to the protection of the Zimbabwean air space and territorial integrity as well as its sovereignty.\u201d\nAmong the graduates was Earnmore Raurai, a surgeon from 1 Commando Regiment, who reflected on the demanding nature of the training.\n\u201cThe course was challenging and demanding, especially in terms of discipline and hygiene. But I have acquired skills that I am proud to pass on to others.\u201d\nMaster Surgeon Jacqueline Moyo, one of the women in the cohort, encouraged fellow female officers to embrace leadership roles within the forces.\n\u201cIt is important to put your heart into everything you do. As women, we must prove our capability and rise through the ranks. I hope fellow women will follow suit.\u201d",

We need assistance now because this is too much for us,\u201d a business owner said.\n\u201cThe fire has left us in a difficult place, where do we start from?
