            "content": "Story by Fairstars Mukungurutse\nTHE public-private partnership in the upgrading of water infrastructure in Harare has taken effect, with the government having handed over the Morton Jaffray water works to private partners that will soon begin rehabilitation works.\nThis Wednesday saw the commencement of a joint venture between the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works, the City of Harare, Helcraw Electrical and Chinese-based Laison Technology to modernise water supply services within the capital city.\nThe project, which starts with the upgrading of the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant will be implemented in four phases including installation of a smart water metering system and upgrading of the distribution network.\n\u201cWhen the President declared the water situation a state of emergency in 2024, it needed us to think outside the box. We then decided that we would not follow the normal processes of inviting tenders, we then invited those with the capacity to join hands with the City of Harare to turn around the water misfortunes. After speaking to a number of these companies, we then zeroed in on Laison Technology and Helcraw Electrical.\n\u201cWe then signed an agreement and allowed them to have a detailed study of the water situation in Harare and come up with a report which was supported by the information from the City of Harare that Lake Chivero water is now contaminated and needs cleaning up and that the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant needs refurbishment and the water conveyance system to various suburbs in Harare has suffered a lot of leakages and a lot of purified water has been lost,\u201d Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Honourable Daniel Garwe said.\nThe partners expressed commitment to boosting water efficiency and sustainability.\n\u201cWe pledged to be committed to making sure that we improve the water situation in our city, the Metropolitan. This aligns with the Vision 2030 that His Excellency has to make sure that by 2030, every household in our city should be able to receive potable water. This also in turn helps us to turn our economy into an upper-middle-class economy. Harare is the face of the country so basic necessities such as water should be available to everyone.\n\u201cAt the moment, there are places that are not even receiving water. A lot of people are buying bottled water. They are using this tap water for cleaning, dishes, and of course, this is not sustainable at all. There are a lot of cholera outbreaks that are happening because of the contamination of water. This shouldn\u2019t be the case, especially for the capital city of Zimbabwe,\u201d Helcraw Electrical\u2019s group Chief Executive Officer Mr Brendon Jere said.\n\u201cWe are excited and honoured to have the opportunity to work together with our partner, Helcraw Electrical to bring the latest technologies, innovations, and the excellent supply chain from China to Zimbabwe and to cooperate with the City of Harare for sustainable water, and assist the City of Harare to let residents enjoy clean water.\n\u201cWe have a strong professional and experienced team of experts here. They are specialised in smart prepaid meters, digital billing, water supply, water treatment, and also wastewater treatment. We are looking forward to working closely with the team from the City of Harare to contribute to the sustainable water management and water supply in the city,\u201d Laison Technology\u2019s Deputy Managing Director, Mr Clark Dai said.",
