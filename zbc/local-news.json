We\u2019ve levelled Pitch A, the main pitch, and the practice pitch. Planting has commenced on the main square, including the wicket and the 30-yard area. The good news is this planting coincides with the rains. I\u2019m told there\u2019s been good rainfall in Victoria Falls, which is very encouraging. While the rains have temporarily slowed work on the practice pitch due to water logging, overall progress is substantial,\u201d said managing director of Zimbabwe Cricket, Givemore Makoni.\nConstruction of other facilities is expected to begin soon.\n\u201cConstruction work on the media centres, players\u2019 changing rooms, and grandstands is scheduled to begin in March this year. We are on course in terms of the field work and adhering to our phased plan. We are confident in meeting all our deadlines,\u201d said Mr Makoni.",
