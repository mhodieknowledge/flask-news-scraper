            "content": "Story by Mercy Bofu-Matinha\nVillagers in Bikita are benefitting from their wetlands conservation efforts through sustainable agriculture projects, with more communities being called upon to embrace sustainable management of natural resources.\nThe restoration of Mukweture and Chapedo wetlands in Bikita has come as a major relief for the surrounding community as it has enabled them to expand their agricultural initiatives.\nThe two projects spearheaded by the community through assistance from the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) and Christian Care Zimbabwe, are benefitting nearly 1 000 families through gardening, apiculture, livestock and fish farming projects.\n\u201cWe are excited about this project of wetlands conservation, when we started we never thought the project would benefit us. We managed to put up a weir as our water reservoir and our partners helped with water pump and pipes. Now we have got four community gardens supplied water from the reservoir,\u201d said a community member.\n\u201cFrom this wetland, we also put up bee hives and we are now into apiculture supplying the community and beyond with honey,\u201d said another community member.\nEMA emphasised the importance of wetlands conservation in ensuring food security at the same time addressing the impact of climate change.\n\u201cAs EMA we encourage communities to take advantage of natural resources in their areas and use them sustainably for development. Today we are witnessing the importance of wetlands conservation as the people of Bikita are now able to do a number of agriculture initiatives. Now they have got weirs that conserve water throughout the year and even their livestock is now benefitting.\u00a0 This shows that if we work together we can address the impact of climate change even at community level,\u201d said EMA Masvingo provincial manager, Mr Milton Muusha.\nChristian Care Zimbabwe continues to compliment government efforts in empowering rural communities through food security.",

We process a fortune of our milk and make sure there is milk and salad so that there are milk products here in Gweru and the balance of goes to Dendairy. We would like to increase the size of our dairy cows and our aim is to reach 500 milking cows a day. We started some five years ago and now we are at a point where we can milk 100 cows an hour. We have invested in milk cooling compressors so those are currently being installed. Two are already running and we hope the other three are up and running in the next two or three months,\u201d said dairy farmer, Mr Robert Anderson.",

There still is a need to do more. We need facilities to put up ramps for us. We need brailles and these side handles to assist us. Moving about the CBD is quite challenging at the moment. You just end up having to get used to these places, otherwise they are not accessible,\u201d a person with disabilities said.\n\u201cSometimes we want to buy our stuff from the shops in the CBD, the equipment that we use in our daily lives, but the shops are not accessible. We are facing challenges even in the entertainment and sports industries. We cannot access the facilities there. We need the government to assist us.\u201d",
