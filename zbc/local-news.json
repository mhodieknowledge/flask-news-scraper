I ran out and heard a lion roaring where our cattle graze, so I ran to meet my colleagues to try and scare it away,\u201d said Tshuma.\nAlongside several others, he attempted to approach the danger, but the lion ambushed him from behind.\n\u201cIt went into a thicket close to where I was, with my colleagues behind me. The lion came from my back and attacked me,\u201d he recounted.\nThe lion bit off his thumb and clawed his head and hand.\nInjured and bleeding, Tshuma stumbled toward a tree and cried for help.\n\u201cI managed to escape by pushing it away. I cried out, injured and in pain, later my colleagues came to rescue me.\u201d\nTshuma was rushed to Victoria Falls Hospital, where he remains under medical care, nursing deep wounds.\n\u201cI thank the almighty God for protecting me because I was going to be killed by that lion,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Story by Tamuka Charakupa\nTHE Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) says it is strengthening mechanisms to combat wildlife crime.\nThis comes as 53 rangers graduated at a pass-out parade at Chinhoyi Caves in Mashonaland West province this Saturday.\nThe graduating group comprises 29 female rangers under the Akashinga and Peace Parks Foundation (PPF) initiative and 24 male counterparts from Zimparks.\nThe new recruits completed a rigorous three-month paramilitary training programme that covered foot and arms drills, advanced weapons handling, bushcraft, and law enforcement, among other disciplines.\n\u201cI am so delighted to have undergone this training. It has not only sharpened my skills, but also deepened my understanding of the critical importance of wildlife conservation,\u201d one graduate said.\n\u201cThis was a tough challenge that required full dedication and courage. I am grateful for the opportunity, especially as a woman making strides in a traditionally male-dominated field,\u201d another noted.\nSpeaking at the pass-out event, Zimparks Mid-Zambezi Senior Regional Manager, Mr Felix Chimeramombe, said the initiative is the result of a tripartite agreement between ZIMPARKS, the Peace Parks Foundation, and Akashinga.\n\u201cThese rangers represent a broad national outlook. The recruitment process involved meticulous consultation with local stakeholders and aligns with the Government of Zimbabwe\u2019s devolution agenda which aims to transform communities, districts, and provinces into economic hubs, thereby contributing to the country\u2019s goal of attaining upper-middle-income status by 2030,\u201d he said.",
