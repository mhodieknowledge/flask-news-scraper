            "content": "Story by Patience Nyagato\nTHE role of parliament in defending the constitution and national security came under the spotlight when the Deputy Senate president, Lieutenant General (Retired) Michael Nyambuya made a presentation at the Zimbabwe National Defence University in Mazowe this Thursday.\nSpeaking to attendees, Lt General (Retired) Nyambuya emphasised parliament\u2019s crucial responsibility in defending the constitution, overseeing the democratic process, and ensuring national security.\n\u201cParliament must legislate, oversee as well as represent the people. So Parliament\u2019s role in ensuring that it carries out oversight on security is that it must ensure that the process of government is going smoothly, resources are allocated to ensure that security services are adequately sponsored and that government and its agencies act constitutionally within the parameters of the law so that everybody in the nation is secure. Parliament must also ensure that multi-party democracy policy as enshrined in the constitution is observed,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Story by Tafara Chikumira\nVICE President General (Retired) Dr Constantino Chiwenga officially lit and handed over the independence flame to the Midlands province this Thursday, setting the stage for the display of the flame across the province which hosts this year\u2019s Uhuru celebrations.\nIn his remarks, VP Chiwenga says the independence flame is a constant reminder of the need for Zimbabweans to respect the ethos of the liberation struggle which binds the nation together going forward.\n\u201cThe Independence Flame we light today represents the spirit and undying hope which guided our struggle for freedom. It symbolises the resilience and determination of the Zimbabwean people, including their resolve to win and defend their sovereignty by all means necessary.\n\u201cAs we celebrate 45 years of independence, we acknowledge our progress as a people and the challenges that remain.\u00a0 It embodies the promise that, despite the challenges we face, our commitment to uphold the ideals of our liberation will never waver. The Independence Flame, too represents the spirit of unity, hope, and determination that has fueled our journey as a nation,\u201d he said.\nThe lighting of the independence flame at the historical monument is significant as the Mtapa Hall hosted the ZANU congress of 1964 which came with a resolution for the commencement of an armed struggle against the white settler regime.\nThe Midlands provincial leadership welcomed the independence flame, while some government ministers who attended the occasion at Mtapa Hall in Gweru, weighed in saying the country\u2019s independence should be cherished as it came through a gruelling war where sons and daughters of the soil lost their lives.\n\u201cThis flame is a symbol of supreme sacrifice and resilience by the veterans of the liberation struggle. Let us cherish what the living and those who lost their lives sacrifices which brought what we enjoy to this very day,\u201d Minister of Veterans of the Liberation Struggle Affairs, Senator Monica Mavhunga said.\n\u201cThis occasion not only marks a significant moment in our national calendar, but also serves as a vibrant reminder of our shared history, resilience, and the enduring spirit of our people. Independence is not merely a date on our calendar, it is a living legacy that embodies our shared struggles, triumphs, and aspirations as a nation. It beckons us to reflect on our progress and to celebrate our achievements. Today, we reaffirm our commitment to uphold the values of unity, peace, and cultural heritage that bind us as a nation,\u201d Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Hon Kazembe Kazembe added.",
