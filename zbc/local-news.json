Also while others are focusing on their studies, you will be concentrating on intoxicating yourself and it destroys your future.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a big embarrassment to parents because they work hard to make sure you get quality education so we should make them proud,\u201d a child added.",

            "content": "Story by Tafara Chikumira\nThe Kwekwe community has thrown its weight behind the proposed Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill saying the piece of legislation will change the national broadcasting landscape if passed into law.\nThe Bill is drawing huge interest from stakeholders who are yearning for a better broadcasting industry that speaks to their needs.\nThe Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Media, Information and Broadcasting Services was in Kwekwe this Saturday where stakeholders proved their knowledge on the tenets of the bill while airing their expectations on the piece of legislation.\nPastors for ED chairperson Evangelist Idirashe Dongo said, \u201cWhat we want is to see ourselves in the media. This bill must address issues like local content being aired in vernacular languages. We want the bill to stimulate energy on having diverse content so that we deal with foreign content which promotes immoral behaviours like homosexuality. We also want critical programmes like parliament debate to be done in vernacular languages.\u201d\n\u201cAs a Kwekwe resident, I am so happy that you came here to listen to our views regarding this bill. We want to see to it that we have exciting programmes on our radio and television stations. This can only happen if our state broadcaster is capacitated. I therefore support the clause that says people should pay their car radio licenses before paying ZINARA licences. That way, our state broadcaster will be capacitated in a huge way and we are bound to receive quality programming,\u201d said a resident.\nAnother added, \u201cI am happy on the proposal that BAZ should sit after every year to consider granting of new radio licenses. This will bring efficiency on prospective license seekers, unlike in the past where it took forever before such considerations were made.\u201d",

We are working closely with the police and the judiciary to achieve our goal of zero poaching and I want to reiterate and warn members of the public to make sure they are not found in protected areas while armed. We also recovered more than 80 rifles and other ammunition. Over 58 convictions of mandatory sentences were done. We have also managed to recover live pangolins which people are poaching for different reasons. Community engagements have also played a significant role in protecting our wildlife and ensuring perpetrators are brought to book and justice is delivered.\u201d",
