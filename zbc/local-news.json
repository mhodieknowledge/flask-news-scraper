The report comes with a set of recommendations for multi-sectoral stakeholders on preventing and responding to violence some of which include the implementation of legislation and policies that address violence against women in politics and holding political parties accountable to gender equality and women empowerment commitments,\u201d Commissioner Sangarwe noted.\nJapanese Deputy Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Hiro Yuki expressed commitment to continue supporting the country\u2019s efforts to eradicate GBV, sentiments echoed by a representative from the French embassy Mrs Lucie Gal-Ong.",
