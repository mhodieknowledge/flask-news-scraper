            "content": "Story by Oleen Ndori, Foreign Editor\n\nThe continent has been implored to unite in the implementation of the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 towards increased intra-continental trade for development.\n\nBuilding \u2018The Africa We Want\u2019 is a key target of the African Union by the year 2063 and as such, various policies and programmes have been put in place by the continental body for the sustainable development of Africa.\n\nThis emerged during an interface between Government and African diplomats accredited to Zimbabwe this Monday.\n\nForeign Affairs and International Trade Minister, Professor Amon Murwira, who presided over the meeting, highlighted the importance of AU member states coming together to boost intra-continental trade.\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, we are just 39 years away from the African Union Agenda 2063. Our ambitious blueprint transformed our continent. In this regard, we are making efforts to silence the guns in line with the AU clarion call, although isolated conflicts or spots present immediate challenges. Let us remain committed to working towards addressing peace and security issues in line with African solutions to African problems, as opposed to the reliance on external forces who may be complicit in some of the conflicts.\n\n\u201cDespite our excellent relations, political relations, Your Excellencies, it is worrying that intra-African trade remains low. The advent of the African Continental Free Trade Area, AFCTA, is a welcome development that should reverse this state of affairs and enable us to recalibrate our efforts towards benefiting from the single market for goods and services across our continent. As we create a bigger market for our goods and services, we should jealously guard against such a market benefiting other regions. The market should benefit Africa first, hence the imperative to enhance local productive practices on our continent. Let us strive to continuously advance common African positions and interests towards the transformation of our countries on the continent for the benefit of our peoples. Our salvation lies in local production, in intra-regional trade, and not aid,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Dean of African Groups of Ambassadors in Zimbabwe and Ambassador of Equatorial Guinea to Zimbabwe, His Excellency Jose Ela Ebang said unity among African countries will move the continent forward.\n\n\u201cWe commend the Republic of Zimbabwe\u2019s contribution to the realisation of the Africa We Want, with a goal for inclusive and sustainable development and a Pan-African drive for unity, self-determination, freedom, progress and collective prosperity pursued under Pan-Africanism and African nations, as you rightly stated. Honourable Minister, may I also take this opportunity to express our solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe during the challenging period of the severe drought caused by the El Nino-induced effects. As climate change worsens globally, and in Southern Africa particularly, urgent actions on climate emergencies are imperative,\u201d said Ambassador Ebang.\n\nFrom meeting the African envoys, Professor Murwira went on to meet BRICS representatives in the country, where he stressed the importance of bilateral and multilateral ties for economic growth.\n\nHe noted, \u201cZimbabwe sees BRICS partnership as a catalyst for global growth and development, a partnership that is strongly meaningful for all nations. In this regard, it is the right of Africa and the entire Global South to fully reap the benefits of global trade and investment. Without trade and investment, our economies cannot thrive, and the livelihoods for our people cannot improve. Your Excellencies, we wish to appreciate the importance of BRICS partnership and the new development plan for leading in the efforts to increase the resilience of the Global South and the world at large, and to bring fairness to global trade and financial systems by strengthening the use of BRICS services. Your Excellencies, we have to reform the moderate bilateral trading system so that we create a conducive environment for investment and fair trade. By working together, sharing skills and capabilities, mobilising resources, we shall be able to give renewed indicators to global growth and renewed and sustained development.\u201d\n\nDean of the BRICS Group of Ambassadors and Russia\u2019s envoy to Zimbabwe, His Excellency Nikolai Krasilnikov said the group acknowledges the deep ties that exist between the countries and the drive towards inclusive development.\n",

By this morning, it was in southern Malawi\u2026.in that path it was losing its strength as it traversed the northern parts of Mozambique. It is now weaker and now a tropical depression which will give light showers in the eastern parts of Zimbabwe.\n",

The plan clearly spells out the significant and specialised roles each of you has to play in ensuring the success of critical areas. We must disrupt the flow of illicit drugs into our country. This requires cooperation between law enforcement agencies, boarder security and the judiciary. As leaders, you must advocate for stricter enforcement of laws and support efforts to strengthen our country\u2019s ability to combat drug trafficking,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Midlands province has made significant progress in dealing with drug and substance abuse by targeting drug kingpins.\n\nMidlands Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Hon Owen Ncube noted, \u201cDuring the period January to October 2024, the Midlands Province Drugs and Substance Supply Reduction Pillar identified 57 hot spots, and undertook 101 raids, Kwekwe included, leading to a total of 379 arrests. The Demand Reduction Pillar reached out to over 36 500 Youths through drugs and substance abuse awareness campaigns, whilst the Treatment and Rehabilitation Pillar admitted 977 people. Furthermore, the Reintegration and Psychosocial Support Pillar reached out to over 1 900 people who use drugs for counselling and caregiving.\u201d",

We are not going to be where we want to be in 2025, but that improvement is significant. We appreciate it and we will continuously engage with the water authority to see whether there will be a possible revision upwards of the water allocation depending on the inflows that will be coming into Lake Kariba.\u201d\n",
