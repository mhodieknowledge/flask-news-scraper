To make matters worse our clinics are far,\u201d said a resident.\n\u201cSewage flowing into houses has become a normal site here, and this is exposing us to health hazards like cholera,\u201d said another resident.\n\u201cWe have been reporting to the local authority, but it seems they are not interested,\u201d another resident noted.\n\u201cWe are pleading with the Bulawayo City Council to hear our cries. We are tired of being neglected. We will end up dying because of this,\u201d added another resident.",

For NRZ, we are supporting it to source a credit from outside to fix the railway line, get more rolling stock and to fix the signaling system. So we are close to concluding a deal for an external credit line. l think we will see some progress during 2025 so that we can get some of the heavy trucks off the roads. We need to shift all that cargo to the railway infrastructure and this can be done commercially and profitably so that we can be able to service the loan.\u201d",

We are looking forward to reach 300 000 litres by end of this year as we have increased our herd,\u201d said chairperson of Cynara Dairy Farmers Cooperative, Francis Musunzuru.\nSmall-scale dairy farmers in the area have benefited from government support, which has given impetus to their milk production ventures.\n\u201cWe have partners selling affordable dairy calves to us at $100 each. We were also given an artificial insemination kit to grow our herd,\u201d said a dairy farmer.\n\u201cThe presidential silage scheme is helping us a lot in improving the volume of milk we produce due to increased supply of feeds,\u201d said a dairy farmer.\n\u201cWe are looking forward to growing our herd as we are being supported by the government,\u201d said another dairy farmer.\n\u201cWe are happy with the support but we can produce more if our herd is increased. We are planning to produce feeds locally to reduce production costs,\u201d said a dairy farmer.\nGovernment support has been the major driver of growth in the dairy sector.\n\u201cSince the introduction of the presidential silage scheme, Manicaland province recorded 27 percent growth in terms of milk production.
