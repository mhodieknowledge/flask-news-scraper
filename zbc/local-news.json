We see the partnership with MIPF being a step in the right direction as we intend to attain our target.\n\u201cSome of the major aspects to be considered for a full municipality status are issues to do with infrastructure and we intend to have more of such facilities. The issue of revenue collection is set to increase with business at this centre,\u201d councillor Fanuel Machiya said.\nThe Shurugwi community is equally excited about the prospects that lie ahead.\nThe government commended development projects in the mining town of Shurugwi saying they dovetail with the government\u2019s industrialisation and re-industrialisation efforts.",

We\u2019ve levelled Pitch A, the main pitch, and the practice pitch. Planting has commenced on the main square, including the wicket and the 30-yard area. The good news is this planting coincides with the rains. I\u2019m told there\u2019s been good rainfall in Victoria Falls, which is very encouraging. While the rains have temporarily slowed work on the practice pitch due to water logging, overall progress is substantial,\u201d said managing director of Zimbabwe Cricket, Givemore Makoni.\nConstruction of other facilities is expected to begin soon.\n\u201cConstruction work on the media centres, players\u2019 changing rooms, and grandstands is scheduled to begin in March this year. We are on course in terms of the field work and adhering to our phased plan. We are confident in meeting all our deadlines,\u201d said Mr Makoni.",
