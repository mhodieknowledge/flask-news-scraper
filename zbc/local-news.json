            "content": "Story by Gay Matambo\nGRASS-woven baskets are still a popular interior, which is one of the reasons why a number of men in Mutirikwi area of Chiredzi have also ventured into the trade.\nWith basketry predominantly a domain for women, Mr Brighton Chada has a thriving art and craft business, whose products include basket chairs made from woven grass, tree bucks and bamboo reeds.\nEach chair takes at least seven days to make while bigger chairs with more complicated designs take as long as a month.\nBasketry has become a lucrative source of income for Mr Chada, who has been able to fend for his family through the art.\n\u201cI have been doing this for 20 years now. I married my wife and took my children to school through funds from weaving. When I started, I used to weave baskets only until I started making chairs. During the sugarcane crop season, that\u2019s when we have many customers and sometimes it depends on whether people like the design or not,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis area is actually called Pamasofa, even people in Harare know this place. I get resources locally, and I make these artifacts at zero cost. I use trees, grass, and reeds. The big one costs US$80, the small ones cost US$50 and garden chairs cost US$30. We make all-weather furniture. This is because these can stay outside even during rainy days and even in the house,\u201d he added.\nThe ZBC News also caught up with Mr Farai Magaya in Muzembi village, Triangle, who specialises in traditional basket weaving using dry grass and reeds.",

            "content": "Story by Mercy Bofu-Matinha\nTHE Government continues to prioritise rural development by ensuring access to electricity, with villagers of Gutu being the latest to benefit following the commissioning of electricity transformers in the area to supply critical institutions including clinics, schools, and rural business centres.\nMr Cuthbert Marimi is one of the small business owners at Jaravaza shopping Centre in Gutu, and he is looking forward to improved business following the installation of a new electricity transformer in their area.\nApart from Jaravaza Shopping Centre, five other transformers were installed at various centres and are expected to feed into critical institutions including rural healthcare centres and schools, with the project being spearheaded by area legislator, Honourable Winston Chitando.\n\u201cToday is a big day for this community, we had gone for more than three years without electricity because we did not have a transformer. Now that it has been installed, our small businesses are going to thrive again because we were no longer able to run butcheries, and liquor shops or store perishable goods. We thank our government for always being supportive of the rural populace,\u201d Mr Marimi said.\nGutu central villagers gathered at various centres across their constituency at the weekend to celebrate the development implemented by the Second Republic.\n\u201cToday after the installation of electricity transformers, our clinics will now run viably, our children will now be doing computer studies at any time. Even our rural homes are now reconnected meaning we now have smooth access to information,\u201d a villager said.\n\u201cThe government sank more than 20 boreholes and many are now into gardening projects. Again, we are beneficiaries of the Presidential Goat and Poultry Scheme among many others,\u201d another villager added.\nHonourable Winston Chitando, who is also the Minister of Mines and Mining Development, said rural industrialisation is key to achieving Vision 2030.",

It\u2019s a serious challenge that we have,\u201d said Harare Mayor, Councillor Jacob Mafume.\nWhile the city\u2019s infrastructure bleeds, executives at Town House are fattening their pockets with evidence presented at the Commission of Inquiry showing the Town Clerk\u2019s monthly salary is pegged at US$27 000.\nThe total salary bill for executives was estimated at half a million United States dollars monthly, prioritised over the cost of repairing damaged infrastructure.\nHarare\u2019s traffic situation has degenerated into a jungle, ranging from traffic accidents to unmanageable traffic congestion.",
