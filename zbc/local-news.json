            "content": "Story by Courage Bushe\nSHURUGWI North is already enjoying the benefits of the government\u2019s rural industrialisation drive following the electrification of three schools, Chief\u2019s homestead,\u00a0 a clinic and a business centre by the Rural Electrification Fund ( REF).\nEfforts by the government to leave no one and no place behind in the development matrix are continuing, as the development has come as a relief to local schools that have never had electricity.\n\u201cNow that there is electricity in schools, this will improve service delivery in the education sector here, considering that the setting up of science laboratories had become an elusive dream.\nSmall to medium projects, especially those relying on electricity, will be able to function properly and grow in numbers at the business centres which have been electrified,\u201d said community members.\nRural Electrification Fund Board member, Mr Fungai Mbetsa, gave an update on similar programmes being spearheaded by the Fund.\n\u201cWe want to change the lives of our people nationwide, and so far, we have done 10 000 similar programmes across the country. We have also managed to connect various households and business centres. We want to make sure that by the end of the year 2030, all rural areas are connected to the national grid.\u201d\nThe Government is upbeat that the electrification program will play a pivotal role in stimulating growth and development in the province.\n\u201cThis initiative by our president will help our learners to bridge the gap between rural and urban learners because there will be computers and labs here. More so, the learning system will be viable and easy for students, and even looking at the business side, there will be growth,\u201d Midlands Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Honourable Owen Ncube said.\n\u201cAs a government, our drive is to make sure that all rural schools have been equipped with requisite materials so that there won\u2019t be any gap between them and urban centres. Our focus is to ensure we improve rural livelihoods by creating a conducive environment that stimulates economic growth,\u201d Minister of Energy and Power Development, Honourable July Moyo added.",

            "content": "Story by Tichaona Kurewa\nZIMBABWE and China have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate in the areas of wetland, forestry and grassland management, a significant step forward in global environmental co-operation.\nThe agreement was signed this Friday on the sidelines of the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (COP15), currently underway in Victoria Falls.\nThe MoU centres around collaboration with China\u2019s International Mangrove Centre (IMC), which has played a pivotal role in supporting global biodiversity, mitigating climate change, and promoting sustainable livelihoods.\nTo date, 18 countries, including seven African nations, have partnered with China under the IMC initiative.\nThis latest MoU is expected to yield multiple benefits for Zimbabwe. These include strengthened wetland conservation efforts, technical and academic exchange programmes, joint research opportunities, access to advanced research equipment, and enhanced capacity development. It also aims to deepen the understanding of mangrove ecosystems.\n\u201cAs we embark on this collaborative endeavour, we acknowledge the pivotal role that mangrove ecosystems play in supporting global biodiversity, mitigating the impacts of climate change, and fostering sustainable livelihoods.\n\u201cAlthough Zimbabwe is a landlocked nation, we recognise the far-reaching benefits of mangrove conservation and are eager to leverage the expertise and resources of the IMC to enhance our conservation efforts,\u201d China\u2019s Department of International Cooperation, National Forestry and Grassland Administration, National Park Administration, Director General, Dr Xia Jun said.\nMangrove ecosystems are unique coastal environments found in tropical and subtropical regions. They consist of salt-tolerant trees and shrubs that thrive along shorelines, estuaries, and river deltas.\nMangroves are vital in the purification of seawater, mitigating storm surges, preserving biodiversity, among others, thus playing a critical role in climate resilience.",

The museum is not an aesthetic home of dead artefacts, it\u2019s a living organism where people can come, celebrate, and appreciate this city called Harare, this country called Zimbabwe, and this beautiful continent called Africa.",
