(Rtd.) K.C.D. Mohadi, as the Chairperson of the Cabinet Committee on Social Service and Poverty Eradication. The Early Childhood Development Coordination Framework is a strategy that seeks to harmonise the existing policies, strategies and initiatives; and strengthen the capacity of the existing systems and structure to holistically provide quality and affordable service to the children up to seven years.\nThe specific objectives of the Framework are as follows: harmonising existing ECD policy-related goals, strategies and initiatives within and across all sectors; setting, improving and aligning standards to ensure equitable access to well-coordinated, quality, inclusive and affordable ECD services; as well as harmonising and strengthening the capacity of existing systems and structures to deliver integrated quality and inclusive ECD programmes.\nThe Constitution of Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwe National Development Strategy 1 (NDS 1): 2021-2025 underscore the importance of investing in early childhood development as a tool for poverty reduction and a vehicle for producing skilled and capable human capital for socio-economic transformation.\nZimbabwe is also a signatory of several global and regional protocols that call on Governments to ensure that all children access quality early childhood development. The Framework therefore aligns the country\u2019s aspirations, policy and legislative environment, as well as international obligations.\n2.0 PREPARATIONS TO HOST THE 45TH INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATIONS AND THE CHILDREN\u2019S PARTY\nCabinet received an update on Preparations for the 2025 Independence Day Celebrations and Children\u2019s Party, as presented by the Minister of Local Government and Public Works, in his capacity as Acting Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on State Occasions and National Monuments Honourable Daniel Garwe.\nIn line with the thrust of the Second Republic to hold national events rotationally across the Country\u2019s Provinces, the 45th Independence Anniversary Celebrations will be held on 18th April 2025 at the Nembudziya Growth Point Open Ground Venue in Gokwe North.

We are widening the narrow mate to a 10 meter full width tarred road and we are going to surface the road using asphalt overlay which is a bit durable in terms of strength,\u201d said Engineer Vincent Gumbo (Site Agent \u2013 Difflock Construction).",

I believe the majority of people in Zimbabwe listen to ZBC, and I want to thank the Minister for proposing this,\u201d a Member of Parliament said.\nDuring the debate, the Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Dr Jenfan Muswere and the Leader of Government Business in the National Assembly, Honourable Ziyambi Ziyambi clarified some clauses in the bill.\n\u201cThe collaboration between ZBC and ZINARA is in full compliance with the Constitution. I want to emphasise the distinction between a radio license and a radio receiver, as the latter is capable of receiving broadcasts,\u201d Dr Muswere said.\n\u201cThe Second Republic has prioritised alignment with constitutional requirements and good governance practices,\u201d Honourable Ziyambi stated.",

The water was powerful from Kamonde River and surrounding higher ground. It converged and failed to dislodge the soil and started eroding the bridge which eventually gave in. Now all the produce from these farms cannot pass through,\u201d a farmer said.\nAnother added, \u201cThe biggest problem is the movement of produce, school children. As farmers, we go to town and buy produce daily. Today, we are likely to receive more rains, so we hope the local authority will urgently intervene before the whole bridge is washed away.\u201d",

            "content": "Story Peter Chivhima\nTHE Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) and the Zimbabwe National Roads Administration (ZINARA) have demonstrated their capacity to implement an integrated disc for vehicle licencing, in line with the provisions of the Constitution.\nA high-level presentation to the Joint Parliamentary Portfolio Committees on Media, Information and Broadcasting Services, and Transport and Infrastructural Development at the New Parliament Building in Mt Hampden this Monday saw ZBC and ZINARA proving their technical capacity to deliver solutions that enhance efficiency.\nTen Ten Technologies\u2019 CEO Mr Charles Wekete said, \u201cIndeed, as we demonstrated in our presentation, we confirmed that it\u2019s technically feasible. The question we were asked to address was whether it\u2019s possible to have a single licensed disc that covers vehicle licensing, insurance, and radio licensing. Our answer was unequivocally yes; it\u2019s entirely possible from a technical standpoint.\n\u201cWe also discussed the importance of security features. Regarding the concern about individuals printing licensed discs at home, we clarified that the display of licensed discs on vehicle windshields is regulated by existing laws. As technical partners, it\u2019s not our role to advocate for changes to these regulations. Instead, it\u2019s up to the relevant authorities, including government agencies, to determine whether they wish to revise or repeal these laws and permit individuals to print their licensed discs at home.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we come together and integrate our systems,\u00a0it will also be less costly in terms of the administration of things,\u00a0because we will be having a lot of automation taking place in the background,\u00a0saving us from printing a lot of discs and all the other expenses associated with the operations in silos.\u00a0\u00a0So we are breaking the silo mentality and cooperating, which is something that we have shown through the meeting\u00a0that it\u2019s possible to work together,\u201d ZBC\u2019s Acting CEO Engineer Tapiwa Mudzamba said.\nZBC Head of Licensing Mr Wisdom Samanyai and Chairpersons of both Parliamentary Portfolio Committees threw their full support behind the vision, emphasising the importance of enhancing efficiency for motorists.\n\u201cWe are pleased that all three parties, including our vendor, are on the same page. We have even outlined the timelines involved. The question was if this proposal is approved tomorrow, when can we expect implementation to begin? We were able to provide a detailed explanation of the technical arrangements and other behind-the-scenes efforts already underway to ensure a smooth rollout,\u201d Mr Samanyai said.",
