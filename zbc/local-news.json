We have opened and established new regional magistrates in Guruve, Mutoko, Kwekwe, Zvishavane. The other four are already functional except for Guruve where we are now finalising and working on the logistical areas so that we have proper infrastructure that will house the regional court. So our numbers of regional magistrates have increased in that respect. We have also established close to 10 resident magistrates courts within the country. We have established a resident magistrate court in Mabvuku where again we are going to open a regional magistrate there. We have since commenced construction of the courthouse in Mabvuku and we are quite certain that during the course of the year the courthouse will be ready to be opened,\u201d he said.",
