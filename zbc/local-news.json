It\u2019s a small comfort, but it means a lot to me,\u201d said an inmate.\nBut not all inmates were as fortunate. Many had not received any visitors or gifts, and the loneliness was evident.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be away from my family on Christmas Day. I have been here for six years and I have never received a single visitor. I just wish someone would come and visit me, just to remind me that I\u2019m not forgotten,\u201d and inmate narrated.\n\u201cMy family please forgive me. I am serving my time and I am sorry, please come and visit me.\u201d\n\u201cI wish someone could come and visit me. Even for 30 minutes only,\u201d said another inmate.",
