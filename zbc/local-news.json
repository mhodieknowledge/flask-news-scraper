            "content": "Story by Tichaona Kurewa\nFOR many years, accessing essential identity documents in Zimbabwe meant long, often difficult journeys to centralised offices, especially to the capital city, Harare.\nThe Second Republic has, however, embarked on a spirited drive to decentralise the issuance of national documents, much to the delight of the citizenry.\nThis drive is anchored in the national devolution agenda and the mantra: \u201cLeaving no one and no place behind.\u201d\nThe process has been gradual but consistent.\nInitial efforts included opening provincial registry offices like Lupane, and easing pressure on the central registry in Bulawayo and other major centres.\n\u201cThe process of acquiring a passport is now cheap for us even the process of obtaining a passport is now smooth,\u201d a Lupane resident said.\n\u201cWe thank the government for opening passports offices in Hwange, everyone who needs these documents can access them easily,\u201d a Hwange resident added.\nOver time, this expanded to include district-level offices in places like Hwange, and even smaller urban centres such as Victoria Falls.\n\u201cWe thank the government for the effort it has made over the years to make vital documents accessible to all people. We used to travel as far as Bulawayo for passports. Then came Lupane, and now we have Hwange, which is commendable. Mobile teams are also visiting schools to register those without documents. Most recently, chiefs have been empowered to issue birth records for deaths occurring within their jurisdictions,\u201d Chief Hwange Mr Amos Chipaya said.\n\u201cThe government has come up with decentralisation, which has made people lessen the burden of the cost that is involved because you also have to pay for the passport. It\u2019s now catering for people from Binga, Kamativi, Victoria Falls and especially the people from the safaris,\u201d Hwange District Registrar, Mr Alfred Jija noted.",
