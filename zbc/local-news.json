            "content": "Story by Fairstars Mukungurutse\nHARARE residents have raised concerns over the increasing number of fatal accidents involving unlicensed commuter omnibus operators.\nThe latest tragedy occurred on Wednesday morning along Bulawayo Road, claiming eight lives, including Dzivarasekwa couple, Enock Chanengeta and Sophia Machema, who leave behind three children.\nWhen the ZBC News Crew visited their family home on Thursday, a sombre atmosphere prevailed as loved ones struggled to come to terms with the devastating loss.\nThe accident involved a commuter omnibus driven by an unlicenced driver, a haulage truck, and a Nissan UD truck.\n\u201cAs a family, we are devastated because they left three school-going children and we do not even have a clue how we are going to manage. The painful thing is that the driver did not have a license, now look at how it ended,\u201d family spokesperson, Mrs Ronia Chanengeta said.\nResidents have voiced frustration over the gross negligence by commuter omnibus drivers, amid confirmation by the Zimbabwe Republic Police that the driver of the omnibus was unlicensed.\n\u201cThe problem with kombi drivers is that they leave the vehicle in the hands of unlicensed conductors and touts while they go about their business and this costs lives,\u201d a resident said.\n\u201cWe appeal to the responsible authorities to bring to book all those who drive without licenses otherwise we are all going to perish,\u201d another added.\nRepresentatives of transporters associations highlighted the urgent need to bring sanity to the public transportation business.\n\u201cWe are saying unlicensed individuals, touts, conductors and drivers must desist from driving at all costs. We also encourage kombi operators to join transporters associations so that their operations will be easily supervised and regulated and ensure the drivers receive proper training,\u201d Harare Youth Transporters Association\u2019s Chairperson, Mr Edmore Gwengwe said.\n\u201cWe encourage the government to enact a law that enables transport associations to regulate themselves so that every operator is closely monitored. We also appeal for stiffer penalties to those who are defying traffic regulations,\u201d the National Coordinator for the Passengers Association of Zimbabwe, Mr Tafadzwa Goriati stated.\nRoad traffic accidents involving unlicensed drivers are on the increase with calls for stiffer penalties on reckless motorists fuelling road carnage.",

            "content": "Story by Mercy Bofu-Matinha\nGOVERNMENT says it is pushing for the enactment of a new Occupational Safety and Health law expected to holistically address issues of safety at workplaces.\nThe Engineers\u2019 Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Workshop is currently underway in Masvingo, with the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Honourable Edgar Moyo having highlighted government\u2019s concerns over occupational injuries and deaths.\n\u201cThe injury statistics over the past three-year period show a declining trend but, certainly remain highly elevated because of the loss of lives which is a major concern to the government. In this regard, the government will do everything possible to push for a new OSH law (The OSH Act) that should help us all as a nation to arrest this needless loss of lives at work as well as stop the horrendous experiences suffered by injured workers and their Families,\u201d Honourable Moyo said.\nEngineers were also challenged to lead innovation and adopt technologies that revolutionise their approach to Occupational Health and Safety.\n\u201cWe are aware of the importance of OSH in fostering sustainable development. As a Province, we face unique challenges related to the safety of workers, particularly in industries such as mining, agriculture, and manufacturing. It is in this regard that the work you do as engineers and OSH professionals is invaluable,\u201d Masvingo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Honorable Ezra Chadzamira said.\n\u201cYour expertise and commitment to safeguarding the health and safety of workers are central to creating a productive and secure working environment for all. The theme, \u201cOccupational Safety and Health: Technology and the Future of Work,\u201d is relevant in today\u2019s ever-evolving industrial landscape. As technology continues to shape the future of work, it is crucial that we embrace these advancements to create safer and more efficient workplaces.\u201d\nThe National Social Security Authority (NSSA) revealed that injury figures have been dropping for the past years and as an institution, they expect the OSH bill to harmonise all the OSH related laws.\n\u201cThe number one deliverable of the OSH bill is to harmonise all the small segments of legislations which currently exist in different sectors in our industry so that we have a single thrust which we can use and lay upon to leverage and make sure that we can supervise all the systems in terms of Occupational Safety and Health,\u201d NSSA Board Chairman, Dr Emmanuel Fundira said.",
