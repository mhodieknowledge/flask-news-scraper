            "content": "Story by Mercy Bofu-Matinha\nGOVERNMENT says it is pushing for the enactment of a new Occupational Safety and Health law expected to holistically address issues of safety at workplaces.\nThe Engineers\u2019 Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Workshop is currently underway in Masvingo, with the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Honourable Edgar Moyo having highlighted government\u2019s concerns over occupational injuries and deaths.\n\u201cThe injury statistics over the past three-year period show a declining trend but, certainly remain highly elevated because of the loss of lives which is a major concern to the government. In this regard, the government will do everything possible to push for a new OSH law (The OSH Act) that should help us all as a nation to arrest this needless loss of lives at work as well as stop the horrendous experiences suffered by injured workers and their Families,\u201d Honourable Moyo said.\nEngineers were also challenged to lead innovation and adopt technologies that revolutionise their approach to Occupational Health and Safety.\n\u201cWe are aware of the importance of OSH in fostering sustainable development. As a Province, we face unique challenges related to the safety of workers, particularly in industries such as mining, agriculture, and manufacturing. It is in this regard that the work you do as engineers and OSH professionals is invaluable,\u201d Masvingo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Honorable Ezra Chadzamira said.\n\u201cYour expertise and commitment to safeguarding the health and safety of workers are central to creating a productive and secure working environment for all. The theme, \u201cOccupational Safety and Health: Technology and the Future of Work,\u201d is relevant in today\u2019s ever-evolving industrial landscape. As technology continues to shape the future of work, it is crucial that we embrace these advancements to create safer and more efficient workplaces.\u201d\nThe National Social Security Authority (NSSA) revealed that injury figures have been dropping for the past years and as an institution, they expect the OSH bill to harmonise all the OSH related laws.\n\u201cThe number one deliverable of the OSH bill is to harmonise all the small segments of legislations which currently exist in different sectors in our industry so that we have a single thrust which we can use and lay upon to leverage and make sure that we can supervise all the systems in terms of Occupational Safety and Health,\u201d NSSA Board Chairman, Dr Emmanuel Fundira said.",
