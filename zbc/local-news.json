The water was powerful from Kamonde River and surrounding higher ground. It converged and failed to dislodge the soil and started eroding the bridge which eventually gave in. Now all the produce from these farms cannot pass through,\u201d a farmer said.\nAnother added, \u201cThe biggest problem is the movement of produce, school children. As farmers, we go to town and buy produce daily. Today, we are likely to receive more rains, so we hope the local authority will urgently intervene before the whole bridge is washed away.\u201d",

            "content": "Story Peter Chivhima\nTHE Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) and the Zimbabwe National Roads Administration (ZINARA) have demonstrated their capacity to implement an integrated disc for vehicle licencing, in line with the provisions of the Constitution.\nA high-level presentation to the Joint Parliamentary Portfolio Committees on Media, Information and Broadcasting Services, and Transport and Infrastructural Development at the New Parliament Building in Mt Hampden this Monday saw ZBC and ZINARA proving their technical capacity to deliver solutions that enhance efficiency.\nTen Ten Technologies\u2019 CEO Mr Charles Wekete said, \u201cIndeed, as we demonstrated in our presentation, we confirmed that it\u2019s technically feasible. The question we were asked to address was whether it\u2019s possible to have a single licensed disc that covers vehicle licensing, insurance, and radio licensing. Our answer was unequivocally yes; it\u2019s entirely possible from a technical standpoint.\n\u201cWe also discussed the importance of security features. Regarding the concern about individuals printing licensed discs at home, we clarified that the display of licensed discs on vehicle windshields is regulated by existing laws. As technical partners, it\u2019s not our role to advocate for changes to these regulations. Instead, it\u2019s up to the relevant authorities, including government agencies, to determine whether they wish to revise or repeal these laws and permit individuals to print their licensed discs at home.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we come together and integrate our systems,\u00a0it will also be less costly in terms of the administration of things,\u00a0because we will be having a lot of automation taking place in the background,\u00a0saving us from printing a lot of discs and all the other expenses associated with the operations in silos.\u00a0\u00a0So we are breaking the silo mentality and cooperating, which is something that we have shown through the meeting\u00a0that it\u2019s possible to work together,\u201d ZBC\u2019s Acting CEO Engineer Tapiwa Mudzamba said.\nZBC Head of Licensing Mr Wisdom Samanyai and Chairpersons of both Parliamentary Portfolio Committees threw their full support behind the vision, emphasising the importance of enhancing efficiency for motorists.\n\u201cWe are pleased that all three parties, including our vendor, are on the same page. We have even outlined the timelines involved. The question was if this proposal is approved tomorrow, when can we expect implementation to begin? We were able to provide a detailed explanation of the technical arrangements and other behind-the-scenes efforts already underway to ensure a smooth rollout,\u201d Mr Samanyai said.",

            "content": "Story by Tapiwa Machemedze\nA total of 17 health institutions in Mount Darwin have received resources from Senator Dr James Makamba\u2019s health facilities initiative, aimed at complementing government efforts.\nOn Saturday, seven clinics in the area became the latest beneficiaries of donations from Senator Makamba, which included consumables and cash worth nearly US$20 000.\nThe initiative, launched on the first of January this year, aims to support 28 health institutions in the senatorial constituency. Stakeholders, including traditional leaders, government officials, war veterans, and ruling party members, commended the efforts, emphasising the importance of community contributions to development.\n\u201cI encourage us to unite and join hands with our President in this program being done by our Senator. He is doing a good programme and this job is going on well. What is being done encourages unity of purpose, self-reliance is what is required. For example, if a roofing sheet is damaged on our roof, let us repair it while we wait for government interventions,\u201d Mount Darwin War Veterans Chairman, Cde Andrew Chikukwa said.\n\u201cI am very happy we have been visited by our Senator, we feel very happy we have development in the area. We have our ruling party which raised us so I am happy that we are developing,\u201d Chief Madziwa added.\n\u201cThis programme being carried out by our senator is very good for the district. He is helping our clinics and the community so that areas get what they need. He is leaving money and consumables which is supporting the government\u2019s mandate. He is reminding people that a country is built by its people,\u201d Mt Darwin District Development Coordinator Mr White Nkoma weighed in.",

As the nation journeys towards Vision 2030, it is important to appreciate and understand the constitutional obligations particularly Section 61 and Section 62 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe,\u201d Dr Muswere said.\n\u201cSection 61 of the Constitution is clear in terms of the freedom of expression and the freedom of media and Section 62, also speaks to access to information. We should also be very clear in terms of the supreme law of the country, the right to broadcast the overthrowing of a legitimate and democratic government does not exist in our Constitution. The media freedom, the freedom of expression that we have should always be guarded jealously and we should always protect our journalists.\u201d\nMinister Muswere also said the Zimbabwe Media Commission and the Ministry will continue to work together with members of the fourth estate to give direction for the nation\u2019s development as witnessed by the opening up of airwaves.",
