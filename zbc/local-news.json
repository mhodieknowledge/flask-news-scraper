Previously we could not get into business, but now we have support even to go to the banks and access loans.\u201d\nThe transformation of Small to Medium Scale Enterprises has presented Zimbabwe with an opportunity for job creation and economic growth.\n\u201cWe have been growing over the years and now we proudly see our business supporting economic growth. We currently employ over 100 and have been heavily involved in key infrastructure projects. This is all because government has implemented sound policies that support local business,\u201d Evergreen Construction\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mrs Verity Bosha said.\nTheir stories bear testimony to a new chapter for indigenous business people, who previously faced significant constraints under colonial rule, operating within a system that favoured European settlers and often restricted opportunities for African entrepreneurs.\nRewind 45 years, only a sizeable number of indigenous entrepreneurs established businesses among them, the late Roger Boka, Paul Matambanadzo, Philimon Machipisa and Myles Chanakira.\nTo date, many businesses in Zimbabwe are being driven by the SMEs sector, with official figures showing the industry is contributing 60 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.",
