            "content": "\nStory by Tamuka Charakupa\nTHERE is a growing call for a multi-sectoral approach to address the negative effects of climate change, with the Church pledging its full support for this initiative.\nThe Roman Catholic Church in Chinhoyi recently joined the fight against climate change, emphasising the need for a comprehensive societal effort to protect the environment.\nAs part of this commitment, the church launched a tree-planting initiative aimed at promoting environmental sustainability.\n\u201cWe have organised this event to share among church followers, particularly students, the importance of environmental conservation,\u201d Priest, Father Peter Paul said.\n\u201cPope Francis in his encyclical letter clearly states that climate change is a serious moral issue, driven by human activity, and demands urgent action to protect the Earth and its most vulnerable inhabitants. He has consistently called for global leaders to take concrete steps to address climate change, criticising irresponsible lifestyles while prioritising the needs of the poor in the fight against environmental degradation.\n\u201cAs young people, we have the mandate to protect our environment through engaging in actions that do not contribute towards climate change. We should plant more trees and avoid littering the environment.\n\u201cNature provides solutions to our daily needs be it food, medicine, ecosystem, etc and without proper and safe practices we are on the verge of destroying everything including humanity.\u201d\nMakonde District Forestry Officer Mr Wisdom Nduku revealed the district has surpassed its 5 000 indigenous tree planting target.",
