            "content": "Story by Tichaona Kurewa\nZIMBABWE has officially launched its National Energy Efficiency Policy, aimed at optimising the use of existing energy resources, minimising waste and promoting sustainable practices across the economy.\nThe policy was unveiled this Wednesday by Vice President, General (Retired) Dr Constantino Chiwenga during the Sixth International Renewable Energy Conference and Expo in Victoria Falls.\nThis policy is designed to strengthen Zimbabwe\u2019s transition to green energy while complementing various incentives aimed at attracting private sector investment in the renewable energy sector.\n\u201cThis policy seeks to optimise the use of our existing energy resources, reduce waste, and promote sustainable practices across our economy. Additionally, private sector-driven projects, such as Captive Power Plants, are already underway. These projects are expected to significantly reduce load shedding soon, contributing to a more reliable energy supply for all Zimbabweans,\u201d the Vice President said.\n\u201cIt is crucial to note that the production of coke generates an important by-product known as coke oven gas. However, as a country, we have not yet fully optimised this resource. Currently, coke oven gas is flared into the atmosphere, causing negative environmental impacts.\n\u201cAs a government, we see this as an opportunity to strategically invest in the conversion of waste gas into fuel for power generation. This would allow self-supply, with any excess being supplied to the national grid. Furthermore, there are opportunities to use the gas for boiler flame support in existing thermal power stations located near coke operations,\u201d he added.\nPrivate renewable energy players are optimistic about the potential impact of the new policy.",
