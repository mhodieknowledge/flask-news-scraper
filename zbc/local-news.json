For NRZ, we are supporting it to source a credit from outside to fix the railway line, get more rolling stock and to fix the signaling system. So we are close to concluding a deal for an external credit line. l think we will see some progress during 2025 so that we can get some of the heavy trucks off the roads. We need to shift all that cargo to the railway infrastructure and this can be done commercially and profitably so that we can be able to service the loan.\u201d",
