            "content": "Story \u00a0by Tichaona Kurewa\nTHE desiltation\u00a0of Chidobe Dam in Hwange\u00a0District is making a tangible difference, with the reservoir now providing a lifeline for the community and other surrounding areas.\nFor years, Chidobe Dam suffered from severe siltation, drastically reducing its capacity, and leaving local communities vulnerable to acute water shortages, particularly during the dry season.\nHowever, a collaborative effort spearheaded by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) under its Climate Adaptation and Protected Areas Initiative, in partnership with local authorities, the community, and other development partners, has revitalised the reservoir.\nThis offers a crucial lifeline to the community and in the attainment of national and international development targets such as Vision 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\u201cWe are grateful for the partners that come to our rescue, water has been a challenge in this community but now we can do various horticulture projects, that can earn us money to survive,\u201d a community member said.\n\u201cIt is a blessing to us youths, we can now do various projects such as horticulture taking us away from vices such as drug abuse and prostitution,\u201d another community member said.\nProject partners, traditional leaders, and local authorities are equally optimistic about the project\u2019s\u00a0transformative impact.\n\u201cWe thank WWF and its partners for assisting our community in rehabilitating our dam and our springs, it took us years trying to rehabilitate the source but we faced many challenges in the process, the rehabilitation will alleviate water challenges, especially for our livestock, we can now venture into fisheries and other income generating projects that will uplift our community livelihoods,\u201d Acting Chief Mvuthu, Mr Bishop Mathatha Sibanda said.\n\u201cBefore we struggled, our livestock suffered, and we had to travel long distances for water. Now, with the dam full, our animals are healthy, and we have water for our gardens. This is a blessing,\u201d Hwange RDC Ward 2, Councillor Bonginkosi Moyo said.\n\u201cFellow residents this is your project that WWF and other partners are bringing to our community, let us protect and preserve our dam and our natural resource, as the Hwange Rural district council and the traditional leadership we pledge to allocate land that will be used for income generating projects like gardens, beekeeping, and others that will assist the community to raise capital to assist in paying school fees for less privileged children of our community and also keep our youths busy and keep away from drug and substance abuse,\u201d CEO of Hwange RDC, Mr Pindile Ncube said.\n\u201cWe have largely been working in protected areas but as time moved we also realised that communities are an integral part of conservation. You can\u2019t do conservation without considering communities,\u201d WWF Country Director, Mr Itayi Chibaya said.\n\u201cAs you are aware, over recent years, rainfall has declined by 40%, and our dams are being filled with silt while also drying up. But these dams also bring a number of challenges because communities rely on them for their livelihoods.",

Ladies and gentlemen, I applaud the expert facilitation team for excellent presentations and mentorship, facilitating active discussions, the positive and careful preparations of presentations made for effective learning and participation for all.\n\u201cI can safely conclude that the purpose of the Civilian Foundation cause has been completely accomplished. Once again, congratulations. Well done.

We can see there\u2019s violence in DRC, and in Mozambique, so peace support operations are very crucial. This course is going to capacitate us with the knowledge that we get posted to various missions across Africa and across SADC. We will be able to deliver on our mandate,\u201d Zimbabwe\u2019s graduand at the ceremony, Elvis George Hove said.",
