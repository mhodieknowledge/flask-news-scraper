This is why we have come up with a funding model to the tune of US$300 million which will be used to support GBV awareness programmes in Zimbabwe,\u201d said European Union Ambassador, Jobst von Kirchmann.\nGovernment has implemented various strategies to ending gender-based violence, including stringent legislation such as the Marriage Act of 2022 which outlawed the exploitation of children through early marriages.\n\u201cEnding gender-based violence is top priority for government. We continue to work in communities to raise awareness against domestic violence while also amplifying that cases are reported through one stop centres,\u201d said the Minister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa.",
