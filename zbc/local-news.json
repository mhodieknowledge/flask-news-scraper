This is a good initiative, and we are happy with this initiative,\u201d a community member said.\n\nAnother said, \u201cLet\u2019s not mock survivors. Let\u2019s believe in them. If we believe in them, then we will adopt comprehensive and inclusive approaches that tackle root causes.\u201d\n\nMidlands Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Honourable Owen Ncube highlighted steps being taken by the government to address the worrisome trajectory trend.\n",

            "content": "Story by Mhlomuli Ncube\n\nTraditional leaders in Binga have received fishing rigs under a Presidential scheme which has also benefitted women and youths in the district.\n\nEmpowering communities is a key priority in the Second Republic. In Binga, where the Zambezi River is a critical source of livelihoods, government has been supporting communities who survive on fishing by availing fishing rigs.\n\nBeneficiaries told the ZBC News, \u201cWe want to thank government for continuing to enable empowerment in Binga. This is an important initiative for us here who have always been fishing for a living. We recognise the importance attached by government and our President to empowering Binga people.\u201d\n\nThe capacitation of communities is an important part of government\u2019s drive towards an upper middle-income economy by 2030.\n\nMatabeleland North Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Hon Richard Moyo said, \u201cThis is a timely intervention by the 2nd Republic under the able leadership of His Excellency, the President E.D. Mnangagwa meant to improve household income levels and general livelihoods for economic benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a critical drive to empower young people also.

            "content": "Story by Memory Chamisa\n\nAdequate funding has been noted as critical for an effective aid response to prevent and address the impact of violence and discrimination against women and girls.\n\nDevelopment Partners have played a pivotal role in ensuring the Gender Based Violence (GBV) Response Fund is able to provide much needed support for communities greatly affected while also serving as one of the largest donors and active partners in ensuring the protection of beneficiaries.\n\nThis emerged at the GBV roundtable meeting held in Harare aimed at addressing the urgent issue of gender base violence-response funding.\n\nFrench Ambassador to Zimbabwe, His Excellency Paul Bertrand-Barets said, \u201cThe committed resources will ensure that identified gaps are adequately addressed and ensuring the continued work of community-based organisations. Together, the GBVF Response Fund and Team EU aim to enhance prevention, protection, and support mechanisms for those affected by GBVF.\u201d\n\nA UNFPA representative also noted, \u201cThe UNFPA together with its agencies are committed to combatting GBV and fostering safer, more resilient communities. By working together, we strive to create lasting change and empower survivors while addressing the root causes of GBV.\u201d\n\nMinister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa acknowledged the support of development partners as instrumental in enabling the fund to offer crucial assistance to communities impacted by GBV.\n\n\u201cSustainable funding solutions are therefore critical, equipping these institutions with the necessary resources to provide high-quality support to survivors. The needs of those institutions range from stationery, food provisions, hospital equipment and supplies, operational costs, allowances and salaries for GBV specialized services (counselling and legal aid) dedicated staff to provide administrative and security duties as well as continuous training of staff. There is also need for income-generating projects at the safe shelters and infrastructure maintenance and development where new institutions need to be set up. We cannot sit on our laps but rather dream big to consider even setting up more institutions to cover all provinces and districts of the country considering that the available institutions are not able to meet the growing demand while at the same time, they have to be within reach of those in need,\u201d she said.\n",
