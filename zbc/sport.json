            "content": "Story by Lawrence Trusida, Sports Editor\nTHE devolution of the country\u2019s independence celebrations has seen the sport sector being one of the major beneficiaries, with stadia being built in different communities.\nFor decades, Zimbabwe\u2019s Independence Day celebrations were a centralised affair, mostly held in Harare.\nIn recent years however, a quiet transformation has taken place.\nThanks to the government\u2019s push for devolution, national celebrations are no longer confined to the capital, as they are now rotating across provinces and with them comes real, tangible investment in rural infrastructure.\nOne unexpected winner in this shift is the country\u2019s sports sector.\nIn 2022, government officially began decentralising the hosting of National Independence celebrations, aligning with its constitutional mandate to promote equitable development.\nWhat may have looked like a symbolic gesture has turned into a practical development tool, especially when it comes to sports.\nIn 2023, government renovated the once dusty Pfura Stadium in Mt Darwin, putting in a lush green lawn, changing rooms, water and other amenities needed for a sports field.\nThe stadium is now host to Northern Region Division One outfit, Agama United.\nThe same happened last year in Manicaland Province where government went even further to construct terraces at Murambinda B field, which is now home to Deportivo la Murambinda which competes in the Eastern Region Division One league.\nCurrently, work is being done in Gokwe North where another community stadium is getting a facelift.\nThese facilities are not just for one day, they become permanent homes for local clubs, schools, and community leagues.\nMore infrastructure means more access, especially in rural areas where sport is often an afterthought in budgets, hence a new stadium changes the equation.\nYoung athletes now have proper grounds to train, compete, and dream.Local tournaments are no longer played on uneven, dusty fields but on manicured pitches.\nThere\u2019s a cultural shift happening too, when rural communities host the nation\u2019s biggest day, it brings a sense of inclusion and pride.",
