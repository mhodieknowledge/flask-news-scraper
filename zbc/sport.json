This is a fest that we should all strive to follow and build our country,\u201d said the Deputy Minister.\nHoops 4 Hope Founder, Mark Crandal who worked closely with Mukukula on various programmes flew from New York, United States to pay his last respects.\nHe said, \u201cYou are mourning and I can tell you that you are not alone the whole of Africa and the world over are mourning the loss of Ngoni. 30 years ago, I met him and he only wanted to make sure that all the kids have access to play basketball and he also made sure they have equipment. He changed the face of basketball in Zimbabwe.\u201d\nMukukula played a stellar role in the development of basketball in the country especially in high-density suburbs.",

Our athletes need to be exposed to international competitions from young ones to the most senior athletes. They should be able to attend, meet, and compete with the best and prepare for major tournaments. So that one area we are working on this year is a sustainable sports fund to support athletes all year round and in their development processes.\u201d\nGovernment in partnership with National Sport Associations is also embarking on an extensive talent identification programme.",
