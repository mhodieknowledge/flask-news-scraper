            "content": "Story by Anashe Murombedzi, Sports Reporter\nHIGHLANDERS Football Club has been given a lifeline after the world football governing body, FIFA, lifted a ban that restricted the club from registering new players.\nThe ban was imposed after the club failed to pay former coaches Baltemar Brito and Antonio Torres, who were owed around US$27 000.\nFollowing the intervention of businessman Wicknell Chivayo, who paid off the debt, FIFA lifted the ban this Tuesday.\nThe ban prevented the Bulawayo giants from registering new players, severely impacting the club that lost some key players during the off-season.\nHighlanders coach Kelvin Kaindu has already identified potential new signings, including striker Never Rauzhi who was on loan in the second half of last season, defender Malvern Hativagoni, winger Tendai Muvuti, as well as midfielders Hubert Ncube and Mafious Chiweta.\nThe new players could be part of the squad for the upcoming match against Green Fuel this Saturday.\nThe lifting of the transfer ban is a major boost for Highlanders, who have been struggling with a depleted squad.\nThe club was only able to pick from 18 players for their last two matches, but can now strengthen their team ahead of the transfer window closing on the 31st of March.\nIn contrast, Yadah FC is still reeling from FIFA sanctions after failing to honour contracts with three former players.",

We are working with ZIFA, CAF and FIFA and we are expecting them soon to come, they have already given us guidance on what we are doing now so very soon we should he hearing from them again,\u201d Minister Coventry said.\nThe refurbishment of the stadium is a joint effort between the government and Sakunda Holdings that has purchased the bucket seats, while the government is taking care of the rest of the areas.\n\u201cThe delays were basically due to the slow release of funds from treasury but they have always communicated when there were delays and we are now moving smoothly and we do not anticipate any hiccups,\u201d Minister Coventry said.\nEngineer Nicholas Mutengu, who is leading the refurbishment gave an update on the scope of works.\n\u201cWe are working on the turnstiles, bucket seats, water reticulation for the stadium and the ablution facilities, we are also working on the lights, we are removing the ones here and putting in LEDs that save power and we are also installing back-up generators for the facility,\u201d he said.",
