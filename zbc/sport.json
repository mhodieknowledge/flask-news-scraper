            "content": "Story by Lawrence Trusida, Sports Editor\nTHE Battle of the Cities has for so long been a platform for beautiful football, with the clash between Highlanders and CAPS United erupting at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday.\nNever mind the two teams\u2019 waning fortunes in recent years, the match is still one of the most anticipated in the land and never disappoints.\nThe clash produces heroes and villains and over the years, it has written many memories in the minds of spectators.\nThe back-to-back league clashes of 2004 stand out when the two teams played an exciting three-all draw at Barbourfields before Bosso edged Makepekepe 4-3 at the National Sports Stadium in the reverse encounter.\nEven though the Green Machine went on to win the league that year, on the fateful day, Tapuwa Kapini was the hero while Witness Munkuli was the villain.\nMany such encounters have happened over the years and this Sunday more of the same is expected as the two age-old giants clash, even though they seem to be fading, they usually save the best when they meet.",

We had a lot of challenges and many times it would then demotivate us as players, but with this development, we are looking forward to exciting times,\u201d Tenax Player, Jambo Joseph Tatenda said.\n\u201cThe coming in of Pacific Storm as a sponsor has motivated us a lot as players. For me, it is been six years playing in ERSL and we did not have a sponsor, now all teams will put in more effort and for players, we now know that in the end, if you play well, definitely there will be rewards,\u201d Wangu Mazodze Captain, Lucky Itimu said.\nThe League\u2019s Chairperson, Wisdom Simba and ZIFA Chief Executive Officer, Yvonne Mapika Manwa concurred that the deal will go a long way in improving competition in the league.\n\u201cThis is a huge step for us as the Eastern Region Soccer League and the deal will focus, beyond the core package, on branding and marketing of the league. This will also motivate our players because now they know we have a sponsor. In terms of value, currently, I am not able to share the exact details of its worth but we are happy as the executive,\u201d Simba said.\n\u201cThis partnership is a testament of what ERSL is doing as a league and it is also a reflection of what the ZIFA itself is, I think more than anything we appreciate that Pacific Storm has come in as a pioneer to sponsor this league. This is a partnership where we as the football industry are bringing in something to the corporate world while they are also bringing something very important for us,\u201d Mapika Manwa said.",
