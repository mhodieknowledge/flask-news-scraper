Since the formation of the games, we have seen strides in the transfer of ideas to improve the education sector,\u201d ANTUSA President, Mkhuseli Dube stated.\nANTUSA leaders also believe the games act as a unifier in the region as they are held on a rotational basis.\n\u201cThe union was formed in Zambia so we represent a bigger population. We have benefitted from these games as we use them to learn how other sister countries are doing it to improve the games,\u201d Basic Education Teachers Union of Zambia\u2019s President, Binstone Tembo said.",
