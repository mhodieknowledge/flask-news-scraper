The second half is not acceptable.\n\u201cIt is a massive game on Wednesday, but we have to use today to be ready and beat PSG on Wednesday.\u201d\nBournemouth move up to eighth in the table, which could be enough for European football next season, with 53 points, while Arsenal, who have just two league wins from six games, stay second with 67 points, three points above third-placed Manchester City.\n\u201cFirst of all we knew that we have never got a point here and that motivated us more. We\u2019re a team that always give our all,\u201d Huijsen told Sky Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important three points for us.\u201d\nAt Villa Park, Belgian midfielder Youri Tielemans headed home John McGinn\u2019s 12th-minute corner.",
