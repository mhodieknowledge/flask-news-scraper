            "content": "MIKEL Arteta admitted Arsenal have to get their \u201cenergy\u201d back for the Champions League showdown with Paris Saint-Germain after a lacklustre 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace left Liverpool on the brink of winning the Premier League.\nArteta\u2019s sidewere hopingto warm up for their first Champions League semi-final appearance since 2009 with a victory over Palace at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.\nBut Jakub Kiwior\u2019s third-minute header for the Gunners was cancelled out by Eberechi Eze\u2019s volley in the 27th minute.\nLeandro Trossard\u2019s strike put Arsenal back in front three minutes before half-time, only for Palace substitute Jean-Philippe Mateta to loft a brilliant lob over out-of-position keeper David Raya in the 83rd minute.\nSecond-placed Arsenal are 12 points adrift of Liverpool, and with only four matches left for the north Londoners, Arne Slot\u2019s team will seal the title if they avoid defeat against Tottenham at Anfield on Sunday.\nTheir title hopes effectively over several weeks ago, Arsenal were already focused on winning the Champions League for the first time.\nBut the sloppy display against Palace was hardly ideal preparation for the showdown with French champions PSG, who have eliminated Liverpool and Aston Villa en route to the last four.\n\u201cWe are disappointed with the result and performance. We didn\u2019t find enoughconsistency in actionsto dominate the game,\u201d Arteta said.\n\u201cIn many aspects, we should have done better. Palace were very organised and deserved credit but we dropped our standards.\n\u201cWe struggled to find consistency. We gave the ball away in simple ways and we were late in everything we did. We have to do much better.\u201d\nAdding to Arteta\u2019s concerns is an injury to Mikel Merino that gave the Spaniard out of the Palace game and could sideline him against PSG.",

We always struggled as an organisation to get sponsorship just to fund Olympic participation, but what I saw were eye-opening approaches primarily around tourism.\n\u201cYou create synergies and I intend to pursue more engagement with the tourism sector. We have a lot of national parks, breathtaking scenery and that can be showcased through the Olympics. The world is watching, and that\u2019s a major advertising opportunity,\u201d Mapondera said.\nMapondera served just one term on the ZOC board and before that he also led the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association for a single term.\nSeven candidates are vying for the two vice-president positions including former ZIFA Spokesperson Xolisani Gwesela, media practitioner Merit Munzwembiri and volleyball administrator Fredrick Ndlovu.",
