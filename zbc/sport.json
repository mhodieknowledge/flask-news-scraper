The church has adopted the programme of the Walkathon to celebrate the lifestyle, and we take Baba Guti as our role model. It is also important for the youth as it keeps them busy from drugs, substance abuse and cyberbullying,\u201d ZAOGA FIF\u2019s Presiding Bishop Dr Joseph Guti said.\n\u201cThe youth have come in their numbers to partake in activities that prolong their lives. These are initiatives the youth must value and adopt to emulate the century that Baba was alive for,\u201d Professor Euna Guti added.",
