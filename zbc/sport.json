            "content": "LIVERPOOL will have to wait for a few more days to be crowned Premier League champions despite a 1-0 victory at Leicester City after Arsenal kept their slender hopes just about alive with a 4-0 romp at 10-man Ipswich Town on Sunday.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold came off the bench to score Liverpool\u2019s winner in the 76th minute at the King Power Stadium to restore their 13-point lead at the top with five games left.\nWhile Liverpool can almost taste a record-equalling 20th English crown, Leicester\u2019s defeat confirmed their relegation back to the Championship after just one season.\nThe Midlands club have now been relegated from England\u2019s top flight a record 13 times.\nChelsea secured a massive win in their bid to qualify for the Champions League as they came from behind to beat Fulham 2-1 at Craven Cottage with Pedro Neto scoring in stoppage time.\nThe win pushed Chelsea above Nottingham Forest in to fifth place, the last spot for qualification to the Champions League, although Forest play at Tottenham Hotspur on Monday.\nChelsea have 57 points from 33 games, two behind third-placed Newcastle United and one behind Manchester City. Forest and Aston Villa are level with Chelsea on 57 points.\nWolverhampton Wanderers guaranteed their safety as they beat Manchester United 1-0 at Old Trafford. Pablo Sarabia\u2019s stunning free kick wrapped up a fifth successive league win, the first time Wolves have achieved that in the top flight since 1970.\nLiverpool were wasteful at Leicester with numerous chances going begging and Mohamed Salah suffering a frustrating afternoon including hitting both posts with an early shot.\nSalah hit the woodwork again moments before the ball came out to Alexander-Arnold who fired a left-footed shot through the crowd to give his side the points \u2014 ripping off his shirt and celebrating wildly with the travelling fans.\n\u201cWe just keep going, mentally we\u2019re really strong,\u201d manager Arne Slot, whose side could be crowned champions if Arsenal lose at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday, told Sky Sports.\u201cThey enjoy playing football and it helps when you are playing for something special. Today (Alexander-Arnold) knows when it matters most he can just bring a bit more which is something all the top, top players have.\u201d\nDISTANT SECOND\nIf Arsenal avoid defeat by Palace, Slot\u2019s side will seal the title if they beat Tottenham Hotspur at home next Sunday.\n\u201cWe will focus on Tottenham and looking forward again to a home game and I think the stadium will be full,\u201d Slot, who can become the first Dutch manager to win the English title, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice game to look forward to.\u201d\nLiverpool have 79 points with Arsenal a distant second on 66. Arsenal may have their eyes now on a Champions League semi-final against Paris St Germain, but they showed against Ipswich they will not hand over the title to Liverpool.\nLeandro Trossard opened the scoring early on and Gabriel Martinelli made it 2-0 after a delightful flick by Mikel Merino.Ipswich were reduced to 10 men before halftime as Leif Davis crudely raked his studs down the back of Bukayo Saka\u2019s calf and the second half was academic.\nTrossard grabbed his second in the 69th minute and Ethan Nwaneri added a late fourth to leave Ipswich stuck in 18th place on 21 points. They will be relegated if they drop points again or 17th-placed West Ham United pick up one more point from their remaining five games.\nChelsea were heading for a damaging defeat at neighbours Fulham as the hosts led with Alex Iwobi\u2019s 20th-minute goal.",
