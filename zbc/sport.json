            "content": "Story by Mthokozisi Dube\nTHE Zimbabwe senior men\u2019s football team, the Warriors, are hoping to carry their second-half fine performance to their next assignment after a frustrating two-all share of spoils with Benin in South Africa this Thursday.\nThe odds were against the Warriors heading into the block buster encounter against Benin, as they were facing a side oozing with confidence in the World Cup qualifiers.\nIt was no fluke that Benin meant business as they managed to secure two early goals which unsettled the Warriors.\nThe Warriors managed to redeem themselves in the second half, but overturning the first-half deficit remained a pipe dream as they settled for a share of spoils.\nReturning former skipper Knowledge Musona justified his inclusion as he was on target to ensure the Warriors secured a point.\nDespite dropping two vital points to bring back their World Cup qualification hopes, Warriors head coach Michael Nees is refusing to throw in the towel, rallying his charges for the next match away to Nigeria on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe had a lot of thoughts and emotions on today\u2019s game. I really would want to thank our fans for the carnival atmosphere, very good crowd. We could not have come back if we had no crowd. We really appreciate. Of course we wanted a better result but the opponent was strong. We did not start well but we had a better second half. We wanted to win, we tried everything and hopefully we will build on this in our next game,\u201d Nees said.",
