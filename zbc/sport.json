            "content": "\nWest Ham are considering whether to sack Julen Lopetegui and have held talks with Graham Potter about possibly replacing the Spaniard.\nHammers sources have denied Lopetegui has already been dismissed but accept the former Real Madrid and Spain coach is under huge pressure.\nLopetegui, 58, was on the brink of being sacked prior to last month\u2019s home game with Wolves. But victory in that match triggered a four-game unbeaten run, West Ham\u2019s best of the season.\nHowever, a humiliating 5-0 home defeat by Liverpool was followed by a 4-1 loss at Manchester City to leave West Ham 14th in the table, seven points above the relegation zone.\nWest Ham\u2019s technical director Tim Steidten has been pictured talking to former Chelsea and Brighton boss Potter, who has previously been linked with the Hammers job.\nThe photograph has been circulated on social media. Sources have said it is a recent picture but this has not been independently verified.\nLopetegui was brought to West Ham in the summer to succeed David Moyes, who left at the end of his contract. However, the former Wolves boss has not been able to improve either the team\u2019s performance or style, for which Moyes was heavily criticised.\nFormer Ostersund and Swansea boss Potter has not held a managerial role since he was sacked after less than seven months in charge of Chelsea in April 2023.\nPotter, who had been linked with succeeding Sir Gareth Southgate as England boss, said he was\u00a0\u201cready\u201d to return to club management\u00a0in September.",
