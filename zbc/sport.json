I am in pain. I regarded him as a brother,\u201d said Genius Mutungamiri.",

            "content": "Story by Mthokozisi Dube\nTHE Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) has suspended three referees for poor officiating.\nReferees Lloyd Mapanje and Grace Gimo, alongside assistant referee Claris Simango, will each be suspended for four matches.\nIn a statement, ZIFA said Mapanje and Simango could not meet expected standards when they officiated a match between Dynamos and Yadah on the 19th of June, while Gimo\u2019s performance during the Green Fuel and TelOne match played on June 14 was judged to be below expected standards.\nZIFA has emphasised the critical role that match officials play in maintaining the credibility of the game, hence the association\u2019s continuous monitoring of their performance.\nMeanwhile, Premier Soccer League action enters Week 19 this weekend, with log leaders MWOS involved in a tricky home tie against Bikita Minerals on Saturday.\nAfter shooting back to the top, the debutants believe pole position comes with a lot of pressure, noting the need for the team to remain focused.\n\u201cIt is good to be back on top. Our next assignment is not an easy game, but we will prepare. My boys should keep their heads down, keep focused. Our target remains to survive relegation. We can talk about the race after the 40-mark point,\u201d said Mutasa.\nMatch Day 19 action begins with Green Fuel hosting Ngezi Platinum in Chisumbanje on Saturday.\nOn the same day, Chicken Inn play Yadah at Luveve, Manica Diamonds entertain FC Platinum at Sakubva, Simba Bhora date ZPC Kariba at Wadzanayi, and Dynamos lock horns with Herentals.\nOn Sunday, Triangle host TelOne at Gibbo, as Scottland and CAPS United face off at the ceremonial home of football, Rufaro.\nThe game between Kwekwe United and Highlanders, set for Bata Stadium, concludes Match Day 19 fixtures.\nThe match comes at a time the Bulawayo giants have re-appointed committee member Kindman Ndlovu as Acting Chief Executive Officer until further notice.",
