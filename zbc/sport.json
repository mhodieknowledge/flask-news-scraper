We are pleased as officials to have gained clarity on recent changes,\u201d said one of the participants.\nThe laws of the game are revised annually, with changes taking effect from July 1.\n\u201cOne notable amendment concerns goalkeepers delaying play. Previously, if a goalkeeper delayed for more than eight seconds, it would result in an indirect free kick. However, the new ruling stipulates that it will now result in a corner kick. It is essential that our officials are fully conversant with such updates,\u201d course facilitator, Brighton Nyika explained.",
