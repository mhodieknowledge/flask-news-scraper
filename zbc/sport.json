He is now eligible to officiate at AFCON and CHAN tournaments effectively he can now take charge of any international match but for logistics sake, CAF just limits them to officiating in Africa.\u201d\nThe four-time referee of the year\u2019s elevation, however, comes a little bit late as the list of officials set to take charge at the upcoming CHAN tournament has already been released.",

Our athletes need to be exposed to international competitions from young ones to the most senior athletes. They should be able to attend, meet, and compete with the best and prepare for major tournaments. So that one area we are working on this year is a sustainable sports fund to support athletes all year round and in their development processes.\u201d\nGovernment in partnership with National Sport Associations is also embarking on an extensive talent identification programme.",
