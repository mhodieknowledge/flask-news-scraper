And then we returned, I think we did a great job,\u201d Amorim told Sky Sports.\n\u201cI think if you look at all the games, I think we were the best team but they were more clinical. We lost the game but the fight from the lads was really important for me. Overall, it was a good match but there\u2019s no taste in that. We didn\u2019t win; we need to focus on the next game.\u201d\nAmorim, who took over from Erik ten Hag in November, said that 13th-placed United still had a long way to go before they could challenge for the Premier League title.",

Of you look at the letters it looks like it\u2019s the work of one person who hasn\u2019t done their homework well because some of the allegations have no standing while others have already been cleared of those things , its elections season so you can expect anything,\u201d he said.\nSome of the candidates vying for the ZIFA presidential seat include Marshal Gore of Team Zimbabwe UK, former Warriors captain Benjani Mwaruwari and PSL chairperson Farai Jere.",
