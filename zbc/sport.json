            "content": "Story by Lawrence Trusida, Sports Editor\nGovernment is on course to setting up a sports fund to support Zimbabwean athletes at international competitions.\nZimbabwean athletes have in some cases struggled to fulfill international commitments due to lack of funding.\nIn most cases, they have been restricted to just attending regional events which sometimes do not offer the best competition.\nThis is, however, set to change with government working on creating a sports fund to support athletes on international assignments.\nPermanent Secretary in the Ministry of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture Nicholas Moyo said, \u201cWe need to create a sustainable sports fund for mobility purposes. Our athletes need to be exposed to international competitions from young ones to the most senior athletes. They should be able to attend, meet, and compete with the best and prepare for major tournaments. So that one area we are working on this year is a sustainable sports fund to support athletes all year round and in their development processes.\u201d\nGovernment in partnership with National Sport Associations is also embarking on an extensive talent identification programme.",

But victory in that match triggered a four-game unbeaten run, West Ham\u2019s best of the season.\nHowever, a humiliating 5-0 home defeat by Liverpool was followed by a 4-1 loss at Manchester City to leave West Ham 14th in the table, seven points above the relegation zone.\nWest Ham\u2019s technical director Tim Steidten has been pictured talking to former Chelsea and Brighton boss Potter, who has previously been linked with the Hammers job.\nThe photograph has been circulated on social media. Sources have said it is a recent picture but this has not been independently verified.\nLopetegui was brought to West Ham in the summer to succeed David Moyes, who left at the end of his contract. However, the former Wolves boss has not been able to improve either the team\u2019s performance or style, for which Moyes was heavily criticised.\nFormer Ostersund and Swansea boss Potter has not held a managerial role since he was sacked after less than seven months in charge of Chelsea in April 2023.\nPotter, who had been linked with succeeding Sir Gareth Southgate as England boss, said he was\u00a0\u201cready\u201d to return to club management\u00a0in September.",
