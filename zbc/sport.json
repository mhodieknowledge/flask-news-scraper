I have been advising them that it is a normal game,\u201d Ndlovu said.\nMPOSA roped in Evans Neta who had a successful stint with the now defunct Bulawayo Queens as their head coach.\n\u201cWe respect Highlanders. They are a good side but we remain hopeful. We will come out with a positive result. We have had preparations to polish the side and the girls are raring to go,\u201d Neta said.",
