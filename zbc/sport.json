I want to appreciate and say, the vision is to start winning at the levels that we should be winning, we should be winning at the continental and world levels. We should be winning in the World Olympics,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, former Head of ZBC\u2019s Television Productions, Merit Munzwembiri was voted the second vice president of ZOC, serving alongside Fredrick Ndlovu, who was re-elected first vice president.\n\u201cI have been serving as a board member in the gender office.
