We want Zimbabwe to be back to where it was and producing big talents like the Flower brothers,\u201d Shah said.\nZimbabwe has hosted international events like the World Cup Qualifiers and co-hosted the 2003 World Cup, however, this is the first time the country is hosting the full ICC board meeting since attaining test status in 1992 and Zimbabwe Cricket views this as an endorsement of the country as a safe sporting destination.",

I have been advising them that it is a normal game,\u201d Ndlovu said.\nMPOSA roped in Evans Neta who had a successful stint with the now defunct Bulawayo Queens as their head coach.\n\u201cWe respect Highlanders. They are a good side but we remain hopeful. We will come out with a positive result. We have had preparations to polish the side and the girls are raring to go,\u201d Neta said.",
