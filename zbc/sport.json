            "content": "Story by Mthokozisi Dube\nHARARE giants, CAPS United are hoping to raise the bar when they clash with former champions and current log leaders, Ngezi Platinum at Rufaro stadium this Sunday.\nThe Green Machine are 14th on the log with four points from four matches, with one of the two defeats this season being inflicted by TelOne at Bata Stadium in Gweru.\nMadamburo are oozing with confidence, enjoying a purple patch which saw them collect maximum points over Triangle in their last outing to occupy pole position.\nThe two sides are separated by six points and CAPS United Assistant Coach, Tonderai Marime says Sunday\u2019s blockbuster game is a must-win for the Harare giants to restore lost pride.\n\u201cAfter the weekend\u2019s game, we sat and had an analysis of how we have played so far from the beginning of the season up to now. What we concluded was that we feel we are punching below our weight and of course, we are disappointed after the weekend\u2019s result. The result is not a true reflection of the game.\n\u201cI think we gave it our all. We got into very good positions to score and we did everything and the result does not match the performance of the team but this is CAPS United, expectations are always to perform and we are all aware of that,\u201d Marime said.\nOnce touted as the Cup Kings in the past, Harare giants, CAPS United have travelled the success path under different coaches with their most decorated campaign coming under Charles Mhlauri in 2004 they won the league with just one loss.\nLloyd Chitembwe also wrote the success story with the team in 2016 but he has had a fair share of challenging campaigns later on.\nMeanwhile, match-day five fixtures begin this Saturday with Manica Diamonds hosting Dynamos at Sakubva, while Chicken Inn will be hunting for a first win in a home clash with Herentals.",
