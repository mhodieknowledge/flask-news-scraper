            "content": "There was jubilation and a revisitation of an over three decades journey when ZPC Hwange celebrated its promotion to the Premier Soccer League at its Annual Awards Ceremony this Friday night in the coal mining town.\nStriker Israel Mukahanana was given the Player of the Year Award. Others who celebrated include Morgan \u201cOkocha\u201d Nyoni, who got Most Loyal Player after enduring many years at ZPC and Beloved Mutambisi, who was awarded Most Improved Player award.\nAdmire Banda was recognised asMost Consistent Player, with Gerald Choto walking away with the Most Disciplined Player accolade.\nBudding Brandon Nyathi managed to bag the team\u2019s Young Player of the Year Award as Justin Kaunda, who scored 14 goals, got theGolden Boot Award.\nFor excelling not only in the campaign for Premiership but at the Champion of Champons Tournament, Harmony Nare got the Goalkeepr of the Year and Golden Glove awards.\nJustin Kaundah again bagged the Supporters Player of the Year Award.\nBeyond the awards night, there was more to reflect on.\nIt was not only about players and the coaching staff being given accolades for a crown that finally came home after 34 years of trying, but a reflection of what the new entails.\nAn executive driven by a passionate chairman, Farai Mahachi, his deputy Ndabezinhle Ncube and club Patron ZPC Hwange Managing Director Shepard Mukundu never gave up on the dream to one day play top flight football.\nWhen the dream manifested, it was a moment to savour.\n\u201cWe are on cloud nine. We just want to thank the Almighty for achieving this. It has not been an easy feat, actually it has been years, more than three decades of trial and at times we would fall in the last minute, but one thing that I noticed is the need to strategise, and also, soccer is teamwork.\n\u201cAs the executive what we then arranged was to be closer to the team, but most importantly, the technical team, so after every match we would sacrifice a day where we would have a postmortem and share ideas on where we would have faltered and try and assist each other in terms of areas of improvement,\u201d said Mahachi.\nThe success recipe complemented by the humble yet strategic, ZPC coach Mebelo Njekwa, is choosing to be modesty in victory.\nAs always, the down-to-earth Njekwa still maintains his optimism. He plans to carry on with the formula that took him to glory in Division One and overcome the giants of the premiership.\nIn his own words, he said, \u201cIndeed it was a good season for us because of so many factors. The first one is teamwork. Wwe work together on the field of play as players and the technical on the bench. This spilt over into the executive and into our management. And for now I started rating this success at a time when we are celebrating Christmas.\u201d\nA beautiful Christmas moment it will be for a team whose hunger and thirst for success has seen its legion of fans continue to grow over the years.\nThe club\u2019s supporters are upbeat that while their counterparts, Chipangano, won\u2019t be playing top flight after relegation, all is not lost as ZPC will carry the banner.\nZPC Supporters chairman Hardlife Gutu is in an exuberant mood.",

And then we returned, I think we did a great job,\u201d Amorim told Sky Sports.\n\u201cI think if you look at all the games, I think we were the best team but they were more clinical. We lost the game but the fight from the lads was really important for me. Overall, it was a good match but there\u2019s no taste in that. We didn\u2019t win; we need to focus on the next game.\u201d\nAmorim, who took over from Erik ten Hag in November, said that 13th-placed United still had a long way to go before they could challenge for the Premier League title.",
