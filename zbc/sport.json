            "content": "Story by Kenias Chivuzhe\nMANICA Diamonds are seeking to continue their winning streak as they date FC Platinum in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League encounter at Mandava Stadium this Saturday.\nFor the first time in three seasons, the Gem Boys managed to win their first match of the season after overcoming Yadah one-nil at Sakubva Stadium last week.\nThe arrival of Ghanaian attacker, Emmanuel Paga and winger Issa Sadiki from Dynamos, and the duo of Ransom Pavari and Lawrence Mhlanga from FC Platinum has given the Gems Boys hope.\n\u201cThe win against Yadah FC is giving us more energy to continue producing positive results. We have a setback where Liberty Masvaure had a fracture while Ransom Pavari has an angle injury. We have players to fill up the positions as we aim for a win.\n\u201cOur team is very strong in defense as we have our goalkeeper Tedious Baye, and defenders who include Lawrence Mhlanga, Farai Banda, Ask Rupande, Chipo Tsodzo among others. In the past two seasons, we were failing to win the first game of the season but this time around we have managed to win. This gives us hope to have a good season as we aim to be champions. We ended last season on number four and we want to improve from that position to finish on number one or two,\u201d Manica Diamonds Head Coach, Jairos Tapera said.\nThe Mutare-based outfit will miss the services of utility Rainsome Pavari who joined from FC Platinum this year, while defender Liberty Masvaure is also nursing a fracture.\nManica Diamond fans are optimistic of a good season but warned their team against complacency when they face FC Platinum.\n\u201cWe are happy with the team but there is need to improve on our attacking department. We need to score goals and we have a tough game with FC Platinum away. We need to play offensive football to win the match,\u201d a football supporter said.",
