The match became a tight contest in the second quarter, with Zimbabwe edging Namibia 22-21 at half-time.\nHowever, Namibia were rejuvenated in the second half, taking advantage of the tight margin to overthrow their opponents and take the lead. In a stunning turn of events, Namibia emerged victorious, winning 42-41.\nThe Gems\u2019 loss was compounded by Uganda\u2019s massive 85-34 win over Eswatini, which saw Uganda leapfrog Zimbabwe to top Pool B on goal average.\nAs a result, the Gems finished as Pool B runners-up.\nDespite the setback, the Gems still advanced to the semi-finals, where they will face Pool A winners South Africa. Uganda, meanwhile, will face Malawi in the other semi-final.\nCurrently ranked 13th in the world, the Gems are hoping to improve their rankings and qualify for the Africa Netball World Cup Qualifiers. Despite the narrow defeat to Namibia, the team remains optimistic about their chances of success in the tournament."

Other things are not yet decided but definitely we will have a women\u2019s team next season,\u201d he said.\nThe club will also be faced with venue challenges since Zimbabwe does not have a CAF approved stadium and will be hoping that works at the National Sports Stadium can be completed in time for their first match next year."

I\u2019m convinced that it will be one of the best facilities that can be used by athletes and can possibly host international games. It\u2019s still a work in progress, but with the work that they are doing, I\u2019m positive that the stadium will be of higher quality. This is also important for the private sector to complement government efforts because President Emmerson Mnangagwa has always said the country is open for business,\u201d she said.\nThe project is the brainchild of Kwekwe businessman, Sherperd Chahwanda in collaboration with Prophet Walter Magaya, who are targeting  to finish the project early next year.\n\u201cWe are humbled to receive high-ranking government officials at the construction site of the Chahwanda Stadium (Heart Main Arena). The support is invaluable, and we really appreciate it. I want to see the game growing in the country, and this is our small way to try and contribute positively to the development of the game in the country,\u201d said Chahwanda.\nThe stadium is being built with all Confederation of African Football (CAF) guidelines to ensure it meets all international standards."
