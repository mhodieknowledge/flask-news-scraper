            "content": "Story by Lawrence Trusida, Sports Editor\nSCOTTLAND returned to winning ways after edging Herentals one-nil in a low-key Harare Derby played at Rufaro Stadium this Thursday.\nThe Mabvuku-based side had endured a three-match winless streak, settling for draws in each fixture. However, they finally secured a hard-fought victory, albeit under pressure from a spirited Herentals outfit.\nHerentals were pumped up and wanted the victory and created clear cut chances in the first half, but Tino Benza was not at his best to utilise the opportunities.\nScottland quickly made the changes early in the second half which paid dividend after Tymon Machope found the back of the net in the 57th minute.\nThe goal sealed the points for Scottland even though Herentals got some chances later.\n\u201cGood display especially in the second half and we manged to get the goal and the victory after a spate of draws,\u201d Scottland coach Tonderai Ndiraya said.",

            "content": "Story by Kenias Chivuzhe\nRUGBY continues to grow in Manicaland province following years of disturbances especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith Mutare Sports Club having been the only recognised franchise in Manicaland Province before the COVID-19 era, a lot of interest generated during the past few years has widened the growth potential for the sport code which for a long time was considered an elitist sport.\nManicaland Rugby Board Chairperson, Mos Kaphuma spoke on the strides made in the province starting with the launch of the Senior Rugby League for men and women before the introduction of under-20 rugby tournaments last year.\n\u201cRugby is gradually developing in Manicaland and last year we started under 20 provincial leagues without any sponsorship. We are in our second edition and we managed to get sponsorship covering ambulance, medicals, referees\u2019 fees and price money at the end of the season,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have been trying to spread our net wide so that we help with the development of the game at the under-20 level. We are hoping to increase the number of teams next year. The senior league is starting on May 17 and it has both men and women. In the under-20 league, we have five boys\u2019 teams and four girls teams. Next year we are targeting to increase the teams to 14, meaning we will have a team in every district in the province.\n\u201cIn the senior\u2019s league, we currently have six teams for men and five teams for women. The senior league starts in May and ends in September. The senior league started in 2023 and in a space of few years we managed to grow the clubs from one to nine,\u201d Kapumha said.\nBoth the rugby board and teams have a shared belief in the bright prospects of the sport.",

This year I do not have the favourites for this race, but we are preparing well enough and my horses this time have no weight and they are now experienced over the distance, so we could surprise one or two people,\u201d Stidolph said.\nStidolph has Wantage, which finished third last year and Citrusdal for this year\u2019s race, which is heavily tipped to go in the direction of Ideal View, while Jaeger Moon, Abayyaan and Majestic Warrior are expected to pose a threat.",
