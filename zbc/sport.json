            "content": "Story by Raynald Ngwarati\nTHE South Africa national men\u2019s cricket team, the Proteas have laid the foundation of a big first-innings score after closing the day on 465 runs for four in the opening day of the second Test match against Zimbabwe at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo.\nIt was a tough day on the field for Zimbabwe\u2019s Chevrons as the Proteas ran riot, spearheaded by a record-breaking innings from skipper Wiaan Mulder.\nThe South Africans, who lost two wickets early in the first hour after brilliant bowling from Tanaka Chivanga and Wellington Masakadza, masterminded an emphatic comeback to take control on day one.\nJust like in the first match of the series, Chivanga got the early breakthrough for Zimbabwe, claiming the priced wicket of Toby de Zorzi for 10 runs before Masakadza dismissed debutant Lesego Senokwane for three runs, leaving South Africa reeling at 24 for two.\nMulder, however, was determined to turn the tide for his side.\nPromoted to number three on the batting card and handed the captaincy, Mulder anchored the Proteas\u2019 innings and led their fightback from 24 for two to a commanding score by stumps on day one.\nHe built a 184-run third-wicket stand with David Bedingham before unleashing his attacking flair in a 217-run partnership with Lhuan dre Pretorius for the fourth wicket, as South Africa dominated proceedings.\nThe skipper found boundaries with ease, exploiting Zimbabwe\u2019s sloppy fielding end route to a record-breaking innings. He shattered a 57-year-old mark for the most runs scored on his debut as captain.",
