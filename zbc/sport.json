            "content": "Story by Mthokoziso Dube\nBULAWAYO giants, Highlanders will not leave anything to chance when they clash against lowly placed Triangle United this weekend.\nFresh from a home stalemate to money bags Scottland, Highlanders will be on the hunt for a win from the struggling Premier Soccer League returnees Triangle.\nThe Sugar Sugar Boys are under the tutelage of the self-proclaimed Dr of Zimbabwean football, Luke Masomere and are yet to discover their mojo and will utilise their home advantage to rise to the occasion.\nTriangle will be at their usual home, Gibbo Stadium for the first time after the conclusion of the renovation works, but Highlanders are not reading much into all those details.\n\u201cWe are up there in preparations. What we know is that Triangle had a bad start but we need not focus on their position playing at Gibbo, we know what they are capable of doing, and our hope is for my players to guard against complacency. We have taken note of some positives from those matches and I am sure we will come out right,\u201d Highlanders head coach, Kelvin Kaindu said.\nBosso are yet to collect maximum points on the road after losing to new boys MWOS and surrendering a two-nil lead to allow Greenfuel to crawl back and level matters.\nSo far Bosso has a clean bill of health with the pair of left-back Talent Dube and forward Never Rauzhi up for selection.\nMatchday five begins this Saturday with a packed programme, Manica Diamonds date Dynamos at Sakubva while Chicken Inn welcome Herentals at Luveve.",

If we manage to produce our own kits and sell for US$20 and if we sell three million kits per year, that is US$60 million and imagine what that can do for football in Zimbabwe. So this is a move to try and unlock the value of the Warriors brand and increase revenue generation,\u201d ZIFA president, Nqobile Magwizi said.",

            "content": "Story by Lawrence Trusida, Sports Editor\nTHE Zimbabwe sports fraternity and diplomats turned up in their numbers at Heritage Village in Harare Wednesday night to bid farewell to International Olympic Committee president-elect Kirsty Coventry at a dinner hosted by the Ministry of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture.\nHonourable Coventry, has been accustomed to grand stages and grand welcomes but there is no harm in doing it one more time, with hundreds of sports luminaries, administrators and diplomats turning up to bid farewell to the International Olympic Committee president-elect.\nCoventry, who was the country\u2019s Minister of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture for the past seven years, was elected to the highest sporting office in the world last month after a resounding victory to become the first woman and first African to be President of the International Olympic Committee.\nHer successor in the Ministry of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture, Lieutenant General (RTD) Anslem Sanyatwe emphasised that the nation is not waving goodbye to an icon, rather it is sending her offer to conquer uncharted lanes.\n\u201cDr Coventry\u2019s rise to the presidency of IOC is a tribute to her exceptional leadership qualities and her understanding of the profound Olympic movement as well as her unwavering dedication to the values of excellence,\u201d Lieutenant General (RTD) Sanyatwe said.\n\u201cIOC president-elect, Dr Coventry your election is not just a personal triumph, it is a victory for Zimbabwe, Africa and all those who believe in the transformative power of sport. It sends a powerful message that women are not only capable of achieving greatness in sport and administration but they can lead at the highest levels of global administration.\n\u201cWe wish you all the best may your leadership be a beacon of strength and resilience, as we bid farewell we are not saying goodbye but we are saying go and continue to conquer the world our ambassador and a true patriot who has always remained true to being Zimbabwean.\u201d\nAll the testimonials touched on Coventry\u2019s virtues of integrity and leadership.\n\u201cYou have always carried yourself with grace, discipline, and the kind of quiet strength that moves nations. Whether in the swimming pool, at the cabinet table, or on the global stage, you have consistently embodied the highest values of Olympism, excellence, respect, and friendship.\n\u201cThis new chapter is not just a testament to your unmatched legacy, but to your deep conviction that sport is a powerful force for unity, transformation, and peace. You represent the face of a new IOC, diverse, inclusive, and ready to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving world,\u201d CEO of the African Union Sports Council Region Five, Stanley Mutoya said.\n\u201cThis is a bittersweet moment we are happy that you continue to fly the country\u2019s flag even away from the pool. We are also sad that we are losing a leader who has always put integrity above everything even when castigated, you stood true to your values and the results have always vindicated you. You taught us integrity and dedication to the cause and we will forever be indebted to you on that,\u201d Chairperson \u2013 Sports and Recreation Commission, Gerald Mlotshwa said.\nOther congratulatory messages poured from different world leaders, sports associations as well as sports personalities.\nDuring Coventry\u2019s tenure as Minister, she championed grassroots sports development, ensuring the construction of seven multi-purpose courts in rural areas across the country.\nOver the same period, Zimbabwe managed to host nine World Cup qualification tournaments across the sport sector, among them the Rugby Africa Sevens tournament, three Cricket World Cup Qualifiers for men and one for women as well as the Afro-Basket championships.\nThe former swimming sensation also pushed government to make it a policy to reward athletes who excel at the highest level and now the policy is in place with rewards well documented for athletes who win medals at continental and World level competitions.",
