            "content": "Story by Mthokozisi Dube\nTHE Women\u2019s Premier Soccer League (WPSL) is set to commence this Saturday, with one of the most anticipated fixtures being the Bulawayo derby between Highlanders Royals and newly promoted Mpopoma Sports Academy (MPOSA).\nMPOSA, an ambitious side, is aiming for a strong start in their inaugural season.\nThis fixture, while traditionally viewed as a standard encounter, takes on added significance as MPOSA has seen a number of players return to their parent clubs following their loan spells.\nNotably, former loan player Patience Ndlovu, a Mighty Warriors forward, made her return to Highlanders last season and will be missing from MPOSA\u2019s ranks.\nNdlovu remains optimistic about her former side\u2019s prospects.\n\u201cIt is a big game, derbies are unpredictable but the girls are raring for the challenge. I have been advising them that it is a normal game,\u201d Ndlovu said.\nMPOSA roped in Evans Neta who had a successful stint with the now defunct Bulawayo Queens as their head coach.\n\u201cWe respect Highlanders. They are a good side but we remain hopeful. We will come out with a positive result. We have had preparations to polish the side and the girls are raring to go,\u201d Neta said.",

            "content": "Story by Mercy Bofu-Matinha\nZIFA Eastern Region Division One soccer league has received a lifeline after securing a sponsorship deal with cigarette manufacturer, Pacific Storm.\nThe league has not had a title sponsor for more than two decades, hence the excitement following the official launch of the deal over the weekend at Mucheke Stadium in Masvingo.\n\u201cWe are excited as players that for the first time we have a sponsor, it is our hope that the deal will ensure improvement in terms of our matches. We had a lot of challenges and many times it would then demotivate us as players, but with this development, we are looking forward to exciting times,\u201d Tenax Player, Jambo Joseph Tatenda said.\n\u201cThe coming in of Pacific Storm as a sponsor has motivated us a lot as players. For me, it is been six years playing in ERSL and we did not have a sponsor, now all teams will put in more effort and for players, we now know that in the end, if you play well, definitely there will be rewards,\u201d Wangu Mazodze Captain, Lucky Itimu said.\nThe League\u2019s Chairperson, Wisdom Simba and ZIFA Chief Executive Officer, Yvonne Mapika Manwa concurred that the deal will go a long way in improving competition in the league.\n\u201cThis is a huge step for us as the Eastern Region Soccer League and the deal will focus, beyond the core package, on branding and marketing of the league. This will also motivate our players because now they know we have a sponsor. In terms of value, currently, I am not able to share the exact details of its worth but we are happy as the executive,\u201d Simba said.\n\u201cThis partnership is a testament of what ERSL is doing as a league and it is also a reflection of what the ZIFA itself is, I think more than anything we appreciate that Pacific Storm has come in as a pioneer to sponsor this league. This is a partnership where we as the football industry are bringing in something to the corporate world while they are also bringing something very important for us,\u201d Mapika Manwa said.",
