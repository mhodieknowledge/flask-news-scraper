This year, we are leaving no stone unturned in our quest to win the championship and make an impact in the champions league,\u201d FC Platinum chairperson, Dumisani Sisale said.\nFC Platinum struggled for goals last season, but they hope the new Malawian duo, striker Nickson Nyasulu and attacking forward Vincent Nyangulu will be the tonic they need.\nAt the back, they leaked goals and have added defender Precious Phiri from Nyasa Big Bullets of Malawi, Thubelihle Jubane from Sheasham FC and Cory Black from Blanket Mine.\nMidfielder James Nguluve has also joined from Green Fuel FC and forward Claivert Tshuma from relegated Hwange.",

            "content": "Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti heaped praise on his striker Kylian Mbappe after he scored a hat-trick in a 3-1 win over Manchester City on Wednesday that took the Champions League holders into the last 16.\nAncelotti said Mbappe had the potential to reach the same level as club great Cristiano Ronaldo, who is Real\u2019s all-time leading scorer with 451 goals in 438 games for the 15-times Champions League winners.\n\u201cHe has the quality to reach his numbers, but he has to work, because Cristiano set the bar very high, but he is so excited to play here, he can reach Cristiano\u2019s level,\u201d Ancelotti told a press conference.\n\u201cEveryone was waiting for this hat-trick from him and it has finally arrived. But Mbappe is not the only one, we have many players who make a difference. And they make a difference with their collective work above their individual quality which is remarkable.\u201d\nMbappe, who scored 256 goals in 308 appearances over six years at Paris St Germain, said he did not care about being the top scorer if it did not lead to silverware.\n\u201cI was the Champions League\u2019s top scorer last year, but did I win it? No,\u201d Mbappe told reporters.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about being the leading scorer, in my career, I have scored many goals. If with these goals we win titles I will sign with my blood. If I can score 50, all the better, but all I want is to win titles,\u201d he added.\nNEXT OPPONENTSAncelotti lamented that his side had to go through the pain of the knockout round but said that they were to blame after a slow start to the campaign that caused them to finish outside the top eight in the league standings.\nThe holders will face Bayer Leverkusen or city rivals Atletico Madrid, depending on Friday\u2019s draw, as they seek a record-extending 16th title.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not positive at all having to go through the knock-out because we had to play 10 games to get to the last 16,\u201d Ancelotti said.",
