I believe our players are playing way too many shorts for a test match as compared to leaving balls and choosing the ones to play. We saw what Madhevere did in the second innings he was patient and he got the reward, we are playing test cricket in limited overs mode and we are rushing,\u201d said cricket analyst, Godwin Mamhiyo.",
