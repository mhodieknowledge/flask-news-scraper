We realised that a lot of our young stars were involved in drug and substance abuse hence we came up with this initiative. Our aim is to see to it that we have a development side mainly for Under 19 competing in the lower leagues acting as a feeder to big teams. We have had talks on that with our partner in the US, UK and they have committed resources for the initiative,\u201d Khumalo noted.",
