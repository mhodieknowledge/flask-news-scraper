            "content": "Story by Mthokozisi Dube\nTHE first half of the 2025 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season had its fair share of thrills and spills, but it is done and dusted, and the focus is now on the second half.\nBig guns have failed to punch above their weight, finding themselves occupying the bottom half of the PSL ladder.\nOnly FC Platinum has managed to protect its unbeaten run, while debutants MWOS surrendered their record on the last day of the first half, also getting dislodged from the top by defending champions, Simba Bhora.\nFootball stakeholders believe the first half has brought the beauty associated with the beautiful game.\n\u201cIt has been quite an exciting first half of the season. Look at the traditional perennial campaigners like Dynamos, Highlanders, and CAPS United. They are not really performing to expectations. But for the newcomers, if you look at Scottland and MWOS, these are division one teams that are doing well, save for Kwekwe United, whose performance is compromised due to financial challenges. Overall, I think it has been a good and exciting season,\u201d Football Coach, Dalubuhle Bhebhe said.\nThe sports journalist, Praise Dhlakama says, It is exciting that teams coming from division one, playing for the first time in the Premier League, are part of the leading pack, and you have got MWOS in second place.",

They are a celebration of sporting choice, discipline, talent and potential. Our tertiary institutions are not just centers of academic excellence, they are a bridge between school sport and the elite professional stage. Over the years we have lost so many athletes as they progressed to tertiary institutions. It is our duty as SRC to harness the available talent. We have a plan to work with ZTISU to harness our talent,\u201d she said.\nNengomasha encouraged ZTISU to adopt best-practice models from countries like South Africa, where tertiary sport systems have successfully fed athletes into national teams and professional leagues.\nZTISU President, Edward Chekure, welcomed the SRC\u2019s commitment to elevate sport within tertiary institutions.",
