We played well last season, and we ended up number four under very difficult circumstances, but we are not looking back,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI have the support of our two warring factions. We have decided to take lessons from last year\u2019s campaign. Zimbabwe Saints is not a new club it is an old club. We just need to go for the Premiership now and have concluded the signing of our players.\u201d\nThe club which boasts of vast infrastructure across the city has court investors from the diaspora to construct a Zimbabwe Saints Village at their clubhouse in Queens Park, Bulawayo, a project expected to generate revenue for the club.\n\u201cWe have come up with a plan to utilise our 14 hectares of land to construct a Saints Village which will be used while also accommodating visiting teams. We need a Zimbabwe Saints that generates revenue,\u201d Ruzive said.",
