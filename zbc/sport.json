We didn\u2019t find enoughconsistency in actionsto dominate the game,\u201d Arteta said.\n\u201cIn many aspects, we should have done better. Palace were very organised and deserved credit but we dropped our standards.\n\u201cWe struggled to find consistency. We gave the ball away in simple ways and we were late in everything we did. We have to do much better.\u201d\nAdding to Arteta\u2019s concerns is an injury to Mikel Merino that gave the Spaniard out of the Palace game and could sideline him against PSG.",
