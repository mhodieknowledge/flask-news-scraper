I really would want to thank our fans for the carnival atmosphere, very good crowd. We could not have come back if we had no crowd. We really appreciate. Of course we wanted a better result but the opponent was strong. We did not start well but we had a better second half. We wanted to win, we tried everything and hopefully we will build on this in our next game,\u201d Nees said.",
