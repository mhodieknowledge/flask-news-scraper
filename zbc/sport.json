Just reaching the finals would be a big milestone,\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my best day, but I learned so much from competing at this level. I\u2019m honored to be part of this event,\u201d\n\u201cWe arrived late from Namibia so I wasn\u2019t at my best today, but I\u2019ll give it my all in the 200m tomorrow. The competition is tough, but the track and officials are world-class,\u201d said the athletes\nDeputy Minister of Sport, Arts, Recreation and Culture, Honourable Emelly Jesaya highlighted Zimbabwe\u2019s pride in hosting the event.\n\u201cThe Government of Zimbabwe is proud to be hosting the Confederation of African Athletics.

            "content": "Story by Raynald Ngwarati\nTHE Zimbabwe men\u2019s senior rugby team, the Sables\u2019 qualification for the 2027 Rugby World Cup has been described as testament to the power of teamwork, commitment and shared dreams, a model all sport codes in the country have been urged to adopt.\nAfter three decades in the wilderness, the World Cup dream for the Sables appeared to be far-fetched.\nWhile, on paper the odds were against the Sables, especially against Namibia in the Rugby Africa Cup final, the motivation in the Sables camp spoke of champions and indeed it took a new generation of sportspersons to take Zimbabwe\u2019s rugby to new heights.\nCurious about how Sables turned the tables against Namibia first in 2024 and 2025, the ZBC News crew caught up with the Sables captain, Hilton Mudariki.\n\u201cWithin our group we did not panic we were never under pressure even when Namibia scored. We just knew that if we tick our boxes we needed to do what we\u2019ve worked on over the past couple of days we would have been fine. Thank goodness it came through at the end,\u201d he said.\nThe last time Zimbabwe participated at the Rugby World Cup was in 1991 and  Mudariki was not yet born.\n\u201cThree decades a lot of us were not born maybe one or two were born then so for us to rewrite the history books is something that we had spoken about as a group. It was part of our goals and we did know that each game was going to be our final in order for your to achieve that goal. So, to be part of that is super special and for us I think that the motivating factor was to create heroes that other Zimbabwean boys can look up to and inspire to be. We haven\u2019t seen a green and white jersey at the world cup in a very long time so we\u2019ve made our little contribution hopefully to inspire a St Johns boy, a PE boy, a Milton boy to want to be a sable when they grow up,\u201d he added.",
