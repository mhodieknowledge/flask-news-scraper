At the end of the day, what we all want to see is a corrupt-free system that protects the integrity of the game.\n\u201cI think we need a sound dispute resolution set-up to avoid letting football issues be taken elsewhere. That removes credibility and damages the game\u2019s reputation, so to say, and obviously, sponsors do not want to be associated with something that has got a tainted image for obvious reasons,\u201d he said.\nMussa also believes his experience as a servant of the game is key in helping the new board.",
