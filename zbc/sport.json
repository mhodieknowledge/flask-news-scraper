But the question is what happens to these young stars. We need a data base which will help us track the development of these players because there is good talent from what we have seen in this tournament.\u201d\nFormer Warriors midfielder, Johannes Ngodzo has also implored other former footballers to cast the net wider by staging similar tournaments in their respective communities.\n\u201cIf we can have former footballers staging these tournament sin their respective areas, that can take us somewhere in growing the game,\u201d he said.\nNow in its second edition, the annual Johannes Ngodzo football tournament has been a way of  educating the youths on the dangers of drug and substance abuse and one of the founder members, Irvin Khumalo believes plans to set up a development side are now at an advanced stage.\n\u201cWe formed the foundation in 2023 and we have had one tournament meaning this is the second edition. We realised that a lot of our young stars were involved in drug and substance abuse hence we came up with this initiative. Our aim is to see to it that we have a development side mainly for Under 19 competing in the lower leagues acting as a feeder to big teams. We have had talks on that with our partner in the US, UK and they have committed resources for the initiative,\u201d Khumalo noted.",
