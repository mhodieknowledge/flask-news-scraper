If anyone asks why, I am telling you, sports tourism has done very well internationally and domestically,\u201d the Minister of Tourism and Hospitality, Honourable Barbara Rwodzi said.\n\u201cBringing countries to come here, there are two key things, number one, it gives a signature to Zimbabwe\u2019s capacity to host international events. Number two, it gives an opportunity for image building of the country. The more we host sporting events, the better it is for Zimbabwe,\u201d Ministry of Sport, Art and Recreation, Permanent Secretary, Mr Nicholas Moyo said.\n\u201cSport is not just about sending people out, but it\u2019s also about attracting those people to come here. This event is one of the flagship events in the sporting calendar in Zimbabwe. It sets a bar for all the national federations to take a copy and copy what has been done by Zimbabwe Triathlon,\u201d Triathlon Zimbabwe National coach and official, Mr Martin Mbofana.\nThe event sponsors expressed their delight to use triathlon as a tool for marketing destination Zimbabwe to the world.",
