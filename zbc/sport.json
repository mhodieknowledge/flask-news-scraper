            "content": "Story by Mthokozisi Dube\nFOUR teams are participating in a two-day sitting volleyball tournament organised by the Zimbabwe Para-Volleyball Association at King George VI School in Bulawayo.\nSitting volleyball is a variation of traditional volleyball for athletes with disabilities, where players compete in a seated position, using both their arms and legs to manoeuvre across the court. The sport employs the same skills and techniques as standing volleyball, with a few key rule adaptations to accommodate seated play.\nThe Zimbabwe Para-Volleyball Association has organised this selection tournament to scout and prepare players to represent the country at an upcoming invitational event in Kenya,\n\u201cIt is interesting to have these tournaments. We think by having more of these, our sport is headed somewhere,\u201d a player said.\n\u201cIt is my first time to play but I felt at home today,\u201d another player added.\nMidlands Province youth representative for people with disabilities, Honourable Nyashadzashe Shonhe implored other sporting institutions to take a leaf from the association to accommodate people living with disabilities.\n\u201cWe are happy to be mingling in this tournament, but we want this initiative to spread to other sporting disciplines,\u201d Honourable Shonhe said.",

From there I have seen and noticed a lot of things, which has prompted me to run for the vice president post in order to uplift women. The focus is not just on females in sport but also the female stakeholders for example the journalists also need to be empowered,\u201d she said.",
