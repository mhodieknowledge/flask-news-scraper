Risks that we need to be on the lookout are climate change, wars and tensions that have the impact on global economy. As a country, we have to prepare ourselves for this new normal so as to achieve our economic aspiration.\u201d",

This project will not only grow the gross domestic product of Matebeleland South province,\u201d Minister Chitando said.",

We have also seen it necessary to forge ahead with using all the relevant instruments to collect more revenues. Going ahead, the focus is also working with the tax payers to generate more money,\u201d Ms Chinamasa.\nThe anticipated revenue collection systems are also expected to help in Zimbabwe\u2019s domestic resource mobilisation drive as statistics indicate that development partner support remains subdued despite accounting for at least 20% of the national budget.",
