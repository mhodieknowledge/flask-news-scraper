            "content": "Story by Stanley James, BusinessEditor\nZIMBABWE has set sights on increased exports and investment inflows in the National Development Strategy Two (NDS2) with a view to consolidating gains from the past years.\nAs Zimbabwe gears towards launching the NDS2, quasi-government economic institutions have prepared roadmaps to increase socio-economic development.\nWith NDS1 having set the pace for annual export earnings at over US$7 billion, expectations are high that the next blueprint will further maximise receipts.\n\u201cYou can see that our statistics are showing an upward trajectory in exports. This is a result of the NDS1 aspirations whereby for the past five years focus has been on regaining all the external markets. For instance,  the horticulture sector has performed extremely well and this has further laid the roadmap for increased export receipts.\n\u201cGoing forward, value addition of the exports will unlock more earnings and enable the country to achieve the set goals. The mission is on how Zimbabwe can consolidate the current gains and forge ahead with strategies that promote overall economic growth in the next five years,\u201d ZimTrade client manager, Mr Kupakwashe Midzi said.\nWith the rate of licenced investors also improving, authorities are also predicting growth, riding on measures to boost inflows in the NDS2 roadmap.",

The costs required to complete these procedures amount to 76.6percentof income per capita, more than doublethe Sub-SaharanAfrica\u2019s 36.3percentand 25 times the cost in OECD countries at threepercent,\u201d he said.\nAdvocate Mudenda urged ZNCC to move beyond compliance with existing laws and actively advocate for reforms through formal channels.\n\u201cZNCC must transition from mere compliance with current regulatory frameworks to becoming powerful advocates for business law consolidation. ZNCC should learn to petition Parliament in terms of section 149 of our Constitution,\u201d said Advocate Mudenda.",
