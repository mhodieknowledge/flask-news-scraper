            "content": "\nStory by Patience Nyagato\nTHE importance of investment knowledge came under the spotlight at the launch of a book titled \u2018A cookie that did not crumble,\u2019 in Harare this Saturday.\nAlfonce Maketo authored the book which celebrates the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) Market, bringing to light its resilience even at a time when the economy was ailing due to the economic sanctions imposed on the country by the West, among other factors.\n\u201cThe cookie that did Not Crumble is a book that was written out of the realisation that we have some positive aspects that are coming out of our country,\u201d Maketo said.\n\u201cWe are always hearing about the negative things but there are also some positive aspects that are coming and one of those positives is the resilience that is mainly shown by Zimbabweans in all walks of life. In this case, in this book, we are talking of the resilience of the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, at a time when everyone expected the stock market to crumble, when everyone was crushing it, saying it was a scam, that it does not pay, does not give returns to investors, the ZSE, through measures that have been put by the government, that have been put by the ZSE management, and also some stakeholders who are involved in that space has remained resilient.\n\u201cUp to today, for the past decade or so, it has been under a lot of pressure, but it has managed to stack its head above the waters, hence its resilience. It is just a great story of resilience, how that institution managed to stay afloat when companies were delisting when companies were closing, when companies were migrating from the ZSE to the VFX, there were measures that were put in place by various stakeholders to ensure that our stock market still stands proudly in the world, against its peers,\u201d Maketo said.\nThe Zimbabwe Stock Exchange is one of the viable investment markets open for Zimbabweans.\n\u201cUnderstanding the ZSE is a matter of education, other African countries including Tunisia and Morocco are doing well in such markets people because people understand. People want fast money where they lose all money but the chances of losing an investment in the stock exchange is low,\u201d ZSE Chief Executive Officer, Mr Justin Bgoni said.\nSecretary for Presidential Affairs and Devolution in the Office of the President and Cabinet, Engineer Tafadzwa Muguti who was guest of honour at the event highlighted the need for a culture shift from toxic politics to economic progress.",
