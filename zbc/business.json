            "content": "Story by Stanley James, Business Editor\nAS Zimbabwe celebrates 45 years of independence on April 18, the country\u2019s banking sector has recorded huge milestones driven by a robust financial system dominated by domestic-owned banks.\nBefore independence, the banking system was mainly tailor-made for the white minority in terms of the provision of loans and access to services.\nIt was dominated mainly by two multinational banks whose terms and conditions only suited the white minority.\nHowever, government interventions since 1980 are yielding results as evidenced by the rise in bank account holders across the country, digital financial services, and dominance of domestic-owned banks, financial inclusion and a roadmap to reduce bank charges while offering better returns to savings.\n\u201cThe banking sector has also played a pivotal role in the overall growth of the economy, such a trend is evidenced by the rise in overall statistics in terms of the number of people accessing financial services across the country to the extent that going forward, the need to spruce up the image of the sector becomes of greater importance. As a result of the key milestones, Zimbabwe\u2019s banking sector is now focusing on facilitating affordable bank charges, offering loans at concessionary rates including more loans to the productive sectors,\u201d Economist, Dr Zack Murerwa said.\nAnother key highlight of the huge strides in Zimbabwe\u2019s banking sector is that there has not been any bank failure or collapsed bank in the past 10 years.\n\u201cThe course to growth is on track and this is manifested by the continuous growth in the number of banking services and also more investments so in the outlook it is all about tapping into viable strategies to consolidate growth and enhance the sector\u2019s ability to extend more loans,\u201d Bankers Association of Zimbabwe president, Mr Lawrence Nyazema said.\nIn line with the Government\u2019s aspirations of leaving no one and no place behind, authorities are focusing on measures to widen access to banking services by the youths, women and marginalised communities.\nThrough these initiatives, AFC Financial Holdings was unbundled and rebranded in 2019 into four separate business units to strategically support the country\u2019s agriculture sector which has been identified as a backbone of the country\u2019s economic development.\nThe Leasing unit has provided the majority of small-scale farmers with the much-needed implements such as tractors and combine harvesters at affordable rates while the main commercial bank has availed agricultural funding which had been lacking under the previous structure, with the aim of making Zimbabwe self-sufficient in food security since the country attained independence.",
