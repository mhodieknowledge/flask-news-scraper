            "content": "Story by Tamuka Charakupa\nKARIBA \u2013 THE government- led women empowerment initiatives are bearing fruit with women venturing into key sectors, including manufacturing, construction and tourism industries.\nIn Kariba, a town famed for its picturesque lakefront and vibrant tourism appeal, women are breaking through traditional barriers and emerging as notable figures in the small and medium enterprise (SME) space.\nOne such trailblazer is Mrs Chikomborero Jaiwa, a local entrepreneur who has established herself within the competitive tourism industry.\n\u201cWhen I started a few years ago, many people looked at me and thought I would not survive. Tourism here has long been dominated by large corporations, mostly white-owned. As a black woman and a former teacher, I am redefining the odds, I have now secured my stake in this sector despite widespread scepticism.\u201d\nHer story resonates with that of Mrs Mationesa Kazangarare, who runs a medium-scale water bottling plant, capitalising on Kariba\u2019s climate and natural resources.\n\u201cKariba experiences high temperatures throughout the year. I realised we were consuming bottled water transported all the way from Manicaland,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSo I identified the gap and established this plant. I wanted to prove that you don\u2019t have to be based in a major city to operate a professional business. Kariba\u2019s water is clean and abundant, why should we not bottle it here, create employment here, and uplift our community?\u201d\nThe government has commended such entrepreneurial efforts, viewing them as critical to local development and national economic empowerment goals.\nThe Minister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa recently visited Kariba and praised the thriving women-led businesses.\n\u201cI have been touring SMEs in Kariba and I am proud to witness women-led enterprises flourishing. My Ministry remains committed to facilitating a conducive business environment, affordable loan access through Smedco, and technical training. We are now in the digital era, let us leverage ICT and social media platforms for marketing to expand beyond Kariba.\u201d",

            "content": "Story by Thubelihle Mhodi\nBULAWAYO \u2013 WOMEN entrepreneurs have been encouraged to sharpen their business acumen and leverage networking platforms to enhance their participation in key economic sectors.\nThis call was made during the Ladies in Business Seminar, an annual event which was held in Bulawayo this Saturday, which brought together a diverse group of women from various industries to explore opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and growth.\nThe seminar, which continues to draw increased participation from emerging and established female entrepreneurs, has become a vital platform for measuring the progression of women in business and their contribution to Zimbabwe\u2019s socio-economic development.\nParticipants shared insights on how women can successfully run businesses without necessarily owning significant assets or capital, highlighting the importance of creativity, resilience, and leveraging available opportunities.\n\u201cYou do not need to own property to run a successful business, you can manage on behalf of someone else. Women do not always need significant capital to start businesses. Homemakers can use their natural hospitality to build thriving ventures,\u201d a participant said.\nOthers emphasised the empowerment potential of addressing market gaps, particularly in sectors such as agriculture and accommodation.\n\u201cThere are many opportunities, but a persistent shortage of suitable accommodation. Empowering women in these sectors is essential for self-reliance, economic growth, and financial inclusion,\u201d a lady said.\n\u201cThis seminar allows me to network within the farming industry. Agriculture is broad it involves inputs, outputs, logistics, and marketing. Events like these help us connect and scale up,\u201d \u201danother woman participant said.\nMs Thubelihle Ndlovu, Managing Director of Purse on Point, the organisation behind the initiative, underscored the value of collective learning and strategic partnerships in promoting financial literacy among women.",

In this case, both Zimbabwe and Rwanda stand to benefit greatly by leveraging digital technologies to support the growth of this key sector,\u201d he said.",

Uganda, Eswatini, Botswana and even Malta are coming. I was recently in Rwanda comparing systems, and we\u2019re now a notch above Rwanda. That\u2019s commendable on our side ,\u201d said ZIMRA commissioner domestic taxes, Mr Misheck Govha.\nThe private sector also acknowledged the positive impact of the reforms on the business environment.",

            "content": "Story by Tamuka Charakupa\nKARIBA\u2013 THE kapenta fishing industry in Kariba is set for a revival following a significant rise in Lake Kariba\u2019s water levels, with government reaffirming its commitment to supporting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as key drivers of economic growth.\nOnce under threat due to climate change and unsustainable fishing practices, the fishing sector is now regaining momentum.\nLocal fishermen have expressed renewed optimism, buoyed by improved yields and growing calls for policy reforms to promote sustainability.\nDuring a tour of cooperatives in Kariba this week, the Minister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa, acknowledged the sector\u2019s importance and pledged government support.\n\u201cI conducted an assessment tour here in Kariba, visiting housing cooperatives with over 200 beneficiaries. I have also engaged with stakeholders in the fishing industry who shared the challenges they face. As government, we remain committed to supporting sustainable practices, including fostering cooperation with Zambia to ensure conservative management of shared water resources in light of climate change,\u201d she said.\nWith 23 fishing cooperatives operating in Kariba, stakeholders are also hopeful that the anticipated Fisheries and Aquaculture Bill will help streamline operations by addressing concerns around multiple levies, licensing fees, and regulatory clarity.\n\u201cWe are happy that water levels in the lake are rising which means better harvests. However, as a sector we have had an opportunity to relay our challenges to the minister particularly high operating fees and fisher\u2019s license. They need to be reviewed so that there is a balance,\u201d fisherman, Mr Besters Munakira said.\n\u201cWe have observed that after our full moon week break there is increased yield, and we have put forward a request to the effect that we should have at least a month-long break as a solution to boost our Kapenta population, Mr Chartwell Tanga said.\nCross-border cooperation also emerged as a key concern, with Zimbabwean fishermen raising the imbalance in rig numbers compared to their Zambian counterparts.",
