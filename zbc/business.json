We therefore collected US$ 1.506 billion between January and March, indicating that we are on course to achieve over US$7.15 billion or over ZiG$220 billion target by December this year. It is also imperative to note that over US$170 million in tax refunds which is an equivalent of ZWL4.81 billion,\u201d she said.\nThe authorities also highlighted measures to boost domestic resource mobilisation.\n\u201cThe revenue collection trends are being solidified by measures to boost collections riding on improved voluntary contribution from our clients based on the automation drive last year, and implementation of new revenue measures as announced in the 2025 budget.",
