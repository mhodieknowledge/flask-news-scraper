            "content": "Story by Tichaona Kurewa\nZIMBABWE is fast becoming a hub for investments, with the United States attesting to the country\u2019s economic potential.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the ongoing three-day United States Exchange Alumni Summit in Victoria Falls, American Chamber of Commerce in Zimbabwe, James Oliver attributed the coming in of the new dispensation in the Southern African country as the turning point.\n\u201cI think the current administration has made it much more conducive to do business here. I\u2019ll give you an example, ZIDA has been a wonderful asset for us as we began to get started, helping us navigate the special economic zones, even Vic Falls through the special opportunities that are here. So organisations like ZIDA, have made the investment process much easier. I can tell you the climate has changed to where people are interested here and not just from a mining perspective and some of the traditional businesses.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s sentiments were also echoed by the US Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Her Excellency Pamela Tremont who is prioritising attracting more investment into Harare.\nShe said, \u201cSince I got here, I\u2019ve been focused on improving the investment climate. Everybody I meet says, why are there not more American companies here? Why aren\u2019t people investing in all these opportunities? And so, as soon as I hit the ground, I immediately started wondering that myself. Why is that? And of course, improving the investment climate to attract more, not just U.S. businesses, but businesses from around the world.\u201d\nWith its rich natural resources, improving business climate, and strategic location, Zimbabwe is poised to become a hub for investors.\nOver 200 delegates from more than 10 countries in the Southern African region are attending the US Exchange Alumni Summit.",

            "content": "Story by Stanley James\nZIMBABWE\u2019s economic growth agenda is on track, with February figures reflecting progress towards stable prices and increased consumer spending.\nAccording to data from the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency, Zimbabwe Gold inflation for February dropped by 10% points to 0,5% with the United States Dollar inflation rate also falling by the average of the same margins.\nThe agency states the trend means that prices as measured by the All Items Consumer Price Index increased by an average of 0,5% \u00a0between January 2025 and February 2025.\nThe drop in the inflation rate has set the tone for a promising outlook on price stability.\n\u201cThe latest data has really ignited that the stability can be managed and that there is that zeal by the relevant authorities to contain inflation,\u201d said Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries Macroeconomics committee chairperson, Mr Jimmy Pscillos.\n\u201cWhile a drop in inflation does not necessarily mean a fall in prices, the current data shows that the rate at which pricing is increasing in Zimbabwe during February this year declined by over 10% points.\n\u201cThis is a commendable element taking into account the needs of industry for a stable and predictable economic climate that fosters growth and lowers costs of doing business while boosting overall macroeconomic performance by key sectors of the economy at a time when we are expecting food inflation or prices to drop in the second quarter riding on gains emanating from the bumper harvest.\u201d\nThe fall in inflation is also attributed to the tight monetary policy stance.\n\u201cSuch a trend can be maintained if the relevant authorities walk the talk in terms of commitment to stabilise the pricing models in the economy, while so far all looks to be good, there is the need to sustain the stability gains by focusing on long-term strategies to guard against the global and local shocks,\u201d RBZ Monetary Policy committee member, Mr Persistence Gwanyanya said.",

Remember, the yellow card is a trade facilitation instrument, and it allows drivers that cross borders to be able to get compensation quickly if they\u2019re involved in accidents outside the country,\u201d he said.\nZimbabwe\u2019s Insurance and Pensions Commission\u2019s Ms Sibongile Siwela director noted the significance of the yellow card.",
