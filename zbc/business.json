            "content": "\nStory by Owen Mandovha\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe says the de-dollarisation roadmap is no course, with industry stakeholders calling for refinement of the policy stance to maintain stability in the economy.\nThe continuity of the multi-currency regime dominated discussions at a Post-Monetary Policy Statement Breakfast Meeting in Harare this Thursday, with stakeholders citing that the policy is noble, but needs fine tuning given the widespread use of foreign currency for transacting.\n\u201cThe RBZ underlined that there is no going back on that policy measure, but certainly looking at the current situation the ZiG is only about 10% of the money in circulation,\u201d said property developer, Mr Ken Sharpe.\n\u201cCertainly the policy measures by the Governor require huge introspection.\u00a0 The industry is not opposed to the mono-currency regime but many considerations need to be made given that there is a need to eliminate the exchange rate distortions currently bedeviling the economy. However more considerations need to be made on the timelines that do not distort the current economic trajectory,\u201d said CEO of Africa Roundtable, chairperson Mr Oswell Binha.\nRBZ deputy governor Dr Innocent Matshe reiterated that the Central Bank\u2019s stance to de-dollarise by 2030 is the best route available to achieve economic stardom.\n\u201cThis economy is affected by low liquidity, especially of the United States dollar which we cannot control at all hence we will continue on that path so that we give full control over our monetary policy to dictate the growth of the economy, \u201d he said.",
