It is a platform where African economies are going to learn from Iran, an economy that has been under sanctions for the past 45 years but managed to prevail. This is the experience that Zimbabwe would further like to learn during the conference, it will also give Zimbabwe an opportunity to interact with other African business people and get to understand what is also happening in other African economies.\n\u201cThis conference and expo will showcase Iran\u2019s achievements in health, agriculture and other key sectors.

What has happened is that we cannot expedite all of them at the same time, we have made some successes in the health sectors, we are working with the pharmaceuticals in that sector, and there are joint projects between Natpharm and Iranian companies in the distribution and manufacturing of selected drugs, in the health sector, I think we are making quite significant progress,\u00a0 then we also have MOU\u2019s in Science and Technology, progress is being made in space technology.
