            "content": "\nStory by Tichaona Kurewa\nTHE local tourism sector is celebrating a resounding success after a record-breaking festive season.\nThe Hospitality Association of Zimbabwe revealed to ZBC News this Saturday that accommodation facilities across the country reported occupancy rates exceeding 80%, a significant surge compared to previous years.\n\u201cOccupancy was in excess of 80% for the period, but if you look at the major festive days, which is the Christmas days, 24 to 26, most properties recorded 100%. During that period, we also saw high volumes of people going into various properties, and the different operators had to come up with various ways to control the traffic. So yes, it was a success,\u201d president of the Hospitality Association of Zimbabwe, Mr Brian Nyakutombwa said.\n\u201cThis year\u2019s festive season has been a mixed bag. The diaspora market had suppressed numbers compared to last year, but the traditional domestic market, they did come with their numbers, which was very encouraging,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPersonally, I can say the business was okay. We realised a slight hike in the number of clients that we normally have on a daily basis in the other months,\u201d safari operator, Mr Charles Chakanya.\nTourism players noted the need to expedite rehabilitation of the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Highway and the absence of traditional festivals such as the carnival as having stifled some potential travellers.",

            "content": "Story by Stanley James, Business Editor\nInvestor participation on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) is expected to increase this year after government reduced the capital gains withholding tax on the selling of shares to one percent.\nThe capital gains withholding tax on selling shares has been slashed from 2 percent to 1 percent with immediate effect, amid optimism the development will result in investors realising more returns from the sale of their shares.\nThe arrangement has been described by market watchers as government\u2019s commitment towards the growth of local capital markets.\n\u201cIt is entirely premised towards reducing the cost of doing business while enabling investors to realise more, so the net effect is to attract more investors participation, while enabling the local market to play a vital role in economic growth,\u201d said an economist, Mr Ignatious Matungamire.",

In specific challenges is the issue of currency volatility up to April then we introduced a new currency, the ZIG which then brought in stability. The other challenge has been the drought which has really resulted in growth slowing down to 2 percent, but going forward we see that things will improve.\n\u201cIn terms of triumphs in the region, for example, President being the chairperson of SADC, which has given us additional roles as the finance ministry. We are driving the economic and investment development fund. We are pleased that we successfully introduced the ZIG it was never easy moving from one currency to the other. As government we have continued to support the economy through various programs. The private sector continues to work with the private sector in various sectors such as the energy sector. Looking at the industrial sector there are various investments,\u201d said Professor Ncube.\nShifting to infrastructure development, Professor Ncube says government has adopted a two tier model which is expected to modernise the country.\n\u201cAs government, we adopted a two tier model where we are investing in roads as government including the National Railways of Zimbabwe, but also allowing the private sector to come in on the PPP basis. We continue to support the devolution agenda with development coming from the bottom up leaving no one behind,\u201d he said.",
