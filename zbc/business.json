            "content": "By Stanley James, Business Editor\nTHE Mid-Term Review of the Zimbabwe\u2013Belarus Joint Permanent Commission on Cooperation (JPCC) commenced this Monday in Harare, with a particular focus on the implementation of previously signed agreements.\nThe three-day session seeks to assess the progress of bilateral cooperation, evaluate set targets, and address any challenges impeding the full realisation of joint initiatives.\nDuring the opening ceremony, Zimbabwe reiterated its commitment to strengthening its strategic alliance with Belarus.\n\u201cThe close relationship that exists between our leaders their Excellencies, \u00a0President Emmerson Mnangagwa and President Aleksandr Lukashenko, is the bedrock upon which the Zimbabwe,\u00a0 Belarus partnership is built,\u201d the Chief Director for Political Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Mr Pearson Chigiji said.\n\u201cWe must seize this rare opportunity to engage at a strategic level, as it is through such engagements that we will chart a path towards tangible and mutually beneficial cooperation between our nations. We must ensure that what we agree today, not only on what was captured in written agreements but most importantly that it is implemented on the ground, failure to do so would render our deliberations unproductive and hollow. The agenda before us serves as a guide for our discussions. However it should not constrain us to these matters alone, let us remain open to discussing any other issues of mutual interest as our partnership continues to evolve,\u201d he said.\nBelarus highlighted the importance of the JPCC in further enhancing investments in Zimbabwe.\n\u201cA little over a year ago, the first session of the Joint Permanent Commission on Cooperation between the Republic of Belarus and the Republic of Zimbabwe was held here at the Rainbow Towers Conference Centre, it is very symbolic that our meeting takes place on the eve of the 45th anniversary of the Independence of Zimbabwe and the 80th anniversary of the victory over fascism in the Second World War,\u201d Head of the Department of Africa and the Middle East, Mr Yuri Nikolaychik said.",
