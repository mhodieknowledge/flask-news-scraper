Remember the UK is among the top importers of horticulture produce from Zimbabwe. Our presence will enable Zimbabwean entrepreneurs to broaden their scope of business by identifying products on demand and focusing on what is needed to boost exports to the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\u201cBotswana is a neighbouring country to Zimbabwe to such an extent that the two economies have strong bilateral ties that have to be strengthened,\u201d Botswana\u2019s Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Her Excellency Mrs Sarah Sithabile Molosiwa said.\n\u201cTaking a closer analysis of this year\u2019s ZITF, it is imperative to note that more companies from Botswana will be coming to take part, riding on several agreements that have been sealed by the two governments on social and economic development. It is therefore vital that the creates the opportunity to even take stock of the current trade and investment deals, and further offer relevant solutions promised on scaling up cooperation and overall business and industrialisation initiatives in line with the SADC principles towards an industrialised region.\u201d\n\u201cSeveral companies have also shown interest in taking part in trade and business activities so indeed Japan will take part at this year\u2019s ZITF,\u201d Japan\u2019s Ambassador to Zimbabwe, His Excellency Shinichi Yamanaka said.\n\u201cThere are also other features in terms of social and cultural activities that will be showcased as we intend to deepen our bilateral trade and economic cooperation with Zimbabwe, so, in a nutshell the ZITF forms a strategic component for us to further broaden the market base and boost our industrial performance or relations with Zimbabwe.\u201d\nThe ZITF is also upbeat about growth prospects this year.",

This promotes investment as investors know they will not suffer from double taxation, thereby enhancing confidence in the country while protecting taxpayers\u2019 rights. This serves to the continuous cooperation between Zimbabwe and the Swiss Federation,\u201d Swiss Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Stefan Rey said.\nWith Swiss Confederation-based companies also increasing their business portfolios in Zimbabwe, the agreement will enable the firms to enjoy a favourable tax regime.\n\u201cThe agreement is aimed at enhancing tax cooperation and eliminating double taxation of the same income.

If women are capacitated across the country in terms of understanding how it works, operational modalities, and awareness of the digitalised methods, then we are likely to see increased participation otherwise the whole concept is noble as it broadens the scope of businesses to everyone across the country,\u201d Karoi Town Council procurement manager, Ms Vena Manyere said.\n\u201cThis meeting has been an eye opener by enabling us to see what we can do as women in broadening our share of supplies to the government in a male-dominated procurement system.\u00a0We take solace from the fact that the modernised system has all that it takes to embrace our operations thereby enabling more women to be the key players in the procurement activities,\u201d Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe Chief Executive Officer, Mr Clever Ruswa said.\nMr Ruswa revealed a rise in female participation following the launch of the Electronic Government Procurement System.\n\u201cThe whole issue relates to what can be done to modernise the public procurement systems and ensure value for money,\u201d he said.",
