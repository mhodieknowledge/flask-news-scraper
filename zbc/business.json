            "content": "Story by Tendai Munengwa\nTHE record wheat hectarage planted this season has set a strong foundation for the country to resume wheat exports and earn the much-needed foreign currency.\nOfficials from the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development led by Professor Obert Jiri toured wheat farms and dams in Mazowe, Mashonaland Central Province, this Tuesday to assess the progress being made by farmers to feed the nation.\nAt Cde Aaron Nhepera\u2019s farm, the officials witnessed a thriving crop on a 60-hectare piece of land, with the farmer praising continued support from government.\n\u201cWe started small after getting land but with the support that we have been getting from government agricultural programmes, we are weaning ourselves to do it our own. I have 160 hectares of centre pivots and with inputs programmes like the ARDA inputs support scheme I am expecting to produce over seven tonnes of wheat per hectare,\u201d said Cde Nhepera.\nThe tour also revealed a positive picture of the prospects of the country achieving adequate wheat output and surplus to resume exports of the strategic crop.",

            "content": "Story by Peter Chivhima\nZIMBABWE\u2019S beverage manufacturing sector is appealing for enhanced government support to stabilise sugar supplies and reduce production costs.\nThe call was made this Tuesday during a briefing with the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Industry and Commerce, where Delta Corporation Finance Director, Mr Alex Makamure, detailed the operational bottlenecks affecting the sector.\n\u201cThe main suppliers of refined sugar are StarAfrica (Goldstar Sugars) and Tongaat Hullets (Hippo Valley and Triangle). Over the years they have failed to meet the quantity and quality requirements. Given these challenges, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has agreed with the bottlers that they be allowed to supplement their requirements from imports,\u201d he said.\nHowever, sugar remains on the controlled list of imported products, attracting a protective import duty of US$100 per tonne a cost the sector says adds significant pressure on pricing.\nIn addition, the beverage sector continues to grapple with the implications of the sugar tax, introduced in February 2024, which Mr Makamure says led to price hikes of between 15% and 45%, especially for sugar-laden products such as Mazoe Orange Crush.\n\u201cPrices of Sugar added on soft drinks increased by 15 % to 45 % following the introduction of the tax in February 2024. The highest increase were on cordial such as Mazoe Orange Crush. The process of cordials have been moderated since January 2025 after the surtax was halved to 0.0005/g,\u201d Mr Makamure said.\nIn response, Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Industry and Commerce, Honourable Clemence Chiduwa, urged Delta Corporation and other industry players to strengthen engagements with domestic sugar producers to build sustainable supply chains.\n\u201cWe encourage you to find each other local companies so that you increase your production. This will create a balance between your production and the market. However as the Committee will further discuss the issues you have raised,\u201d he said.",
