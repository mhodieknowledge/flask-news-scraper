Spanning over 100 hectares of land, the park is designed to accommodate a diverse range of industries, from manufacturing and logistics to technology and innovation. One of the primary benefits of the Bulawayo Industrial Park is its potential to create thousands of jobs for the local community. From skilled laborers to management professionals, the park will provide a wide range of employment opportunities, helping to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment,\u201d he said.",
