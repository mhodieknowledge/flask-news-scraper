While this is for January, we anticipate the trend to continue intact all the value chains have been informed or notified of the developments and we expect them to comply.\u201d",

            "content": "Story by Owen Mandovha, Business Reporter\nPlayers in the wholesale and retail sector have called for policy interventions to address viability challenges at a time when the market has been flooded by smuggled goods and informal traders on their doorsteps.\nThe Second Republic has created an environment for business to thrive with various players including the informal sector running successful business ventures.\nThe gains are, however, being set back by a glut of smuggled goods which have found their way into the informal market at cheaper prices.\nKey proponents of the Buy Zimbabwe initiative are convinced there is need for policy and regulatory interventions.\n\u201cThe situation obtaining here is clear, you have got big manufacturers who are doing very well in the same environment that these retailers and wholesalers are operating. The problem here is that laws favour the informal sector because big businesses have to comply with a lot of policies that are difficult and distort their pricing framework. So it\u2019s not an economic issue but an issue of how government should reform policies that allow these companies to thrive,\u201d Buy Zimbabwe\u2019s Executive Director Mr Munyaradzi Hwengwere said.\nConfederation of Zimbabwe Retailers\u2019 president, Dr Denford Mutashu concurred adding that there is need to cushion the formal sector.\n\u201cRetailers have to sell in both currencies which does not apply to the informal sector hence manufacturers end up preferring to sell directly to the informal sector who sell in foreign currency so this provides an untenable situation for the formal retailers.\u201d",

We are looking forward to reach 300 000 litres by end of this year as we have increased our herd,\u201d said chairperson of Cynara Dairy Farmers Cooperative, Francis Musunzuru.\nSmall-scale dairy farmers in the area have benefited from government support, which has given impetus to their milk production ventures.\n\u201cWe have partners selling affordable dairy calves to us at $100 each. We were also given an artificial insemination kit to grow our herd,\u201d said a dairy farmer.\n\u201cThe presidential silage scheme is helping us a lot in improving the volume of milk we produce due to increased supply of feeds,\u201d said a dairy farmer.\n\u201cWe are looking forward to growing our herd as we are being supported by the government,\u201d said another dairy farmer.\n\u201cWe are happy with the support but we can produce more if our herd is increased. We are planning to produce feeds locally to reduce production costs,\u201d said a dairy farmer.\nGovernment support has been the major driver of growth in the dairy sector.\n\u201cSince the introduction of the presidential silage scheme, Manicaland province recorded 27 percent growth in terms of milk production. We want to thank the government and President Mnangagwa for supporting farmers to increase productivity,\u201d Mutare regional chairperson of Zimbabwe Association of Dairy Farmers, Mrs Rudo Sithole said.",

During that period, we also saw high volumes of people going into various properties, and the different operators had to come up with various ways to control the traffic. So yes, it was a success,\u201d president of the Hospitality Association of Zimbabwe, Mr Brian Nyakutombwa said.\n\u201cThis year\u2019s festive season has been a mixed bag. The diaspora market had suppressed numbers compared to last year, but the traditional domestic market, they did come with their numbers, which was very encouraging,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPersonally, I can say the business was okay. We realised a slight hike in the number of clients that we normally have on a daily basis in the other months,\u201d safari operator, Mr Charles Chakanya.\nTourism players noted the need to expedite rehabilitation of the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Highway and the absence of traditional festivals such as the carnival as having stifled some potential travellers.",
