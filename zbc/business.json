            "content": "\nStory by Tichaona Kurewa\nIN a strategic move to enhance agricultural trade within the region, key commodity exchanges have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to foster closer cooperation and integration.\nFollowing the success of the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP), which has been overseeing regional electricity trading since 1995, four major commodity exchanges have come together to streamline the trade of surplus and deficit commodities such as maize and wheat.\nThe signatories include the Agricultural Commodity Exchange for Africa (Malawi), the Zambian Agricultural Commodity Exchange (ZAMACE), the Zimbabwe Mercantile Exchange (ZMX), and the Tanzania Mercantile Exchange (TMX).\nThe MOU seeks to promote regional collaboration, improve market efficiency, enhance price discovery, increase liquidity, and create more opportunities for both farmers and traders.\nMalawi\u2019s Agricultural Commodity Exchange for Africa CEO, Mr. Kristian Moller, highlighted the significance of the agreement.\n\u201cIt is great to sign this MOU today. We saw a specific case where Zimbabwe had excess wheat and Malawi had excess soybeans, and a swap made perfect sense. This led us to develop a modality for such trades. We then expanded the initiative to include ZAMACE and TMX, creating a unified framework for regional trade,\u201d Mr Moller said.\nStakeholders believe the regional collaboration will significantly enhance market efficiency, improve price discovery, increase market liquidity, and create broader opportunities for farmers and traders.\nNedbank South Africa\u2019s Head of Agricultural Commodities, Mr Zhann Meyer, emphasised the importance of cross-border trade for regional food security.\n\u201cThe signing of this MOU is crucial for cross-regional trade. It demonstrates the region\u2019s recognition of the importance of trade and food security, not just nationally, but regionally. I\u2019m hopeful that this MOU will unlock trade barriers and enhance food security across the region.\u201d\n\u201cThis agreement addresses regional food security, which is paramount. We need to support each other through trade, and we are pleased to be moving in this direction and hope to attract investors to fund the procurement and trade of commodities like maize across borders,\u201d Chairperson, Grain Millers Association, Mr Tafadzwa Musarara also added.",

The fact that there has been an increase in the global participants is a true reflection of how Zimbabwe\u2019s mining industry remains attractive and viable,\u201d the Minister of Mines and Mining Development, Honourable Winston Chitando said.",
