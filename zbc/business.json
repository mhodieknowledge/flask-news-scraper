Business-wise, we have so many business owners of Zimbabwean origin who are domiciled here and this offers them more convenience. The development offers opportunities to further enhance trade ties between Zimbabwe and Zambia. We are pursuing economic diplomacy and this flight will give an impetus to that goal,\u201d she said.\nZimbabwe\u2019s Deputy Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development, Honourable Joshua Sacco says the government is reaping the fruits of upgrading its airport infrastructure as regional connectivity increases.\n\u201cWe are excited as a country to note that many airlines are now expanding routes because we now have world-class airport infrastructure, which rivals any other hence we see opportunities to grow trade between the two countries.\u201d",

            "content": "Story by Stanley James, Business Editor\nAS Zimbabwe celebrates 45 years of independence on April 18, the country\u2019s banking sector has recorded huge milestones driven by a robust financial system dominated by domestic-owned banks.\nBefore independence, the banking system was mainly tailor-made for the white minority in terms of the provision of loans and access to services.\nIt was dominated mainly by two multinational banks whose terms and conditions only suited the white minority.\nHowever, government interventions since 1980 are yielding results as evidenced by the rise in bank account holders across the country, digital financial services, and dominance of domestic-owned banks, financial inclusion and a roadmap to reduce bank charges while offering better returns to savings.\n\u201cThe banking sector has also played a pivotal role in the overall growth of the economy, such a trend is evidenced by the rise in overall statistics in terms of the number of people accessing financial services across the country to the extent that going forward, the need to spruce up the image of the sector becomes of greater importance. As a result of the key milestones, Zimbabwe\u2019s banking sector is now focusing on facilitating affordable bank charges, offering loans at concessionary rates including more loans to the productive sectors,\u201d Economist, Dr Zack Murerwa said.\nAnother key highlight of the huge strides in Zimbabwe\u2019s banking sector is that there has not been any bank failure or collapsed bank in the past 10 years.\n\u201cThe course to growth is on track and this is manifested by the continuous growth in the number of banking services and also more investments so in the outlook it is all about tapping into viable strategies to consolidate growth and enhance the sector\u2019s ability to extend more loans,\u201d Bankers Association of Zimbabwe president, Mr Lawrence Nyazema said.\nIn line with the Government\u2019s aspirations of leaving no one and no place behind, authorities are focusing on measures to widen access to banking services by the youths, women and marginalised communities.\nThrough these initiatives, AFC Financial Holdings was unbundled and rebranded in 2019 into four separate business units to strategically support the country\u2019s agriculture sector which has been identified as a backbone of the country\u2019s economic development.\nThe Leasing unit has provided the majority of small-scale farmers with the much-needed implements such as tractors and combine harvesters at affordable rates while the main commercial bank has availed agricultural funding which had been lacking under the previous structure, with the aim of making Zimbabwe self-sufficient in food security since the country attained independence.",

            "content": "\nStory by Stanley James, Business Editor\nZIMBABWE\u2019S airports recorded a 19 % surge in passenger traffic flows last year driven by the government\u2019s upgrading and refurbishment of the ports of entry.\nData from the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ) released to the ZBC News this Tuesday shows that air passenger volumes rose to over two million last year from around 1.9 million in 2023.\nThe data, which is showing a promising outlook for Zimbabwe\u2019s aviation sector shows an over five percent growth in air traffic movements compared to 2023.\nAs a result of increased trade, the country\u2019s airports also experienced growth in terms of cargo volumes to over 17 tonnes compared to around 15 tonnes in 2023, with more volumes being recorded in the last quarter.\nThe international and domestic airports in Zimbabwe also witnessed huge milestones driven by the influx of new airlines, new routes and increased flights.\nEconomists contend that Zimbabwe\u2019s airport upgrades and development strategies are yielding the intended goals of attracting increased business and traffic flows.\n\u201cThere is that appetite for the airlines to come and operate in the country, this is mainly arising from the fact that the government did actually set its priorities right by focusing on the expansion of the industry, such a development has therefore positively propelled the traffic flows. It is also prudent to note that going forward, the surge in air traffic passenger flows will have multiplier effects in terms of increasing investments and also creating more opportunities for growth in the short to long term,\u201d Development Economist, Dr Prosper Chitambara said.\n\u201cWhat is needed is that element towards the continuous upgrading of the airports in line with the global standards, to further accelerate growth and ensure the current gains continue for the benefit of the nation. Remember Zimbabwe is now a global village meaning that the local airports should meet the needs of the global market thereby sustaining growth and consolidating the current gains,\u201d a University of Zimbabwe Business Studies Lecturer, Dr Nyasha Kaseke said.",
