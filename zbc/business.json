            "content": "Story by Fungai Jachi\nHARARE-AT least 13 000 youths from across the country are set to benefit from the second phase of the Youth Employment and Entrepreneurship Project, which was launched in Harare this Wednesday.\nYouth Empowerment in Zimbabwe has ceased to be a fantasy; it is now a lived reality, and young people like 17-year-old Tapiwanashe Shumba and 26-year-old Chido Makanha are already benefiting from the empowerment initiatives spearheaded by the government and its development partners.\n\u201cI am grateful that opportunities have been created for us. I am into rabbit breeding, and there is a huge market because people view it as a delicacy. The business is doing quite well,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI am one black person who is providing a rare breed of flowers to the market, and as a young person, I am excited about that. I am looking forward to starting exporting soon because my hectarage has increased,\u201d Chido Makanha said.\nSander Jamba, who works with nine others in peas production, is already making a mark on the export market.\n\u201cWe are a group of ten young people who ventured into pea farming. We started off providing the local market, but failed to survive because of competition. That is when we were helped to start export-oriented production. Now we have a market in Europe and we are exporting our peas and making more money,\u201d Jamba said.\nPeter Kanodeweta, who got funding from the Youth Bank to start his apiary project, is grateful for the opportunities being provided to young people.\n\u201cFor starters, my apiary project, I got money from the youth bank and was able to buy what I needed to start the project. I started with 30 hives and now I have 60, hoping to be at 100 by the end of the year. The Second Republic has really created a conducive environment for young people to venture into business,\u201d he said.\nThe launch of the second phase of the Youth Employment and Entrepreneurship Project stands to bring sustainability to already existing enterprises, while also giving a new lifeline to new businesses with development partners and the government vowing to continue collaborating for the benefit of youths.",

            "content": "Story by Stanley James\nTRADE between Zimbabwe and China has reached a massive US$1.9 billion during the first five months of this year, representing an annual growth rate of over 18 percent.\nFigures released during the China-Zimbabwe Business Forum held in Harare this Tuesday revealed continued growth in trade ties between the two economies, as Zimbabwe\u2019s exports to the Asian economic giant have risen by over 14 percent to more than US$1.9 billion.\nZimbabwe\u2019s imports from China were pegged at over US$600 million during the period under review, reflecting a 29 percent increase.\nHowever, it is Zimbabwe that recorded a surplus of over US$7 million, reflecting strides by the Second Republic\u2019s efforts to boost external markets by incentivising local industries.\nChina is pledging increased business ties with Zimbabwe.\n\u201cFor the period under review, it is imperative to observe that tobacco has been the key export commodity by Zimbabwe to China. However, horticultural produce, including citrus commodities, is in the second spot mainly as a result of increased demand. In the long term, both countries stand to benefit, riding on improved relations that have created scope for further growth in business, investments, and trade in the fields of energy, mining, agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, among many other strategic sectors,\u201d China Zimbabwe Exchange Centre CEO, Mr Steve Ke Zhao said.",
