Our country has all that it takes in terms of mining equipment implying the existing cooperation will also positively affect Zimbabwe. The key issue is how sustainable mining practices are vital to the growth of Zimbabwe\u2019s mining sector in the short to long term.\n\u201cThe main issue is how Sweden can take a cue from the mining boom in Zimbabwe, remember our country is entirely dominated by mining projects an element that becomes crucial in terms of creating synergies with Zimbabwe in the mining value chains,\u201d\nZimbabwe is committed to further collaborating with Sweden in mining projects.\n\u201cWe are really excited to have the presence of this delegation in Zimbabwe, it\u2019s a true reflection of what we are doing as government in facilitating increased inflows of external projects, it is also a reflection of how the ties between Zimbabwe and Sweden are being reinforced so there are here to further scout more opportunities in the resource extraction sector which is riding on massive growth credit to several interventions by the Government,\u201d Zimbabwe\u2019s Ambassador to Sweden, the Nordics and Baltics, Priscilla Misihairabwi said.\n\u201cZimbabwe possess a wealth of mineral resources and the mining industry is expected to play a vital role towards the attainment of vision 2030. However we recognise the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental mining best practices so their presence is very vital in further enhancing the existing ties and focus on long term deliverables,\u201d the Minister of Mines and Mining Development, Honourable Winston Chitando said.\nThe Swedish- Zimbabwean Sustainability in Mining Expo is aimed at showcasing Swedish technologies and innovations that can be used to promote sustainable mining practices in Zimbabwe.",
