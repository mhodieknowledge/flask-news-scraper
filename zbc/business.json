From July going forward we should start the construction. It must last us two years. The school must open in 2028,\u201d she said.\nThe school will be established within the Masuwe Special Economic Zone which will also put Zimbabwe on the global map and provide employment.\n\u201cIf the United Nations is coming to be a part of us, anyone else can come to be a part of us. So it drives more investment in the country but more so for us in tourism, it\u2019s about endorsing the destination. We already have the ground because this whole land, 271 hectares, belongs to the Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry through Mosi-oa-Tunya Development Company. So the land for the school is already there, it\u2019s a nine-hectare land for the school which is ready and which is already on the subdivision,\u201d she added.",
