            "content": "Story by Fairstars Mukungurutse\nGOVERNMENT has reaffirmed its commitment to continue fostering the growth of the tourism and hospitality industry as the country targets to attain an upper middle-income society by 2030.\nSurpassing agriculture and mining, the tourism and hospitality industry registered tremendous growth in 2024, accounting for 12 % of the country\u2019s GDP.\nIn an interview with ZBC News after addressing students at the Zimbabwe Staff College this Monday, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister, Honourable Barbara Rwodzi said the government has put in place a raft of measures to consolidate the tourism industry as one of the top contributors to the Gross Domestic Product, alongside mining, agriculture and manufacturing.\n\u201cWe had an engagement with the Staff of the Defense Forces today, where we were discussing the contribution of the tourism industry to the country\u2019s economy, and we were giving them a layout of what the tourism industry is all about, how we are guided by the constitution, the President\u2019s Vision 2030, as well as the policies and how we have formulated our strategies to be where we are,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe were telling them the figures for 2023, in comparison with 2024 figures, whereby tourism was the highest sector that contributed to the GDP by 12 %, and how we achieved that. Agriculture was affected by climate change due to the drought that we experienced in 2024, and mining was affected by the fluctuation of global prices, and, that resulted in tourism being the number one contributor to the GDP.",

            "content": "Story by Tichaona Kurewa\nCOAL producers have praised government efforts to stabilise the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency and its ongoing engagement and re-engagement drive, measures which they say are key in significantly revitalising the sector.\nThe government has implemented various measures to enhance the ease of doing business, including the introduction of the ZiG currency and a concerted effort to engage and re-engage with the global community.\nA visit to Zambezi Gas Mine by the ZBC News crew revealed increased activity attributed directly to timely government interventions.\n\u201cThe Second Republic has helped us by opening doors, allowing us to enter into markets for equipment. We can now get cheaper and efficient equipment from China and that has enabled us to start finding our feet again. With the Second Republic\u2019s re-engagement drive, we can now talk to our traditional suppliers like BaloWorld and get assistance,\u201d Zambezi Gas\u2019 executive Mr Mathew Rararadza said.\n\u201cOur friends from the East are always receptive when we want facilities with regards to machines, imports and everything, all thanks to the re-engagement drive. It has also opened for Western countries as their companies are starting to come back now and want to do business with us, especially after the lifting of the sanctions on some companies the lifting of the sanctions on some companies,\u201d Coal Producers Association\u2019s Chairperson, Mr Lainos Masimura said.\nThe stability of the ZiG currency has also been highlighted as a critical factor in the sector\u2019s resurgence.\n\u201cOur hope and wish is that the currency continues to grow strength so that we can be able to transact locally in our currency and then work with foreign currency when we are exporting. For us to run on a foreign currency when we are doing local transactions, it always comes with the costs that are also denominated in foreign currency and it becomes difficult to operate,\u201d Mr Masimura stated.\nZimbabwe\u2019s coal production has shown consistent growth. As of December 2023, the country recorded more than 4.9 million tonnes, up from just over 3.9 million tonnes in December 2022.",

            "content": "OIL prices fell on Monday as concern about the impact of U.S. import tariffs on global economic growth and fuel demand, as well as rising output from OPEC+ producers, cooled investor appetite for riskier assets.\nBrent crude fell 31 cents, or 0.4%, to $70.05 a barrel by 0445 GMT after settling up 90 cents on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $66.69 a barrel, down 35 cents, or 0.5%, after closing 68 cents higher in the previous trading session.\nWTI declined for a seventh successive week, the longest losing streak since November 2023, while Brent was down for a third consecutive week after U.S. President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0imposed then\u00a0delayed tariffs\u00a0on its key oil suppliers\u00a0Canada\u00a0and Mexico while raising taxes on Chinese goods.\u00a0China retaliated\u00a0against the U.S. and\u00a0Canada\u00a0with tariffs on agricultural products.\n\u201cTariff uncertainty is a key driver behind the weakness,\u201d ING analysts said in a note, adding that oil price cuts from Saudi Arabia and deflationary signals from China also hurt sentiment.\nIG analyst Tony Sycamore said other factors weighing on oil prices include concerns about U.S. growth, the potential lifting of U.S. sanctions on Russia, and OPEC+ opting to increase output.\n\u201cNonetheless, with much of the bad news likely factored in, we expect weekly support around $65/$62 to hold firm before a recovery back to $72.00,\u201d he said in a client note in reference to the WTI price.\nOil prices clawed back some loss on Friday after Trump said the U.S. would\u00a0increase sanctions\u00a0on Russia if the latter fails to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine.\nThe U.S. is also studying ways to\u00a0ease sanctions\u00a0on Russia\u2019s energy sector if Russia agrees to end its war with Ukraine, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nMeanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, collectively known as OPEC+, said it\u00a0will proceed\u00a0with oil output hikes from April.\nRussia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak on Friday said OPEC+ could\u00a0reverse the decision\u00a0in the event of market imbalance.\nAdding to supply concerns, Saudi Arabia\u00a0cut prices\u00a0for crude grades it sells to Asia for the first time in three months in April.\nLast week, Trump said he wanted to\u00a0negotiate\u00a0a deal with OPEC member Iran to prevent the latter seeking nuclear weapons \u2013 though Iran has said it is not seeking such weapons.",
