It is the appetite by the Zimbabweans to invest back home that has seen a lot being done by the diaspora market in as far as making decisions to inject capital in fixed assets that guarantee long term benefits is concerned,\u201d noted Homelux Properties Managing Director, Mr Justin Machibaya.\nDespite the growth trajectory, the real estate sector has also not been spared from challenges.\n\u201cThe year is coming to an end and of course there are more positives, but it is prudent to note that growth will be underpinned by a stable economic climate, affordable borrowing costs and availability of all relevant inputs. In fact, a stakeholder commitment approach will form the hallmark for the growth of the sector. Overally, we are expecting more project inflows next year,\u201d explained another real estate expert.\nThe three-day conference is also reviewing investments, identifying challenges, offering solutions and exchanging ideas."

This therefore entails cooperation among stakeholders to come up with a common vision, that is taking a closer look at current challenges and offer solutions that takes the economy forward riding on the current gains within the sector and taking a closer look to the outlook projections of enhancing intermediate manufacturing, utilisation of idle infrastructure assets, value chain optimisation, rural industrialisation and local content strategy implementation,\u201d Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce- Harare Branch chairperson Mr Ephraim Chawoneka said.\nNavidale Textiles Managing Director Mrs Mary Madzima noted, \u201cAs the plan seeks to address influx of smuggled and counterfeit products, improve the ease of doing business, enhance growth of large corporates, address regulation and compliance issues, it becomes imperative that as the private sector we need to embrace it for the growth of the economy.\u201d\n\u201cWe are more than willing to partner the government to implement the plan because through implementation, we are destined to achieve the intended targets so that it will harness competitiveness and position Zimbabwe as a regional hub for industrial growth by addressing issues of access to long-term financing and infrastructure as well as utilities such as electricity and water cost and availability,\u201d Employers\u2019 Confederation of Zimbabwe vice president Dr Farai Dube added.\nGovernment has reaffirmed commitment to work with the private sector.\n\u201cGovernment is willing to roll out extensive discussions with industry and commerce relating to this blue print. Basically, the desire is there and what we want is to promote the sector, this strategy is also premised on four pillars that include issues constraining industrial growth, measures to promote growth, implementing, monitoring and evaluation including crafting the Zimbabwe National Industrial and Development Policy 2 (2026- 2030),\u201d said the Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce, Honourable Raj Modi.\nTreasury in the national budget allocated over ZiG 550 million to support implementation of the blue print targeted at sectors that include pharmaceuticals, oil seeds, grains and cereals, dairy, clothing and textiles, fertilizer, iron and steel, cement, wood and timber among others."
