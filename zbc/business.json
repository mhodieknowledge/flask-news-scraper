Already some have benefited through the establishment of this project, however we are looking forward to grow cash crops such as potatoes, paprika and horticultural crops.\u201dSpeaking after touring the project and handing over a stock-feed thresher to Ward 9 Farmers Field School, Chivi District Development Coordinator, Mr Innocent Matingwina concurred with the area legislator, Honourable Godfrey Mukungunugwa that communities including youths must take advantage of empowerment programmes by government for improved livelihoods.\n\u201cAs you are aware, we are in a drought season and the government has been assisting us a lot in ensuring food security. Given that our area is dry, a borehole has been established here and it will not only benefit youths because the community around will be able to get clean and safe water. Again this thresher given to the community will enable you to produce fodder for your livestock hence they will not be affected much by drought,\u201d said Mr Matingwina.",

Spanning over 100 hectares of land, the park is designed to accommodate a diverse range of industries, from manufacturing and logistics to technology and innovation. One of the primary benefits of the Bulawayo Industrial Park is its potential to create thousands of jobs for the local community. From skilled laborers to management professionals, the park will provide a wide range of employment opportunities, helping to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment,\u201d he said.",
