The budget must be analysed through the lenses of the poor, through the lens of disadvantaged groups such as women, children, youths, and people with disability, hence, we expect them to be proficient in ensuring that the budget is adequate, answers to the question of equity, and is inclusive,\u201d he said.\nChairpersons of the Committees represented said the capacity building programme will enable them to execute their mandate, including ensuring accountability in the management of public resources.\n\u201cAs Honorable members, we are being equipped with technical skills that enable us to effectively analyse, scrutinise, and monitor our budget. It means we will be able to analyse budget proposals, performance reports, and accompanying documentation submitted by ministries, departments, and agencies. Again, we will be able to understand constitutional and legislative provisions guiding financial accountability and budget oversight,\u201d Chairperson Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Lands, Agriculture, Water, Fisheries and Rural Development, Honourable Felix Maburutse noted.",

This figure surpasses the continental average of 52 percent, which means that local organisations keep on improving customer engagement. We have brought players from both the private and public sectors to share ideas and continue improving client satisfaction, while reminding each other to tap into the benefits of AI in this digitally driven economy,\u201d Customer Experience Association of Zimbabwe,Marketing Manager, Mrs Aquiline Mazhawidza said.\n\u201cThe Customer Satisfaction Index Reports are critical because they point out areas needing further investigation, gaps, and milestones achieved. I am grateful that this conference has brought together key players to deliberate on ways to enhance service delivery and client management,\u201d ZBC Director for Marketing, Mr Fredius Dzumbunu noted.\n\u201cI am walking away with new tools to map our customer touchpoints and apply data from surveys to better our delivery. The Second Republic emphasises the need to create an ease-of-doing-business environment, and this is what we are being reminded about. The ultimate message is that the customer is king, and we should therefore exhaust all ideas to promote that,\u201d Deputy Registrar General Provincial Operations, Mrs Christina Chikerema added.",
