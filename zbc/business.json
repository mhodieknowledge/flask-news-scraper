The report indicates an estimated decrease of about 15% in bookings from this market over the next quarter, reflecting concerns among potential travellers,\u201d Hospitality Association of Zimbabwe vice president, Ms Emmah Kativu said.\nTourism operators are concerned that the geopolitical unrest is deterring visitors from countries directly affected, as well as those transiting through Middle Eastern cities.\n\u201cWe have also seen that Qatar has not been spared in these disputes. Qatar is a very strategic partner to Zimbabwe\u2019s tourism sector, as most airlines connect through there. It serves as a hub for airlines from various global regions that bring clients to our country. As long as there is instability in Qatar, it becomes very difficult for people to connect to Zimbabwe. We are hopeful that world leaders will come together, reason together, and foster peace, peace that will help us attract more visitors to Zimbabwe and Southern Africa,\u201d said Mr Clement Mukwasi, a tourism executive.\nThe Middle East serves as a critical aviation hub for Zimbabwe, with many travellers from Asia and Europe connecting through Doha, Dubai, and other major cities.\nDespite the challenges, tourism stakeholders are not sitting idle. The focus is now shifting toward strengthening ties with other regions and promoting Zimbabwe\u2019s position as a safe and attractive destination.",
