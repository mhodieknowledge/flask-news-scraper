            "content": "Story by Tichaona Kurewa\nTHE second Africa Continental Free Trade Area Association of Commodities Exchanges (A-ACX) Conference kicked-off in Victoria Falls this Wednesday, with focus on stimulating investment within African commodities markets.\nAs Africa still imports between US$80 billion to US$100 billion worth of food annually, Zimbabwe is actively exploring the export opportunities brought about by the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and Association of Commodities Exchanges (A-CX).\nZimbabwe confirmed the strides it is making in that direction during the official opening of the second edition of the conference.\n\u201cZimbabwe is building capacity to export key commodities. For example, having attained wheat self-sufficiency three seasons ago, Zimbabwe now has an annual surplus of wheat of about 250 000 Metric Tonnes, a surplus of 290 million kilograms of tobacco, surplus sugar, and many horticultural products.\n\u201cThe conference centres on strengthening collaboration, enhancing regional trade integration, and stimulating investment within African commodities markets. Indeed, there are exciting times ahead for a country whose economy is agro-based.\n\u201cWith enhanced value addition and beneficiation, coupled with the creation of competitive production and pricing models, establishment of risk mitigation through appropriate insurance models, the increasing use of innovative payment platforms and use of more efficient logistics and transportation networks, Zimbabwe can indeed contribute to stable, affordable, and friendly intra-Africa trade,\u201d Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Dr Anxious Masuka said.\nA-ACX is upbeat about Zimbabwe\u2019s potential to cut food imports from outside the continent.\n\u201cI know wheat is one of those that is coming out of Zimbabwe. There are other countries who have expressed interest in receiving wheat. Not many of the African countries are actually producing wheat. Zimbabwe is a key player so they will benefit obviously from the surpluses that you\u2019re now producing to be able to provide to other African countries and this is amazing,\u201d ACX Chairperson, Ms Tucci Ivowi said.\nZimbabwe has intensified efforts to ramp up production in the agriculture sector through establishment of irrigation schemes, setting up village business units, climate proofing agriculture and issuing of title deeds to agricultural land beneficiaries, among other initiatives.",

The fact that there has been an increase in the global participants is a true reflection of how Zimbabwe\u2019s mining industry remains attractive and viable,\u201d the Minister of Mines and Mining Development, Honourable Winston Chitando said.",

This development of infrastructure is multi-faceted, with the provision of water infrastructure being one of them,\u201d Professor Ncube said.\n\u201cThat is why President Emmerson Mnangagwa launched the Presidential Borehole Drilling Scheme, amongst other programmes. We have noted that Bulawayo has been facing water challenges, and as government, we have moved in with a three-pronged approach to ensure the challenge is addressed.\n\u201cWe all know that the government is constructing the Gwayi Shangani Dam as a long-term measure to this challenge. We are currently going through the contractual details of the Glass Block Dam which is expected to be the mid-term solution to the challenge we are facing, and soon, once we finish on the details construction is set to begin.\u201d",

We want to thank your support which has seen us establish this investment. Without your support we would not have managed to establish such an infrastructure,\u201d Zhong Jin International Hotel General Manager, Mr Yolo Chen said.\nThe government is impressed by opportunities brought about by the investment, which further cements the bilateral relations between Harare and Beijing.\n\u201cThis investment is a game changer as it has created jobs and stimulated growth in the tourism value chain.
