            "content": "Story by Stanley James\nTRADE between Zimbabwe and China has reached a massive US$1.9 billion during the first five months of this year, representing an annual growth rate of over 18 percent.\nFigures released during the China-Zimbabwe Business Forum held in Harare this Tuesday revealed continued growth in trade ties between the two economies, as Zimbabwe\u2019s exports to the Asian economic giant have risen by over 14 percent to more than US$1.9 billion.\nZimbabwe\u2019s imports from China were pegged at over US$600 million during the period under review, reflecting a 29 percent increase.\nHowever, it is Zimbabwe that recorded a surplus of over US$7 million, reflecting strides by the Second Republic\u2019s efforts to boost external markets by incentivising local industries.\nChina is pledging increased business ties with Zimbabwe.\n\u201cFor the period under review, it is imperative to observe that tobacco has been the key export commodity by Zimbabwe to China. However, horticultural produce, including citrus commodities, is in the second spot mainly as a result of increased demand. In the long term, both countries stand to benefit, riding on improved relations that have created scope for further growth in business, investments, and trade in the fields of energy, mining, agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, among many other strategic sectors,\u201d China Zimbabwe Exchange Centre CEO, Mr Steve Ke Zhao said.",
