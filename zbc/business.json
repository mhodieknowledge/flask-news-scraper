It is coming at a time when rains have also added a positive impetus to the growth forecast. What remains to be seen is how the authorities will walk the tone in setting the pace for growth, including coming up with a cocktail of measures to consolidate growth, taking into account measures or policies being instituted to foster growth,\u201d Professor Makochekanwa said.",

We must ensure that what we agree today, not only on what was captured in written agreements but most importantly that it is implemented on the ground, failure to do so would render our deliberations unproductive and hollow. The agenda before us serves as a guide for our discussions. However it should not constrain us to these matters alone, let us remain open to discussing any other issues of mutual interest as our partnership continues to evolve,\u201d he said.\nBelarus highlighted the importance of the JPCC in further enhancing investments in Zimbabwe.\n\u201cA little over a year ago, the first session of the Joint Permanent Commission on Cooperation between the Republic of Belarus and the Republic of Zimbabwe was held here at the Rainbow Towers Conference Centre, it is very symbolic that our meeting takes place on the eve of the 45th anniversary of the Independence of Zimbabwe and the 80th anniversary of the victory over fascism in the Second World War,\u201d Head of the Department of Africa and the Middle East, Mr Yuri Nikolaychik said.",
