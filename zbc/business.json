            "content": "Story by Stanley James, Business Editor\nTHE African Association of Automotive Manufacturers has expressed interest in reviving Zimbabwe\u2019s motor industry through raising funds and joint ventures with local firms.\nDuring a meeting with government officials and the private sector this Wednesday, the delegation noted that despite challenges which led to low capacity, Zimbabwe\u2019s motor industry has the potential to recover.\n\u201cRemember our goal is to harmonise resources for the growth of the car value chains across the nation and it is our firm belief that the current developments will further enable us to focus on long term gains while creating a platform to unlock value while facilitating growth and recovery so our recommendations after this visit will help authorities to further come up with tangible plans to facilitate growth,\u201d African Association of Automotive Manufacturers chief executive officer, Mr Dave Coffey.\nThe local car manufacturing industry is also expecting to learn from the delegation.\n\u201cThe delegation will have an opportunity to visit different companies in the car manufacturing chains, a development we believe shall open opportunities for the sharing of ideas while unlocking value for the investors off course there have been challenges but hope has not been lost in as much as facilitating the growth of the sector is concerned, \u201d said Motor Industry Association of Zimbabwe president, Mr Lawrence Nyamushanya.",

            "content": "Story by Oleen Ndori, Foreign Desk Editor\nZIMBABWE and Japan are hoping to use the Expo2025 Osaka to increase trade and investment opportunities for both countries.\nFebruary 23 was the 65th birthday of Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and to belatedly mark the day, the Japanese Embassy in Harare held its celebrations this Wednesday.\nJapanese Ambassador to Zimbabwe, His Excellency Shinichi Yamanaka says that 45 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the two countries\u2019 cooperation has seen growth in areas such as agriculture, road rehabilitation, health and the economy.\nHe said the upcoming Expo 2025 Osaka, along with the 9th Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9) will further grow these ties.\n\u201cThe Osaka-Kansai Expo is scheduled to take place for six months from April 13 to October 13 in Osaka, Japan. Zimbabwe will have a dedicated pavilion at the EXPO with a special focus on July 16, which has been designated as Zimbabwe\u2019s National Day. Various events and activities are scheduled to be held. In addition, Japan will also host the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) 9 in August in Yokohama, Japan. I am also confident that the assistance in the areas of education, health, gender and mine clearance through international organisations and NGOs has brought great relief to the people at the grass-roots level.\n\u201cWe are also witnessing the strengthening of economic ties between our two nations. Last November, the Government of Japan decided to support sesame seed production in Zimbabwe. Sesame is important for Japanese food and the export of sesame from Zimbabwe to Japan started recently. Another positive development was the resumption of petalite export after two years. Petalite is essential to produce traditional earthenware pot in Japan. Coffee exports to Japan also resumed after 20 years. Given these developments, it is evident that business activities between Japan and Zimbabwe are expanding gradually and steadily,\u201d he said.",

Of course, there are some challenges here and there, but what is needed is the will to oversee the set targets become a reality for the benefit of the nation.\u201d",
