The conference will focus on consolidating economic ties with the Western Asian nation.\nZimbabwe\u2019s participation at the conference in Tehran is a show of confidence by the government in further expanding business ties with Iran.\nZimbabwe\u2019s top envoy to the Islamic Republic of Iran Ambassador Bright Kupemba speaks on the importance of the conference which will also be attended by Vice President General Retired Dr Constantino Chiwenga.\n\u201cThe focus is mainly on investment, trade, development and exchange of knowledge, it will allow\u00a0 Iran and African business people to exchange notes on business, markets and general global economic trends, and it will give an opportunity for our businesses, to interact with the Iran business community across all the key sectors,\u201d Ambassador Kupemba said.\n\u201cThe major areas of focus this year are the agriculture, mining and health sectors. It is a platform where African economies are going to learn from Iran, an economy that has been under sanctions for the past 45 years but managed to prevail. This is the experience that Zimbabwe would further like to learn during the conference, it will also give Zimbabwe an opportunity to interact with other African business people and get to understand what is also happening in other African economies.\n\u201cThis conference and expo will showcase Iran\u2019s achievements in health, agriculture and other key sectors. We have benefitted from the previous Iran- Africa conference, our main areas of interest are in the health delivery systems, particularly cancer treatment,\u00a0Iran is quite advanced and some companies are willing to do joint ventures with Zimbabwe,\u201d he added.\nThe Ambassador explained the impact of Memorandums of Understanding signed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.\n\u201cWe have 17 signed Memorandums of Understanding. What has happened is that we cannot expedite all of them at the same time, we have made some successes in the health sectors, we are working with the pharmaceuticals in that sector, and there are joint projects between Natpharm and Iranian companies in the distribution and manufacturing of selected drugs, in the health sector, I think we are making quite significant progress,\u00a0 then we also have MOU\u2019s in Science and Technology, progress is being made in space technology. We have some quite commendable projects in the agriculture sector, in terms of the manufacturing of agricultural equipment between an Iranian company and the Government of Zimbabwe.",
