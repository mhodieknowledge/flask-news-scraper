Suffice to say despite the low commodity prices, we didn\u2019t have any major shutdown of mines\u2026 That in itself shows the major resilience of the Zimbabwean mining space. We managed to maintain our production capacity. So what it means is when the prices start going up, Zimbabwe will reap the benefits of the increase in prices,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Story by Bruce Chahwanda\nAll is set for the 2025 Fruit Logistica in Berlin, Germany, with Zimbabwean companies expecting to expand their market share for horticultural produce.\nThe premier horticultural exhibition kicks off this Wednesday.\nZimbabwe\u2019s Ambassador to Germany, Her Excellency Alice Mashingaidze believes such platforms are critical towards unlocking business potential for a global market.\nShe said, \u201cEvents like Fruit Logistica are essential to Zimbabwe\u2019s broader trade strategy. It will allow us to directly connect with global markets and engage with industry leaders. More than just a fair, Fruit Logistica is also about positioning Zimbabwe as a strategic player in the global supply chain. Such events allow us to tell our story, meet with potential partners and discuss new opportunities. By attending, we are demonstrating that Zimbabwe is open for business, eager to engage in international partnerships and ready to contribute to global trade.\u201d\nAmbassador Mashingaidze commended ZimTrade for facilitating the presence of local firms, saying a lot of business is being generated through direct engagement with buyers and suppliers of cutting-edge technology in the sector.\n\u201cGermany and the wider European market present immense opportunities for Zimbabwe. As Europe\u2019s largest economy, Germany is a key trade partner, and there is a growing recognition of Zimbabwe\u2019s potential. We believe that by our participation here at Fruit Logistica, we can position Zimbabwe as a reliable supplier of high-quality produce. This is not just about increasing exports, but also about attracting sustainable investment and technology transfer.\n\u201cThe immediate goal is to establish meaningful business connections that will lead to concrete deals. I hope that the Zimbabwe pavilion attracts the attention of potential buyers and, that the B2B meetings result in partnerships that will bring tangible benefits to both sides. In the longer term, we aim to see increased exports, better market access for Zimbabwean products, and the establishment of long-term trade relationships with Germany and Europe. Furthermore, this is an opportunity to build the Zimbabwean brand on the international stage, and I am confident it will pay dividends,\u201d said the Ambassador.\nZimTrade has facilitated the participation of 30 Zimbabwean companies, with some exhibiting their produce while others are following up on previous engagements to concretise partnerships.\nIn 2024, companies generated business worth US$17 million and this year, Zimbabwean firms are targeting to go beyond US$20 million when the exhibition comes to an end this Friday.",
