China\u2019s journey shows that each nation must define its own path, rooted in its culture, history, and aspirations.\u201d\nAt both forums, Ambassador Ding underscored China\u2019s pivotal role in transforming Zimbabwe\u2019s economic landscape through large-scale investments across infrastructure, energy, and industry.\nHe cited landmark projects such as the Dinson Steel Plant, Titan New Energy Complex, and Parm River Energy and Metallurgical Economic Zone as proof of development that empowers communities while advancing industrial capacity.\n\u201cThese are not just industrial investments; they are lifelines of opportunity, creating jobs, transferring skills, and uplifting lives,\u201d the Ambassador remarked.",

For example, we are importing packaging to the tune of US$300 million which is needless so we really need to spearhead that and there are opportunities in that sector,\u201d CZI Chief Executive Officer, Sakai Kuvarika said.\n\u201cOur portion of manufactured exports is very low at 5 % hence we need to increase the level of innovation so as to achieve that,\u201d ZITF Chairman, Mr Busisa Moyo said.\n\u201cInnovation needs to be tradition-based and Zimbabwe requires to create its own systems that can be used to rally its own industrialisation agenda,\u201d JICA, Senior Advisor, Dr Gaku Funabashi said.",
