            "content": "Story by Tamuka Charakupa\nKARIBA \u2013 THE government- led women empowerment initiatives are bearing fruit with women venturing into key sectors, including manufacturing, construction and tourism industries.\nIn Kariba, a town famed for its picturesque lakefront and vibrant tourism appeal, women are breaking through traditional barriers and emerging as notable figures in the small and medium enterprise (SME) space.\nOne such trailblazer is Mrs Chikomborero Jaiwa, a local entrepreneur who has established herself within the competitive tourism industry.\n\u201cWhen I started a few years ago, many people looked at me and thought I would not survive. Tourism here has long been dominated by large corporations, mostly white-owned. As a black woman and a former teacher, I am redefining the odds, I have now secured my stake in this sector despite widespread scepticism.\u201d\nHer story resonates with that of Mrs Mationesa Kazangarare, who runs a medium-scale water bottling plant, capitalising on Kariba\u2019s climate and natural resources.\n\u201cKariba experiences high temperatures throughout the year. I realised we were consuming bottled water transported all the way from Manicaland,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSo I identified the gap and established this plant. I wanted to prove that you don\u2019t have to be based in a major city to operate a professional business. Kariba\u2019s water is clean and abundant, why should we not bottle it here, create employment here, and uplift our community?\u201d\nThe government has commended such entrepreneurial efforts, viewing them as critical to local development and national economic empowerment goals.\nThe Minister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa recently visited Kariba and praised the thriving women-led businesses.\n\u201cI have been touring SMEs in Kariba and I am proud to witness women-led enterprises flourishing. My Ministry remains committed to facilitating a conducive business environment, affordable loan access through Smedco, and technical training. We are now in the digital era, let us leverage ICT and social media platforms for marketing to expand beyond Kariba.\u201d",

Women do not always need significant capital to start businesses. Homemakers can use their natural hospitality to build thriving ventures,\u201d a participant said.\nOthers emphasised the empowerment potential of addressing market gaps, particularly in sectors such as agriculture and accommodation.\n\u201cThere are many opportunities, but a persistent shortage of suitable accommodation. Empowering women in these sectors is essential for self-reliance, economic growth, and financial inclusion,\u201d a lady said.\n\u201cThis seminar allows me to network within the farming industry. Agriculture is broad it involves inputs, outputs, logistics, and marketing. Events like these help us connect and scale up,\u201d \u201danother woman participant said.\nMs Thubelihle Ndlovu, Managing Director of Purse on Point, the organisation behind the initiative, underscored the value of collective learning and strategic partnerships in promoting financial literacy among women.",
