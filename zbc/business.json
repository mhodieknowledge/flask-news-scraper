There are already some expansion projects of this private sector investment, one of which was recently officiated by his Excellency President Mnangagwa last month.  I am confident that the Indian business sector will be an important contributor in restructuring of Zimbabwe\u2019s economy. Zimbabwe has been India\u2019s valued partner in issues of mutual concern at various international fora, including the United Nations. Our two countries have been strong supporters of the South-South cooperation framework.
