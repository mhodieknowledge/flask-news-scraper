            "content": "Story by Mhlomuli Ncube\nTHE Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development has unearthed potential criminal underhand dealings at the Bubi Small Scale Miners Association Milling Plant in Matabeleland North.\nThe Bubi Gold Milling Plant was set up as a joint venture between the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) and local miners in the area.\nThe ZMDC holds 60 % while 40 % equity was given to the local community.\nThe government then injected US$3 million into the project in the form of a loan which has since been paid off.\nMilling started in 2018 and the miners say to date they have produced 17 kilogrammes of the yellow metal.\nWhen the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development visited the area this Friday, questions arose on how the venture managed to pay off the loan after only delivering 17 kilogrammes of gold to Fidelity Gold Refinery.\nThe community raised a cocktail of challenges at the venture.\n\u201cAs miners we were not served well at this buying centre, nothing good came out of here. As you can see for yourselves how vandalised this place is, we did not get anything as beneficiaries. As a community, we were expecting that this project would benefit our district but as you can see for yourselves it did before it was born, even if you ask them when they last spoke to us as ZMDC they did not even know,\u201d local miners said.\nThe miners at the venture have lamented the alleged lack of accountability and transparency at the venture.\nAmong some of the allegations raised is the purchase of three tractors and a lorry to ferry ore, with only one tractor having been delivered, despite being fully paid for.\nIt also emerged that seven compressors were fully paid for and only three were delivered and a weighbridge was bought and fully paid for, but only parts of it were delivered.\n\u201cActually it was two tractors but Dulys only managed to supply one, there were legal issues which are being handled by the ZMDC legal department. There is also another company which was supposed to supply a truck and it did not happen, it is also being handled by the legal department,\u201d Milling Plant Manager, Mr Gezana Sithole said.",
