            "content": "Story by Zanele Ndlovu\nBULAWAYO \u2013 STANBIC Bank Zimbabwe has stepped in to support the country\u2019s mental health sector by donating a high-capacity autoclave machine to Ingutsheni Central Hospital in Bulawayo, a move set to strengthen infection control and medical safety at the institution.\nThe modern sterilisation unit, the autoclave, unveiled during a commissioning ceremony attended by senior health officials and Stanbic Bank executives, is expected to improve hygiene and operational efficiency in the hospital\u2019s daily procedures.\nBeing a referral point for mental health patients across the country, Ingutsheni Hospital is Zimbabwe\u2019s oldest psychiatric institution and continues to play a critical role in mental healthcare.\nHowever, it faces significant challenges, including ageing infrastructure and deteriorating facilities, which affect service delivery and patient care.\nSpeaking at the handover ceremony, the hospital\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Dr Nemache Mawere said the autoclave will go a long way in reducing the risk of infection among patients and healthcare workers.\n\u201cIngutsheni Hospital has always resembled a large rural hospital, with minimal infrastructure development to reflect that it is a modern facility. The arrival of this autoclave machine, along with the soon-to-be-opened CSSD department, marks a major milestone in shifting us away from that perception. We intend to open a gentle care unit, and for that, we need sterilised instruments. This facility was desperately needed,\u201d Dr Mawere said.\nStanbic Bank Chairperson, Ms Mucha Mukangwani said the donation forms part of the bank\u2019s commitment to national development and public health.\n\u201cWe are here to officially hand over this autoclave machine to Ingutsheni Hospital, an institution that has served Zimbabwe with dedication since 1908. The autoclave will significantly enhance infection and germ control through effective sterilisation. We are proud to support the largest psychiatric hospital in Zimbabwe, with over 700 beds, located in the City of Kings and Queens, Bulawayo.\n\u201cThis donation aligns with our commitment to supporting national development priorities and complements the Government\u2019s efforts to improve access to quality healthcare. Similar initiatives have benefited Parirenyatwa, Sally Mugabe, and Victoria Chitepo hospitals, at a combined cost of US$80,000,\u201d said Ms Mukangwani.",

I am into rabbit breeding, and there is a huge market because people view it as a delicacy. The business is doing quite well,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI am one black person who is providing a rare breed of flowers to the market, and as a young person, I am excited about that. I am looking forward to starting exporting soon because my hectarage has increased,\u201d Chido Makanha said.\nSander Jamba, who works with nine others in peas production, is already making a mark on the export market.\n\u201cWe are a group of ten young people who ventured into pea farming. We started off providing the local market, but failed to survive because of competition. That is when we were helped to start export-oriented production. Now we have a market in Europe and we are exporting our peas and making more money,\u201d Jamba said.\nPeter Kanodeweta, who got funding from the Youth Bank to start his apiary project, is grateful for the opportunities being provided to young people.\n\u201cFor starters, my apiary project, I got money from the youth bank and was able to buy what I needed to start the project. I started with 30 hives and now I have 60, hoping to be at 100 by the end of the year. The Second Republic has really created a conducive environment for young people to venture into business,\u201d he said.\nThe launch of the second phase of the Youth Employment and Entrepreneurship Project stands to bring sustainability to already existing enterprises, while also giving a new lifeline to new businesses with development partners and the government vowing to continue collaborating for the benefit of youths.",
