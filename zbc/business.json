            "content": "Story by Tichaona Kurewa\nTHE 38th Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) meeting of the Council of Bureaux of the Regional Third Party Motor Vehicle Insurance kicked off in Victoria Falls this Wednesday, amid revelations a phenomenal increase of 33 percent in yellow cards issuance was recorded last year compared to 2023.\nCOMESA Yellow Card Council of Bureau Chairperson, Mr Kusikwenyu told journalists on the sidelines of the COMESA meeting of the Council of Bureaux of the Regional Third Party Motor Vehicle Insurance that his organisation issued more than 600 000 yellow cards in 2024, as opposed to about 450 000 the previous year.\nOf these cards, over 70 000 were issued to vehicles exiting Zimbabwe.\nHe attributed the growth to ongoing efforts to raise awareness in member states on the benefits of the yellow card.\n\u201cThat growth has been because of the efforts of the council to grow the yellow card through conscientising the motorists on the benefits of the yellow card. Remember, the yellow card is a trade facilitation instrument, and it allows drivers that cross borders to be able to get compensation quickly if they\u2019re involved in accidents outside the country,\u201d he said.\nZimbabwe\u2019s Insurance and Pensions Commission\u2019s Ms Sibongile Siwela director noted the significance of the yellow card.",

            "content": "Story by Oleen Ndori, Foreign Desk Editor\nZIMBABWE and Japan are hoping to use the Expo2025 Osaka to increase trade and investment opportunities for both countries.\nFebruary 23 was the 65th birthday of Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and to belatedly mark the day, the Japanese Embassy in Harare held its celebrations this Wednesday.\nJapanese Ambassador to Zimbabwe, His Excellency Shinichi Yamanaka says that 45 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the two countries\u2019 cooperation has seen growth in areas such as agriculture, road rehabilitation, health and the economy.\nHe said the upcoming Expo 2025 Osaka, along with the 9th Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9) will further grow these ties.\n\u201cThe Osaka-Kansai Expo is scheduled to take place for six months from April 13 to October 13 in Osaka, Japan. Zimbabwe will have a dedicated pavilion at the EXPO with a special focus on July 16, which has been designated as Zimbabwe\u2019s National Day. Various events and activities are scheduled to be held. In addition, Japan will also host the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) 9 in August in Yokohama, Japan. I am also confident that the assistance in the areas of education, health, gender and mine clearance through international organisations and NGOs has brought great relief to the people at the grass-roots level.\n\u201cWe are also witnessing the strengthening of economic ties between our two nations. Last November, the Government of Japan decided to support sesame seed production in Zimbabwe. Sesame is important for Japanese food and the export of sesame from Zimbabwe to Japan started recently. Another positive development was the resumption of petalite export after two years. Petalite is essential to produce traditional earthenware pot in Japan. Coffee exports to Japan also resumed after 20 years. Given these developments, it is evident that business activities between Japan and Zimbabwe are expanding gradually and steadily,\u201d he said.",
