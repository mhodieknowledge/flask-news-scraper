            "content": "Story by Stanley James\nLOCAL industry has started operationalising a roadmap to reduce imports by increasing domestic production driven by government interventions.\nThe signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Buy Zimbabwe and the Content Creators Association of Zimbabwe set the tone on a commitment by local companies to increase domestic production, promote local goods and create awareness for the country\u2019s brands.\n\u201cThe initiative is towards embracing Zimbabweans in the products they are buying. However, in all areas across the country, we have new products, yet they are not yet known. The thrust is towards ensuring that our partners spread the gospel of Zimbabwean products given the fact that we have had many people who have become entrepreneurs,\u201d Buy Zimbabwe\u2019s Chairperson, Dr Munyaradzi Hwengwere said.\nGovernment interventions in safeguarding local production are also cited as key in consolidating domestic production gains, with content creators also expected to present strategies in marketing locally produced goods.\n\u201cAs content creators, we are excited and ready to work with our members in ensuring that the deal is implemented and will fulfill the intended targets to promote the local brands,\u201d Content Creators Association of Zimbabwe\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Wellington Bakaimani said.\n\u201cBy working with businesses, there are things that we have to follow to maintain our relationships. Today is, therefore, an exciting day to balance an equation where content creators bring these two entities so that we empower\u00a0Zimbabweans by marketing the products and ensuring that products are consumed locally.l\u201d\nThe signing of the MOU is being made as Treasury is projecting the manufacturing sector to grow by over three percent this year, driven by incentives that include Value Added Tax deferment, duty-free importation of certain inputs, tax relief and tax rebates.\nStatistics also show that Zimbabwe is reaping milestones in terms of the promotion of local brands as over 80 percent of goods in the markets are locally produced.\nAn Industrialisation Fund has also been unveiled by the government to resuscitate ailing manufacturing companies.",

Agriculture was affected by climate change due to the drought that we experienced in 2024, and mining was affected by the fluctuation of global prices, and, that resulted in tourism being the number one contributor to the GDP.",

            "content": "Story by Tichaona Kurewa\nCOAL producers have praised government efforts to stabilise the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency and its ongoing engagement and re-engagement drive, measures which they say are key in significantly revitalising the sector.\nThe government has implemented various measures to enhance the ease of doing business, including the introduction of the ZiG currency and a concerted effort to engage and re-engage with the global community.\nA visit to Zambezi Gas Mine by the ZBC News crew revealed increased activity attributed directly to timely government interventions.\n\u201cThe Second Republic has helped us by opening doors, allowing us to enter into markets for equipment. We can now get cheaper and efficient equipment from China and that has enabled us to start finding our feet again. With the Second Republic\u2019s re-engagement drive, we can now talk to our traditional suppliers like BaloWorld and get assistance,\u201d Zambezi Gas\u2019 executive Mr Mathew Rararadza said.\n\u201cOur friends from the East are always receptive when we want facilities with regards to machines, imports and everything, all thanks to the re-engagement drive. It has also opened for Western countries as their companies are starting to come back now and want to do business with us, especially after the lifting of the sanctions on some companies the lifting of the sanctions on some companies,\u201d Coal Producers Association\u2019s Chairperson, Mr Lainos Masimura said.\nThe stability of the ZiG currency has also been highlighted as a critical factor in the sector\u2019s resurgence.\n\u201cOur hope and wish is that the currency continues to grow strength so that we can be able to transact locally in our currency and then work with foreign currency when we are exporting. For us to run on a foreign currency when we are doing local transactions, it always comes with the costs that are also denominated in foreign currency and it becomes difficult to operate,\u201d Mr Masimura stated.\nZimbabwe\u2019s coal production has shown consistent growth. As of December 2023, the country recorded more than 4.9 million tonnes, up from just over 3.9 million tonnes in December 2022.",
