We have a lot of understanding of the processes and how they work, but also, I think the guidance that we will also be able to give will be at the highest level. We want to see efficiency as we move into this new era, the year that we will be running.\n\u201cWe want to ensure that the governance structures of the Yellow Card continue to be strengthened. We also want to see the ability for the communication between countries to be much better. So Zimbabwe has just recently been elected and I think it is a very important position to hold,\u201d he said.\nMr Charles Ndagijima, Past president from Burundi will deputise Mr Mharadze.\nMr Mharadze is a complete insurance professional with experience in both short-term insurance and life assurance industries comprising 21 years in general insurance and two years in the life assurance industry.\nHe has\u00a023 years of professional experience, 14 of which are at senior management level, and will lead the regional board for a year.\nHe worked for AIG Zimbabwe, Zimnat Lion, Optimal Insurance, CBZ Life, and CBZ Insurance.\nCurrently, Mharadze is the General Manager and Principal Officer at CBZ Insurance.",

            "content": "Story by Tichaona Kurewa\nZIMBABWE is fast becoming a hub for investments, with the United States attesting to the country\u2019s economic potential.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the ongoing three-day United States Exchange Alumni Summit in Victoria Falls, American Chamber of Commerce in Zimbabwe, James Oliver attributed the coming in of the new dispensation in the Southern African country as the turning point.\n\u201cI think the current administration has made it much more conducive to do business here. I\u2019ll give you an example, ZIDA has been a wonderful asset for us as we began to get started, helping us navigate the special economic zones, even Vic Falls through the special opportunities that are here. So organisations like ZIDA, have made the investment process much easier. I can tell you the climate has changed to where people are interested here and not just from a mining perspective and some of the traditional businesses.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s sentiments were also echoed by the US Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Her Excellency Pamela Tremont who is prioritising attracting more investment into Harare.\nShe said, \u201cSince I got here, I\u2019ve been focused on improving the investment climate. Everybody I meet says, why are there not more American companies here? Why aren\u2019t people investing in all these opportunities? And so, as soon as I hit the ground, I immediately started wondering that myself. Why is that? And of course, improving the investment climate to attract more, not just U.S. businesses, but businesses from around the world.\u201d\nWith its rich natural resources, improving business climate, and strategic location, Zimbabwe is poised to become a hub for investors.\nOver 200 delegates from more than 10 countries in the Southern African region are attending the US Exchange Alumni Summit.",

Remember, the yellow card is a trade facilitation instrument, and it allows drivers that cross borders to be able to get compensation quickly if they\u2019re involved in accidents outside the country,\u201d he said.\nZimbabwe\u2019s Insurance and Pensions Commission\u2019s Ms Sibongile Siwela director noted the significance of the yellow card.",
