            "content": "Story by Yolanda Moyo\nEconomists are expecting the introduction of the fast food tax to widen Treasury\u2019s revenue inflows and facilitate funding for development projects.\nThe tax, which was effected this month, is levied per-unit basis for various fast-food items and aims to generate revenue for government while discouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods.\nWhile the tax has generated intense debate, economists believe it presents an opportunity to bolster domestic resource mobilisation and address critical national needs.\n\u201cThis tax provides a valuable new revenue stream for the government. These funds can be strategically utilized to address critical national priorities such as infrastructure development, healthcare, and education. This aligns with global trends that have been successful implemented in reducing consumption of fast foods,\u201d said economist, Mr Stevenson Dlamini.\n\u201cThe proceeds from this tax can be used to strengthen primary healthcare, combat non-communicable diseases linked to unhealthy diets, and improve nutrition education programmes. This will not only improve public health outcomes, but also contribute to a more productive and healthier workforce. This will be crucial in research and development in the NDC field helping the nation in fight this scourge,\u201d said economist Mr Malorn Gwadu.",

            "content": "Story by Owen Mandovha\nMeasures implemented by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) have cooled off exchange rate volatility, providing stability to the ZiG currency over the past five months.\nAlmost four months after its introduction in April 2024, the ZiG was fast losing value as the yawning gap between the official rate of 13.56 to the greenback and the parallel market rate which was hovering between 40 and 50 to the United States dollar prompted monetary authorities to devalue the ZiG to 23.56.\nThis was followed by the upward review of the statutory reserve requirements among a host of other interventions to quell emerging inflationary pressures and exchange rate volatility.\nThe local currency has remained largely stable in the last quarter of the year 2024 as explained by financial economist Mr Batanai Matsika.\n\u201cThe liquidity management measures introduced by the central through a tight monetary policy stance speaks to the ongoing macroeconomic stability and it is essential to mention the interventions made by the RBZ to contain money supply growth which was a threat to the exchange rate stability. The ensuing liquidity crunch is also explained by this stance due to increased statutory reserve requirements though we can see a local currency that has largely remained stable for some time,\u201d he said.",
