This development of infrastructure is multi-faceted, with the provision of water infrastructure being one of them,\u201d Professor Ncube said.\n\u201cThat is why President Emmerson Mnangagwa launched the Presidential Borehole Drilling Scheme, amongst other programmes. We have noted that Bulawayo has been facing water challenges, and as government, we have moved in with a three-pronged approach to ensure the challenge is addressed.\n\u201cWe all know that the government is constructing the Gwayi Shangani Dam as a long-term measure to this challenge. We are currently going through the contractual details of the Glass Block Dam which is expected to be the mid-term solution to the challenge we are facing, and soon, once we finish on the details construction is set to begin.\u201d",

            "content": "Story by Stanley James, Business Editor\nZIMBABWE\u2019s dairy sector has started the year on a strong note after recording a 3% rise in milk output to over 9,7 million litres in January.\nAccording to the latest official data released by the Zimbabwe Association of Dairy Farmers this Monday, milk output for the month under review was pegged at 9,7 million litres, compared to 9,5 million litres the same month last year.\nWith the focus on achieving a target of above 120 million litres in 2025 from 114 million litres the previous year against a national requirement of 130 million litres, the dairy sector is confident of a continuous growth trajectory.\n\u201cThe target for this year is over 120 million litres, this is definitely achievable taking into account the persistent growth in output that has seen us being on an towards trajectory. Going forward the sector is looking at what can be done to sustain current gains including the need to capacitate the farmers leading to continuous growth which is an element that will further set the tone towards self-sufficiency for Zimbabwe,\u201d Zimbabwe Dairy Industry Trust chairperson, Mr Themba Mutsvairo said.\nWith dairy related imports falling due to growth in the availability of locally manufactured products on domestic shelves, Zimbabwe is also expected to benefit from a favourable balance of payments position.\n\u201cSince 2018 there has been largely an improved availability of locally produced dairy commodities, this is something that is reflecting the resilience of the dairy sector, the trend has also resulted in reduced dairy imports, a further testimony that the nation is on track to eventually reach a point where the commodity will not be imported, so going forward it is up to the relevant authorities to focus on tangible systems to consolidate current gains,\u201d Buy Zimbabwe General Manager, Mr Alois Burutsa.",
