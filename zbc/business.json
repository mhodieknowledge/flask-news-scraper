            "content": "Story by Gay Matambo\nTHE government remains committed to supporting the ethanol production sector as part of initiatives aimed at ensuring it delivers positive results.\nThis was highlighted during the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Energy and Power\u2019s visit to the Triangle Ethanol plant this Saturday, where it engaged with an ethanol producing firm, Tongaat Hulett Zimbabwe (THZ).\nPortfolio Committee, is touring several electricity generating players across the country.\nThe importance of ethanol blending, which includes reducing pollution by emission, was brought to the fore during the engagement with the producers being challenged to remain compliant with national regulations.\n\u201cWe have an ethanol plant and that ethanol plant has a name plate capacity of 40 million litres running in close to 48 weeks in a year. The ethanol plant was commissioned in 1980 by the former late President of the Republic of Zimbabwe and it is still operational, in very sound condition,\u201d Tongaat Hulett Zimbabwe Chief Executive Officer, Mr Tendai Masawi said.\n\u201cI want to applaud Tongaat Hulett Zimbabwe for adhering to issues of safety, environment, and quality. Tongaat Hulett Zimbabwe is doing a good job in that regard. Ethanol blending is a substitute to alleviate issues of foreign currency shortages, and it dovetails with the National Climate Policy of 2017, which looks at mandatory blending as a way of curbing greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d ZERA Representative, Mr Herbert Mataruka said.\nThe Parliamentary Portfolio Committee\u2019s visit underscores government\u2019s commitment to supporting the ethanol production industry, which aligns with the Bio Fuels policy of 2019.",

            "content": "\nStory by Patience Nyagato\nTHE importance of investment knowledge came under the spotlight at the launch of a book titled \u2018A cookie that did not crumble,\u2019 in Harare this Saturday.\nAlfonce Maketo authored the book which celebrates the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) Market, bringing to light its resilience even at a time when the economy was ailing due to the economic sanctions imposed on the country by the West, among other factors.\n\u201cThe cookie that did Not Crumble is a book that was written out of the realisation that we have some positive aspects that are coming out of our country,\u201d Maketo said.\n\u201cWe are always hearing about the negative things but there are also some positive aspects that are coming and one of those positives is the resilience that is mainly shown by Zimbabweans in all walks of life. In this case, in this book, we are talking of the resilience of the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, at a time when everyone expected the stock market to crumble, when everyone was crushing it, saying it was a scam, that it does not pay, does not give returns to investors, the ZSE, through measures that have been put by the government, that have been put by the ZSE management, and also some stakeholders who are involved in that space has remained resilient.\n\u201cUp to today, for the past decade or so, it has been under a lot of pressure, but it has managed to stack its head above the waters, hence its resilience. It is just a great story of resilience, how that institution managed to stay afloat when companies were delisting when companies were closing, when companies were migrating from the ZSE to the VFX, there were measures that were put in place by various stakeholders to ensure that our stock market still stands proudly in the world, against its peers,\u201d Maketo said.\nThe Zimbabwe Stock Exchange is one of the viable investment markets open for Zimbabweans.\n\u201cUnderstanding the ZSE is a matter of education, other African countries including Tunisia and Morocco are doing well in such markets people because people understand. People want fast money where they lose all money but the chances of losing an investment in the stock exchange is low,\u201d ZSE Chief Executive Officer, Mr Justin Bgoni said.\nSecretary for Presidential Affairs and Devolution in the Office of the President and Cabinet, Engineer Tafadzwa Muguti who was guest of honour at the event highlighted the need for a culture shift from toxic politics to economic progress.",
