Business-wise, we have so many business owners of Zimbabwean origin who are domiciled here and this offers them more convenience. The development offers opportunities to further enhance trade ties between Zimbabwe and Zambia. We are pursuing economic diplomacy and this flight will give an impetus to that goal,\u201d she said.\nZimbabwe\u2019s Deputy Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development, Honourable Joshua Sacco says the government is reaping the fruits of upgrading its airport infrastructure as regional connectivity increases.\n\u201cWe are excited as a country to note that many airlines are now expanding routes because we now have world-class airport infrastructure, which rivals any other hence we see opportunities to grow trade between the two countries.\u201d",
