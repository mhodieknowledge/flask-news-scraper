Looking at the de-dollarisation roadmap, the main important thing is that the 2030 deadline to dissolve multi-currency is what we are working with, whereby we will have zero transactions in foreign currency.\n\u201cWe are supporting the productive sector through the targeted finance facility however, there has been calls to also support the retail sector upon learning of challenges affecting them. Coming to the bank policy rate, we are calculating the month-on-month inflation but waiting to calculate the year-on-year inflation until May,\u201d",

We have a lot of understanding of the processes and how they work, but also, I think the guidance that we will also be able to give will be at the highest level. We want to see efficiency as we move into this new era, the year that we will be running.\n\u201cWe want to ensure that the governance structures of the Yellow Card continue to be strengthened. We also want to see the ability for the communication between countries to be much better.

I\u2019ll give you an example, ZIDA has been a wonderful asset for us as we began to get started, helping us navigate the special economic zones, even Vic Falls through the special opportunities that are here. So organisations like ZIDA, have made the investment process much easier. I can tell you the climate has changed to where people are interested here and not just from a mining perspective and some of the traditional businesses.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s sentiments were also echoed by the US Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Her Excellency Pamela Tremont who is prioritising attracting more investment into Harare.\nShe said, \u201cSince I got here, I\u2019ve been focused on improving the investment climate. Everybody I meet says, why are there not more American companies here? Why aren\u2019t people investing in all these opportunities? And so, as soon as I hit the ground, I immediately started wondering that myself. Why is that? And of course, improving the investment climate to attract more, not just U.S. businesses, but businesses from around the world.\u201d\nWith its rich natural resources, improving business climate, and strategic location, Zimbabwe is poised to become a hub for investors.\nOver 200 delegates from more than 10 countries in the Southern African region are attending the US Exchange Alumni Summit.",
