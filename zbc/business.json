            "content": "Story by Stanley James, Business Editor\nZIMBABWE\u2019s Electronic Government Procurement System has gained strong support from women entrepreneurs, who have praised its transparency and the efficiency it brings to the procurement process.\nThe Women in Procurement Meeting, held on Tuesday, provided a platform to assess the impact of the system, which was launched nearly a year ago.\nWomen entrepreneurs expressed confidence that the system will enhance their participation in government, local authority, and public utility projects, opening new opportunities for their businesses.\n\u201cTransparency and accountability are the key hallmarks of ethical business activities in any economy, Government by introducing the latest digitalised system needs to be commended because it creates a fair playing field in the market, stamps out corruption and boosts the value for money principles.\n\u201cGoing forward, as women entrepreneurs we need to up our skills in terms of quality goods and services that are on offer to the government or public utilities, by so doing we will be in a position to compete and realise our potential by being awarded the contracts,\u201d Manna Resorts Executive Director, Mrs Joy Mataruka said.\n\u201cThe key challenge is on the capacity building, while there are more women out there who want to supply the government with goods and services, it is, however, access to modern gadgets under the latest procurement methods that becomes a challenge. If women are capacitated across the country in terms of understanding how it works, operational modalities, and awareness of the digitalised methods, then we are likely to see increased participation otherwise the whole concept is noble as it broadens the scope of businesses to everyone across the country,\u201d Karoi Town Council procurement manager, Ms Vena Manyere said.\n\u201cThis meeting has been an eye opener by enabling us to see what we can do as women in broadening our share of supplies to the government in a male-dominated procurement system.\u00a0We take solace from the fact that the modernised system has all that it takes to embrace our operations thereby enabling more women to be the key players in the procurement activities,\u201d Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe Chief Executive Officer, Mr Clever Ruswa said.\nMr Ruswa revealed a rise in female participation following the launch of the Electronic Government Procurement System.\n\u201cThe whole issue relates to what can be done to modernise the public procurement systems and ensure value for money,\u201d he said.",
