            "content": "Story by Oleen Ndori, Foreign Desk Editor\nTHE government is undertaking consultative processes for the formulation of the National Development Strategy Two (2026-2030), which is expected to give further impetus to Zimbabwe\u2019s journey towards attaining an upper-middle-income society by 2030.\nWith the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), which spans from 2021 to 2025, drawing to a close this year, preparations are already underway to shape the second phase of Zimbabwe\u2019s economic transformation blueprint.\nPresenting the ten thematic areas that will guide NDS2 during a stakeholder engagement in Harare this Wednesday, the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion, Professor Mthuli Ncube, said the strategy would consolidate the progress made under NDS1 and sharpen focus on national priorities.\n\u201cThe National Development Strategy 2 will serve as the second five-year medium-term economic plan under the Second Republic, aimed at achieving Vision 2030. Following Cabinet\u2019s approval of the NDS2 roadmap on September 17, 2024, the government has appointed chairpersons and co-chairpersons for each of the ten thematic working groups. These groups will consult widely across their domains to determine appropriate strategies and interventions aligned to national priorities,\u201d Professor Ncube said.\nHe added that the consultations will adopt a participatory approach to promote inclusivity and national ownership of the strategy.\nChief Secretary to the President and Cabinet, Dr Martin Rushwaya, reinforced the government\u2019s commitment to transparency and inclusiveness in the formulation process.\n\u201cThe successful implementation of NDS2 requires transformative leadership, alignment of goals across sectors, and collaboration from all stakeholders. President Emmerson Mnangagwa has directed that the consultative process be inclusive and comprehensive, capturing a wide range of voices from across the country, ensuring that no one and no place is left behind,\u201d he said.\nHe further noted that NDS2 would establish a robust framework for aligning planning, budgeting, and execution of public investments.\nThe strategy will also define minimum service standards at all levels and adopt integrated results-based management principles.\nSpecific performance indicators will be used to measure progress and ensure the delivery of tangible development outcomes.\nStakeholders from the private sector, civil society, academia, and religious institutions attended the launch and welcomed government\u2019s inclusive approach to policy formulation.\n\u201cAs stakeholders in the transport sector, we are pleased that our concerns will be addressed. It is encouraging that the government is engaging all sectors,\u201d one participant said.",

They have been unstable for a while since they went into business rescue in September 2022, which delayed capital programmes. We believe that is our first order of business. We think there is an opportunity to grow the business in terms of yields and area under cane, as well as innovate. We are also looking at possibilities to produce other by-products, such as carbon dioxide for the industry,\u201d he said.\nThe coming on board of these investors is expected to drive strategic diversification while stabilising the company\u2019s operations.\n\u201cThe Vision Group is African-owned. They have a vision to create an African agri-processing giant. They are committed long-term, with proven track records in African businesses. We are committed to transparency, open engagement, and generating strong financial returns for investors,\u201d Chief Executive Officer for Vision Sugar, Mr Gavin Dalgeish said.\n\u201cWhat is key right now is moving away from BRPs. With a new investor on board, we are liberated from negotiating with banks for credit lines. We can negotiate better terms with suppliers, rather than relying on cash-up-front deals that strain our cash flow due to lack of trust. Having a strong parent company allows us to focus on running operations effectively,\u201d Tongaat Hulett Zimbabwe\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Tendai Masawi noted.\nSugarcane outgrowers believe the sugar industry can return to profitability with proper management and transparency amongst key players in the sector.",
