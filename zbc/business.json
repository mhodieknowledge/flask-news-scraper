            "content": "Story by ZBC Reporter\nCHINA has reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to Zimbabwe\u2019s industrialisation and sustainable development agenda.\nThis came out through a double engagement by the Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Ambassador Zhou Ding, who delivered keynote addresses at both the International Business Conference during the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) and the inaugural Research for Sustainable Industrialisation and Economic Development Indaba.\nSpeaking at the ZITF International Business Conference, Ambassador Zhou stressed the urgent need for multilateralism and win-win cooperation amid rising global protectionism.\n\u201cZimbabwe and China share the conviction that true industrialisation must be inclusive, innovative, and people-centered,\u201d he said.\nAt the Research Indaba, Ambassador Ding shared insights into China\u2019s rapid development trajectory, reflecting on how China transitioned from kerosene lamps to solar grids, and from rural poverty to global leadership in 5G and AI.\n\u201cThere is no one-size-fits-all model. China\u2019s journey shows that each nation must define its own path, rooted in its culture, history, and aspirations.\u201d\nAt both forums, Ambassador Ding underscored China\u2019s pivotal role in transforming Zimbabwe\u2019s economic landscape through large-scale investments across infrastructure, energy, and industry.\nHe cited landmark projects such as the Dinson Steel Plant, Titan New Energy Complex, and Parm River Energy and Metallurgical Economic Zone as proof of development that empowers communities while advancing industrial capacity.\n\u201cThese are not just industrial investments; they are lifelines of opportunity, creating jobs, transferring skills, and uplifting lives,\u201d the Ambassador remarked.",

For example, we are importing packaging to the tune of US$300 million which is needless so we really need to spearhead that and there are opportunities in that sector,\u201d CZI Chief Executive Officer, Sakai Kuvarika said.\n\u201cOur portion of manufactured exports is very low at 5 % hence we need to increase the level of innovation so as to achieve that,\u201d ZITF Chairman, Mr Busisa Moyo said.\n\u201cInnovation needs to be tradition-based and Zimbabwe requires to create its own systems that can be used to rally its own industrialisation agenda,\u201d JICA, Senior Advisor, Dr Gaku Funabashi said.",
