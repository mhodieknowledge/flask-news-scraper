The first element that we had to devise included the need to invest in machinery so as to unlock value to put shareholders. This actually paid off. In fact, the industry is ready for next year riding on lessons that we learned this year.\u201d\nEmployers Confederation of Zimbabwe president, Mr Demos Mbauya says the country\u2019s manufacturing sector also defied market expectations by maintaining production levels as the availability of locally produced goods improved.\n\u201cGiven the challenges faced by the economy this year, the country could have been a net importer of goods but you can see for yourselves the vast availability of locally goods is an indication that industry is on the right path to growth trajectory, which is commendable. The year 2025 presents opportunities for us to grow our business portfolios, relook at cost benefits analysis and boost production to the extent that the good rains will further aid to the success of the industry,\u201d he said.",

Already some have benefited through the establishment of this project, however we are looking forward to grow cash crops such as potatoes, paprika and horticultural crops.\u201dSpeaking after touring the project and handing over a stock-feed thresher to Ward 9 Farmers Field School, Chivi District Development Coordinator, Mr Innocent Matingwina concurred with the area legislator, Honourable Godfrey Mukungunugwa that communities including youths must take advantage of empowerment programmes by government for improved livelihoods.\n\u201cAs you are aware, we are in a drought season and the government has been assisting us a lot in ensuring food security. Given that our area is dry, a borehole has been established here and it will not only benefit youths because the community around will be able to get clean and safe water. Again this thresher given to the community will enable you to produce fodder for your livestock hence they will not be affected much by drought,\u201d said Mr Matingwina.",
