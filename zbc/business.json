In specific challenges is the issue of currency volatility up to April then we introduced a new currency, the ZIG which then brought in stability. The other challenge has been the drought which has really resulted in growth slowing down to 2 percent, but going forward we see that things will improve.\n\u201cIn terms of triumphs in the region, for example, President being the chairperson of SADC, which has given us additional roles as the finance ministry. We are driving the economic and investment development fund. We are pleased that we successfully introduced the ZIG it was never easy moving from one currency to the other. As government we have continued to support the economy through various programs. The private sector continues to work with the private sector in various sectors such as the energy sector. Looking at the industrial sector there are various investments,\u201d said Professor Ncube.\nShifting to infrastructure development, Professor Ncube says government has adopted a two tier model which is expected to modernise the country.\n\u201cAs government, we adopted a two tier model where we are investing in roads as government including the National Railways of Zimbabwe, but also allowing the private sector to come in on the PPP basis. We continue to support the devolution agenda with development coming from the bottom up leaving no one behind,\u201d he said.",

The first element that we had to devise included the need to invest in machinery so as to unlock value to put shareholders. This actually paid off. In fact, the industry is ready for next year riding on lessons that we learned this year.\u201d\nEmployers Confederation of Zimbabwe president, Mr Demos Mbauya says the country\u2019s manufacturing sector also defied market expectations by maintaining production levels as the availability of locally produced goods improved.\n\u201cGiven the challenges faced by the economy this year, the country could have been a net importer of goods but you can see for yourselves the vast availability of locally goods is an indication that industry is on the right path to growth trajectory, which is commendable. The year 2025 presents opportunities for us to grow our business portfolios, relook at cost benefits analysis and boost production to the extent that the good rains will further aid to the success of the industry,\u201d he said.",
