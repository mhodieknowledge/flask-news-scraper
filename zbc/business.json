            "content": "Story Farai Gwaze in South Africa\nThe country\u2019s mining sector continues to show resilience and drive Zimbabwe\u2019s economic growth despite fluctuating commodity prices on the global market.\nSpeaking at the ongoing African Mining Conference in South Africa, the Minister of Mines and Mining Development, Honourable Winston Chitando commended the mining sector\u2019s continued endurance during the global downturn in commodity prices.\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s important to note that in 2023 and especially 2024, we witnessed low commodity prices right across the entire sector of the mining space, except for gold. Suffice to say despite the low commodity prices, we didn\u2019t have any major shutdown of mines\u2026 That in itself shows the major resilience of the Zimbabwean mining space. We managed to maintain our production capacity. So what it means is when the prices start going up, Zimbabwe will reap the benefits of the increase in prices,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Story by Bruce Chahwanda\nAll is set for the 2025 Fruit Logistica in Berlin, Germany, with Zimbabwean companies expecting to expand their market share for horticultural produce.\nThe premier horticultural exhibition kicks off this Wednesday.\nZimbabwe\u2019s Ambassador to Germany, Her Excellency Alice Mashingaidze believes such platforms are critical towards unlocking business potential for a global market.\nShe said, \u201cEvents like Fruit Logistica are essential to Zimbabwe\u2019s broader trade strategy. It will allow us to directly connect with global markets and engage with industry leaders. More than just a fair, Fruit Logistica is also about positioning Zimbabwe as a strategic player in the global supply chain. Such events allow us to tell our story, meet with potential partners and discuss new opportunities. By attending, we are demonstrating that Zimbabwe is open for business, eager to engage in international partnerships and ready to contribute to global trade.\u201d\nAmbassador Mashingaidze commended ZimTrade for facilitating the presence of local firms, saying a lot of business is being generated through direct engagement with buyers and suppliers of cutting-edge technology in the sector.\n\u201cGermany and the wider European market present immense opportunities for Zimbabwe. As Europe\u2019s largest economy, Germany is a key trade partner, and there is a growing recognition of Zimbabwe\u2019s potential. We believe that by our participation here at Fruit Logistica, we can position Zimbabwe as a reliable supplier of high-quality produce. This is not just about increasing exports, but also about attracting sustainable investment and technology transfer.\n\u201cThe immediate goal is to establish meaningful business connections that will lead to concrete deals. I hope that the Zimbabwe pavilion attracts the attention of potential buyers and, that the B2B meetings result in partnerships that will bring tangible benefits to both sides. In the longer term, we aim to see increased exports, better market access for Zimbabwean products, and the establishment of long-term trade relationships with Germany and Europe. Furthermore, this is an opportunity to build the Zimbabwean brand on the international stage, and I am confident it will pay dividends,\u201d said the Ambassador.\nZimTrade has facilitated the participation of 30 Zimbabwean companies, with some exhibiting their produce while others are following up on previous engagements to concretise partnerships.\nIn 2024, companies generated business worth US$17 million and this year, Zimbabwean firms are targeting to go beyond US$20 million when the exhibition comes to an end this Friday.",

We are saying as Africans, we need to go beyond being extractive and selling our minerals. Because the same renewable energies we are talking about need cobalt, they need lithium in storage, they need copper, they need nickel. Those are our key elements which will have been given by God. They are key to unlocking value from Africa if we can get partners who don\u2019t extract raw minerals but add value to our own countries so that we remain and retain that value and build the capacity to fund our projects.\nIn the field of ICT, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of ICT, Postal and Courier Services, Dr Beaullah Chirume noted the need to create a borderless Africa through connectivity.\n\u201cZimbabwe, we are on board, and we are saying within the framework of the African continental free trade area where we hope to achieve or to enhance intra-African trade and economic integration. It is therefore crucial for us to attain or achieve quality connectivity fostering on seamless, borderless, there shouldn\u2019t be any difference between Ghana, Zimbabwe and the other countries, facilitating ease of doing business within our own African context, rather bring in trade efficiency and more collaboration.\u201d",
