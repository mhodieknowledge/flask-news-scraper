            "content": "\nStory by Stanley James, Business Editor\nZIMBABWE is targeting cooking oil self-sufficiency, driven by government interventions in increasing soya beans, sunflower and cotton seed production.\nA tour by government officials at two of Zimbabwe\u2019s largest cooking oil manufacturing firms this Tuesday provided an opportunity for them to assess the state of the sector.\nIt emerged that Zimbabwe is moving towards cooking oil self-sufficiency riding on increased investments aided by the increase in soya bean, sunflower and cotton seed production.\nData released during the tour reveals the availability of locally produced cooking oil has increased from 20 percent in 2018 to over 80 percent last year.\n\u201cThe retail sector shelves ideally have what it takes in terms of telling the ideal picture of the situation. If there are so many cooking oil commodity products on the shelves that are being produced locally, then this reflects that the situation is just normal and there is more that is being done by the local producers to facilitate such growth.\n\u201cLike any other business, there are challenges but we continue to wither the storm with the key focus being on what is needed to boost overall growth off course production is on a high trajectory but we have our constraints and such a platform gives us the ideal opportunity to see what we can do and chart the way forward basically I am convinced this will yield the intended goals,\u201d the acting chief executive officer for Surface Wilmar and Olivine Industries, Mr Sylvester Dendere.",

The problem here is that laws favour the informal sector because big businesses have to comply with a lot of policies that are difficult and distort their pricing framework. So it\u2019s not an economic issue but an issue of how government should reform policies that allow these companies to thrive,\u201d Buy Zimbabwe\u2019s Executive Director Mr Munyaradzi Hwengwere said.\nConfederation of Zimbabwe Retailers\u2019 president, Dr Denford Mutashu concurred adding that there is need to cushion the formal sector.\n\u201cRetailers have to sell in both currencies which does not apply to the informal sector hence manufacturers end up preferring to sell directly to the informal sector who sell in foreign currency so this provides an untenable situation for the formal retailers.\u201d",
