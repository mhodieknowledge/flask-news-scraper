We have ambitious expansion plans in place to further increase our poultry production and diversify our agricultural output,\u201d NUST, farm supervisor, Andile Ndlovu said.\n\u201cThis metal fabrication workshop is actively producing essential infrastructure, including containers specifically designed to accommodate the diverse food crops originating from the agricultural side of our operations. Our vision extends to achieving increased production volumes to serve the wider community, while simultaneously providing our students with invaluable practical insights and hands-on experience in metalworking and fabrication,\u201d NUST, Faculty of Industrial Technology Lecturer, Engineer Albert Mkandla said.\nThe institution is strategically expanding the scope and development of its diverse business projects.\n\u201cWe are currently at a crucial experimental stage, meticulously working towards having the entire value chain fully and efficiently operational.
