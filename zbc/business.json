            "content": "Story by Tamuka Charakupa\nTHE Mashonaland West Investment Conference has ended in Kariba with discussions centering on transforming the resort town into a world-class tourism hub.\nA wave of developments that include upgraded lodges, new luxury resorts, and expanded conference venues is redefining the town\u2019s hospitality landscape.\n\u201cWe are claiming a fair share in the tourism sector as black entrepreneurs. The construction of new conference centres and accommodation facilities will mean increased business in the cruise industry, transport sector, casino, etc. Room occupancy was low because of shortages of conference centres, which generally drive the numbers,\u201d Tourism Stakeholder, Mr Patrick Kuona noted\nThese hospitality upgrades are being complemented by major activities in the transport sector.\nThe Airports Company of Zimbabwe has revealed plans to expand Kariba Airport to accommodate international direct flights, while a local bus operator is partnering with local authorities to construct bus termini.\n\u201cAs the Airports Company of Zimbabwe, we are currently conducting feasibility studies to see if we can expand the airport or relocate it to Charara, where there is space to construct a four-kilometer highway that is required for international plans. Right now, we are averaging about six chartered planes per day, which speaks to the potential of the area. Once that is done, we will then engage the international community for direct flights into Kariba,\u201d Public Relations and Communications Manager, Airports Company of Zimbabwe, Mr Tonderai Mangombe said.\n\u201cWe are working as a company to revamp and modernise our operations through pre-booking so that we eliminate the problem of touts. We have already partnered with Harare City Council, where we constructed a modern bus terminus where our passengers have access to wifi, clean water, and ablution facilities. We want to establish the same in all the major towns where our buses ply,\u201d CAG Spokesperson, Mr Elijah Tembo added.",
