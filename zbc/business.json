We supply right across Africa and we\u2019ve done work in Zambia\u2026 We\u2019ve done work in Uganda, Mozambique Malawi.\n\u201cWith the African free trade opening South Africa is our only competitor.\u00a0 We can\u2019t compete because we can\u2019t produce at their rate. There is a need to improve on foreign currency availability in the market so that as an industry we need that to procure machinery.\u201d\nThe leader of the economic cluster, Cde Elifasi Mashava emphasised the significance of the tour in the context of the government\u2019s broader economic development agenda.\n\u201cThe ruling party, ZANU PF, which I represent at this forum, has deemed it necessary to embark on this crucial tour to assess the prevailing conditions of our industries.

However more considerations need to be made on the timelines that do not distort the current economic trajectory,\u201d said CEO of Africa Roundtable, chairperson Mr Oswell Binha.\nRBZ deputy governor Dr Innocent Matshe reiterated that the Central Bank\u2019s stance to de-dollarise by 2030 is the best route available to achieve economic stardom.\n\u201cThis economy is affected by low liquidity, especially of the United States dollar which we cannot control at all hence we will continue on that path so that we give full control over our monetary policy to dictate the growth of the economy, \u201d he said.",
